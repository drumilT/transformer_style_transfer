i i think it's a great idea but when it comes to me it's like almost an insult you know
i i've come from the teaching field
so so it's just like i don't know i i guess i guess i'd have to go with uh
i i i'd be for it
but uh you know i i i don't know it's just kind of a kind of a delicate subject i guess
but i i i would i would probably go for for going ahead and doing it you know if it's got to be done for everyone
you know when they answer the company i think it'll make it a lot easier and they'd run into less problems
and it sort of uh
i'm more or less if they told me i had to well then fine
but if you know if they made me then i'd probably
if i had my druthers i'd probably say well no
and you know but i guess if they
you know you know there's uh
i guess there's some companies that aren't that are doing it
and it it seems to be working out
i think it's it's what they're basically trying to do i don't know up here in massachusetts anyhow what they're basically trying to do is uh oh gosh uh any people who had di- tested positively getting them into a drug program
and uh anybody who uh gee is you know di- doesn't accept the rehab program then they're more or less getting laid off
i i think that's really hard to because you know you never know i don't know it
you know that that's what's they're coming across as is some of the companies anyhow
oh we can get you into a drug program
but then you wear that stigma you know
where uh like a lot of people are saying well i only smoked a joint last night i don't have any problems
then i kind of hear it goes into like uh
this is just something i've heard that it kind of goes into like uh just your off the counter medication that you could be taking for a cold that it kind of affects that too
anything with an- a
you know if you drink a lot of caffeine or
oh i didn't know that
somebody was saying telling me if you drink it in
you know an awful lot of caffeine that that can show up as a positive test
see things like that
so i'd probably test positive and
and a lot of times those are the things i don't like to disclose to an employer because then they don't want to have anything to do with you
you know it's very personal
i wouldn't want to have it disclosed because then i'd always wonder if they fired me you know why did you fire me
cause it kind of gets into your personal life you know
and wha- what's kind of next
it it hits me as the orwell thing big brother is watching
and you know his book brig big brother is watching
you know you're being controlled
and i sh-
i don't really you know i don't know seems awful strange
but i can understand why they need it with all the you know train accidents and everything else
so do you think they'll kind of push into the teaching field eventually
i think they will too because uh you know it's just going to follow
i don't know i we haven't had any of it in our school system
so uh you know hopefully we won't
but i i i just kind of think it's heading that way though you know it's just
and i just i just kind of think it's going to eventually head that way
well and eventually it's going to be not only the tea-
you know the kids are going to be under scrutiny it's going to be the teachers
and if they can test the teachers that gives them the full right to test the kids
and then they you know caught everybody
uh i haven't been in this situation yet
you know my my parents are not quite at that age yet
so i haven't
so i haven't uh really been in that situation although they are thinking about my grandmother
uh not for my parents
but i i was around uh two sets of grandparents uh quite a bit
we we put one i put one grandfather in a rest home and that killed him
did it really
well there was some other things involved
you know he lost his drivers license
and i couldn't get around and wasn't able to do some things
and so we ended up just having to put him in a rest home
and he just kind of became a vegetable and died
so but that was a long time ago
that was uh back in like seventy-three
so uh i think the way they did things were a lot different back then
and uh my grandmother his his wife uh we also put her in a rest home
and then she was back out because she didn't really need to be there
and they worked with her and got her walking and got her ta- kind of taking care of herself
and so she was able to come back home
and then she had to go back in a couple of times
but mostly it was just because she kind of gave up
and they got her going again
so i guess as far as looking
i said as what you're looking for i think you need to look for an active uh an
somebody who is willing to work with uh you know work with a patients and do do things with them and treat them treat like they're
and i'm sure it's it's expensive
it it is
my my grandmother is not in a nursing home
but she's in a
and she she she really does love that
but she's just concerned about i- in the future you know
that she she knows it's not going to be like that all the time
and she's just wondering well what's going to happen to me
and and i
you know it's i guess it's so normal to start to wonder about that even if she doesn't need that
but you know she's kind of asking questions about what well what's going to happen this can't last forever
is it like a kitchenette type apartment where she can fix her own food if she wants to or she can go down to the cafeteria
but i i think it is also cafeteria style because i i really i i i doubt if she rarely cooks for herself
so uh because i i remember her in her letters telling me she'll go downstairs for coffee or something to eat
so i'm assuming it's something like that too
i i really like that concept
they've they have a few of those well quite a few of those places like that here in utah
and you know couples can
you know husband and wife can can live there too or or whatever
and and then and yet they have their their friendships and relationships and the
i i think it really takes uh you know looking more at the people than even really the facilities
and she lives by herself too
and uh my husband's grandmother is
well she lives she lives in a house on her own
and she doesn't really need the care or anything like that
but she has her own home
and sh- she's doing really well
so we haven't had to do anything
but then again she has a lot of support
so i mean she's got her mother in town too and things like that
well i i think that that's the thing that's a little bit scary you know a little bit tough about putting them in a rest home is it's it's almost like
that you know they say putting them out to pasture
and some some of the people that were there with my grandmother were really active
they they wanted to do things
they didn't you know they didn't want to go down and play bingo or uh you know play with the oranges
but uh talking about latin america i kind of i consider latin america to include central and south america
and i did live in uh san polo brazil for four years
do you do you think that that we should have given up the panama canal
uh realistically i
i don't see the the panama canal that hasn't had a whole lot of usefulness to us recently since it's not not really big enough to uh accommodate the the shipping that it once did
and uh maybe it would be better that we let the panamanians run it however i think we're certainly justified in uh our actions dealing with uh noriega in this
well there are those that that that think that that that the panama canal has some considerable strategic importance particularly for the military
interestingly enough my father was who was in world war one and as uh as a civil engineer they they they offered him a commission as a captain if he would uh go in and and uh help with the defenses of the panama canal
and they uh they in fact they had
this was in the the late twenties
and they in fact used some of the equipment that had been left over
and uh he turned them down
it it's interesting that that most people don't realize how small the canal is
it's it's really
i i haven't been there
and and uh in fact we went back to visit some friends of of my fathers that we went in fifty-seven i guess
and interestingly enough the canal is quite small and and realistically could be sabotaged quite quite easily
the thing i find interesting though is that uh is the whole colonial approach
and and and do we do we support the sandinistas or or do we support uh
you know when they thought uh they thought that nicaragua if you gave them a free election they would vote for the
will you uh
did you ever studied the the political makeup there in in in nicaragua
i have a a little bit
i can't say that i'm i would be an an expert on on the region
but uh certainly uh i it it gets it ge- there
you've got this this toss up betw-
or not not so much a toss up but a a dilemma when when you want a country to have its its um own uh dominion or its free rein over its its own people
and then on the other hand uh the uh the government in power that under what seem what seems to be popular support uh the sandinistas had to a given extent popular uh support um starts making overtures to the soviet union and and into what we consider our sphere of influence
and now we're we're in this dilemma over uh united states is believes in democracy and and self determination where a-
on the other hand we believe in self preservation and uh agree with the or not so much agree with but are terribly concerned about uh infl- soviet influence in in what's considered to be the united states sphere of the world which is not only you we used to see spheres
but now we're in a situation where the united states is looks like we're it now
well the interesting part about it is that if realistically it was economic
but there was an option to build it across nicaragua
uh and uh there were uh there's a big there's a big lake
and um from a technical standpoint it wouldn't have been a lot more difficult to have built it in nicaragua
but the the united states uh had some
and i've forgotten what the political influence was
but there were economic ties then
the issue of of
if if it's in the economic interest of the united states uh do we go in and and prevail
and and uh in other words do we make the world safe for democracy
but if there's no economic benefit
and i think particularly if you're if you're looking at the at the at the peasant uh whether he's in central america regardless of where he is is his life is his life better off under communism or or uh or democratic government
well he doesn't care as long as he's feeding his uh his family
and and the question is does the government make a difference
if they'll mostly leave him alone uh
and i think that's the difficulty they that that we have that uh it it reality doesn't make uh doesn't make any difference if he has no income
and apparently even some of our alleged uh central american leaders that uh are mostly democratic have done some pretty terrible things
so it's uh
if you look at the region in in uh
to their detriment they came from uh this uh hundreds of years of spanish control
and the and the spaniards have uh horrible history of corrupt uh government greedy uh rulers who have been uh manipulating manipulating their public for their own their own good
i mean if you go back to the kings and and the the conquistadors coming in and and the hor- incredibly horrible things they did to the uh the native tribes
i mean they make uh they make the things that custer did look like uh like trivial
and uh you get
it is it is interesting that that you know we we look at the exploitation
and and and then we accuse some other people of exploiting them
and and americans have uh have a pretty good reputation of exploiting
you know we basically the panama canal we went in and and took it
and you know we set up
and we stole it fair and square
i think is uh
i mean ted teddy roosevelt didn't have the reputation speak softly and carry a big stick for uh for nothing
well what's going to be interesting is to the see what the economic impact of of uh of the the region uh you know at the moment it the tremendous drug traffic through there
the idea of of uh
what's the what's america's role there
and it it uh
with with other things going on it it seems to have lessened
but you've still got uh cuba that accepts exerts some influence
the only the only thing i see about cuba though is uh after fidel castro dies i don't think they'll be a communist power anymore
i i can't see communism in that country carrying on past him
well when you take a a situation where i think in particular in salvador where there is a significant under class
and that uh
you know having a a lot of difficulty uh surviving uh the question is would they you know would they be better off under communism
and i wouldn't don't know that i would advocate communism
but uh the question is can uh can you can uh can a democracy uh afford the
it's like the street people that are starting to show up all other the u s is that
and when you get enough of them uh you know communism would feed them all
well i i don't know if maybe communism is the right the right word for it
but what we would
there there may be a point at which at which you've uh you might want to consider some kind of socialistic uh organization or socialistic set up to to deal with the problem and then be able to gradually transform back to a democracy
if he's got uh
you know if he if he can raise enough uh coffee and bananas to uh where he's got something to protect
other you know
whether he can export or at least uh set up trade and all then democracy of a considerable interest
but cocoa leaves sell real well right now it seems
it's going to be hard to um
if you you
that that's where your absolutely right is we've got to do something in that region to encourage uh or to make to make him growing bananas profitable again i mean
but the but the question is you know if somebody offered you you know a thousand dollars a day to to grow something in your backyard would you do it
well not that we could be bought
i never know when the d i a may be uh listening on my phone
well of course everything we're saying is being recorded
it's got to be it's got to be horribly tempting for those those peasants
it's not it's not just a matter of uh of having an extra car or having a better car this is a matter for them of of feeding themselves their wife and their family
and and you
and there's dishonor in not being able to do it
uh starving to death is not a not a whole lot of fun either
uh and and you know
when somebody comes in an offers i think that's one of the real problems particularly when when the uh religious organizations you know the catholic church has been accused of a lot of things
i'm i'm not sure the catholic church is is is particularly political
but you know if
um i was wondering whether you were in favor of statehood independence or the status quo for puerto rico
i was a resident although very young of the sta- of what is now the state of alaska in nineteen fifty-nine when alaska stopped being a territory and became a state
uh so i guess i have a left over positive feeling about the question even though i don't know very much about puerto rico
uh i know that all the things that happened relative to that territory in alaska have been very positive uh
and i have a suspicion that that i believe that a the statehood is a good idea whenever you have a territory the size of puerto rico one ought either to make it a full-fledged state or or let it go one or the other
well i'm i guess i don't have su- such close experience with with um an area becoming a state as you do
um my concern is the economy because as i understand it puerto rico has a very low sta- uh standard of living or at least um annual average income
um part of this i suppose is justified in in that the climate they don't need perhaps the heating and the housing that some of the more northern territories need
i have been to puerto rico and and found it very very interesting
oh that's very interesting
and so um you know i saw it also as a young student
and and it was very foreign in a certain sense although i had grown up in california
and so the spanish was no problem
um it was it was you know very lovely
and and the people seemed very friendly and and nice
actually i work with uh a girl from puerto rico
and i guess i have never thought to ask her what she favors um
your concern on the economy was one in terms of if it became a state would that put even more pressures on on puerto rico or pressures on the u s in terms of aid
well probably more on in terms of the u s um
you know i'm i'm not quite sure how the u s copes with this sort of thing
i've live abro- abroad most of my life
so i guess i i've been very cut off
so i was very cut off from the the press as i you know and be was becoming an adult
so i don't know how the u s would cope with uh a new state that is so very very poor
um i guess you know we'd have a lot of aid if if you consider the inner cities of like new york and and how much aid it needs
i suppose the whole country or the whole um new state would require such aid
i guess um we're assuming that that puerto rico would be per capita significantly more poor perhaps than than say mississippi
that's something that that i guess i have not much of an image of other than than puerto rico as a tropical island and consequently large numbers of barefoot natives or something not in a perjuritive sense but in a in a carefree sense i guess
although i'm aware of the political problems and unrest and and also difficulties they have um i don't know whether state woul- statehood would improve their economy
i don't i don't know that the ve- the act of being a state would have any impact on on them
uh i guess they would have the ability to do some taxing that they don't have now
but of course if their economy is weak the- there is not much of a base on which to tax
well i guess it's to their advantage to be a territory
but um i wonder how have having been in a territory but only as a young student
and my parents were in the military at the time
so they didn't have ready negative feelings about being in in alaska at the time since they voted absentee
i i would imagine that it must be a little bit of a se- feeling of second class citizenry uh to be in a territory that large and not being able to vote
those are good points um which obviously i had never thought about
uh i don't know uh i suppose they also not being a state are probably freer to determine their own um ways of life than they would if if
uh i see what you mean
um and taxes
um frequently the laws in a territory are are in some ways as stringent as they are in other states
and i'm thinking in terms of education
but then again each state sets its own
and i don't know how a territorial governor takes care of something like puerto rico
um it's interesting because i haven't thought of them in terms of the problems relative to uh economy uh i had thought of it more in terms of political uh realization
and i guess i had automatically made the assumption that gee anyone would rather be a state of the u s than an independent country
well well actually i thin-
so if they've just taken such action it would seem to indicate to me either they're doing it because they're afraid they might become a state and want to declare this before they become a state or maybe because they don't want to become a state for fear of losing the spanish or hispanic heritage
well that's interesting too
well it sounds as though you are in favor of uh status quo
i i believe i would probably tend towards that
and i think uh having listened to you relative to the economy thing i think if i were being forced to make a decision i would plead ignorance and wait to do more research before picking one of these
so i'm ul- i guess i'm ultimately in favor of status quo also at this point
well that's interesting
what about if if um they demanded to have spanish as the official language as a condition for statehood
i suspect i believe that any of our states
constitutionally i don't think there are any prescriptions abo- against that decision even if louisiana chose to go with creole or something
um i don't think there is any prohibitions
i'm i'm bothered by any tendency to resist what i think was one of america's strengths
and that's the the the melting pot
uh i i am particularly fond of a number of ethnic cuisines
but i'm troubled by too close a clinging to to the past
and i'm also realizing that that a common language i think is the ultimate bond of a country
and canada i guess comes to my mind as they're going through the throes up there relative to french quebec and whatever
uh that i i think that would be a negative step to make
and i think that that they would need to reassess that
um i'm troubled even in by bilingualism uh in so far that it intr- it gets in the way of of of the melting pot aspect
that's interesting because although i tend to be bilingual spanish based on experience um i was in bilingual education in california
and i didn't have any problem with my students
but i noticed my my brother who was quite a bit younger was learning spanish in elementary school
and he can't speak a word
and so obviously it didn't work in california
but i'm rather in favor of people being bilingual
and i'd be quite happy to see a national law in which every student was required to learn english and a second language
but i'm i'm disturbed by a country that attempts to be functionally bilingual at the official level
oh i see
um i'm i'm concerned about whether or not that causes fractiousness i guess
well i think we have gone to time
and i appreciate your having called
well thank you very much
so what are your opinions on it
well let me preface it
i was a staff officer in vietnam in sixty-nine and seventy and i'm in active reserve now
so uh i'm probably not going to have the you think i would have
i was an interesting in that i think that he gave the american people some uh uh a sense of the fact that that uh wars are really run by politicians
so when did it end
well december seventy-two was when we bombed north vietnam and then they released the prisoners in early seventy-three
in that in that time frame
because i was ten
and i don't remember a lot about anything at that time in my life very much in
the the significant thing is is today did did you uh did you see barbara walters interview with schwartzkopf
but i i did read the book
so i did read and study about the vietnam war though
so i am pretty fa-
you know i'm more
well wha- what's your perspective on it
i think uh i think that there was a lot of rebellion in our nation and that i think it was the right thing to do to try and not to take away to you know just leave their freedoms there
i don't i don't know i don't really
see on the other hand i'm a pac-
and i believe that the real warfare is not with saddam hussein or the north vietnamese
but it's in spiritual kingdoms and that the real warfare is done you know in your prayer closet on your knees
so in a way in a sense i'm a pacifist
but i'm really not you know what i'm saying
but let's go to war praying
and let's go to war for that way
well well the difficulty i have is that uh are we our neighbor's keepers
and this is what i find particularly difficult in that uh if we see injustice and weather it's in a uh you know chicago or uh
or or dallas i i think if we see it you know we see john wiley price hollering injustice i think that's wrong
now the question is is was there injustice in vietnam
and i think that we that's that's the part i have difficulty
and the the other part is that the the when when your when your when your looking at vietnam and you say well is fifty-eight thousand lives worth it
still have a problem with uh
you know i haven't come to an absolute conclusion on my opinion on this
but and i know other christians would disagree with me
but we don't fight over it or anything
but you know how can
you know the bible says bless your enemies and bless those that curse you
and it's like be gentle unto all men apt to teach patient kind
so it's like how can you
i don't know you know i can't say that i agree with vietnam because how can you be gentle unto all men and and then shoot them
other issue is is is how do you allow uh how how do you allow injustice just like the the policeman in in los angeles how could how could
well in some cases we would
and i i think that's what makes it so difficult
but then vengeance is mine sayeth the lord
and i will pay
so i think god is ultimately in charge of what goes on
and i know like now in china he did all these terrible things
and they were te- terrible
and he was going to be accountable for them
and but if you look back and you say wait a minute while he was in power he built roads he put in all the temples he he unified the chinese language
it was impossible for missionaries to do accomplish anything in china because of all that
and so even in north and south vietnam i bet you'd see the same thing and that now he builds roads
so then it
and then he dropped dead twenty-five years premature he dropped dead
and so something good did come out of that in that now you see what i mean if like now
but but the other the other difficulty is is that it's just if if you take the to to feed my sheep and the question is who are my sheep
and the idea do we go out and feed these people when they're hungry
well bless your enemies if your enemy is hungry feed him
if he if he needs your asks for your shirt give him your coat also
so if the the the the south vietnamese they asked us to help them
uh they did
but i think the biggest difficulty is is that when your at an economy like south vietnam well the then reality uh the the poor farmer the poor rice farmer was going to pay taxes
and the question is who was he going to pay it to
uh the communists are the all alleged democrats uh
and i i think that's i think i think uh that's a little was a difficult part there
and and i
we couldn't uh
we had uh we had a a young lady that was fourteen that worked on our in the unit i was commander of that appeared to be eight or nine years old
and and the people looked like children i mean you couldn't imagine that one would would would conceal a bomb and and do these kind of things
i think socially it really destroyed a lot of the people that that went over and saw these people
you just couldn't believe that they would that they would be mean and and and and drop bombs and kill people
and then we would turn around and and nay palm them you know
if and i think there was a lot of a lot of tearing of emotions
and i think that if anything that when he was saying the idea that we learned we l- we learned a lot from vietnam now it was it was in general bad
but and i don't know the problem is now
i'm i'm concerned a little bit
and it was okay to go beat up on people
and i think that i think we need to a little more justice at home
but then again yeah
and i'm not saying president bush made the wrong decision
and i've kind of always
and i've kind of avoided that that those the war things and how god approaches that because i think it's just now coming up to where i really feel like i need to come you know need to decide
well the difficulty is is if you look in the old test meat and in the numbers of places that uh the lord went out and just simply struck down
and that was part of the problem when they went into the promise land
that they that they uh they didn't destroy everybody
they left a woman and a child and a
and and that that
you know and you
but then again though jesus the grace pushes you beyond the law you know what i'm saying
like so he didn't just say don't kill your don't kill your enemies
but not only don't kill them bless them
you know and so therefore when we have an enemy come against us i really feel like that i really feel like i know i do feel this strongly that when if we had someone come and attack us the best way to handle it would be to bless them and humbly go to their other king or the other ruler and say what have we done to offend you
and that god would move in that sovereignly
and he would get the glory though no king no
but it would work out because if you follow the scriptural principals it's going to work out because those are that's the best way to do it you know
but the thing is is that then god gets the glory not a president not a king
and i think that's a problem for a lot of politicians is they want the glory
well and i i
and even if the even at the local level when somebody's assaulted what do you do turn the other cheek
well i believe personally
if the one if somebody broke in my house i would pray that i would have this faith ta- to to take authority over that
and i know people that have done that
i mean i know that there have been people who have had people break in their homes and just say i bind you in jesus name
and rebuke any enemy because i believe it's a spiritual war that's going on
and it's not normal for someone to come into someone elses home
and then the same in vietnam you would you wouldn't handle vietnam the same way you would handle uh saddam houssein
but i was i have a problem with all the killing
but i'm not a new ager i don't believe
i i you know i don't have a problem with uh national identity
and i'm an american
and having different nations and all of this
but i'm concerned about the killing that went on there because i just feel like god has a better way to handle it than that
um so um do you have any favorite teams
well i kind of like them all
i played for about eighteen years all the way through college and then uh kind of hung them up after college
oh i was going to say you played pro ball
not quite huh
anyway uh being in rochester you probably like the mets
i'm actually a met
i'm i'm one of these people who's actually a die hard mets fan
oh boy it i think it's like one or the other isn't it i mean
i i i find it very strange
um more people
you know real met fans don't like the yankees
and real yankee fans don't like the mets for some reason
i never fou- i never quite found a new york fan
i always found a fan you know of either one or the other
and so that of course means that when it comes to the american league my favorite team is the red sox by default because i went to college also in boston
i like the uh
huh i guess if i had to pick a favorite team any more as well as
so that so that's sort of close enough
well we were thirty miles south of them
oh so you were pretty close
but uh so what are the mets going to do this year without strawberry
well i don't know um there's there's a part of me that says that you know um i'm sort of glad strawberry went away
you know when when he sort of went away i started thinking yeah well he was performing fairly well
but he really wasn't worth the baggage you know
um i think they're okay
you know i think they have enough people who are who are who are still in their prime you know
um i mean certainly if you look at them compared to let's say you know um eight years ago or something they're they're they're they're you know they're sort of in in good standing whereas you know um
well i was going to talk to you about that eighty-six team
that was that was the year they beat houston in extra innings
and then they actually won the series bye-bye sort of a sneaky route um against boston when there was the ball that was sort of hit to buckner
but hey what can you do
hey the guy's making millions
well actually he he he was supposedly um
there was there was something wrong with him at the time
well his knees were bothering him
and i and i understand that
and i say hey if the guy can't play you don't blame that
uh hit it to him
you blame the team you know for putting him in
so i i i was uh i was also i was in school at boston at the time
it was actually wonderful because where i was they were half met fans and um half sox fans
i think we were all pretty much uh astros fans in the national league championship series but there's like two fellows from uh brooklyn
and they they were you know they were pretty much without having to say they were pretty much mets fans
well i guess they were uh i guess they must have been scared
they weren't scared very much you know
well that's good
well they're brooklyn boys i guess
you don't expect them to be uh much of anything but thugs
i know i was born there um
i i was i was also born in brooklyn
so i can call myself a brooklyn thug although i'm really not
well i'm not to say that all folks from brooklyn are thugs
and they were from brooklyn
so i'm kind of hoping
i i i guess uh any more
they're uh they're they're they they have i think they have the best facilities in the major leagues
actually i think i make something because i think
and and and in as much as sort of fan support helps
you know it's good to have um
so they're they they have plans
i mean the owner tried to move them to florida but uh they ended up sticking around in arlington
and they're going to build a new stadium in arlington as a matter of fact not even in dallas
oh that's great
so that's that's something that we're looking forward to
i mean that that i think tends to keep
oh case in point toronto
uh i haven't been to any toronto games yet
oh boy i saw it i was up there on business uh last june and watched a game in the sky dome
that's that's probably the pattern for the future of stadiums i think
well i i mean to get up there
i mean the the best i've been up here so far you know up in up state new york is uh is um rochester red wings game
now is rochester
where where is cornell university
oh cornell is in ithaca
so cornell is about um somewhere uh about two and a half hours south of south and east of us
so if you know where lake ontario is sort of
well rochester is like right on the shores isn't it
actually whoever built the city was an idiot in my opinion
because they built it they built it far enough from the city that it actually couldn't be a port city
um but they
well they say that from that space needle up in toronto you can see the lights of rochester on a clear night
oh really i ne- i hadn't actually known that
well um but we have our own um our own triple a team here the redwings which are they're a farm team for the orioles
so everybody hopes that uh they go all the way around here
you you you watch those games
actually we we we make a point of going to a bunch of them every year because they're fun
you know lots of local fans you know small stadium you know um
and they'll get a crowd of less than ten thousand sometimes you know um especially
you know i'll make a day game or something
but they really seem to uh
i mean i can't i i again i can't make any predictions about them
but i suspect they'll go uh they'll go fly
my my folks lived down in beaumont
and uh on the campus of lamar university they used to house the beaumont golden gators who were a double a team for the padres i think
but uh they they were fun games to watch
those are those are uh i think those are more fun than major league games sometimes
well there's definitely a lot more hitting
one of the advantages of not having pitchers who are uh uh you know i guess i guess when you start pitching real well well move them up bam
so as far as the major league teams
you know every year they always knock on the door early and then just go into their skid about you know the end of june
but they they've got so much young raw talent
and then they just haven't been able to put anything together
well the way i the way i see it is
i mean um you know i can use a met analogy here
you know back to you know maybe eighty eighty-four or eighty-three or eighty-five you know when they were first when they weren't quite the eighty-six team that that that they were
that probably gives the readers a good shot for you this year or next year i think if i think the young talent really just has to build itself up
i mean they've been they've been young for a while
and they're almo- almost starting to age a little bit here
i just um
they they really hurting pitching wise
i mean they've got ryan
but you know who knows what he'll be able to do
and but it'll it'll be interesting to watch
we we usually try to get to opening day game
oh that must be nice
well i i guess we're probably oh maybe a hundred fifty miles south of dallas
well that isn't too bad just a couple of hours
but it takes about two hours two and a half hours to get there
well it takes me a good seven hours to get to shay stadium
so i don't know
we we've just got a freeway
well actually we can we can i can take a highway the whole way down
well it's so crowded up there
but it's still it's some it's it's almost four hundred hou-
i mean i mean it's almost four hundred
you know barring traffic it's four hundred hours
i mean four hundred mil-
so it's um it's it's you know it's a heck of a drive
we are substantially north of new york enough that uh we don't get to go play too often
you're you're like a boat ride from
oh toronto's only about two hours
toronto i mean i want to go see
do do you drive there
or do you take the ferry or what
um i can
i've actually i've driven
but i've heard about the ferry as well
it's a it's a beautiful city
um i i really love
i think that's one of the most uh enjoyable things about being up here
so and then i mean you go back to new york after school
i'm not a big uh i'm not a big uh cold fan
well what kind of weather are you having right now
uh right now we're actually having uh
i mean it was in the high fifties today
but three and a half weeks ago we had an ice storm
we've been up in the oh seventies eighties even up in the nineties a couple of weeks ago
oh that's great
you know about that same time branches were falling off everywhere
and we were actually in a state of emergency for two weeks
because it didn't make the nat- national news too much which i find really weird but um we were i mean um
you know all schools were closed for almost for over for a week
because they had so many power lines down and so many uh things like that
so they were
we we can uh be recorded while we talk about it
well is your
does your city have mandatory uh recycling
we actually we're kind of slow up here
and we've just started doing recycling probably last summer
and it's all voluntary
so that's interesting
um there there're some places that are strongly encouraging it
and that they city will pick it up
but we have to carry it uh some distance
and some places um you can sell your uh recyclables
and for example our church was collecting newspapers
well it turns out that so much
the problem in texas is that uh they've got so much paper now from people recycling that they've got no way to uh reprocess it
it requires an ex- it requires essentially a paper mill to recycle it
and so the value has gone down
oh i didn't realize
now up here i i suppose they send it all back to the mill
and there are paper mills within a couple of hundred miles of uh
actually there is one in northern vermont
so there's probably a paper mill that's sixty miles from here
you know in the large city that if the next recycling if the next mill is more like five hundred miles away it's a lot of money to transport
well see that's
in in dallas there no plan to build
i think there there's some in east texas there's some pulp mills
but uh you have to go to houston
and it's interesting
and then there's places that will buy metal
and they still buy aluminum can and likes that
like copper is a very good one to collect
well do you do do you do recycling
uh we do the recycling
and our city will pick up our recyclables
um i don't recycle personally
i i'm saying i want to do it
but i don't get a lot of magazines
but i do have a lot of uh
my trash has a lot of tin cans and a lot of cart- a lot of different papers and cardboards
well do you drink soda and such in aluminum cans
but we have a bottle return
oh so it's worth taking them back
well see we don't have
we have we have most of our soft drinks are in plastic liter or two liter bottles
oh they should definitely get um the nickel returnable
see a lot of the kids get the money from it
and it's great for the boy scouts running around they knock door to door and the collect the bottles sometimes
oh that's it
there is a down side to all this you know about no good deed going unpunished
that uh my mother sells um trees that they make paper out of
and so every time i recycle newspapers in fact there's a there's a uh
kimberly and clark the makers of kleenex and such has a uh a big paper mill
and uh so it's a question should i be diligent and um and and recycle and put my mother out of her livelihood
but it's an interesting point though that you know everybody's so anxious to recycle
and i suppose it does provide some gainful employment
but it takes away employment from the resource
well but in general i think it's a good idea because like the glass you can't argue that the glass
it doesn't biodegrade and and uh the plastics obviously
so we might as well recycle those
i mean like personally i don't want to clean my
you know i'd just rather get rid of that thing and throw it in the trash
well that's what we've got
well we took one load over there
and now we've got these containers filling up with stuff
and you know it's not a very high priority thing to go haul these containers over there
and i get a whole bunch of them and bring them ov- and bring them over
now if i had a recycling center and i kept it clean like if i washed all the cans and things i wouldn't mind if it sat around too much
but if if it stunk or something i wouldn't like doing it
but um i produce quite a bit of trash
my you know house
and i see it
but i don't see so much that i can recycle
i'm not a real plastic person user but a lot of paper um pretty much
and i don't know how they sort that
but if if i used a lot of can goods and i do use a lot of laundry detergent and a lot of plastic bottles i would think that i wou- i would have a recycling center
but now it's just me and my husband
so i don't know
but every little bit helps
but we have we have a very aggressive recycling at work
and i'm the one who will pick the newspaper out of the trash and bring it to the recycle bin
see some people it's the recycle bin is on their way out
well do you have separate trash cans at your desk
but other other offices do
well we have we have one that's recyclable and and then for uh lunch sacks and waste food
and they gave us a list of things that aren't re-
and it turns out it's not so bad
i i get a lot of reports that that are covered in plastic or plas- like saran wrap or something anyway
and then uh cardboard there's a few
it's interesting that we're we're recycling computer type paper
and and uh one day they'll pick up uh
and then the next day they'll pick up the other
you know and there's a lot of actually it works pretty well
and then we have a uh waste uh cans for aluminum in the in the break areas at work
well that's that's a really good idea because um like our uh fruit juices for some reason when they're in a can don't come with a deposit
and they're thinking about putting a deposit on them because pretty much you have to you're having a whole separate recyclable bin just for these fruit cans where they're so much easier just to put a deposit on it because most probably ninety percent of the aluminum cans do have deposits because they're beer and soda
but when they sell juice it's some strange quirk in the law you don't have to have a deposit on it
and even like the a very fine juice jar does not have to have a deposit on it
but if it's got soda in it it does
so it's a strange
they should they should clean clear that up
it wouldn't take them much to put a stamp on the uh juice cans as easily as the soda
so but redemption centers are a big thing up here
i think they either get a penny or two pennies a can
well see well see those of us that don't have state income taxes
and it's interesting what people get upset about
uh it really is
is bot- is bottle return down there a heated debate
the the big issue was is is when we moved here a few years ago is whether it was okay for you to uh drink beer while you were driving your pickup truck
and throw it out at the in uh
well here you can't drink
we're not civilized now you can no longer you cannot drink beer and drive
but but it was it was actually legal
well i know i was in atlanta
and you could walk out the bar with your drink in your hand
but here let me put that in a paper cup for you
so that was strange
but i think
they say well we're not going to start a can deposit because you have to get all these um the the recycle center you have to deal with the can and then you have to to recycle it
and their problem's already solved because they can just come to states that do have bottle deposits see how they handle it
and see if it's a good way
and then do it that way because as like i say people are making money on it
the cans do are worth something
well you know the other well the other thing is it also is is a is a a good habit uh to uh just to conserve resources you know where they you know because you get in the habit of that you think in terms of of uh of of things like saving
well do you exercise regularly judy
um i try to ride the stationary bicycle every day about five miles uh-huh
and i love to walk
so if i have a lunch hour with nice weather i get out and and walk
well um i uh exercise regularly
uh very good
and i swim almost every day upwards of a mile
but washington is one of my favorite places to visit
uh my daughter lives in arlington
and when i go to visit her i love to get out on that bike trail and either ride the bike oh
gosh you can ride a bike
but washington's a great place to do that
there are there are lots of bike paths
and he he's done the whole canal i think it's a hundred and eighty miles with the scouts
and so but that somehow takes
you know it's at home i can i can do some of my reading
because i think there're so many parts of the district
and that's it um
at work we have a a nice campus
so i'm able to um take advantage of of the environment here
uh the neighborhood also
i mean we're within walking distance of of stores and shops
so i do
now i think um
basically is your motive simply um health or because you enjoy it
well it's uh it's really both
and uh and most of the time i enjoy it
but i feel that uh that the discipline it affords me when i do it when i don't want to is also worth something
i think pretty much you summed up my my my motivations also
and i often find that even when i don't feel that much like exercising
and i'll start swimming
and i'll and i'll actually get energy
and i'll be have much more energy when i'm done than when i started
i mean i just feel great
oh well that's great
and that's really a terrific feeling because you just go there at the end of the day and you figure god i'm ready for bed and you exercise and then it's sort of painful for a while
but by the time you get done you feeling really terrific
and actually in in summer i like to swim
but um and and that's true when i go home from work at the end of the day if i go up for an hour in the pool i'm much much more awake
so can i just ask you are you canadian
i'm trying to because you have a you have one funny vowel that's probably going to drive the t i people crazy
but i i must say that um when when i did do a linguistics course in in school ages ago um the professor had a lot of trouble with my accent
and it's probably because i i i was born in the chicago area and grew up in california
and at that point that was sort of the limit but since then i've been abroad a lot
but where did you grow up in california
oh i see
because i grew up in north hollywood california went to u c l a and all that
well very good
i think we've probably know know each other's exercise habits and uh it was nice talking to you
well same here
so um well i'll tell you my situation is uh i have an elderly grandmother that we did just recently put in a nursing home
and um her son which is my father is also elderly
and this is one of the reasons why she had to go to the nursing home is that she was literally driving him nuts in his later years
now my father's almost eighty
so um it's strange because it it so hit so close to home that um my father's an only child
and really me and my sister are the only ones that will deal with my grandmother
and a couple of them took care of her
and then one her last sister died
and it was probably seven or eight months after that she had to go in a nursing home because i was pretty much giving up my life my sister was and plus she was driving my father crazy
she went through three housekeepers live-in housekeepers
so she's kind of cranky to get along with
but her personality is is very grating
i'm i'm i have some great concerns about uh my parents and my relatives reaching that age
um around here where i live in maryland in the washington area there's there's
and uh i used to live down in dallas there was just so many stories about uh rest homes where the people are being abused where the people are being kept in filthy conditions
in fact here in baltimore they've actually shut a couple of them down and taken all the people out of them because they were so uh bug infested and rat infested
and uh i
it really concerns me that um first of all that anyone could let someone live like that
but if you have to you know how do you make sure
i mean i'm sure when you make your appointment and go by everybody puts on a happy face um
you know how are you sure that the home is really as good as it is because once you put someone into there you know they may not like the fact that they've been put in there
and they might complain about the place all the time even though it's the best place in the whole world they could be just because they want to make you feel guilty for putting them in there
and you know
um we don't have that problem up here
we might maybe in a rural uh
maybe there's a bad uh a bad home in a rural area
but it would be a very small one
um the one my grandmother's in is very um hospital like
um this one is more or less for someone who's poor and can't go there
and my father's is he's no by no means wealthy
but he's quite well off
and he could easily have put her into a nicer um home
but up here there's waiting lists
and that was the first one that opened
and i suggested to him why don't you change
um he said well these people here are they are very nice to her
and he was saying his excuses if you move her some place else the people might not be so nice
so the the professionals in the nursing homes really have to want to do what their doing because it's a really trying job
i mean i go up twice a week to see my grandmother
and i know the staff very well
so they couldn't they can't hide anything on you or anything like that
but i have heard of really awful conditions especially down the southern part of the st- the country
uh that's true
my uh my grandmother's um
last time my mother went down there to visit the the place where my grandmother was staying at was so overrun with roaches that uh she even ha- you know they went in and she had roaches crawling on her
there were roaches even in her alarm clock um
oh that's terrible
and they just threw everything away that that she had from there
i mean they wouldn't even take the uh the uh the dresser that she had that was her own dresser because it was just you know full of bugs
they just left everything and uh bought her all brand new stuff
and they they had called a home where they you know where they were on a waiting list to get into there and explained to the person that was in charge you know what had happened and that they had ta- they had to take her out of the home because of the conditions
and amazingly enough the very next day they had an opening
and they put her into that opening
well that's good
so is your grandmother um impaired
i'm not sure um what exactly is wrong with her
up until nineteen eighty-two uh
actually i'm sorry not until
and um apparently what had happened was that i had a grandfather who um put her into a mental institution
oh that does happen
and uh you know it was a real hush-hush thing and then i was wondering why my mother always referred to you know his second wife as that hussy
you know my neighbors across the street their mother was sick at times
and they they couldn't handle her
so they put her in a home
and then uh the old frenchman he'd get a little drunk look round at his kids oh you still need your mother
and that happens a lot when people are sick or they just real manic-depressants they end up being put in homes
and it's like oh well
i'm really glad that i come from an area where um that there's good people in the homes
but it's just as
and my grandmother's real there
i mean she cries every day
and she tries to make me feel really guilty
but i have to you know i have to put my foot down where where my life begins
i mean if that was my mother i would really feel a lot more responsible
i don't really um
and hopefully that he can uh get along with uh in-house help
so he's going to probably hopefully set it up so that he will be able to pay someone to come in and stay with him probably for sixteen hours a day because i think that's the best situation is when you're you get that old and you've been independent your whole life you don't want to go into a home because like i say my father's eighty
and he's really active
i mean you wouldn't believe what he does
and as the years go on the tow trucks got better more easier
and he went out and bought himself a flat bed one
so he won't have to do very much work
so someone like that they i really don't want to see them go in a home
and he always replaces them
you know i've had like over the past thirty years i've had you know about seven or eight different dogs all the time
and it's like
you know it's oops
and the old dies
and the young one goes for a while
and he gets another one
so i can't see him with- without his animals
i mean when you get on in your years it's the only thing you really have
and i'm thinking when i get older i i i think if brought all my precious belongings with me i think i could live in a home
i don't want to be a selfish you know a burden on anyone
and i'm saying that when i get older i could probably make the best of this place i mean
and of course it's institutional food
and everybody hates it
and it's so ironic is that they go in there and they lose weight
it's really it's a bad thing
but when they go into the homes they lose weight and lik- because of the institutional food you know
but you know my taste buds are pretty uh flexible
and here they are they're always used to these old fashioned foods
and now they're feeding them um quiche and all kinds of strange food that we would eat
that's that's the thing my grandmother really misses i mean really growls about
you know just put me out to pasture or shoot me or something you know
and uh and i tell her you know no problem mom always got a place for you
i know if if if people would think ahead of time and do things like that like build the in-law apartment and have it on you know one floor and really easy access
well that's what i'm telling my father now
and i says now is the time redo your whole bathroom
so you can get in and out
the the books i read are uh business related
um i've got a a uh small company on the side that i that i do things with
so uh a lot of the reading that i i do has to do with um how can i uh do better at at my small-time business uh important issues such as a
you know taxes and
well that sounds interest- that sounds fun
um i've got a uh small distributorship uh
i uh sell a uh healthy cookie on the side
and uh i have a few health food stores that i send it to
so i can get a deal from the uh from the ma- from the supplier
well that's interesting
and then i distributed them
and then i ca- i get i can sell them at a cheaper price
plus i've got a uh drinking water system business that i've had on the side for years that i've done
well that sounds interesting
but i'll i'm not really into it
i don't know the infor- i don't know that much about it
so anyway but well that's interesting
i personally i like mostly
if i had a book of my choice i like books i go to the library a lot
and it seems like i always i never go to the fiction section
i mean that to me is just ridiculous
but i always get books like um
well i'm not into quilting
but i check a lot of books out to learn how
but i like to um can and do food preservation
and mostly canning just for fun to go pick the things and just to have fun doing it and to give them as gifts and stuff
and i like to check books out like that
and i always come away with
and i enjoy reading books about um
and that's just where my heart is
so i read a lot of books on that
and you know christian books written by people about you know to help you out and stuff
and i read the bible
but but i think i would always think that no matter what i did
so but i do enjoy reading that
and he likes to run down the street with it
and you you can probably hear him
so do you enjoy reading anything like that um
um i haven't really read anything like that in in in years
and i did uh had my own garden
and i did canning all those kind of things
that was when i was about uh ten years younger
and uh i had
oh ten years younger
oh that's funny
and uh uh th- the problem that i've had in the past with uh my children growing up and moving out of the house and and still having three left at home
um i've tried to devote more time to them and trying to get them interested in in reading more and and spending more time at the library
uh with my daughter and with my son they both have different interests in books
but um they they uh they do read them
maureen solomon i had a a friend of mine has a book by her right now called foods that heal
you know you can take your vitamins
and she was telling me to take zinc
there's a uh a couple called um oh
i'm going to forgot his name now uh dirkson
um and uh there's a book called life extensions
there's also a book called the life extans- extension companion
uh dirk pearson and
oh i forgot sally's last name anyway it's a couple
i've i've seen them on t v
and uh they an- they are pretty down to earth about uh
um life extensions
on johnny carson show and uh i was pretty impressed
before he started out on his experiments he had a battery of tests done on his body to determine the age of each one of his organs you know based on how well it was performing
and then he embarked on this uh vitamin treatment
and then every year he had the same tests run
and at the age of thirty-two i think it was his um heart was that of a fourteen year old and all the rest of his organs were all greatly you know all tested out greatly below his actual age
and of course sally uh isn't a very big woman
i mean she's you know she appeared to me to be very petite
and um she took a horse shoe and and turned it turned it into an s
and uh it was all from taking the right vitamins and things that that give you the strength
and of course doing isometric exercises uh together they both exercised about five minutes a day
doing isometrics rather than you know physical strenuous exercises
and it's grown on good soil hardly anymore
and i know my my husband's uncle owns di- some acreage in a eastland texas which is in west texas
owns and he owns a lot of acreage that's been farmed properly you know and uh we get black-eyed peas off of it and stuff
but i know that you know the further we go from adam the worse the food is for you
but god still somehow makes us all be able to still live
well the last couple of processed foods
you know i mean but
i like to i like to
you know and
i guess i'm going to have to wait for the millennium i think though because i do don't think we're going to restore the earth to
you know i think
but uh in the meantime we pray over our food because i'm always looking down my plate
and i think man this stuff was probably grown in who knows what you know kind of environment
but i do take some vitamins on the side
and i do like reading books like that i just i have a hard time a lot of the books are real new age oriented like mother earth
and we're going to restore the earth
i think i mean i think to think that is almost
and i think god's in charge
and god's going to restore it when he wants to
so sometimes i get bogged down in the
but you know there's a balance in it sometimes i read stuff like that
and then i just chunk off like water off your back some of it
and you know and try and do what's what i can do out of it that's practical
i've i've read a lot of things um since i got involved in the water business back in eighty-three
um and it's amazing that the the legislation they have um for food that doesn't apply to water
they don't consider water a food and uh the basics premise is that if water was a food it would be you know they wouldn't be able to sell it to you through your pipes because it's toxic
um yet their saying well we're putting such low doses in there that well
the problem is that i've that i've read books that
uh have proven that
and if you look at the history of hear attacks heart attacks were nonexistent prior to nineteen twenty
and we started doing um large quantities of chlorination of water starting around uh where we experimented with it in nineteen oh three and nineteen thirteen
you know i bet that's why we have some friends that eat only
man it's going to be good
anyway uh i had a friend that read a book on that
and um i've
you know you probably read back to eden or something
but the um
they dr- they drilled a well i don't know how many feet
but it's three or four times deeper than it needed to be
and so their water comes out
they live kind of in a the planes go right over from d f w
so it's not real developed
and so they have a
and they drilled this well
and the water comes out at thirty-two degrees
would that be healthier do to do that to drill your own fresh water well like that
it depends a lot of uh a lot of things were thought
you know the farmers thought okay we got chemicals we're putting chemicals on the field
well the ground will naturally filter out the
uh what kind of house do you live in
uh we live in a one story just like a style home you know the standard texas uh fox and jacobs
with with a yard and fence
are you in a ho- apartment or a home
i'm in an apartment in uh plano
well they say those are easy to fi- or difficult to find
they are if uh
uh it's hard for me to tell because i haven't rented in uh probably twenty twenty-five years and uh just
what's a what's a one bedroom
are you in a um well plano
most most complexes in plano are pretty nice
so you're probably in a you know
well they vary from place to place
it's hard to tell you know how well they've been kept up how old they are
and these are probably oh one of the nicest that i found
and uh they're almost five hundred a month for a one bedroom place
ooh that does get high
it does considering that you know you- uh house payments are
our mortgage is is between depending on
you know it drops um
seems like in the last six months we um got lucky
and we refinanced
but it was like eight hundred and something
but it went down to like seven hundred and twenty so that's really not
wow that's a lot for a townhouse
actually they're near plano in north dallas too
but i couldn't believe it
but you know
but that's what happens when you get up in this area you know you got all these companies are up here
and these and i guess they know they're going to get it
and then i think that um nobody was really buying houses there for a long time there because of just
i mean we've been in ours for about ten years
but uh there's no investment in it
you know all it allows you to do is itemize
you just take off your mortgage interest and that's about it
on your on your taxes yeah
i've owned uh several built several
so you know what it's like
it's not um
and it's not that exciting after a while
we uh we lived out of state for a while and came back
and uh we lived in a smaller city
and now we say gee dallas really is big and polluted
but i can remember coming to work from
i used to live in wylie and i could see downtown dallas
and now there's this brown haze over it
and it's moving north
it's really it's really sad because they're not doing anything
well we're getting off the subject i guess
but just like with housing i mean they're not doing anything about pollution
you know um i used to think that dallas was better than houston because their zoning for where you can put a house next to a
so we've got you know got some investment in it
but you really don't get anything out of it
were you said you were out of state for a while was that a smaller town than dallas area
the prices actually a lot better because pittsburgh is about the size i've been trying to think like a louisville or minneapolis that type of size
and the prices what you get here for about a hundred thousand you could get there for about seventy-five eighty
and we didn't think it was that clean
but then after you're gone for a while
oh yeah well you know a lot of these people that i've talked to that are coming down from uh like what i call the back east especially from j c penney uh are selling two and three hundred thousand dollar houses up there and buying a hundred and fifty hundred and seventy-five thousand dollar houses down here
and they've wound up getting better houses here than they had there so in a way i guess it works both ways
but and here i guess it depends on what you want
you know here i got a lot of people that work for j c penney in marketing and a lot of the people that came from that area probably like what you're talking about they had no um they had a lot of property but not a lot of house
and now they have a lot of house and hardly any yardage around it but but they love it
i mean they they they think they're getting
you know you say sun room to them and you enclose and you can sell it
and they don't have to worry about yard upkeep if they don't hardly have any
and a lot of them i know a couple women that work there
and they don't miss in public relations
and they don't miss having a basement to run up and down to you know
there's not too many basements in texas
and i said you haven't heard about tornados
how about those you know
gosh i remember when i was little uh we didn't have a
i lived grew up in southern oklahoma and uh people across the street had a cellar
and we never did
and it's just like dallas area it was tornado alley up there
and every spring mom would drag me up at three o'clock four o'clock in the morning and pajamas and teddy bear across the street
and we'd go into the cellar
and i to this day i don't care if i go or not
you know if it's going to get me it's get me
that's exactly uh
and uh we used to call the basements actual cellars
so it's funny to hear that word because i never hear it
you know it's like the back porch used to be a stoop you know but uh um the housing is just
and i don't know if we're going to stay here or not depends
you know i mean
actually when we were up north um
but some family things changed
so we ended up come back down here and all that because it helped my husband's work
but um we really would like to
but we don't know if we're going to do it unless we stay here you know
with t i it's like anybody else you never know how long you're going to be here be in one place you know
i mean the economy any more
i mean i think everybody just lives under an umbrella the uncertainty with housing and everything
you know it's
well how do you handle
so you got
uh how do we take care of the house
well i don't have a mexi-
i don't shouldn't say that
and they have like a four thousand square foot home
and she's got a uh a live out nanny um
but any rate i don't have any of that um
it's really not too difficult with no children and just two people you know
and we're pretty
i mean we're not fanatically neat
but um we keep things up you know not like where there is three feet of weeds or anything in the yard by the time you need to um get around to fertilizing and cutting in the spring
we're pretty much um
oh you too
we we've been around long enough as a couple that we learned a long time ago not to wall paper together
uh we pretty much hire
we subcontract mostly everything i mean other than anything that's not a um
i mean i know how to fix a running toilet he does what he needs to
but mostly if it's something major um you know cleaning out the air conditioning ducts or something like that we just hire out to do that
i mean you sound like you may have been a couple one time
and how'd that go
the building process was a lot of fun but puts a lot of strain on things
and i also think that once you get to be um you know certain
you know i think people that own homes a lot in north dallas are very materialistic
oh you bet
but people that the people that own them are the hom- homes themselves
and you know um spending sixteen dollars a yard for custom draperies for custom drapes just doesn't
well to some of them i guess it doesn't matter you know that maybe they've got enough coming in to take care of it
i mean and and you know you see a lot of these people that came east from uh west from uh from new york with exxon or j c penney
and it's just a hoot to watch them
are they they
you know they've got it made
so well was it hard to adjust living in an apartment after being in a house
because you're combine- uh confined by space
you know i had a
oh my goodness yeah
and i had room for everything
i don't know just seems like room stuff always expands to fill available space
well in a way you can travel light
you know you lear- you adjust you figure out
how is how is apartment dwelling living in terms of general privacy and noise and things like that
uh there seems to be more a mature crowd in uh apartments at least where i am uh even though you know there's kids all around
and there's there's traffic
and there's people running up and down the sidewalks and stuff like that
but still uh
everybody pretty much kee- keeps- keeps to their own turf so to speak
and uh there's never really any
oh i remember in school
seem like there was a fight or a party or something going on every night you don't run into that up here i think i think because there's so many uh professional people if you want to call them that that go spend all day at work
and they want to come home
and they want some quiet
or they're doing this and that
and they they're trying to to unwind
well it's gotten so big it's almost a town in it's own right
now we paid oh we paid um about seventy-eight nine for our house like i said about a decade ago not even about nine years ago
and i'd say they appraised it
it's gone up you now maybe like five percent so it's an investment
but it's something that
you know when you're first married or starting out you think if you really have something
but you really
oh you bet
and the thing that that gets me is uh you never really catch up you never really finish doing things
and uh you're always paying for something
you know i mean like we had i called them prefabs just a tract home
you know i mean we we had one of their homes that was nicer in pennsylvania
but um it was an older home
but then you buy an older home and you're always fixing things up
oh you are constantly
so you know
so uh tell me about changes from say twenty years ago since you were an adult twenty years ago
well let's see well we assume i was an adult twenty years ago
well you're you're able to you're able to uh vote and go to war and things like that
oh that's right
uh nineteen seventy i had been married two years
um we had all the great civil rights legislation of nineteen sixty-eight
and uh around here on the uh east coast uh
and uh that was a uh a great shock for a lot of people
um i was gainfully employed by safeway stores incorporated
and uh trying desperately to uh get ahead with the company
uh the problem was that my hair was too long
and uh you weren't allowed to have a uh mustache or a beard
you know jeans just flat out weren't allowed
well if you were a uh black female you were destined to be store manager in six to nine months
and that's basically where i ended up
i uh i just flat out couldn't get hold you know get ahead with the company because they were dead in affirmative action
um on other fronts um
and is the company now uh well represented uh demographically at the higher echelons
i i i i stopped working for them in uh seventy-eight seventy-nine
i think they're they're like all companies well represented
and uh you know everything seems to be fine
i i've kind of lost touch with the company
but uh as far as uh as their management goes um i'm not sure they're any any better off than they were were before management wise
but uh other changes um just people seem to be more outspoken now individually rather than collectively
um back in the seventies we had uh a lot of uh protests against the war and uh bring our troops home
and things were more organized
and uh i've noticed that now more and more individual people are speaking out for their own rights rather than massing together
so there's less you think now there's less of a a social movement and more individual mov- lots of individual movements
i'm not sure if that was because you know eighties was like the uh the me decade
and uh everybody was into me
and then we are getting back into us
but um it it it's
i've seen uh uh a great deal of change as far as um corporate responsibility and things um
and people's response to that you know at first not trusting and now expecting more
and what ab- what about the last ten years that you've been aware
well that i've been aware of i've
but half generation off i guess
um i've noticed uh a certain increase um pessimism with america no longer being sort of on top
and it was right around that time when i started becoming socially you know a socially conscious adult
and i realize that people of my age have no um no major success in the sense that uh you saw the passage of the civil rights act and um major social change in that sense
and all the changes that have happened in the last uh even during my adulthood have been more incremental
but there hasn't been the same sort of fiery speeches of martin luther king or whatever that has really uh galvanized the population
and there's just
instead there's been sort of an increasing oh i don't know japan bashing and things like that
and uh a lot of
i see among some of my friends and even more among some of my students who are you know maybe twenty a real sense of you know america's losing it
and losing it in the competitive market
and a real knowl- uh
you know our former enemies and things like that
and uh so i see i see a lot of uh a lot of pessimism growing
um and at the same time i think there's there's there's a growing environmentalist movement and sense of corporate respon- increased corporate responsible towards uh you know environmental safety and things like that
and that might potentially be sort of the civil right the equivalent of the civil rights act in in the near future in terms of you know some real landmark bills passing and things like that
such that you know people
i mean my generation doesn't can't rest on the the glow of having achieved civil rights because we were born into an assumption that you know yes there's still some racism
but you know basically things are
and there's a notion of fairness
but even uh i think uh along the line of the uh goals of civil rights
um there always seems to be some prejudice to someone by anyone
oh of course
i mean you know
you know don't like the way you look don't like the way you dress don't like your hair don't like you know it's just something that always sets people off
you know you either like someone or you don't like someone or you're just completely indifferent
and the problem is that ideally you they you know the world would like you to be completely indifferent
so um but i i i understand what you say about the environmental movement
um it's it's been a long time coming
um and being a uh a very old hippie
i mean you know if you had long hair in high school in the sixties you got labeled a hippie
and you keep that image your whole life
and i i just
i've seen a lot of changes i mean from the original earth day and um i'm heavily involved in you know my own personal recycling
and you know i do the newspaper and cardboard and paper and
you know all that stuff at home
and i'm starting to see more and more recycling centers
and that's a real change except it sort of brings back to the nineteen forties more than anything else
i mean all this recycling used to be in tact
but much of it did
i mean recycling was a was a wartime thing
and then they turned around and called them junkyards and
and now we got to the point where the junkyards you've got to pay them to take something there
so things have really changed a lot
i think the uh the other part about uh america's decline i think has to do with
the perceived decline has to do with uh um the attitudes and the educational system uh
i have children in in s- i have three children in school right now
and i'm not impressed with the teachers that are teaching them
uh i had
when i was down in dallas for two years i had uh my children come home from school with papers that were corrected by the teacher that had words spelled correctly marked wrong
and this person's teaching my children
you know i had a real problem with that
well i'd i'd say actually i mean as someone who's involved in education i'd say that maybe one of the changes is that the role of the teacher has incrementally gotten lower and lower value and society
i mean relative pay which is a major way we value people has been poorer and poorer over the years
uh you know that
but not quite in proportion to cost of living
and you know it's just more and more uh a real low income sort of job and very low prestige
i mean there's that that old saying those who can do it and those who can't teach
and if you have that kind of social attitude it's hard to get sufficient numbers of people who are going to overlook all of that work for lower pay work for low social prestige just because they care about good education
and you get more and more people and up there because it's uh it's the safety net of those of you know average intelligence or something they can always teach
um i'm not sure if your familiar with the movement they have here in maryland
but they're trying to get a uh a uh a merit system here in maryland rather than a uh tenure system
for all the you know elementary middle school and high schools
so jan how do they recycle in texas
and then they've just got different barrels
um they've got them set outside
is it is it all voluntary
now they do have some places where you can take things and get cash
you know they just want to uh help recycle which is
what we do you know
probably the only thing sometimes we'll take cash or the cans in
and we let the kids get the money for that
a lot of projects where the the boy scouts and things and that will
but but that's really the the biggest thing around here is the grocery stores participating
you know but
you see i guess it depends on your landfill space
and my parents how are forced recycling
all plastic they ha- all plastic has to go into a recycling bin all cans have to be recycled all newspapers has to be recycled
because they're um
uh pennsylvania ohio and new york are some of the uh
so it's really uh it's uh really hard on them
now up here in maryland though we're j- just in a voluntary recycling stage right now
so uh so my wife and i you know we save our bottles
and we save our newspapers
and we save all our plastic and all of our tin cans
and just like you say we go to uh a community area where they have it set up
and we dump them off
so it's vol-
though i think i think we're supposed to have something impame- implemented by nineteen ninety-three though where some aspects will be mandatory
is it all um
or is it all
and most of the time like i said that's that's a sort of like fund raiser things that
well they do have places around here where you can get money for your newspapers
but you know i think a lot of people like i said are more concerned
with you know right now you know the aspects of saving the earth
well you know we
as soon as the community said you know we're going to put up bins for recycling you know we automatically started
it was it's one of those things
you know and just going and taking the time to go and read the signs and the brochures on what they accept and how it should be
separated you know
well i tell you it's kind of funny now at e- even at t i i don't
um at t i they're doing recycling
i mean for a long time they didn't do this
but now they're they're recycling cans and paper
we have separate bins uh separate wastebaskets
you know and they
i mean it's tremendous how much money they have saved and even saving all these trees
and you know it's really
how much how well they're doing
at a at a at a college
and we do basically the same thing
the state of maryland has lost asked all the colleges and universities and some of the large organizations you know if they would definitely recycle their office paper
the same thing you know every almost every college in maryland is recycling office paper
but you know in the giant bins around
and it's surprising how much you never realize because that janitor comes around and empties your garbage
you know they don't pick up your recycling until
you just can't believe how much paper that you uh
well you think about
i mean you know cost wise and and you know like you s- saving trees and stuff like
i mean it's just amazing
so i think
you know i guess a lot of the large organizations
uh but that doesn't mean that they don't
but i haven't really seen anything advertise publicly
and then like i said they do a lot of internal
but i haven't seen anything
but see i don't see a lot of t i advertisements on t v anyway
i think they advertise more um other places where they're not located
you know so so i don't see a lot of advertisements for t i
because i know that some of the large industries here will advertise on television
you know they'll jus- come up and say
you know they'll show you tho- to encourage
and here those of us that dumavra power which is our power company
so i so i think you know we're probably reaching a successful stage and and just with voluntary
well even i mean in the kid's schools
i mean they do things to try and recycle
and i know my kids um like if they see litter on the ground they pick it up and say oh look at that somebody is not saving the earth
so i mean the kids i mean they really try to educate all ages you know
and it's good to start the kids real young on
because i mean when i was a kid they never did stuff like that
i mean it's like nobody was concerned about it
you know and it's like
you know it's like all of a sudden when there's noticeable things saying hey you know
you know and now everybody is doing something about which is good
i i think really probably what hit peoples you know i know that here in the up in the uh
and and they're saying we estimate this landfill be ov- will be full in two years unless we cut back
even then you know we're really running out of space
so i think that that became
you know and n- no other state
they're not going to voluntarily say hey ship your garbage here
so you know
realistically you know we had we really had to start we have to start recycling in some some uh geographic areas
that it it really surprises me because of the cost savings
i mean this is such a tremendous
i mean why
i mean even even not even the aspects of not saving the earth
so cost you know
well in some ways i guess it it doesn't become really cost saving until you have an industry around it you know because
i know that like in
to take the ink out of the newspaper so it can be reused um is very expensive
and also it w- it produces a a waste a um a
even some aspects of recycling they still have cost yeah cost efficient yet
so but others you know like tin cans and plastics
are are really uh efficient you know
they they melt on quickly and can be you know just because of the
i i noticed that a lot of gas stations are telling you to recycle your oil
and i mean that kind of surprises me
i mean you know because once oil gets so you know thick and yucky you'd wonder how they could you know clean that up
but they can
um i don't know how cost efficient that would be i guess
i d- i don't know either
i know that though i e- all those petroleum products though are so terrible for your um
you know they really pollute quickly
and you know one
i was reading some place the brake fluid you put brake fluid normally comes in just small little pint containers
you know like hundreds of gallons of water
so it's one of those things that they really
how how terrible that is
so we'll have to we'll have to keep our eyes on all that i guess
i i think that i mean i think that they really are doing a good thing now
and i hope it keeps
well i'm sure we'll keep up
you know i i think that
because like we were asking some people that live in um north dakota well are you saving
and they said well we're not forced to do it yet
you know so i mean i don't know
i think that if people are forced if the people are not forced to do it they may not you
i mean i don't know
well you know if they're forced to do it
you know i know that it's really funny
well i personally don't have any problem with uh drug testing employees or potential employees do you
i mean basically
i i uh uh
the policy that t i has i think is uh uh very fair
they first had a policy where they uh would test new employees
and then since i've been with them the last four years uh there's been in the last year year and a half um they're doing random testing of all employees
you know junkins all the way down
and it is
and fr- from what i understand it is jerry junkins all the way down
but the program you know was still fairly new
so i was not uh ever called upon to do a drug test
and i think random is probably you know the only really fair way to do it
um i like it because um
you know i i i grew up in the sixties
and and uh you know i i saw
you know i know my friends who were you know druggies and
and and uh you know it's i think it's a real problem
and i think it and i think it's causing us a lot of trouble and and a lot of problems
and so i'm hoping that uh a lot of other companies will will follow the same path
um probably not
especially if they have anything do with you know government contracts or anything
as matter of fact i want to believe that the uh defense department more or less mandated that people you know who work on defense contracts you know
s- do some sort of you know drug testing
i was in the uh defense electronic division when i retired
i know it was a you know it was a real hot hot item there
i think i want to think maybe they you know really got some nudging from you know d o d to do this sort of thing
um a p d as a matter of fact
so you kne- you know the atmosphere then
but i i'd i'd i really like the idea
uh in fact i would like to see uh a lot more uh people uh adopt it
uh like you know school systems and that kind of thing
i mean i'd like i'd like to know that my child's being taught by a teacher who's not on drugs or or uh who might be at a point where they're trying to sell my kid drugs
i just can't disagree with you with you know the basic premise
as far as i know it's you know seems to be a fairly accurate program as far as uh you know the testing goes
and i like the idea that they have a uh system where they allow you to uh be retested if for
and offer you you know help if you need help
rather than just uh put you out on the street and let you fend for yourself
i believe it is a a a medical problem
um of course i also think smoking is the most addictive thing in the world too
so i mean there's a lot of things out there
things that uh
i'm just glad that they uh decided not to uh tax drugs otherwise they'd be legal
and they'd be getting tax money off it the same way
well it's it's a real problem
and and stuff
and i uh uh i moved to a t i facility that um had never had uh random drug sampling before
it was uh an industrial company and you know that t i purchased
and so the people here a lot of them are real opposed to it
uh they were really opposed to it
and you know there was a few of them that obviously were doing drugs
and that's why they were opposed to it
and uh it resulted in in a few people leaving
you know because they just flat out weren't going to put up with the policy
you know they had a life-style
and they weren't going to change it
or at least began was in the talking sta-
you know everybody knew it was coming
it just a matter of time everybody was screaming you know invasion of privacy and all this stuff
but a lot of people i think after they thought about it for awhile and you know weighed the pros and cons decided you know it's really not a bad idea unless you're doing drugs of course
i mean uh you should have no objection to it
it's like uh going down to get your license and checking your eyes
i mean you know why do i need my eyes checked
you know it's like
well so you don't kill people on the road
uh it's a ba-
i mean it's the basic premise with
you know drug testing
especially some of the jobs um
and it's very little that anyone could do in the engineering sector as far as uh you know hurting someone i mean
but uh in the manufacturing sectors and over in semiconductor
yeah i darn if i'd want somebody down there that i'm working with side by side you know that could kill me
so there's a there's a lot of sectors where i think that would would help out
and i think in the long run we all benefit
i mean if you have uh
you know if you're not working with someone on drugs well then you're going to have less accidents
and you have less accidents
and you spend less money on medical
and you spend less money on medical then the company's more profitable
and then and it
and it goes around
you know to everywhere
trickles trickles up and down
i i just hope that uh more and more companies uh get on the ball
and and and start it up
you know if if they
well a lot of companies are are coming down in price
and i think that the insurance companies are starting to give uh benefits
you know re- reduction in in medical costs if you know they
so i think everybody will will benefit from the program
and i think if if a lot more insurance companies get on the bandwagon and say
well if you impose uh
you know twenty per cent
and of course you know the company's not going to reduce the employee's cost of insurance twenty per cent they're going to reduce their own
but it'll save in some areas
and that'll cover it
and maybe some insurance companies might start offering it as a uh as part of the package
that's a very ver- very very competitive business
i i think i think all around it it's going to help out a lot
well it's nice to talk to you
and you take care
so the topic is vacations
that's a good that's a good topic huh
uh the last was back down to lubbock to visit parents
but that's not the tradition for us
what's your out of the out of the state type
uh we enjoyed yellow stone real well last year
what kind of uh vacation spots are there in colorado
oh rocky mountain national park
it's it's just like any of the other national parks
you know there's camping and fishing and hiking and wildlife watching
we went to colorado springs and uh rocky mountain national park
we usually try and drive up there oh once every year or two
oh that's tough
i don't i don't think i could do that
oh it's not bad at all
it's it's a beautiful drive
now i admit up there the altitude is kind of
you know you get a little lightheaded and giddy
but it's fun you know take along a picnic lunch
oh we love it
they're only to the east uh i mean to the west of us
you know it's right there at the very foot of the rockies
you know and once a week we drive up into the mountains usually you know usually once a week once every other week
well i enjoy hills in texas too
have you ever been out of the united states for uh vacation
uh once to mexico city
but just a little day thing on business
i went to uh the bahamas last year on a cruise for my honeymoon
uh that's nice
i had never been out of really out of texas or out of indiana much out of the united states
uh got to eat some different kinds of foods and meet people from a different culture
in fact one uh family that
and they had never been to the united states
so they were really enjoying it
and they were telling us about all their trips
and it was neat to meet different people
so the place that i went that we've gone on vacation that i think i enjoyed the most
well we uh
somehow we picked the right time and uh walked down on the wharf
and i think we ate seafood every meal for well not quite every meal but most meals for a week
uh it was wonderful
uh the pacific science museum the little girl really enjoyed
it was it was super
and uh went to the seattle aquarium
and it's right down there on the right there on the ocean and
and you walk down in a dome a glass dome
and the bay is circulating over your head
and you and you can watch the fish swim by and sharks
and oh it's
and then there's walrus and sea lion and porpoises and oh it's it's amazing
that's the vacation you recommend huh
and the mountains the mountains to the east of seattle
you know up there
and you drive your car on
and you have a beer
and your car is on a ferry
and it goes across with you
and there are people literally that everyday take the ferry you know and drive
live on an island off off shore from seattle
and you uh
take for the twenty to hour and ten minutes that it takes to get across and you know depending on where it is
well in some places you know
in some areas you know depends on how far they are commuting
oh it it's strict
i'm i'm a west texan
and to think that people live on the water daily is kind of odd to me
you know it's it's a different life style than we are used to
and i haven't really seen much
so what are some good things in texas to go visit
but it's a bird sanctuary
and it's very pretty
uh i like the rio grande valley
of course you haven't lived until you have been to san antone to the to the alamo
and you need to go in the spring when all the flowers are in bloom all up and down through there
oh it's just simply beautiful
and of course always when i lived in west texas had to annually go down to san antone just
and go to uh lone star
and uh you know make my annual pilgrimage to the lone star brewery
uh el paso is kind of neat in kind of a funny way
you know go across the border and all
uh the davis mountains are interesting
uh now the right time of year to go there is in the middle of winter
you know whenever you've been kind of cold where you are at it's most enjoyable
to get you know to get warm
uh down there in the lower rio grande valley closer to where the rio grande empties into the gulf that's interesting
and uh austin is neat for for an occasional visit
it's a fun few days uh
oh u t is real pretty
uh there's a lot of little limestone lakes and caverns around that area marble falls and all
and uh i'd say go to uh midland once just for the heck of it
i don't know why exactly
but uh you know find out when they are holding
um currently i'm not doing a whole lot of exercise in any type of program
and um the best thing we found to do with him is to walk around
so my wife and i kind of take turns
but in the last couple of months i've changed to a new residence and everything has gotten kind of turned a little upside down
um what did you do when you did exercise regularly
well i had uh a little routine that i did for warm ups
and then i did some very mild say light weight lifting
but i try to uh
and i like to cycle a lot
and uh my husband and i we have entered a few rallies that's pretty popular in texas
but every weekend a small town will sponsor a rally
and thousands of people come with their bikes and ride over hilly terrain for thirty or forty miles which that's a lot of fun
um so we try to ride during the week to try and stay in shape for that
and um t i where i work has uh a fitness center
so a lot of time after work or maybe on the weekends we'd go over there and lift weights and do the tread mill
and um they have stair masters and all kinds of new machine that are fun to ride and workout on
so i try to
i used to uh get into it and get out of it based on my schedule
so i'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis now
but it's a big commitment
so that's a lot of part of it
oh i have a total of five children
and they do take up a big part of my uh my evening and weekend
and it's tough being a parent and doing all the things that you should do for yourself too
that's why they uh really stress at t i they really stress staying in shape like stay in fit overall fitness you know no smoking and all that
but it's hard to find uh an actual exercise regimen that work for you you know because like i know a lot of people that cycle they take their kids behind them on the bikes
and i don't know if that would work for me because i don't know i wouldn't want to pull a kid over hilly terrain
but it's really hard to find something that works and you know to find time to do it and stay committed to it like three days a week or whatever
and you can use what ever rationale you want
but basically the healthier you stay the longer you'll live
and uh you know if i spend a little bit of time each day or a little bit of time every other day doing something for me to make me live longer well then i'll around a lot longer
and those people that i'm taking the ten minutes or twenty minutes away from now well you know get the enjoyment of me years past where i would have been if i wouldn't have taken it
um i've been learning a lot lately about um
i don't know if you're familiar with him he was the pioneer of aerobics and all of health really
he's he's kind of he's pretty much the innovator of the whole exercise thing
um he was talking about the three things you could that cause aging smoking are inactivity
and what was the other one i think was yeah obesity
if you can control those three areas then are you going to live longer you know cause those are risk factors
oh i've done a lot of study over the years
and i found that probably one of the worst things that anybody can ingest is chlorinated water
um the research that i've done
and i've actually been in the drinking watering business since eighty-three
and it's amazing that uh you know prior to like nineteen-twenty there were very few heart attacks
well in nineteen-three they started experimenting with chlorinating the water in nineteen-thirteen most of the major cities
and after that we we started having the hearts attacks
and uh dr price wrote a book coronary cholesterol and chlorine
uh dr price
and it's amazing
you know it's a very small book
and the guys very opinionated
um but he makes a very good case against chlorine
and he points out that people in uh england
and uh or even diets that quadrupled the amount of cholesterol that we're ingesting now
and they weren't dropping dead of heart attacks
and uh proved that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis which is the
and uh you know he's
and now they're saying what's cholesterol
well there's good cholesterol and there's bad cholesterol
you know it's amazing what he points out in that book
and in fact he everyone there was a toxicologist for the environmental protection agency who did work back in nineteen eighty-six who wrote a letter to dr price in nineteen eighty-seven and in this letter he praised dr price for the work he did back in the sixties on this and said that e p a had been doing experiments on nonhuman primates and proving that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis
and e p a never published that report
and what's the name of this book again
so he's really interested in the heart
and he's in fact he's a well heart too
he's uh he's done a lot of research on like how your heart reacts to exercise
um so anyway
there is there is a lot of good information out there uh about health
and a lot of the a lot of the myths they've been passing around people are starting to realize aren't true
i mean i'm all for having a diet high in fiber and all that because that's that's good for you
uh but to believe some of the things
you know and i don't think anybody should be going out there and eating a high fat diet
but to think that solely alone is going to cause something like arteriosclerosis is is just hard to believe
um he talks about that
and i've had my cholesterol checked and uh a few times
and i've never been above like you know one-hundred and fifty
and uh uh i mean i
well what they tell me
but i mean you know everything is like within five to ten percent and all that kind of thing
you know they leave themselves wide open so they can't be sued
but uh we've
and we've had a few of the health fairs up here
and um you know i've always come out aces
you know i'm not really that big on watching what i eat
but i do eat you know some health cookies that are high in fiber
but i mean as far as really being concerned about ingesting too much chlorine i'm not cholesterol i'm not worried about it
okay um do you like to cook
well i love to cook as a matter of fact i'm making dinner right now
um i um i'm making some uh
i have a little turkey left from a passover whi- whi- which was in april
and i had frozen it
and i'm defrosting that and making some dressing and gravy and making corn and wheat stuff that you can buy at a store which is like uh rice pilaf
with with with wheat kernel that
and do you cook
i mean are you single do you cook every night for yourself
um i'm married
and actually the
so this isn't for her
this is for our friends that came over and helped helped me do some stuff
and and she's having
i i do cook um virtually
well like if you were having a dinner party what would you cook a variety of things i mean you know vegetarian and nonvegetarian
we we consistently
if if we have a dinner party we usually make it vegetarian just to make life easier
so we'll make something you know uh some sort of pasta or something
you know homemade pasta or lasagna or something
that's something that's you know really easy
and that is what i'm having is pasta
oh good idea
well for for christmas i got a um pasta machine
and all all my friends are really anxious you know to have the homemade noodles
electric or uh
that that that that's
we we bought one in italy
i like you know kind of still having in put that not everything's being done for me
but um yeah
so that's what i'm going to be cooking you know
um pasta salad first
and um then just something for desert you know bread and wine and cheese stuff like that
um so you know so you know that it's a a lot of fun actually
a lot of people think though that i've talked to about it think that it's you know a lot of hard work
and i said heck
it actually is if if if you have a food processor
it it turns out that i- i- if if you really want to be nice and easy about it you can make the dough in the food processor really simply
and then um and with that it becomes really easy to make colorful pasta
what other kinds of uh dinner parties
um well i don't entertain that often
uh when i do though i i have some friends that i always
but you know um i see a recipe and think oh wow i'd really like to try this cause i'm single
and i live by myself
so it's not necessarily something that i would cook just for myself
so i'll say okay you guys are experimental i want say how this is going to turn out
and usually i'm i'm pretty good about it
um i have this really good recipe for this um pork chop and apple casserole kind of thing
and um you put stuffing and put poached apples and everything
and my girlfriend and her husband loved it
and i was quite impressed with myself if i should say so
well i'm the kind of cook that i don't normally measure things
and you know i don't to the point of you know measuring down to the exact amount that they say
if you've ever watched the ones on television like uh jeff schmidt the super gourmet
he he just thro- takes stuff he says yeah about an ounce of this
we have a we do uh uh middle eastern dinner quite a bit actually
or uh we have people other that have never experienced it before and haven't had much middle eastern food
we make uh cause we're my wife is syrian
and um her families always have this food she grew up in
and i've made some of it before as well
so we make uh four or five middle eastern dishes that are just all real simple
an- and that's always a real big kick for people who want you know who've never tried it before
that's that's that's that's a fun idea i mean if you ever uh want something different to try
i've been wanting to take an um oriental cooking class
and i just haven't gotten around to it yet
oh do you have a wok though
but i'd like to know more about you know more elaborate things like guess
it's easy um
and the food just comes out
you know if you do it right i think it comes out the food comes out very tasty not very mushy
you know and and it doesn't taste like a million calories of oil
we li- live in our wok
we we we like to eat even when we eat out and stuff we eat a lot of chinese food
or japanese food or you know
and that seems to
so wok food seems to be our thing
so anything else you cook
um i just kind of you know cook here cook there
i mean i'm always willing to try anything usually
well that's good
i think it's uh
and i i especially like baking and making deserts
oh the wilson course
actually it was a private course
through like a com-
it is it's it's neat but it takes a long time
you know i mean like i'm elected to always bring cakes into work
and it's like you know you bake the cakes
and then i guess just because i don't have the expertise to just hurry up and do it
like you know some a professional would i try to i go real slow
and you know it's a little time consuming
but it's really worth your effort once you see how you do
we have um
he's he's uh got a degree in business management
so he learned to uh how to do this
he he do- does that a lot
so you know he cooks a lot
you know he bakes a lot whenever he
whe- when my wife and i got married the night before we had a party
and he baked us he made a real big cake himself
so new years our friend made a baby
i get the mold i put i put it on you know the frosting always melts
and it's it's just horrible
well you learn helpful hints in the classes at least
you know the instructor told us certain things about well don't follow what's really necessarily on the box you know if you're making just a cake from a box you know do this cause you know make it a variety
oh that that you mean about the
you know some different hints yeah
well that helps
some different hints you know and the different thi- the different kinds of frostings you can make
you know and i have a book an it
and you know all of the different you know decorating tips an things like that
well most frostings are sort of butter cream to aren't they
those are those kill me
it's like it's like i'm eating sugar
but they're good sugar
so that's about it
it was it was a pleasure chatting with you
well have a good time cooking for your dinner party next week
uh well i mean i've had time to think about it because uh we've had
so oh okay
so um i i was thinking about a couple things uh and whether they are serious
and some aren't
i guess the biggest thing that bothers me is is uh not the biggest thing
but one of the things that bothers me is the credit information uh situation
that you uh that you find yourself almost compromised into giving if you want any s- sort of credit
e- extensive checks and and things of that nature
i i i mean i i don't know if that's an invasion of privacy simply i i do t- i do feel it is
but i don't know whether
some of the questions they ask are legitimate uh because they are the ones who are making the profit out of your
well what's scary is uh uh about two three four months ago on a sun- in the sunday edition of what is called the morning paper here the dallas morning news
they showed a reporter and a um and a copy editor how they went out
and they just took um a fellow in john q public in dallas
and all they had was
let's see they had his birth- they had something like his birth date the street address
um they weren't even sure of the correct spelling of his last name
and it was um very scary to see what they found out
i mean they were able to find out what liens he still had against you know two or three houses through a two divorces children's names locations
um it was really frightening
well i guess i guess then it's just the big brother concept of the fact
that once you give your social security number there are people i guess who are who are uh actually collecting all this all the time
and and profiles are given
i understand uh
i read the other day that uh these telemarketeers when someone talks to you on the phone uh all all they need now is your telephone number which i guess is involved in this controversy of whether they can reveal your telephone number or not
i i i feel that is an invasion of privacy
i don't the other thing i don't like is um in terms of uh
like we just moved here from uh minneapolis
and uh to get the the very nice townhouse that we're in
you know husband and wife owners um who had never done this before
they um asked us for again an astounding amount of information
and what we really didn't have the same opportunity
you know and i guess that's when i also get upset that if you're going to do it then i want to do it too
um in terms of the credit
i know um we're also going through adoption now
and i mean after we gave our fingerprints n- to the f b i you you
look at each other yeah you look at each other and say well
um so i mean it's it's a matter of anybody can get it any way and how if they really try um
i i have a particular subject that not everyone agrees with me uh uh well by b-
uh i make my living by uh flying airplanes for for a company
and uh as a as a uh an airline pilot i have to take random drug testing
i mean it seems to me the public outcry was for that at the time
so i when i finish a a certain flight on a random basis i have to
uh have a wri- a drug test
and and and that's without i- uh probably cause
and uh a-
in the end now i mean they've tested they've spent forty million dollars
and they've found uh i think uh in pilots anyway of something like uh uh eighty-six thousand tests there's only been two guys have come up uh three guys have come up positive
and one of them was a bad test
see uh and i just started working well for an electronics firm down here
and then now i'm in corporate communications
and uh part of that
and i had never been asked that
and i thought um i really didn't like it
um i i have very mixed feelings about it
um i think i- i think that it's well
and you're in that field
so i don't know
you know we lived in uh minneapolis when the northwest airlines pilot in the dakotas
that hit the fan like uh
you uh you're obviously aware of that um
if they're going to do random um
i i don't agree with random
you know in terms of maybe at set intervals so that everybody knows what's going on
um i don't see a problem with that
i do think i see some level of necessity um
the reason i feel that way even to a low degree is because it's the old story the minority make it bad for the you know majority um
i i can understand the public's alarm to it
but i guess having done this all my life i knew that there wasn't a problem
and and it indeed it has proved out that way
but now try to get the damn thing repealed you know
i know it's um
uh not only that
but in some of the instances like you just cited where you have to give your fingerprints i mean wha- what what happens if you say no
and that's um exactly what it is
i mean that that kind of screening in general is a matter of exclusion
um if we didn't give it we wouldn't go to romania
i mean if
but that's the way it is
it's my feeling also that that that although
i i don't know if it's that serious i-
but that was part of the question
i do feel the courts have have held up a great deal of of our privacy i mean particularly look in in some of the in some of the
uh i notice in some of the sexual cases they've held up a great deal of privacy
but it i guess with our fear with crime and maybe airline crashes and things like that it does seem that we've we've slipped and that's eroded
or at least those in the market place their everyday life seemed to take that as a signal that you know it's fair game
you you have to answer these questions of course
uh i don't know
i i feel there has been an erosion
and i don't really know how serious it is except i don't like it
and also i agree with that
and in the in terms of the question um in terms uh
and that was pre-aids and all the other um things
and i have a real problem with medical professionals
um it goes back to the things like drug screening
but if it's in any level even with the potential to endangerment
um and i think this is much stronger than you know pilots or uh train engineers being screened
um the transmission of the aids virus um
i mean i don't i don't have the answer
i i you know i mean i think of the young girl in florida who
or was she from
the young girl that uh contracted aids through her dentist allegedly
and then they proved it
i don't i don't know um i- y- i don't know if it's the old story that we are killing ourselves in general or what um
well i mean it it
just take that that step now where where now we feel there's a need to do that
and the next thing you know then
uh there's always the need to to go and inspect lockers of high school students
i guess the question is uh
the the thing for me is who sets the parameters or who has the control you know
i mean well uh good luck to you
uh i don't i don't hold out much hope for you
i mean i was based there a lot uh several times in the service
and i was absolutely flabbergasted at the
in in at least in criminal law some of the some of the
oh it's it's ter-
and th- the things i'm finding out are the
um it's no better than journalism
um except in journalism it's words
um this is very frightening in that uh oh
and in uh in texas they they d- they do not require for instance for prospective adoptive parents
let's just say um that somebody who's in ne-
but somebody who's need of carting um aluminum beer cans around
and they want to take them to a recycling uh resource for money or whatever
um they've they've been going through a lot of bad publicity here in the last three or four months again um because they've been arresting people like that
well i mean i don't understand
if you if you don't
because um in our case one is at the state and the other one is at the federal level because you have to de- because you have to deal with the i n
because you have to deal with the uh imi- immigration service
oh i see
oh the state doesn't require it
well that's kind of that's rather that's rather unusual isn't it
i mean there's again there's no consistency
you know like in your
in terms of you being a pilot and being tested randomly um i can't see why after a certain number of years or after a certain time frame they can't do it at an interval
or you know i mean
well i guess i guess the extension of that is why why not
and then if we really think that drugs are a problem we can randomly stop anybody on the street
they they do that in texas
oh they do
what they do is they check to see if you've got uh current insurance
or they check to to see if you're permits are
well there's there's all sorts of scare tactics i guess to to invade our privacy
and it's kind of um
to me it's just frightening you know
i mean the old uh
uh way past time
is come an- is come and gone
but it's here
i mean i
and the computers of course helps that
well look at what we're talking now
i mean it's
i mean you wonder ultimately what a network of stranger you know
well what kind of music did you all listen to
oh my goodness
now see we think of classic rock that they you know have on all the easy listening stations now as our heart and soul
i mean it was
i mean we were there
now well then you was in the uh
or i am sorry
well i was i was in seventh grade when the beatles came out
well i wanted to go
and i guess i was close to eighteen or something
it was like i think the summer between my uh high school and college somewhere around in there
i i kind of liked would have liked to have been there
we could not we could not get it together to drive
i mean you know we had never driven outside of you know
and here we were all hep to go to woodstock you know
oh that would have been such a great memory
i i think of uh you know all the social changes that were going on around that time and and the sixties as being so revolutionary in a lot of ways in terms of raising people's consciousness everything from
well i mean i remember we had the first earth day back then you know
we got out of school at at uh the university
and we celebrated earth day
and we did not realize you know the implications of all that then
to me it didn't doesn't seem like we have got much
well you do
i mean there w- there was no name to it
you had you had to fight for racial equality
well i do remember demonstrations over busing
and busing themsel-
it was like just a continuum
you know everything sort of had a seed in the sixties
and women's rights i mean things for women were totally different for you by that time
by the time i was born even now you know women's rights uh
now i saw something on t v last night on twenty-twenty
you know men's uh fathers or daddies
now wait a minute
it is about a lot of men you know all right going through divorces
the judge will usually uh give custody to the mother ninety-seven percent of the time because they go through the female
well we learned from kramer versus kramer didn't we
but it does seem you know
see men are coming into their own now too
they are well
i thought well now men you know have to fight to be equal
and i think that is only right though really
one guy said the judge looked at him and said well now mister so and so he says i have never seen uh calves follow a bull
that is why i always he said that is why i always give custody to the mama
and he said well he said does that mean you are going to shoot them if they break a leg and
you know butcher them if they get fat
you know but that that is the way most people feel that women should get custody
well are you married
and do you have children
and i have got two kids
and and how does your husband respond to all the new
social uh changes
bless his heart you know
flared pants and he
well i do not like them
you know to him
well he just you know he is he is his own person
he you know he does stay with it as far as music and stuff goes
but he wears what clothes he wants to which we are both that way
but uh my husband is not a conformist at all
well see that that is the spirit of the sixties
and whether we are talking about the rain forests
you you know the situation you have right now
and and all of our generations is what to do with the children because both mother and father have to work now
well uh we are trying to keep away from that
but i have got a four month old baby
and i do not want to work
that's that's see that is your commitment
well when he grew up he grew up with his
and my mom had six kids
so she had to work
and you know i was raised by my sisters and stuff
and i can i can't see the difference
but i know that it would have been better had mom been able to stay home with us
and my husband was the same way
and we just
well they need guidance
and they do need parental guidance twenty-four hours a day
uh well see i if i had some i would
i i have not
and i am you know
and it is not going to happen that way
but my my uh friends are having babies right and left
so i get to see the different ways that they
uh all raise them
and and one gal she started a business
and she she hired an au pair which is a college kid to come in and take care of her two boys while she works in the other end of the house
well but see now
and the guy lives in with her you know
i mean you know it is a family sort of unit sort of thing
well i think that's neat
so that is a different way
and then my other girlfriend just you know tears her hair out and goes at it you know twenty-four hours a day watching both kids all the time
and i think there is a point where you just have to get away
and it is good for the kid
and it is good for you to develop you know your interest so you do not stop growing at the same time
well i know the family is really going through changes
but now we are trying to go back to about the sixties when the parents you know when the mother was staying at home
do you have any uh
well my family is kentucky
now my one of my sisters is down here
and my husband was in the service when i met him
and so we we've been all over
and he is itching
so i am keep having to scratch his back
outside of i mean going
well that is
well see and and that is uh the sort of the thing of the nineties is women working out of their own home
they are bringing offices i mean jus- i mean big businesses into their home
and i think you know the more we try to you know shape that the more input we
have into what that whole system is going to look like because that is that is our choice now too
that is that is our cause
well i think i think one that would be uh
it is uh
kids could see their parents you know how hard they work
when uh we first moved down here i was working
and it was three and four days a week
oh my little boy just he went wild you know i mean because because he had been used to me being there all the time
and he is just now
well when i got pregnant i went ahead and quit work and decided just to stay at home
and it was costing too much at home than more at home than i was bringing in
see the- the- the economic situation on the whole thing
and then uh well it is
see we do have things that we are
but i think we have taken a big leap in the last you know twenty thirty years
and uh nothing is the same
but we we grew we passed them on to you
you you what
i mean you know because it takes a lot of hard work
it takes writing letters to congressmen and and you know just being very very politically astute about how to shape and mold the future
and and uh you know um did we make the right choices
i mean you know i i think we made a wrong choice when i look at the children of today
and i think business got in the way
and i like it just for the noise
but do you actually watch it
or is it more of a company
i mean i have my favorite things that i do
and then some fun thing to do sometime
um what about you
well actually i work full time
and when i am not working i am running
and i do not watch a lot of television
and i am very selective in what i watch
well see that's great
and and uh
if if i do not find something that i really want or really want to watch well then i just do not turn it on
part of it is that uh i think we need to be very selective about the kinds of things that come to us on a subliminal basis
and i think that if we are doing other things and these programs come in sometimes they influence us
and we do not know where that influence came from
well i think that well part i think that's partially true too
and uh anyway i think it
you are you would be susceptible to stuff
of course i uh
and it has to be reinforced at another level too
anyway what would you watch if you had you know this week to watch
well last night for example i really would have liked to have watched unsolved mysteries
but i would prefer to find
well we have cable also
and sometimes you can um get the h b o specials
and sometimes those are really
and some of those are fine programs
so i i like to watch comedy
and that's something
i i enjoy comedy
i i guess i have my old favorites
but i am
hooked on you know like
and uh you know something on that level
i i also enjoy uh
of thirteen uh the mclaughlin group
and i i just laugh
i mean i think that's so hysterical
it's just it's just a lot of fun
i mean i do not agree with a whole lot of the stuff the they say
but i also watch it for uh cultural impact
and i watch for special programs that have special a special play a special concert uh
oh now that was fabulous
uh and it was fabulous
and that you know
oh i was just
i i may or may not even look at the t v guide
but if i have time i may flip through and say hey this looks good if i finish this task i can watch that in an hour
you know well there's certain thin-
i have got um my t v in the kitchen here
uh you know if there's something like cooking shows
i i really do
and then i eat
and then i get fat
so i just let other people watch
and and there's some um
in fact one of the water color shows i know has inspired me to take water color lessons you know
oh i think that's
but i think
or at least i saw a very bad example of having television influence your life uh
and i want you to know that became the most suspicious cantankerous contrary old
but she just got to the point where you could might near you could almost hear those soaps being echoed in her voice
oh well see that's
but she was probably depressed to begin with
well i do not know
well she was grumpy to begin with
but uh but you could clearly see those influences
and in my youngsters
i know that one day uh my youngsters were watching the three stooges
and i always thought that was just casual slap stick
but when one tries to lift the other one up with a pipe wrench i decided that was not funny
and i really i really feel very strong about the bart simpson show
and that's absolutely the mouthiest kid i ever saw
and i just i do not like it
but i have grandchildren
and uh for a four year old to think bart simpson is a hero is tragic
see it's just my husband and i
so i do not have that you know i that constant influence
but uh um i don't know
well i was very careful even when my kids were kids were at home
and when they were young i was really did uh watch what they watched
and i watched it
and if i did not like it i changed the channel for them you know
i you know i distracted them changed their interest
and and you know we get it at school too
anyway so you might as well not
they got they are mouthy enough anyway
i know i remember going to sch-
and of course
we did not have any of the variety you know
but all the watch rawhide and all those shows
and my parents never let me watch anything like that
i could watch yogi bear you know
and i remember going to school the next day
and everybody would be asking oh did you see that
and did you see
and i could never participate
and it always made me feel a little bit you know a loner
like i you know
but see then my parents
well i did
i said hey i think that's enough television for awhile
and we need to go out and play and enjoy some company
so i would go out with them
now see there's the problem parents do not do that
or you go rent a video up at
but but we went on field trips
and we did other things
and i think that was
well that's you know that's something people do not do
well here we are talking on that subject
but that's that's an interesting concept
i have got to stick in my uh
you know work with kids
and i guess the suggestion is that we maybe talk about a menu for a dinner party if we wanted to do something like that or
share recipes or something um
i mean i do them
but they are a lot of work
i usually have them when i
and i i make a big deal out of it for them
and uh i think i am most uh happiest with my most
you know and i have i make my own pies and pie crust
you know i can make my pies from scratch
oh that's great
well i bake pies too
but my mother was always the famous pie baker in the family
i mean i guess after many years of doing it you just
and she said make me one
and i made her one
and when i when she gave me back the plate she said i did not share this with anybody
she enjoyed it huh
well there is a woman in our choir who is nearly famous for her apple pies
and uh we had a a
well i think i i have had it once
and it has been a few years ago
but i do recall that it was quite good
so that is her specialty uh
i like to bake uh also
but i do enjoy baking
and i guess i always liked making uh cookies and bars and things like that
and they seem to last longer than pies around here
they are meant for the that evening's
and you know it has got to be gone or daddy gets into the you know the leftovers
and then he is
well it is interesting that
and she was telling me that she had a dinner party over the weekend
for um uh
and uh they invited two other couples over
and so there were seven of them that uh
i said well what did you have
and she said what she had uh just mexican food
but you know she had uh uh guacamole
and uh i cannot remember all she had
but she also had made uh flan which is actually spanish i think
it's uh it's um
it's like uh an egg custard in a caramelized sugar
and it's it's quite actually not very difficult to make
but it's very very high in cholesterol i am sure with all the eggs that are in it
but uh she said that she and her husband had uh traveled in spain a couple years ago
and and flan is almost uh a basic with every meal that you get
so if you ever run into that
but uh i would never have thought of making that as part of a a mexican dinner
but you know sopapillas i guess would be another kind of a dessert if you decided to do something like that
make ahead and have just you know have ready
but uh well i would have been thinking i would like to have a dinner party sometime soon
but i tell you it
it's one of those things where it does require some real uh planning
it's you know
you have the house to clean and you know the whole business that goes with it
well when i have a dinner party that is my motivation for getting the
we are catering a wedding uh um in august
uh this lady that is
so she has got to hire this crew
and there you know
she is she must have found some jewels
well we have
and until last year i had never had another person clean my house
and so i had a woman come in uh once a month
and you know it was not just very often
but for me it was wonderful
that is nice you know to have that
and it is buys you time to do other things like have a dinner party i guess
so it is just a real gift of time as far as i am concerned
i i have a pie crust recipe that i that is unique
but i have never tried it
well i should say i have heard of one that has vinegar in it
i think it would be too hazy because um the
like the liquid is like
and you mix that together
and then you
see it makes it makes uh five pie crusts at once
uh quite large
and like uh a tablespoon of salt and a tablespoon of sugar
and and you combine your dry ingredients
and then you uh put in your liquid
uh what is it about the uh the vinegar that uh makes
it just it just makes it very pliable and and very flaky
and you are still going to have a flaky pie crust
boy that that's the real secret
like uh it's not mine
it was from the one of the magazines probably
and it said you can throw this on the floor and step on it
i thought wow quite a statement for them to make
it makes me think of years ago uh when i was visiting my mother-in-law in uh michigan
and we just had
you know according to the owners
well talk about working with big amounts of pie crust and having it be tough
i i could have used that recipe
well we lived in plymouth for four years uh
in fact i we were there from uh seventy three to seventy seven
oh how neat
i was i worked for the little the weekly newspaper there the the plymouth oh what was it called crier
so he was born and
so uh are you originally from michigan
well uh some of the books i've read lately have to do with crafty type things where i've where i've um learned things that i'm going to do for my children for christmas and they were really uh helpful because i didn't know how to do this one stitching
and so that was very helpful to me as far as books
otherwise um i like to read children's books and things like that
well i was an english major
so i like to read period
uh lately i've been on the whole very practical
and uh i'm trying um to to uh furnish a home so i've been looking at i'm not sure reading is the word but looking at books on uh antiques and paintings and uh interior decoration hints and uh lots of books on plants and and and gardens because we started a garden and things things like that
so i've been doing very little reading except i i did finally dip into a couple of biographies um all of sort of literary figures of this century
my husband and i had uh took a book out of the library about gardening too and started a garden a fall garden
and our our uh cantaloupes and and um peppers and tomatoes are on right now
so it's been really fun
and and we learned that you know um some of the gardening skills we had were before
but some of them we learned from a book and so that was helpful to us
now i've read two books
well one was nonfiction and one was fiction
and the fiction one uh was about a boy in uh during the time of adolf hitler and he grew up and lived through a concentration camp and that was not enjoyment
that that was too realistic and really um mind a real eye opener uh
and i guess it's good to read those things too uh
but i didn't enjoy it necessarily and uh the other one was quite enjoyable
it was uh about a a chinese lady and her generations down her what happened to her family through the years so that one was good
well even if they're not enjoyable they bring you a uh some kind of of learning
so even if it's the country that they're from or anything like that
so i i i like to read the the children's books
so i like those a lot
uh what are your favorite children's books
oh there are a couple of newberry award winners
uh a wrinkle in time is one i don't know if you've ever read that but but um oh there's one about an indian girl
and i can't think of that
island of the blue dolphins is another and that's a good one
now some of the ones that have just received the awards this year i haven't read
and i would like to read those but uh it's funny because i've read some from like nineteen twenty-three and nineteen forty-five and things like that and i didn't enjoy those as much
and i don't know if it's just because they didn't come from my era or what
i i i
well you can't be an english major unless you like reading things from the past
so i've read a great deal of old things
i tend to go go back
i don't have any children so i don't read the new ones
but i occasionally if no one's looking dip into something like winnie the pooh
or uh uh the grimm's fairy tales or something like that um just because it's sheer magic
uh my children and i uh i started a thing where i read a book with them before they went to bed at night
and there was one called the pig princess
and it was a a princess from a long long time ago
and she came through a a spell kind of thing and ended up in a pig um sty
and the people that she came to were just farm people and she didn't understand them
and they didn't understand her
but it came together in this book
and it was really a lot of fun
i think that uh we we
i'm wondering what what camping means to you
when i think of camping i think of of bugs
oh very good
that's sort of the same thing that that i do
i don't think of um trailers and campers and all this stuff
um do you do much camping
oh you've never been camping
well um yes and no
and the uh
but um up until gee maybe five or six years ago i did a lot of it
oh i bet
and so i i camped a lot in um the middle east and i was able to camp right in ruins which was always very exciting
um and then when i used to come back to the states in summer we'd often go up um to the lake country in new york with my brother's family and and do camping there
well my cou- uh husband and and his uncle especially uh grew up camping together
and uh they they just love it
and they're planning a trip uh into canada this i guess in about a year
and they're going to spend about a week and a half camping up there
and you're not going
this is this is a a man's trip
oh that's too bad
so they're really looking forward to that so
and see i was i was never exposed to it so
i i feel like i'm a little bit too uh much of a city city mouse to try doing it
oh that's too bad
i think the- you know there's certainly a lot of aspects you would like
but maybe not the yo- you know the canada men's trip but some other you know
a nice tent on the the shore of a lake
what's the best part about it to to you the the quiet the getting away
the the the no telephone the
gee whiz you go to bed when it gets dark
and you get up when it gets light
and um i guess just just the change
now do you usually like do you usually go and there's lots of other people around
or is it pretty much isolated
it's uh it's pretty isolated um
and to me i like that i guess too although there are people
i mean you know it's really hard to get away
but we didn't even have tents there
oh good grief
that that does sound neat
but i don't think i i've got quite enough nerve to do that
i know my husband's gone uh for several days on the appalachian trail before
and he said that you can a lot of times you can go for you know a good day before you'll see or meet anybody else on the trail
so it's not for the faint of heart i don't think
actually i just joined um the appalachian trail walking club or whatever they call it
uh and i'm very eager to to start uh
i love to walk and um i'm going to start with day trips though because i don't know the territory and all
and i'm not sure
well that sounds really neat
oh but you know i'm going to try
well gee whiz
i don't know uh
we talk about sometimes going up to chincoteague and uh i
maybe like you said start out slow and and kind of get used to it and find out that it maybe it's not as bad as i i fear it might be
i think that you know
and you know the only site left when we got there was in the middle of a field
and i said gee whiz for twenty dollars we can go down the road and get a a motel which we did
and so that you know
if the setting was right and that it's it's great
but if it's
well i've been real um
but we have two cars right now
and we're still paying on them
but i would love to have one of these new mini vans
and i think that would be just the perfect family car
right now my car is terminally ill so i am really looking at uh facing the purchase of a car
uh what i would like to have is so totally impractical for me that
uh well i would like for one time in my life to have a convertible
and uh you know i don't even like the wind blowing in on me
so i don't know why i think i want one
but i do
uh i will probably stay with a foreign make
we have um we have
so we bought um a chevy nova about three years ago
and and we opened up the the hood
and it said toyota made in japan right across the front of all the engine parts
well the chevy nova is the same car as the toyota camry
uh at that time was the same car
so they just put different names on them depending on who they're being shipped to
well i didn't realize it
i knew that one of the that nissan which is toyota had uh joined with had a plant over here
and and i
but i i never thought of
i know uh
that's why we were so surprised to see toyota written i mean imprinted on the engine
but uh i
you know there's so many different options and so many different prices and who has this cash back and whatever
and that's minimum
it you know it's it's a major purchase
i heard a commercial or something about a sixty thousand dollar car about oh it would how
and i thought i don't think i'd find that exciting
i'd be wondering you know here i am buying this expensive of a car and my house isn't worth that much money
but when you consider that when you drive them off of the show lot
and you know that
and i don't know that i'll buy a brand new one again
well we had a pretty
and then we bought a used car
then we bought our our next car used
and uh we had better luck with our used car
and i like it more
and we got more features and air-conditioning and whatever on it then we did on our brand new one for twice as much money
well i'm i'm seriously considering going that route instead of a brand new car
if you can find one that's r- uh you know reliable
well some people you know some people have to have a new car every year
uh i wouldn't
or it you know at the most every two years
and they don't drive them that much
your foreign cars you know
like a honda or uh a toyota
and if i can find one or a repossession
and with the banks being in such financial you know problems now that people
and it was in real nice condition so because apparently whatever the bank get
and a very good afternoon to you
and aft- good afternoon to you
do you uh do most of your cooking at home
or do you uh have a lot of people come in and have to prepare for them
and um i could safely say that i have never cooked for a dinner party
well what would you uh like to cook
what's what what's what is your favorite uh recipes uh that you would like to have for a dinner party
now you're in dallas is it
of course um dinner parties down here probably oh turn out to be more things like barbecues
i was i was thinking in terms of mexican almost
uh tex-mex uh
mexican food um probably a little bit different than what you serve up in pennsylvania for a dinner party
well that's a very interesting food though
and when i go out to eat dinner sometimes that's the type of foods i like to find
we have uh
or or in these different restaurants in this area that uh have all this fine mexican foods
but um if i were to cook uh a dinner party uh it may be standard to you
but uh actually i never get too much fried chicken
but i would have fried chicken uh with reasonably hot sauce on it
and i love twice cooked potatoes
with with a cream made of the the sour cream and cream cheese and uh a little oleo and i use uh oregano and maybe dill weed uh mixed in with it
and uh i like broccoli casseroles which would include onion and cheese and and more dill weed and some medium hot peppers
and i would probably have some quiet and gentle fried onion rings mixed in there with it too
so uh how would you improve upon that
uh green beans and uh carrots and things like that
um i just get fresh green beans from the grocery store and snap off the ends and put them in water and steam them for about ten minutes
so you h-
and i like to put a little mrs dash in with them
what what you use and and in herbs and so forth
um i like to just put a tablespoon or so of mrs dash in there
and it makes them pretty tasty
well you might uh be interested in that
you you have a soy sauce taste
and you also have a little cream sauce in there because you you would use the uh water and
but uh it does make a nice thick creamy sauce with the green beans and then you have a nice soy sauce taste under it with a few onions in there with it
if it does it it brings out such a so much different things in uh in the string beans
i i like it to try them differently
so you might uh think about that
chinese cooking actually has a lot of very delicious tastes to them
and uh north african cooking is good when you use something called couscous
and that's uh made from uh i think they call it beans
and that's the type of something that whatever you mix with it this couscous uh absorbs the taste of whatever else you put in it where that makes a very delicious dish
and that's a a north african dish
and it is very very flexible
it makes a fantastic uh uh salad with cucumbers and
well i've enjoyed talking with you
and i hope i've well i've enjoyed talking with you
given you some ideas and uh that's one thing we can enjoy is good delicious food
are you reading the papers about the the middle east summit
i think um i think i was worn o- worn out from middle east after the war
i think it kind of uh it didn't really take over the first page quite as much as it did i think during the war
but um we definitely need something there with all the hostages and what all
that's i think uh
i think that's really uh really important
i i i i guess we grew up in such a different world i could never even imagine taking hostages
but i think they just have a whole different world than we do
but i don't know what do you think some of the long term repercussions might be
and i see the middle east as being you know the real
so i guess i view it as being the prime importance as far as trying to negotiate trying to wind down some of the tensions and everything that are there
i think um
i don't know i have uh i just have this this civil rights mentality i i guess
or or you know sho- should we uh
those i wish those countries could have the same type of freedoms or whatever that we do
i guess that's what i i hope for them
but some of them don't want those freedoms i think
their their religious beliefs may um may not you know
so i think that's something that has to be considered too
but i think that's a that's really a long term type thing
i know that the the
and i was just thinking well peace is peace you know
and that really is the nicest thing
and and it depends on the country you know
if you look at um iraq for example and you know the recent thing with the u n going in there and the the bomb development and all this kind of stuff you know
i think you know we should have got him while we
i i think so
i think um
and i think there's a certain mentality to that that's in the middle east you know the the constant fighting you know
i think i think they realized we would probably never push him out
and uh i think the other
i think they they look at force as a way of you know their their means to their ends
and uh so i you know i don't know so much if these peace talks are going to
you know if if we even if we say that we're going to do stuff i don't know how they'll stick to that
i i think the the thing is though i i guess the the arab countries that used to argue with us or not support any i- ideas that that coincide with the the u s ideas or whatever used to probably receive money from the soviet union
and i guess that's all gone
i think that's really uh probably what started the whole process
well that's probably a bonus on our part
i think i think that they're s- they're so much more vulnerable now because they don't receive support from the soviet union
so i guess they're saying well you know we can eat two ways or we can get this aid free from these countries two ways
we can either act like we're going to be pro-communist or act like we're going to be pro uh pro-democracy
and whatever gets us the most honor that's what we'll act like we're going to do
but we really won't change in the long run
i think that's the way i sort of see them all working you know
you know i think they have in mind what they want to do
and i think a lot of times their might make right
and you know it
kind of the forceful you know
but i just don't think peace is uppermost in their minds
it's it's really funny as an american and always being an ally with the israelis
i always find it very hard in my heart to a- to align with the israelis because they seem to be just as bad as the arabs
but then again they have to live in that environment
and then you think to yourself well you know in your heart you don't want to be aligned with somebody that's mean and cruel to someone else
but if that's the environment that they have to live in and survive in then you have to sort of
like i don't know
but i am a golfer
well that's about the way i am
but i do enjoy it
i uh haven't been out all year
but uh i enjoy both watching it and playing it
but lately it's been just about that
but i do enjoy
i think the one of the things i enjoy the most is the beauty of the golf courses
and the the peacefulness
and the little critters that are around
and it's such a personal challenge
it's it's a competitiveness against yourself
and you're doing a whole lot better you know
and then all of a sudden you go back out
and it's just terrible
or you'll hear thirty and think boy i got my game together
and then you quadruple bogey
being down there do you uh get to see like the colonial or any of those
i've never been to a golf to a major golf tournament
i uh watch them on t v a lot
you know we've had uh the p g a up here
uh a- and in tulsa
and i've been to both of them
i mean it's it's like a bullet going by
i'll bet um
and you know to to see their concentration and yet to see them how friendly they are when they're walk by you you know and how good they are to their spectators
well i've only been playing like about three years now
but i just took it up about three years ago
and uh we play in a lot of couple's scramble tournaments
and we have developed a tremendous number of friends that couples do this
and you know it's fun to go on vacations and things and go to golf courses
and it you know it it's fun because it's so uncompetitive
you really on those you really go out for fun
and you know you won't
you know you're stroke is just one of one or two or three or four you know that's going to make any difference
and you just do your own thing and be relaxed and enjoy it
i used to when i worked at kerr mcgee i used to play in their tournaments
and uh now that was very competitive
and i enjoyed it tremendously
but uh i i'm more i think i get more enjoyment just couple friends going out
and if if it takes one of us ten shots to get up to the green so be it
you know we just think well the next time has got to be better
they have a lot of them there at the club you know
and then they they have the club championships and everything with the women's slots as well
but i don't know
now my husband and all the men i mean they love the real competitiveness of playing for money you know
but i i'm not good enough for that
i don't do much with it since uh most of theirs
and uh most of their meetings and all are during the week
and i don't don't get to play except on the weekend
someday when i i get where i live closer to the club and partially retired maybe i'll uh be able to play a little more
it uh it's it's a it's a good game
i uh i wish i had more time to play
and i felt you know had more energy to play it too
well now see i've got two children
and uh they're
one is o- uh just turned to be a teenager
and the other one is on his way
so i think it makes it more difficult for me to uh you know find time with my my children since i work
and then of course take care of the house a- and all this good kind of stuff
uh so it's a real uh it's a real problem for me
uh the the thing that we like to do the most is to watch t v together
and uh the kids like to play nintendo
but i'm no good at it
you just watch them play huh
i i tried it once or twice
but i didn't feel like i was very good at it either
and i've never got off of level one
and i i don't even know what they're talking about
i i know
that's a that's a neat thing
so i guess we're all in uh you know movie uh fanatics or whatever around here
so we like to do those kind of things
i know when our kids were growing up our we were big into water sports
and they all skied
and in the summer we spent most weekends on the lake with them skiing
and they always took other friends with them
and we had a lot of fun doing that
oh how neat
but i had all girls so we didn't do too much sports wise
i find my grandchildren are very involved in soccer and baseball and little boys do all of those things but
see i have a son
and uh you know it's football in the fall and and baseball in the spring
and and it's one activity after another
i i'm constantly going back and forth
and my daughter has uh tennis
so it's between tennis and and bowling
so you know we're pretty active as a sports you know in in the family
it it's really neat
well when mine were real little they all played soccer
you know that was just for a couple of years when they were pretty small for girls
and then they got more interested in other things
but i think that's probably what it was
i i know that uh my daughter uh even though she goes out with the the sports and everything uh yeah she likes to watch the football for uh the kids
uh that was a cat that hit the telephone
but uh yeah
my uh my kids are they're starting to grow up you know
it's not going to be too many more years before i uh uh you know they'll be gone
and and uh there won't be as many activities
do you uh
but you enjoy them
i i agree with you
i i do
i'm so glad they're out of the that young real young age
and the babies
and i mean i didn't
but the older they got i enjoyed them as teenagers
and now that they're each
of course three girls they're each becoming the they've all become women in themselves that it's been neat to watch them
what kind of wives you know
well do you do the do your daughters live close where you can go out
so we we spend a lot
and we play with the kids you know
where d- oh
they camp out and we spend weekends at the in the country with them quite a bit
but as far as doing any activity now that the grand kids are here we all just stay around the house mostly
boy i know especially when they grow up like that
so i'm trying to these last five or six years i'm trying to make them really special and uh very precious since that's uh about the only time we've got left
i i think so too
i hear mine saying well i remember mother and daddy used to take us to do so and so
i need to take my boys to do this or that you know
and i remember the year we went to disneyworld as quick as my kids are big enough we're going to go to disneyworld
i know i know they can't wait
so well i still got a few more years
so i'm uh i'm hanging onto those and doing as much activity as i can with them
and i work full time
so uh it it
and uh vacations are very special for us and activities
i imagine that they have uh some a lot of homework too
you know this being a school night and stuff
so uh it's it's in the same old y- you know routine of uh you know doing homework and you know trying to talk between all of that and and uh the other activities that we all have
well there's just so many things to do with them nowadays though
and especially if they're active kids
i i uh
i want to believe that that they really are trying to change that that maybe they are headed for a more democratic society
and i i want to believe it's all okay
but then there's that side of me that says
but they've put on faces before
and never to this extent though you know
so so it's like there is a struggle within me going do do i
you know i i trust people
or do i keep on going well we'll wait and see
well i think there's a a struggle within the soviet union
um i think the people are are just fed up
and i think it's showing
and all the republic is trying to gain their independence
and i think uh that's making gorbachev and others realize that hey maybe this communist thing isn't working
that's it's not just a mere- or uh western society telling you i- it's it doesn't work
you know they've always said you know the the soviet people were united
and maybe they are seeing that no no hey we don't believe this you know
it's still you know
well i don't know i want to trust them
and maybe it's because you know we've had our own propaganda over the years
well that that could be
we always we think of the k g b and we think such bad things you know
but i wouldn't doubt if the soviet people think c i a and they think such bad things you know
and they probably do the same things
they do you know
now the difference is we don't i i don't think we take people and kill them just because they don't believe what we believe
you know i think to that extent we don't go as far
but i'm sure they lie
and i think if we can get away from that or if we can keep that out of our minds
excuse me i've got a cold today
um i think if we can get that propaganda thing because i'm sure both countries are seeing seeing it you know thinking k g b and c i a and all that
but uh just on an economic point of view if the soviet union doesn't do something fast they are they ain't going to be able to feed their people this this winter you know
on the other hand i'm kind of getting fed up with uh our own country and presidency uh always concerning themselves with other nations' problems when we have so many at home yet
but i feel like we ought to be spending maybe the same time and effort and and energy into trying to solve our own or resolve our own
you know i mean you know any any country that wants to be democratic i'm all for helping them you know because i i understand that you know you are looking at the united states as the biggest and longest supporter of that type of government
but at the same time i i agree
i don't think we can do it and and just you know turn our backs or or be ignorant per se to the things that are happening here
you know we've got uh we've got quite a few domestic problems that uh that i feel we ought to be concentrating more on
i think the problem is you know
on the international scope maybe the president feels that uh you know for long-term relations with all these countries it's important
and well we'll we'll always have the united states
and you know we need to solve these international problems
but um i think i heard in the news about last week sometime that uh the president ended up canceling one of his international trips so he could spend more time on dem- on a domestic issue because the american public is kind of getting fed up with it
we we we believe in what he's doing abroad
but but like you said there's issues here too
and but i i am encouraged by what is happening in the soviet union
i'm encouraged by what's happened in you know the the iron curtain countries you know
in in that block
and and i think it's moved in the right direction
i i think sometimes people expect it to happen overnight
you know it's not going to
and it didn't happen here without a struggle
and i i think sometimes we forget that
but i i i i have to say yes i'm you know i'm encouraged by the way it's going uh
think uh i think in the long
so i'd like to know um what what do you do in lawn and garden
what uh what's what's of interest to you
and how do you go about it
well i have a town home
so i don't do a lot of regular maintenance
but i do have a large garden out in back
so we do a lot of
and then every year i grow a garden
oh you do you do actually uh grow a garden to produce food
so how much room do you have
um we have virtually no room out in front
and then in the back i'd say we have about an eighth of an acre and we pretty much fill it up with uh like i said perennials things that aren't don't have to fool with every year
but then i've got uh a twenty-five by twenty area that i do gardening
oh that's what i was curious about
i was wondering whether you had actually some of the flowers that you had planted were bulb type that you would dig up and and then put down your garden and then put them back in later or something like that
and last year was the first year we tried two new things
and we tried a watermelon
well tell me this uh lowell
do you en- do you enjoy doing that kind of work
and do you have the time to relax so that you can take advantage of it
so i don't mow grass or anything like that
so i think if i had a big home and a big lawn i'd i don't believe i would enjoy it
but just on the limited basis that i do it i do enjoy it very much
well i'm a little more fortunate i think from that point of view
and i moved here in state college quite a while ago and was fortunate to get some land
so actually i have nine acres
and uh for many years i grew sweet corn
uh and and my kids were there
and so we set up a shop there
and uh i would uh collect the corn very carefully ear by ear
and it was never more than one to two hours old
and people came from miles and miles around to get that corn because they knew it was individually picked and very very fresh
so we had a nice thing going there
and it was delicious
huh i really enjoyed that
and then i also have a a garden
oh it's probably uh twenty-five by thirty or forty something like that that i put in my normal food garden things each year
and uh i have a little bit of everything or a whole lot of everything in the
actually i love uh broccoli brussels sprouts
and i have all kinds of tomatoes kale and all those good things
and i rent out my field that i used to plant in sweet corn to a local farmer
and then he plants about a quarter of an acre of sweet corn for me to use
so i get out of that amount of work at any rate
well that's nice
it is it is very very nice
i i really enjoy it
uh and actually i had a pony there for twenty-five years
and he had two acres that he had for his own grazing
so he had his own backyard garden too
but that that worked out very nicely too
i built him a barn back there where in the part of my corn field
and he lived in that
but uh as far as gardening is concerned we do enjoy it
and we have you know an acre an acre and a half that the house is sitting in the middle of
and she has flower gardens and bulbs perennials and things
i have two or three uh apple trees
my neighbor has pear trees and um oh blueberries all kinds of food around there if we just had time to take advantage of it
and i have been totally engulfed with golden delicious apples
i just couldn't handle the the amount of them we got this year
well i bet you could answer a question for me
and they make delicious pies
i i like keep forgetting to make these calls
i just oh i just got mine last week
and i haven't started yet because i wanted to get one first see how it worked
well there are some kind of nice prizes
and it's worth doing it
and like i've said i've made four calls
and lot of times we don't answer the phone probably when i get mine early in the evening
well we're supposed to talk about movies
i have i was trying to think of the one i went to a couple of weeks ago
but i forgot it already
uh i haven't really seen one since probably august because uh every weekend in in the fall we go to our high school football game on friday then we go out with friends after
and that's kind of the our social for the
but oh i saw uh robin hood which i didn't care for
and my husband dragged me to it
i like i think kevin costner's a nice fellow
and he's nice looking
but he just to me is not a very dynamic actor
i did see that and i really enjoyed that
oh i do too
oh i i really enjoyed that
and my daughter went to see that one too
so it was fine for her so yeah
well that's right
so they've probably seen about everything at this point
well my daughter is twelve and we had a sleep over one night
they wanted to watch pretty woman which i have and i was hesitant
and they all had seen it anyway
we can see some pretty raunchy stuff on on just regular t v without cable or anything
you know there's no way to protect them any more
i i love julia roberts movies
but i didn't think they were great for my daughter
but it was a fun movie to watch
oh i love pretty woman
and then i like that one after that where oh
oh the scary one
oh i didn't see that
but that was so good
oh i like scary ones that are realistic
that that was
oh i don't know
they say it's really horrifyingly scary but uh i'd never get my husband to that
oh and my kids both saw that
and i watched it at a friend's house on video
and i was just
and it was still scary
he he likes mary poppins and things
and i like scary movies
i i really like a variety
oh i was going to s-
well my husband's from new jersey
and we lived there for five years when we first got married and so it sound kind of nice
i'm from long island so that's close you know
that's more related to new jersey than it is to like rochester new york those that kind of thing
it's it's different
well see the accents up there fascinated me because even in his family alone there were several different accents the way they would pronounce words differently
and and his family they lived in the same house there
and they were all from new jersey
and they lived you know
or they went in the service
and so they were together for all that time
but they still
their accents differed a little in the family so and it
uh in the sixties
i i just thought life would be
well sort of
but i was real familiar with texas
and i just thought you know we could probably get a better house
and life is a little slower a little easier
it is it is
he he really would never want to leave
so it worked out
so i like
it was because we're here eighteen years and you can imagine what plano was like eighteen years ago
oh i know
oh compared to new york oh
and they were
well i alternate between danielle steele
and uh then i try to go into one of the self improvement books
uh we we take books every once in a while in our sunday school class and go through them
uh i love scott peck and his road less traveled
oh it is it is wonderful
i i thoroughly enjoyed that
well uh i'm a tom clancy fan
and i read
i just finished a book on novelle netware uh
and uh i'm just finishing another one up on uh statistical sampling
so i do more work kind of related reading than uh just for enjoyment
i i try to keep a book going all the time
uh i try to read when i first wake up in the morning and then before i go to sleep
so i probably get oh thirty to fifty pages a day read
well that's pretty good
and i just you know
and i didn't want to put it down
but i like i like mysteries
i like uh uh oh
uh he wrote the uh bourne ultimatum
and uh i like jeffrey archer
what does he r- write
uh well i guess they're they're a type of mystery
so or he he's a lawyer who no longer practices
but his are all have some part of the law uh enveloped in them
so you kind of learn something as well as en- enjoy yourself
and then uh the new author that came out with uh oh the one that uh harrison ford starred in
it was the uh
what what time is it there ten thirty
uh it's nine thirty here
oh it's uh it was his first book
it came it was on the top of the list uh
uh presumed innocent
oh i haven't seen the movie uh or n- read the book
and then he's he came out with the second one
uh a sequel to it
and both of those i've enjoyed real well
but i i like that
and and you know if i want to get a fantasy and
is she is she kind of racy
her books uh
i mean it's it's always good for good tears
uh one book that she wrote that's good for both men and women is fine things
m- my mother-in-law's a real fan of hers
well it's it's one that's you know
it's it's always going to make you have a good cry
and you know it's going it turn out good
and you're going to be happy in the end
oh well that's nice
and i said you know
i want i want happy fantasy
uh you mentioned sunday school ladonna
uh do you
uh i i do my share of it
i i certainly can't say that i understand a lot of it
but uh that's always a challenge
so do you do
i guess uh tonight's topic is about uh personal computers and level of interest and uh and your your expertise
well let's let's fire away
uh well brian
well first of all
why don't you why don't we why don't you do about thirty seconds
and i'll do thirty seconds
and then we can work off of there
real real fine
uh first of all uh yes
uh i do own a p c here at home
and i also have one at the office
and my level of interest is quite high with p c
and i was really i am really interested in them however not to the extent as i was about uh two years ago when i basically knew about everything there was to know about different things
and that was the time when we were shopping for one
and i think we got a top of the line at that time
but uh as you know p c change quite rapidly
and the technological advances kind of outdated our p c where i can get the same p c i got two years ago at the fraction of the cost
and i also enjoy using ours at home
and we use it for a a number of different things
plus i get in a lot an awful lot of good use of one at work where i work
lot of uh analytical uh testing reviews uh lot of different things i use it at h- at work
so i enjoy p c
and they they make my w- life and my work a lot easier
well uh since uh
well i guess since this time last year i've changed uh jobs within the firm i'm with
and these are the big mamas i e sons uh hewlett packards uh uh sor- uh
and and uh we have uh two p c here
we have uh an x t
and then recently we we made a the command decision to go ahead and get uh the absolute top of the line because spouse is a uh programmer
and so we got one that that could do enough uh and you know hold three different o s
as far as dos uh unix and uh o s two
i'm learning t- i'm learning to be uh one who knows what's he's doing but expert
oh well well
i frown on that that term because uh too many people s- you know uh misuse the word
i'd rather say i'm i i am continually learning
but my area m- my level of expertise is increasing almost daily
well that's great be-
and uh yeah
so i've got a p c and a work station at work
and i and we have two p c here w- at home
a lot of the the the new mama we're uh
i've got aldus and uh micrographics on it as far as uh technical publishing
and we do a quite a bit of church work with ours
you know some
i i i've found that uh the more we do with it uh
and the lord's just pleased that we're kind of
this is this is part of giving back a portion of what he's given to us
so uh i don't mind because seems like the more we do there's there's the more stuff that's uh available that comes along and so forth
so uh rather than being niggardly and and chintzy uh we've just said you bet boss seeing as he was the one that uh
because the top of the line we've got
well we've got a compatible
eight meg of ram and and two two two hundred and eleven hard drives
like i said we bought a real steam steam burner
uh mainly because of spouse's unix because unix takes a a c- a well four megs minimum of ram
and then uh it it it likes to live on about a hundred and fifty megabyte hard drive
so the next size up was a two hundred and eleven
and so rather than just have one we went ahead and got two
uh at some point in time i'm going to do the mirroring uh experiment to where one disk mirrors the other for fault tolerance
and uh oh speak speak of the angel she just walked in
well good for her
so uh uh
she's she's a squirrel for uh uh contractor out at american airlines
well she probably needs that kind of a powerful type of a machine to do her work
you ready to discuss the the topic
and one that i think is quite fascinating because uh couple of years ago i guess uh
not very not very long ago seemed like the whole world not just the united states but the whole world was kind of in a standstill where everyone was basically in uh you know a very comfortable position so to say even though the the cold war was was in full swing you know
and in the last couple of years things have changed dramatically not only on the political front but also on the economic front where uh couple of years ago we had uh america was one of the leading powers and one of the strongest nations in the world as far as economics were concerned
and now we're having a very tough time in a recessionary period
and uh and that's kind of frightening
also you know a couple of years ago ten fif- fifteen ten fifteen years ago an individual going into a career could expect to have that career basically throughout their whole life
and thirty years ago that was that was basically it whereas now we're expected to have a career change every you know every couple of years and possibly fi- four to five career changes throughout our lifetime
and so i think uh you know things
and of course i look at the economic problems in the united states right now
i think the other kind of changes like job changes and those kinds of things i mean i think it's great to even have three or four different careers in your life
some of that opportunity for job change in the fact that that aspects changing
and the uncertainty of whether you're going to have a job is not as good
but the fact that you really can make major changes in your life and jobs
well do do you think that's good or bad
they they're very comfortable
and they in a sense become unteachable
they think they know all there is to know in the area set path and you know
and when that's over with that's that's it without even giving a second thought to advancing their education or getting extracurricular um education
and and i think that's an excellent opportunity for us to expand ourselves also
i think one of the problems with with education as it relates to this though is that i don't know that education is prepared to help people make those changes
but i believe that uh an individual should really learn how to to learn
learn how to grow in the in their college or whatever education they might take
well that that's good
there probably needs to be some training on how to to to adjust to these changes as they come about
i mean if you look at the the high unemployment rate right now
so it seems to me that while those changes are taking place maybe we're not well preparing people to make the changes with them
i i read a few articles off in the newspaper and some publications
and it affects
well nancy what do you think um some of the changes in roles of women are in american society in the past generation or two
well of course working
well what do you think it is
i also think that there are more um
i know my mother and her sister were both married by the time they were twenty and i waited until i was thirty-two
you know um i know that
and so i really do see what you're saying there
and now our care plans look more like thirty-two thirty-three and if we get somebody twenty-one we go oh look how young
and we have a lot of first time moms in their late thirties and even forties
so it's true
but again i guess it probably does go back to the same thing of women having careers
uh it just seems like there are more single mothers too
i mean that's
there're a lot of either divorced or um you know never been married
well what do you think have been the most significant changes in the past generation or so
well just that
the the role in the family
and the mother doesn't stay home and cook the dinner take care of the children um
and i know that there's a lot more participation by the fathers
but i still think the mothers have the major role
i think they're just they're not doing very much less
i don't think as far as the kids and and the house and everything are concerned not from what i see and and they're contributing to the income besides
i think that we're really really putting a lot of stress on ourselves
oh it is
and it really it's affecting the families you know for mothers not not to be home and yet you know um
i mean i i don't blame anybody when they have to work
it's it's difficult
and i think that
so it's a very wealthy town
and we're not part of that
and i think what i see a lot of parents a lot of mothers working just for bigger and better and i really hate that you know
and i i've been here for a very long time but um i don't know
and i don't have a choice any more but i used to just work occasionally for extra money
but now i have to work all the time and that's really hard and and i don't know how a mother does just choose to go out to work and and leave the kids
in a way it's good it's very good to get out with adults
and i think that's a good thing if you can do it part time
but to just go out there forty hours a week at least and and work and and leave your kids to get home from school alone and that kind of thing i think that's not very smart
well what do you think's going to happen in the next generation
well it's going to be interesting
but i'm not sure how it's going to because you see young people today and wonder how in the world they'll ever afford to buy a home and and to raise a family
and so i don't know how it can change to where the mother can get back into the home again
i don't that ever will go backwards but i don't know what effect it's going to have on these kids now when they grow up how they're going to feel about it
it you know it could lead to another woodstock
and and maybe these kids will really resent that their parents are out there working for things and they might want to do without things rather than do that to their families
i don't know how many you know what percentage but some are will move back toward more traditional lifestyle of staying home with the children
and and they get you know
people chide them for it you know
and i've pressed the button
see now that is where i want to go
is it is it uh
and she couldn't stand it any more
she moved out because she said the whole island was uh you know being taken over by the japanese
well there is there is a lot of japanese over there
and they are
and she uh also told me that
well not her uh necessarily other people that have been there have said that it is too commercialized
uh well yeah
but there is still a lot of beautiful places to go and see
on all of the islands you know
but it is still beautiful
oh well i will you know
well what is the most uh you know the nicest island
uh i like maui
i think that is what usually people uh say they do they like the best
well i like it because the beach is nice and white
and you know it is like oahu
and it is really nice
but uh kauai
i mean the beaches are nice
but i don't know just not nice as maui
and then uh where where have you been
oh you have
oh uh eighty-six
oh well that is right near piedmont
well she was in berkley also
and she lets see i went when she was uh was living
well when i went out there she was in uh now i can't oh lafayette
and then they moved to
so i uh i haven't seen uh you know her house in piedmont
but but i loved san francisco
you know we did the whole bit
and we went to carmel
and we took the eighteen mile drive
oh it is beautiful
and they wanted to take that drive
and they had closed the whole road because of uh uh fog
oh the weather
well i have also been to the carribean
oh i haven't been there either
well i uh have been there a couple of times
oh that is nice
and we really had a good time
well they they had this cruise director dress up like santa claus
and we went to the beach
and they had put a christmas tree on the beach decorated it up
it was it was a lot of fun
well that's nice
is uh a cruise nicer than uh if you just go on a regular uh you know to a hotel
because you don't have to worry about unpacking or anything like that you know
oh you will have to go on one
i mean there was
some people did uh on that last cruise that we took because they was having a storm come in but that is unusual
uh one of my sisters got sick
but the other one didn't
and i didn't
but uh it is really nice
and they they just do so many things for you you know to make you enjoy the trip and everything
so you will have to do that once
but i want to go to alaska
now someone i know was on a cruise to alaska
and i was thinking you know cruise i am thinking
and she is laying on the beach
and i said well you are not very tan for someone who has been on a cruise
and uh that that i would like to go
well hawaii is my uh is number one
and get a
oh i think i would like to too
i keep hoping to win the lottery where i can do all these things you know
oh well see i am am just in the publisher's clearing house and the reader's digest because we don't uh
okay well what do you think about the government providing health insurance for everybody
and they closed
but um for me to try to get it now it would cost me like over three hundred dollars a month with the same company that was providing health insurance at at p i e
and i think you know i think uh
god the government should come up with some kind of a health plan or stop these doctors and hospitals from having their prices so high
well i wonder if they couldn't just provide uh interim health insurance for people who are between jobs like that
well the thing is you know jobs are so hard to find you know
anyhow in the valley where i live at now they don't want to pay anything for health insurance at all
no benefits you know um
you mean the uh the employers
i mean you get a job now and the wages are really low
and they don't want uh
so you just you know pray to god that you don't get sick
well i used to think that universal health insurance was probably the right thing to do
i i have to think about it some more now because my doctor is uh actually he's canadian and uh he told me that there're a lot of uh lot of counts against the canadian system which is basically the one people are talking about for here
he says it restricts your choice of doctors and and so forth
i mean we're on a private insurance plan right now uh actually i have my own business
and and we
and uh and every year we get another list of what doctor's we can go to and where we can buy our medicine
and uh it changes every year
well i know the plan that i had with p i e i could go to any doctor
and i could go to any drug store and get my prescriptions filled you know
then i just sent cards in and then they would have like a ten dollar deductible per year for my medicine
and then they would just send me a check for what was ever over that you know
of course the restricted choice in this case is because only certain doctors agree to accept the uh the limits of uh compensation
but of course that is restricted choice
so i don't think that the restricted choice really uh has to do with the difference between uh public and private health insurance
i think it has to do with the the the uh attempt to limit cost doesn't it and everybody agrees that we need to limit cost some way
well um i guess the most sensible thing i've heard about this is they say people are trying
you you have to recognize that if you're going to
and if you want to pay less then you're going to have to settle for a health system that is not quite that uh lavish
but there's just so many people that can't afford to pay anything you know
but it is it does seem to be a big problem you know
but um i sure wish they would come up with with something
and uh like i say
and and i'm at the age too where the
and the people don't want to hire people this age any more
they'll be needing you in a couple of years because they're running out of kids down that the other end
they'll be calling at my door huh
well if they're smart
now i i do think the government though is going to have to do something uh with this problem because it you know even to go to a little doctor out here just to
and then he
then that's not counting what medicine you're going to buy and everything else you know
and he might tell you well you know now you're going to have to come back in a week
and then that's another forty bucks plus whatever else he decides to do to you
okay bill um
well i own the company
so uh i guess uh i determine what the benefits are
but uh so what are you asking me
what what benefits i think are most important
well what what do you think of the
what do you think are the most important benefits for those working for you other than other than their present salary
um i'd say in today's economy besides basic benefits uh such as um health insurance and life insurance and the some type of retirement plan i'd say that uh most of the employees uh um that we have really like a a profit sharing plan
they like to participate in the profits of the company like they're you know
because they feel like well we're contributing to it
so we'd like to participate in it
and so that means i make a little bit less
but the thing is that really you make a little more because everybody has a interest in in it working
i think most people uh don't want money um
it's been my experience most people want uh to feel like they're participating in something that uh that is not a drudgery you know that they enjoy and that they can get some benefits out of
and it's a contribution
well bill uh that idea fits me exactly
i just retired from uh the university here
and that's been the goal in my life was to contribute and to the work that i was doing in my research
and that's what made me happy
and uh that's the type of goal i think most people ought to look for
and i'm sure a lot of them don't
well uh our people get a lot of satisfaction
um we're a financial planning firm
how many uh
but anyway uh uh we do we deal with a lot of people that are retired or trying to retire
but they like to have enough to be comfortable
well what what changes would you have you considered uh in doing it to to your company that might benefit the employees or perhaps the company itself better
well um we considering instead of tying a profit sharing plan to a a salary is uh is tie um uh a percentage um of business that uh that a person would participate and bring into the company
uh pay them uh based on the percentage of business they bring instead of based on their salary
and the re-
when you say bring in do you mean that they negotiated with people to to come in and uh ask for your support
um it can be in-house people who help you handle x amount of dollars
well see we have dif- we have marketing people
and then we have financial planners
and uh then we have uh staff secretaries and administrative assistants
and these secretaries and administrative assistants um you know if we don't have their cooperation and they're not participating in the profit of the company they they can get very dissatisfied very quickly
and so uh we're thinking about paying them instead of a percentage on salary paying them a percentage on the business they handle
so administrative assistant that would handle two million dollars worth of business is a lot more valuable than a person that handles a hundred thousand dollars worth of business
but it it might not be necessarily because he did a good or bad job
but it might be whether the locality there those people want that kind of support
well and and but to
see the thing is that they give support to the financial planner that they're the assistant to or that they usually have several people they report to that you know that they work together with it encourages them not to uh complain when they realize that they get a part of the of the action based on their efforts and not based on being sitting back saying well make me do it
see we don't want anybody around here that says make me do it
i don't think anyb- any i think most people want to be lack of better term- terminology they want to be self-employed
but they don't want to take the risk
but they also want to be somewhat content to go and come as they please without some real strict adherence
actually i'm in
and the big thing up here of course is the twins uh
it's it's pretty pervasive
but uh actually i don't know how much of the world series you caught last year
but that was a lot of fun
well of course it was fun for you
and i'm going back at the end of next month
uh orlando florida
so i'm not exactly a real twins fan from birth or anything
i was born and raised in uh near miami and uh spent the last twenty years in dallas uh where the rangers played
and uh for the last uh what year roughly year i've been in san francisco where there are two teams the oakland a and the san francisco giants
uh but honestly you know i uh i do my duty and watch the sports on uh
the newscasts but that's about all the exposure i have to sports
i haven't followed it real closely at all uh except like i said last year when the world series rolled around i did i did follow that pretty religiously
went out into the bars you know drank a beer watched the game had a gir- a good time that way
well i guess the uh san francisco giants and the oakland a were like the leading teams a couple of years ago
well i th-
well i don't know
um and uh i don't know
what is the prognosis for uh this year
uh real good as far as i can tell
i i assume that means good for the minnesota
uh as far as the twins are concerned it seems to be real good
uh my roommate went and saw them play on their season opener a couple of nights ago
and they they won that one seven to one
so uh that's pretty good i guess
but i think it probably was the the train
well i don't know
i i i don't even know uh who has been winning in uh as far as the uh san francisco giants and the oakland a
but i think they both won their opener
i uh sort of gathered that in my uh subliminal memory
i've actually got a friend that's living in san francisco right now
uh he's doing the same thing i'm doing which is basically uh an internship
we we're both doctoral students
and he's doing his with i b m
and i'm doing mine with honeywell
but uh i i think he kind of follows the sports
and i think he's mentioned
uh he may have watched them and seemed to think that they were pretty good
and in the major leagues i guess there is a couple of different divisions
and then of course there's the minors
uh i don't know
i i guess i'm one of those people that if i really made a concentrated effort i could really probably get into baseball
uh but i was talking to my roommate a couple of nights ago right after that game
and he offered you know to take me to one of the games because apparently he'd bought uh he and four other people from honeywell had bought a seat or a row of seats actually for the home games
but the thing is there's like eighty-six home games per year
so there's no no way that you can ever use them all
you know that's just the home games
and i i thought it was a mistake
but he goes no
well they must play every day then
and that's you know
and that's lord that's uh over five months worth
well you yo- if you if you consider it the season starts
and it ends with the world series which usually takes place i believe in december or january
it did last we- year didn't it
or was it november
i know it was doggone cold up here uh
i think you you don't know all that much more than i do about baseball
well i know for sure it was
and and it was at least two months after i got up here
so it had to be november anyway
well i i know uh the super bowl
or you want salary too plus what
well as far as tangible benefits go i would say that uh health insurance of all forms is probably my next most important concern
i feel that a company that can provide good health benefits such as health care dental and vision as well as good long-term and short-term disability plans uh goes a long way toward satisfying my needs
well i'll tell you
i've uh i'm not working right at the moment
but the company that i did work for
but uh man i think those medical benefits are the most important uh
you you really don't realize how important they are until you find yourself on the other side of the fence without them and having to cover your own medical
and uh you can quickly see where they become a very important part of your your compensation package
uh i should knock on wood
i haven't you know had any serious health problems or anything
and it was only for a cold you know
and they can't really do anything for you anyhow
so you might as well not even go
they look at you say well you're still breathing so uh
oh you've got a cold
go home and take uh liquids and uh rest
uh that is definitely the most important
uh pension i guess is next
uh thank god that i had one
i don't know what happened to the salary employees when uh the company went bankrupt
so mine was being put into a like a trust fund you know
so but i don't know if they ever got anything or if they lost all of theirs
i really feel sorry for all those people that spent all that time there you know
uh i work for a little start-up company here in pittsburgh called trans ark uh
we do uh distributive system software for unix based workstations so
i i worked for a trucking company p i e nation wide
oh does she really
oh how about that
i see uh
after the merger uh you see a lot of ryder pie stuff on the road
well you did
so did did ryder get out of the business
well ryder and p i e went together you know
and then then that ended it
it's it started i think a little bit before that
when p i e and and ryder went together why that was downhill from then on you know
and the the problem with that is you know when you leave a job you can continue your benefits for some finite period of time
but when when the company goes bankrupt i mean the they're just cut off completely
and you're responsible for your own
and and that's exceedingly expensive
but three hundred and fifty dollars a month
god that's terrible
so but anyhow uh and jobs aren't that hard to find to get another one that does pay your benefits you know
and a lot of them that
they're starting to to cut back especially start-ups
i know here at trans ark we get uh we get health care
and that's it
i mean there's no dental or vision
and the the short-term disability policy is is a ninety day policy
and there is no long-term disability policy
so you know at least in the case of this particular company they tend to scrimp a little bit there
and you know of course they can use the excuse
well we're start-up
god there's been big articles in the paper about that
uh you know they claim a back injury
and then someone goes out and spies on them
and they're lifting refrigerators into trucks and and everything else you know
so i don't know what's happening and what's going to happen
well that certainly doesn't help matters any
i mean you you get people who are willing to put their neck on the line to get you you know these additional benefits
well uh no
i don- i don't get as much exercise as i as i should as or as i would like to uh uh these days
uh i have in the past uh jogged and and run
and every every january and every september i start out again
and then it tapers off
uh what about you
uh i started about two years ago because i gained some weight over the past few years
and i wanted to get it back off and i was going through a divorce
and i just found that running really made me feel good
and i ran on the treadmill and rode the bike
and uh i felt really good
and it was really helpful at the time
now when i do those things they're boring
and so i just recently discovered jazzercise about two months ago
and i'm getting to be a good dancer from it
and i'm just feeling really good
so i'm really into that
well now that is that uh that's related to the the aerobic uh
it is it's aerobics
but it's with dance steps
and it's an hour straight
and it's just uh it's a lot of fun
and i'm i'm getting much better
well uh okay
and i've been doing a lot of bike riding outside with the nice weather we've been having
and i just enjoy that much more too than inside
do do you like to do it wi- with other people
i mean like the the jazzercise would be
and so we go bike riding
and it's nice
so i've enjoyed that part of it
and at the gym even in the class uh i w- e-
everybody's on their way to someplace and so you know i do have one friend who goes occasionally
but basically i do it by myself in a group of maybe forty
but still there are there are other people there doing the doing the same thing
there are there are
uh that makes a difference doesn't it
when when i have
and and kno-
not with the sense that it was uh uh chore or something that i was having to do
i i've really enjoyed just the activity
and so getting out and being active uh is uh uh helps out
the ch- the chan- the change of pace and just getting out and around
and i find that i can often you know
often uh when i get around to doing it then i i feel better when i get back to work and uh uh also that that it my subconscious is working on things while i'm working and i i go back
and i've got new ideas
and i think that it's just is good for your self-esteem for everything because when you look better you feel better
and it's just uh
now i've learned to do that and you know and it's i think it just benefits you all around
i think that's uh i think that's a good term d- demanding the time for yourself
that you've just got to you've just got to prior-
but i just i don't demand a lot for myself
and so you know i just feel entitled to it
and i take it
well uh uh have you have you done any jogging
i tell you you said you did on the bike and on the treadmill in in the uh club
but i find that when you do that you do more chatting than you do exercise
and that's not really beneficial
so uh i don't have time like that
and i spend enough time chatting around
uh read any good books lately
i i've read uh several good books lately
uh lot of them related to uh business and financial matters since that's what i do for a living
uh well i'm in graduate school
and so i read a lot of books
but i don't know if i consider very many of them good
uh i haven't read a book for enjoyment since i guess around christmas
and at christmas break i read uh sarum by uh uh a fellow named rutherford
uh it's the history of uh
well it's sort of the his- the historical fiction about uh the salisbury area in in england
and so i i really enjoyed that book a lot
uh he's not quite as good as you know michener or some of uh some of the other historical writers
but he he did this job well
well that sounds good
uh do you find th- do you find you have much chance to read for for just pleasure or mostly for business
well it's a book about
uh uh greek gods and and greek uh mythology as well as uh man and interacting with other men and a book about uh men and how they mature through life
and how they deal with life itself
but it's uh it's all revolved around uh mythology
uh as far as uh traditions from uh other cultures and our culture
and how we uh interact with one another
did did it have something to mention about uh sort of uh cultural rituals of of manhood
i have uh someone suggested that i read it
and uh it's a very interesting book
uh what are your favorite uh
do you have a favorite subject to read whether it be science fiction or or history
well it depends again if we're talking about
uh just because i have an interest in that area
and i read a lot of books in the area of uh uh psychology and self-help type uh materials
uh always trying to understand people better and understand myself in relation to other people and try to understand where the people are coming from because i'm in a people business
and uh so that that's
uh who is your whose your favorite religious author
well i don't know if i have a favorite uh religious author
i would have to say that uh some of the ones that consistently put out good materials
uh you know
that that's difficult because
uh i had to stop here and think a second
and i thought that each one of his books were good
uh he's a great man
i've met him several times uh
uh i'd say another which is a local writer here in plano uh is uh
and that is uh
but i can't
i mean i see him
but i can't see his name
but he uh he talks about uh he talks about a lot of different topics
um what kind of hobbies do you have
well i um i do cross-stitch
and i enjoy reading and playing softball
i uh i started knitting awhile ago
i didn't know even know what the stitch is called
i just had this uh uh piece of yarn
and i wanted to start something
so i remembered something i learned i think when i was five years old
and now i have a little blanket
but that's all i've done
well i know that i learned how to knit one time and um made a few things
but i haven't done it in so long that i probably wouldn't remember how
well if i remember i think we made some like christmas stockings
you could make the like the granny squares or whatever
and she makes a lot of afghans and all that kind of stuff
um i like to sing
oh well that's good
um right now my actual job is a news reporter
but uh if i could do anything i wanted to do it would be to sing professionally
so are you on the t v then
i'm in uh
and so i do little news reports and things
so you don't have too much time for hobbies
um my day is usually pretty full
but i could be at work from anytime you know from nine until nine at night or ten or whatever
so it's hard to make plans much less you know have a hobby
and even if i had a hobby like knitting or something and i wanted to take it to work i'd probably never get to it
so what do you do
so unless the kids are asleep i don't get usually get much done either
but i've made a um few things cross-stitch things
and um i made uh like stockings for both my children and a christmas tree shirt and that
and it just takes a long time to get it done
but you know once you've done something like that it kind of makes you feel good to to see it
i show- i showed mine to my boyfriend
and he was like you didn't make that
it looks uh halfway decent
so um have you sang at any weddings yet
um it was my first wedding
i've done um little commercials and background singing
and um i sang all through college and things like that
but i really haven't done anything really professional per se
but i did one wedding last year
and uh i just now got some cards together kind of uh business cards that say
and what does it say a song makes beautiful wedding or something
and i've been passing them out to different wedding shops
i mean when someone comes in
oh that's a good place
you know for a wedding for a wedding dress
and they they might ask about it
this one woman even wanted me to bring my tape in because i have a demo tape you know if any one wants to listen
and uh she wanted me to bring it in
well that's good
but i only just put them out this week
hopefully i'll get some calls in especially now since this it's spring
and it's the wedding season i guess
oh that's true
make your hobby into a business that would be pretty good huh
but i'd love it
i've never i've never had uh formal training
i try you know
and um when i was at u t i was in a group called ensemble one oh nine just twelve singers
and we did uh little conventions and um uh like dinner parties and things like that
well that's nice
so that's what got me really really interested in it
so i'm trying to be sensible sensible too at the same time
but uh i think
i either have a call or
but um i think we are suppose to talk for ten minutes
and i thought that the man told me five minutes
so i don't know
but uh okay
well it was nice talking to you
and and good luck with your hobbies
uh you want to start by telling me what camping is to you
well uh a little bit uh
noth- nothing overly strenuous
the majority of my camping experience is uh a tent by the lake type situation or uh maybe a canoe trip or something like that
oh it it's
we've had a lot of fun uh
i i moved to dallas about five years ago
and we've made three different trips since i've been here the group of friends that i run around with of varying degrees uh of difficulty
the the last one we did and we haven't had a chance to duplicate was uh was a canoe trip in arkansas
and the river was it was up about three feet
so it was uh it was pre- it was pretty challenging
oh man i imagine
but uh and then we uh
as far as the camping part of that we just drag along all our tents and sleeping bags and uh find uh find a clearing in the woods and go for it
so they'll actually fit in the canoe
and then you go for days at a time
that that particular one was a two day trip
so what uh
there's uh there's a outfitter
and uh they haul you up to the headwaters come down about halfway and then you get to you spend the night
and then uh the second day head on down to the to the pool at the end of the river
god that sounds like fun
it it really is
well the camping i grew up with was like tents and coleman stove type
and uh you know that just either out in the woods or
actually i i grew up water skiing
i was uh from california
and so we would go up to the sacramento uh river sloughs the delta there
and you just pick a campground on the river
if it got you know over a hundred and ten degrees you went over the levee and jumped in the water
but uh when i got married my husband had always backpacked
and so we did that uh
i guess we haven't done it since my kids were born so about three years ago
and that was a new experience for me
but i enjoyed it
boy i bet
or you know where the trail didn't necessarily lead and where you couldn't necessarily pitch a tent
but uh that that was interesting
i i have always wanted to do some white water rafting
and so your canoeing kind of made me think of that
that's that was uh that's always been our next step
our our little group of friends here we've been kind of getting married off and what not
well it it just puts a damper on things for a little while
but we're we're starting to get everybody back together
we'd like to do a float trip down uh oh like big bend area or something like that
so you haven't done that before
my parents uh were sailing uh this last year down off uh costa rica
and they took about two weeks and went into
but they went white water rafting
and mom said it was absolutely just a wonderful experience
and you know i
there's that sense of it you know you're kind of scared that risk of like gosh what could happen and then the thrill of you know the excitement of doing it
well do you have anything planned for this summer
um not really just yet
well i i do have uh a little bit of property
and i've got a piece of property in minnesota that is completely undeveloped as of yet
there's uh there's a little lake up there
and uh a group of friends that i i went to college with um got together
and we basically own all the land around this little lake there
oh i imagine
so we've got a private lake
and it's completely undeveloped at this point
so that's a possibility
and the weather is typically always nice up there in the summertime
it it's it's about two hours north of minneapolis
oh that doesn't that sounds good
so uh yeah
in fact uh uh
well i got married last summer
and uh that's that's
we ended up there for a couple days uh on our honeymoon
we kind of took uh a tour of the united states for about a week
and uh up through that area
but uh my wife's real excited about it
so we're uh we're going to hope to get up there sometime early eno-
and it was a little too late for the fish
but uh hopefully get up there early enough to to get into some of the some of the fish and uh the the good weather and what not
uh my oldest child is a girl was born three years ago three and a half
and then i have a little one that just turned two
and we are in the process of potty training
i didn't want to go camping with diapers you know
and and you know at a time when they're afraid of their shadow all they need is you know some skunk or something to rub up the outside of the tent
so but i think with him almost potty trained and you know she's not afraid of her shadow anymore that i'm i'm hoping and crossing my fingers that we'll be able to go uh this summer you know even if it's like over to rio dosa for a couple of days
or something to get them used to it and get them started uh with little back packs of their own
and you know things like that
we'll that you know
and there's a lot of places with uh like nature trails
well that's true
you know it's like okay this this is this is what uh a pheasant looks like you know
and okay now we'll go look for one
ugh i would need that before i could teach them
ever- everybody might learn something that way
but uh but yeah
there is there's an awful lot of things set up you know just any anything you want to do
like like you say it can be uh a water ski trip or fishing trip or just a sightseeing bird watching you know hunt hunt with a camera type of thing
or there's a lot of different opportunities for things like that
but this is
but education in public schools
i have a son who's graduating uh in may
and there's some interesting problems of of of how d- you how do you challenge the kids today
and i have some real hang-ups
i think that uh if your if your kid's not ambitious he can sure get lost
and i teach in dallas
well i have a daughter that's in the in
and my husband teaches with plano
uh do your kids go to garland high you said
well there's a
over to uh to north garland for ninth grade
but at north garland the the difficulty i see with the education system is that uh is that you can you can you can get some masses
but unless if the kid's really dedicated it seems like they do all right
but if if if your child is just pressing along uh
well you know the the the thing that i don't see and maybe you would take issue with it is that if if we went to if there was an opportunity for teachers to teach year around
i know when you get the kids that have gone the summer being out of school then it's like they've lost so much ground we spend at least the first six weeks just backing up reteaching what they had the year before you know
well how do we accom- how do we get that
well we're starting pilot schools
and richardson's supposed to start some pilot schools going to school year around
and then we you know we investigated this by flying some people out from dallas to observe some of the schools in california that already had it
and one thing it'll save us money because we've got the buildings sitting there
and we might as well use them
well what about the what about the issue of air conditioning
isn't that a s- an area of concern in the cost of air conditioning
well air conditioning what's and and heating
like if we get in the thirties we raise it up to the seventies
it's it's less degree days
but i think i think
and it's not like the kids are going to go a lot longer
really if you go year around there's not thirty days difference
w- well how do they do it
do they put uh long
like i i think going two six weeks and then having two two weeks off each after a two six weeks period is one way
from from what you've seen is that the desirable way to do it
see i don't know because i've never seen it in action
oh you said you had some people from california
oh i thought you
but you didn't go
but i think i'd like it
and i know a lot of teachers that would like to try it
well the the other issue has to that i hear that the local commentator i listen to some the idea that the numbers of administration and the fact that the principal
the principal's their t- hands are tied by all the administrators
and i heard that in dallas it's one out of every three is actually in the classroom of the educators that were hired
well i had heard that one of the comments when they when they brought it
um then why the
the one they brought in the new superintendent for dallas schools the admini- um
but the idea yeah that he had suggested that that maybe they could reduce the number of administrators and and some of the people who were administrators saying that that uh that's not what he was hired for
but they resented the fact that he would try to save some costs there
well you know he did supposedly cut administrators
but what they've done is create other offices for those same people and just rehi- renamed their jobs and you know opened up n- other n- other things
and they've hired all these administrators in on that you know
well you know the other thing that bothers me is the amount of money that it tak- that it took to contest the the football um issue
but the i can't think of the name of the school
that that uh
but in any event they they they kept arguing
and they went to court
i mean i- you know
guess i i'm sympathetic with the kids
but but how much money did that cost dallas to to to fight that in court
and all the things that dallas fights costs thousands probably millions of dollars i bet you
but just think of all the the all the lawyers you've kept employed
and and all these other people are out running around
so but you need to keep all these people employed
you mean you mean we need a little more of our tax money like maybe uh
now that's sad when there's supposed to be what you know one thousand what sixty-five dollars something like that spent on each pupil
um it's it's wrong
anyway i was thinking about
and i think in nineteen uh ninety-three we're supposed to begin that
if if a child is a visual learner we're supposed to present him with all these visual things
and if he has to learn just by kinesthetic we're supposed to teach whatever way that that child has to have it learns the best way
and that's going to be quite a problem
but if we could do something like that i'm sure it would certainly help
um that's interesting
and how many administrators is that going to take
and you know at nongraded schools
i i teach chapter one
and it's for kids that have fallen behind in their reading according to like i t b s scores
and some of the kids really they shouldn't be in there
and they're you know they're not being challenged
and they're not being challenged in their home
and we always have to teach toward the middle of the road
well that's that's part of where my son is um would like to go to rice
but i don't think he's
well the the difficulty is is is the people that get in are are are overachievers
and he's not an overachiever
but the same time everybody can't go
the question of of you know of how far should you take a kid in the motivation
i had a a friend that was administrator in richardson said if the parents read books then the kids probably would read books
but that a lot of the schools i would think the kids you're talking to question of of how much reading do those kids' parents do
well but that's the point as i would say uh and that is that's what makes
but anyway um i'm trying to think how much longer
and we got carried away
and they cut
and i didn't know that there was even a cut off or anything
oh another things that's wrong with schools
and we're going to do that until at least the first part of may
well see that's in the garland schools
they i don't think they have to do that because most everybody passes
but see that
and unfortunately the uh that's that's tough
but see what we're doing is we're turning these kids off to school even more than they are
and we're not teaching toward the test
we're teaching you know
i always objected you know
it's like there's not a whole lot of you know fun time like we used to have in school
like our principal says i want every child to be on task all the time
and you can't do that as adults
but we're expecting kids to
and like after after recess play we don't get that
if they finish before their thirty minutes is up then they can go out and play for like maybe five or ten minutes probably be the most
but we always got that
you know our s- son had that
he was had an attention deficit disorder
and they were keeping him from recess
and in reality that's uh that's one of those really tough situations
but people like if more people like you though that understand the problems get in and and change some education
so uh i got some background noise there
but i guess
well i uh before i was married i used to play a lot of sports
and uh but when i got married
so i haven't done a lot of uh exercise on purpose
well it's funny
and i found a bathing suit that i had bought
so yesterday i went to uh a spa
i belong to a private spa and went in and and got with a trainer
and uh he checked body fat content and we set up a program for me to work on
and i went back tonight also
oh that's good
so i've been two nights in a row
and i i'm going to take it pretty seriously
i'm going to start going every night just you know
even if i i
like tonight i only went for thirty minutes
but i at least did something
like is it the weight machines or aerobics or what is it
last night i did about thirty minutes of riding a bike and a few like three different types of uh uh weight lifting for my legs and and my hips and then i did a hour of aerobics
and that was really tough
oh i bet
and i was sore this morning when i got up
but then tonight i got into a a
it's sort of like an aerobics class but it's only thirty minutes
and it's for your abdominals your thighs and your butt
so and that was
well that's good
so are you moti-
well i like i am undisciplined in the sense that i can't just go and do exercise
but i like to uh play tennis and play racquetball i i like to get exercise when i'm playing a game of some sort
and so that's always been the way that i have kept myself in uh the shape that i was satisfied with at least
and uh then i have given that up
but uh i would really like to start that again because i am now you know not in a position that i like myself
and i get you know
you're easily tired and so that has made me
but i i'm not the kind of person that could go to a spa and work out
if something like uh
i mean i have so many chores and so many obligations every day for to add another obligation would make me feel stressed
and i wouldn't enjoy it
but if i have something some team sport or some activity then it's kind of like having fun
and then you then you get some of the uh good exercise and some of the desired results
but you you're doing it for fun
but i really admire people who can go and work out
well i don't you know
i have a girlfriend that goes for the social aspect of it and she walks around talks to people
naturally i'm married so my husband goes a lot
and we'll go and and just do what we want to do and then leave
well that's nice
and swimming is a is a part that i i'd like to get into as far as my
so i'd like to try that as well
and that's probably something that that you could do you know family included
and it's fun
and kids enjoy that and
and also the nice thing about belonging to a club is that you can have some of the relaxation you know like saunas or
they have that kind of is kind of makes it fun and stuff you know
well i guess it's getting late
and i should take off
but uh i appreciate that
that helped me helped motivate me
well try it
or or maybe just exercise at home
and i'm going to try doing that
so but i haven't done it
but i'm going to try it
well you have a good night
so uh what do you think about our involvement in the middle east
i i i hope that we uh uh get a chance to uh promote peace out there uh because i think without peace we're not going to get stable oil prices
and and uh i'd i'd really like to see stability in that area because i'm always afraid that's where another big war is going to start not that desert storm was a small one
i i suspect that if any world war is coming at this point in time they're going to come from there uh i would think anyway
i saw um just recently where uh uh the u s is supposedly going to be uh putting pressure on all the you know the israelis supposedly to come to a bargaining table to
actually i heard that the israelis were even talk- at least mentioned about giving up some of the golan heights
that would be interesting because i am actually um um i'm i'm i'm jewish
and i'm actually sort of not not not really a zionist per se you know
but i have a um i have a lot of friends you know who are sort of adamant you know israel
and do whatever they want
and i think they've been sort of hard nosed about the entire thing
and you know in some sense m- the moderates may be right
they may you know may be better if they give up just a little bit to settle things down
well uh i guess it's one of those things that uh if it's going to really promote a lasting peace if there is not going to be a peace
then then then then is it worth it at all
i mean i could the way
i mean the only way to think about it is well they won you know
they sort of took over the um
so i don't i don't know how to i don't i don't know what to do about it
but i think that that you know in general the region is really in bad shape
do you think the u s is going to wind up keeping uh military bases over there
um probably oh
isn't isn't there a plan now to make a command center there or something
i i haven't heard that
but i i haven't specifically heard anything about that
i just heard something about moving recently about moving um
there there there's some central command post in tampa
actually there was um a small country or small city i think or even not actually in saudi arabia or anything but a little bit off to the um east of it i think
they want to keep something over there so that they don't have to um
i guess it's i guess it's sort of so they don't have to move troops out so quickly or something
but they want to keep some sort of central command post there
what i thought was interesting is that uh apparently the formal cease fire has not actually been signed yet
i mean you know why only
you note it's only only a small number of people have actually come back yet
but i think that's actually the scariest part because when in the way what what's happening in iraq right now you know in itself it being so crazy there
i mean what do you know
and it's going to be worse
i don't know um
i ha- i i i have some friends in israel
and coincidently actually my wife is syrian um
so i am
we are sort of we are the middle east peace talks at home um
but we um we
and um i have some friends in israel
and we we talk a bit about it
but we try and keep it out of the home life
do you uh
she was she is actually um
i think it's um for her not really relevant because she is second generation american actually
but they recognize that syria's not the place that one wants to visit right about now
you know something about the place makes it not not quite enjoyable
i i've actually been there
i was there a couple of years ago when it wasn't you know sort of dangerous to be out there i guess
and i do i d- do like it actually
i think i'm too americanized and um
but i do like the food
if that so if that if that amounts for anything
well who- you know
actually my house is kosher
but it turns out that one of the strangest things about about israel is that no- um most folks don't realize that for all the food people think of as sort of you know jewish food and so forth
um and you know um in general it really isn't the food that is eaten in israel
so you typically think of it like bagels
right you know
turns out you don't you don't you don't really find bagels in israel
the same foods that you find in um syria and egypt and everything else
you don't you don't see a lot of
it's it's very different
i was actually very amazed when i sort of figured out for myself that everything i grew up with really wasn't israeli
it was more jewish you know
it it it is very strange
that that starts tomorrow night
i dated uh i dated a nice jewish girl for many years up in chicago
and i was the only goyim at at all the seder dinners and everything
and i used to have to go with rolls of not pocketful of change to buy all this bread the kids would see me
well you've you've you've really got a handle on this stuff i've noticed
not not not uh
that that that makes you real good
we um we actually we have the reverse situation
turned out that um um most of my friends aren't jewish
and and my wife's not
but i um i sort of you know do a lot of these things
so so that um
seder our first seder is tomorrow night
and this is a rare exception
two two years ago we had a seder
and i was the only jew both nights
so which to me is wonderful because it means that people who never would get to see this um so get to see it
and my view is passover is should sort of be
in in in in my mind passover is sort of a generic holiday anyway because it it sort of predates christ
well they had the
matter of fact i just watched charles heston this uh this weekend in the ten commandments
that's what always amazes me actually is that um is that you know
my wife and i always sort of bring this up about sh- her being syrian you know and my being jewish you know
well not totally alike
but you know um um it's amazing to think that people in the middle east sort of all hate each other
to me it's really um
i guess i guess i can intellectually kind of come to grips with all of that
but you know emotionally i have a real difficult time believing that uh that that people that believe in god and love not war and to forgive can't get together
you know i mea-
but i mean even within the muslim uh religions different sects they can't get together
that's that's actually the part that that that i find really strange
i mean i i i sort of understand somewhat
i mean i i
knowing the history i understand that the hatred of the muslims for you know the israelis or whatever
and i can sort of handle that
and but i sort of think about the muslims sort of running around have jihad against themselves
you know i mean and and that seems really weird
or the uh you know the catholics and the protestants up in ireland
you know i mean
same same thing
i'll i'll never understand it
didn't hurt me at at at the moment
so um and and and i i don't know
there's a there's something about
but everything i ever wanted to know i learned in kindergarten
and it talks about how you know if we could just all get toge- you know
and in the mi- you know
and then we all took naps
and we all held hands and hugged you know
and and and that's what kindergarten was like
and wouldn't it be nice if if we could solve all our problems by just sort of getting together and everyone in the world sat down and took a nap together
woke up and had snack time you know and then hugged each other as we left
it sounds like a it sounds like a john lennon uh type
uh my daughter talked to a student
uh in general most of them uh people doing this are t i
but i guess customers too huh
and i think a great number of students who got word of it and participated in general and voiced who heard about the program
t i got uh a lot of advances in it really
uh hopefully this will turn out to be a good program for us
we sure need uh the business
uh you you've got the question you can go first there since i called
i rely primarily on uh newspaper combined with television
and so if i just use time
and not say one which quality is the best
and then newspapers and t v would be tied after that because maybe i'll catch the the evening news like ten o'clock on t v
so that's a half an hour roughly the same with newspaper
of course you you're in a different part of the country
i i really listen to a lot of the talk shows i don't mean the gossip ones
but there's a lot
of on the weekends when i do chores or whatever
and turn on
they have everything from lawn work lawyers news uh veterinarians all kinds of items uh
so i'm i'm a real radio buff especially on the w- when i'm doing chores
i find it surprising because a lot of times it here you know
and i'll mention someone's some talk host
and i'll expect them to have an opinion on why i don't like him and don't listen
you know what the guys name is uh bruce williams who does financial work all over the united states
i'd i'd have to say i haven't either
and he has it
well it's five seventy here
and he he is again national and talks about a lot of financial things
but the here i just get a kick out of uh
well we do a lot of gardening here
but i i'm i am kind of a radio buff
i listen to the radio uh probably g- five or six hours a week
but almost inevitably to a station that is a classical uh station here
we have our a television connected to a uh uh electronic alarm
uh system that kicks in
and it comes on with c n n in the morning
we we wake up to television news and uh uh shower and dress and whatever to that
and then because of the fact that my wife and i ride to work together uh in a car
oh that's good
we we chat at each other rather than than something else
uh and occasionally what we'll each do depending on whoever is driving is have the newspaper sort of on our lap on the way in in the car
so we have the advantage of being able to uh read and drive although there seems to be from what i've seen on the freeway recently that a fair number of people are reading and driving
i also uh use uh newsweek magazine uh
we tend to alternate between newsweek and time and whatever happens to be the the uh news magazine of the year for us
w- we get
and uh i read sporadically of commentary and a couple of other you know trade magazines and uh uh such as that uh where i might read the the occasional social and even current event commentaries and and everything as diverse as a c m to uh uh some of the uh some of the other tabloids i get
so uh i guess i use about eighty percent written is probably my input and twenty percent uh television
i i think i respect the from a journalistic perspective current events
i've always said that it it's really not interesting unless it's three weeks old and found its way into a news weekly headline
uh other than that it was a at best
uh we're probably not thrilled with our only newspaper that we have in raleigh
there there are other uh uh
i'm not sure what you would call them they co- the small uh competing independent sort of newspapers
but there's only one daily uh called the news and observer fondly referred to here by some as the uh uh sometimes the noise and observer
uh it depends
it it's has decent national coverage but has an extremely focused political coverage probably steeped in
and uh consequently everything is filtered through that uh republican democratic sort of
are you into any of that what what's going on in the city council and the and the school boards and all that
we we have
that is uh
we and we pay it sort of glancing nod
we uh have a very good friend who is uh tapped into the city planning structure uh our developer architect friend
so i think we find out what's happening in the city uh on a fairly frequent basis over a over a gin and tonic sort of thing
uh and that probably gives us a better insight as to the city of raleigh than than the paper would have anyway
my wife and i you know as mentioned
the question was uh do you get it from people too
and and i can say the same thing you do that uh my wife is uh she reads the paper from front to back
and so she'll tell me some stuff
and she'll always get mad and say you didn't read the uh
well i always read the sports uh
what am i thinking of uh the commentaries
and she's always reading something
and she says why haven't you read that
and i say i never have time to read it like you do
but i always get a lot of my information from the
uh so i guess we do get it from people too
oh you mentioned c n n of course i mentioned radio and the c n n t v news you know
i'll heard there was some stuff on the on the radio that was equivalent to c n n
well it is c n n exactly
uh because uh
and but the reason i say that is on the radio they'll say and look at this you know
and when i first heard c n n it only started about uh since the war you know or right before that
and they would always say and look at this
and there would be a pause you know
and i realized that it's the exact commentary that you have on the uh the news
that didn't uh
but it's still good
it's still uh uh you know
but i do do enjoy since the gulf war listening to c n n radio too as well as watching c n n on t v here at work
i'm actually at work right now believe it or not
uh where was i
your your turn
uh we probably were listening to c n n fairly heavily before the war broadcasts began
uh we almost live and and breathed it for because during the war itself to the point where we began to sort of have household pact of lets turn the war off and get something done
i've i've heard that
uh almost an addition uh
and and and we could equate or relate relay well to some of the newspaper and television articles about the fact that people where having this problem in in unhooking uncoupling from the events and going on with their
instead of being watching the missiles and being glued to the tube or whatever uh
and because of that we began towards the middle and of the war i guess about two and a half or three weeks in we began to restrict our news almost deliberately where we would uh watch uh fifteen minutes before fifteen minutes after six our time which would be national news or our local news
we would watch c n n until six thirty then we would watch uh a rotating network news of either uh a b c c b s or n b c
and we we sort of just rotated around the dial each night a different one
and then we would turn the television off
and we were sort of limiting or dieting ourselves on on news that way
and then we would do a similar thing uh at uh ten forty-five because uh c n n would be wrapping their hourly coverage up
and then we would get the local coverage uh
and then i think the local coverage we would tend to watch the same station that would would have better state coverage rather than local coverage
uh three of the networks here on their local news uh
if if you wish to listen at eleven o'clock you can find out who raped who murdered who or stole what
and that was the sort of thing that i would say is the best
and not news unless there's some trend or something that says jesus this neighborhood has been hit forty-seven times or whatever uh that's that's sort of more of of a pattern news
so tell me about your home
it it's our first home
and it looks like it's going to be the last
they have scraped the uh plaster off the walls you know with riding their little toys through it and stuff you know
i mean even places
it's it's past the dent stage
we're talking some of it's been peeled away you know
we talking from from dents in the holes
we've got i've got a daughter
and one of them's seven
and then the carpet you know
i mean it sounds like it's just the pits
but it's not all that bad i guess
but you know they're just real hard on it
i can see why people wait until they get like in high school or maybe junior high
and then they get another one
uh we live in a mobile home
and that's probably not typical america
and uh seems like we're always working on it as i'm sure
because they're always because they're always ruining something
so you know just like yours ours is always you know
something else goes wrong always you know
who knows you know it's always something with homes
and you said you were in colorado springs
and is that what you're in
i'm i work for t i
well then that's why you're doing this then isn't it
and she saw this come up on the computer screen and ran it off and passed it to the people that were interested
it's not a hobby you know
i know i've been talking to people in ohio and uh virginia and i think california
you know the gal i talked to in maryland didn't own a car
she you know
and she didn't understand
uh she uh lives on campus
buses and and uh public transportation
her her parents live by the public transportation
and i wish we could down here
well it would be nice
but i kind of like the freedom too don't you
but i tell you i'd sure like to be able to get on a bus or something and get to work
but if i did it it would take me an hour and fifteen minutes
i would have to get on one and drive or walk to a bu- you know
and then they'd drive me to the main terminal here
if it's anything like uh
so that's too much
but there sure are a lot of people that work down there
and i went down there a couple maybe three weeks ago for a trial
and i mean all these people were standing up that was you know during the workday all along the cur- streets
you know just all around these vacant buildings just a lot of vacant buildings
and they're just being demolished
and and they stink
huh that's terrible
so garland how nice is it now
you know i think it might be up to two hundred and fifty thousand
and i didn't realize when i moved here that it was a separate town from dallas
but i didn't
oh where you from
i'm i'm originally from lubbock
so why did you move up to colorado
well it's real pretty up there
oh i love it
uh back to the topic
it seems that uh more and more people are not owning traditional homes these days
uh everyone says you know
and strange it seems that uh
oh they're doing some back pedaling
so have you got uh land
and we all taught
and it was a two bedroom
so we took turns
having sharing the bedroom
and then we had two baths
it was just one the little bathroom were the thing that really bothered me because i felt real closed in
well mobile homes have changed a lot probably since you had one
ours is wood s- ours is wood sided
and it has a traditional v top
and uh it's nine hundred and eighty square foot
well you can imagine nine hundred eighty square foot broke up into two bedrooms one bath
it's it's comfy
well i bet it's not bad
and uh you know so it's quieter than you remember mobile homes to be
but how much is yours
when we bought ours we were paying tw- uh three hundred twenty-nine dollars
oh our payments are like two twenty
oh so it was still a lot cheaper
and uh what
so it was still a lot cheaper than what we gave because ours is thirty years
and we bought one of the cheapest houses you know a tract house
and well actually whenever we got ours we picked it up used you know three or four years used
gee nice huh
so you know there's not that much time left on the loan
so if the economy gets better are you going to get another one another house
uh to tell you the truth right now it feels kind of comfy to have our mobile home and have it so close to paid for
you know it's like me to pickup and move somewhere else somewhere else is easy
but you wouldn't take that mobile home
when i you know when you talk about the deal like i got yeah yeah it would be cheaper
uh especially if it were a paid move or something
you know there's some paid moves occasionally
but they did
when i when i moved up here
so they might want to move away
so how many years you been up there
uh six or seven
uh a little bit little bit
oh that's exciting
i'm a real um scaredy when it comes to heights
but once we got on top of the rocks it was quite
well thanks for being home uh on the weekend
i uh i'm actually working at night
and uh there very few people that are on the list for calls uh on the weekends nights
well sometimes i'm home
and sometimes i'm not
but if i am it's always fun to talk
are are you part of the school system out there
i'm at uh north carolina state
uh the reason i said that because i've had about uh three calls and my daughter had one too from different students out of north carolina
i think i was the one who did that actually
oh is that ri-
i had a uh
oh is that right
so i know uh you know i know about this project
so i got my students to sign up
and uh apparently a number of them have been participating
he had way more twice as many calls as as i've made uh
and i i'm
of course we at t i just hoping it works out that the new products that they come out will uh sell like gang books bu- busters really
wha- what do you think about latin america
uh let's see
i actually wa- was planning a trip to latin america
and i got warned off by some people
and the crime rate in brazil makes it not a pleasant place to go and so on and so forth
and uh i guess we were selling parts to the automotive industry or whatever
and they had quite a few uh locations
and i think the one in in brazil is closed
but i i don't know why that is a problem down there
and i guess the crime rate is terrible up here too
and uh an
but i don't i don't have an answer to the crime rate
i i'd like to go down to mexico you know
and i keep hearing that you know the government and and the crime rates pretty high too
that that is sad
uh not that we can uh sell any great program we have with crime
but uh i think uh i'm kind of like you
i guess maybe that's our biggest problem we have with our our neighbors down there is that we don't have any
and we don't really aren't that close to everyone in south america
i i don't understand it either although i i think a lot of south americans regard the united states as as bullying
and uh that's certainly from a historical point of view would be true
i was reading a spanish book uh not that i read spanish you know
i just you know reading some spanish words
and there was a comment in there about the mexicans don't really want us to say we're americans
they would like to say that we're north americans because they're americans too you know
and i guess that's true
i guess we're kind of uh the smart asses in the world i suppose uh or of america anyway
well i think they're going to have
and they can stand on their heads if they want too
but i don't think that they're going they're going to change that
and and and really i mean north americans i think are when you say that even i thi- i mean i tend to think of americans and canadians
i mean they were saying that of us that we're the north americans and they're americans
and they they want us to say we're the north americans
oh i see
and they're south americans
i i don't want to make
well it's it's so interesting i ju- i just don't think mexico's problems are going to be cured by semantics
they they were lucky enough to have some oil what ten years ago an
and they they blew all that and borrowed enou- more money than they can pay back now
and uh uh so they're not exactly business men
i don't i do have a lot of sympathy in that we're here in texas uh
for the language you know is very foolish
i'm relativ- relatively familiar with texas school system
and we should teach spanish at least in uh grammar school you know four or five grades of it so that we can speak spanish
i think that helps when you certainly can speak their language uh
and there are problems with you know the wet back problem you know
and then we should somehow uh
and i think the governments are working on that to try to have some uh businesses uh at the borders of both sides so that you can you don't have this problem of them trying to come up here an to to get the jobs you know
i i do feel for them uh
they are very envious of us or they wouldn't be coming up here you know risking a lot
not that they're risking their lives of course but risking a lot uh
getting thrown back i guess is all that uh happens
we see it you know once a month i'm sure in san antonio they see it more often than that
well i grew up in los angeles
well you see it saw it out there then too
and uh in fact i drove a cab when i was a graduate student
so i i knew uh the hispanic part of l a pretty well
and certainly you know knew that problem
knew you know knew about apartment houses that would have eight or ten or twelve people living in them sleeping in the same bed in shifts and all that
and uh it was it was pretty wild
i think a a common factor to a lot of problems both whether it be crime if if you want to jump on that is mostly uh poverty
uh and i think a lot of their problems is poverty
if we could uh uh
the problems we have yo- kno- in this country is is a lot of it's poverty
whether it's the people aren't trying hard enough to get out of poverty i that's another story
but uh uh it is sad
there there's so much down in all of south america uh so much potential you know
t i of course is is really pushing world markets in their products
and they're they're mostly in in europe now and in in in the orient japan and singapore now just announced building a plant in singapore uh
and they're they haven't had what that much luck in south america
and there's got to be a lot of potential for business down there for the products certainly that we make and everything
and there's got to be trade
i guess that's some of the answer i guess is business uh uh
and i try to be an optimist and say well that that's one way is to help any problem whether it be crime or certainly poverty obviously is to is to get some business going between each other
and we need we need to do more of that uh somehow and encourage more business
they've got to have a lot of resources i would think an enormous amount of of well potential that way
but uh there's got to be a lot of potential down there
wha- what are you taking in school
well i am actually
oh yo- you're an instructor
i'm the i'm the teacher
uh very interested in voice systems and in speech recognition
but of course this project is really one to collect a data base of of uh of casual speech uh in an attempt to get some kind of a model of what speech is like
i of course i work at t i
and i'm a little puzzled as to why when they get my voice one time why that isn't enough
i mean i'm i'm i'm getting a kick out of the whole program
but uh there's going to be i guess thousands i don't know how many thousands or tens of thousands of these recordings
and i wonder how they're going to analyze them whether it would be listening to them or analyzing
they've got to be analyzing with a a voice recorder some how
well they record these
and then somebody transcribes them so that they they have uh they have a speech signal
and what is said
and they have a they're able to average it over a number of different occasions because peoples voices change a lot even from morning to evening
and that's uh a big problem in speech recognition
i know mine changes uh has changed uh
although you you never found
your your voice echoes in your own head which is makes it different than what it really sounds to other people
uh i'm sure singers and professional people know that
and you always hear your own voice in recordings and say my god that's that's not obviously that's not me you know
but uh i know your voice in your own head resonates a different way
uh go ahead
yo- you comment on it
and i'm sure they have some of that now
and not not in computers but a lot of potential of course for handicapped people
uh my first thoughts on capital punishment i-
the first thing i want to say i- is no just simply because we as human beings don't have the right to take another human being's life
uh we are punishing someone for taking someone's life
or in some cases we are punishing s- one- a person for taking someone's life
and so in effect we are committing that same crime
well it sounds like you have really strong views on it
and i can see that point
but i also have this you know
i i question
and just to play devil's advocate
it never seems right to me that uh we take in people that are criminals and people that are you know low income or even middle income that are struggling to provide for their families
and it just
that that i find very difficult to swallow
one thing i don't understand is the the whole concept of death row
and there are thousands upon thousands of people on death row
and i'm not saying that oh
i guess i am kind of saying what what are we doing
i mean i guess that's the same thing you were saying
what what are we doing with these people
we should either take some kind of action
or take enough or go a different route
but they're just
and then when you think of the thousands and thousands of dollars that get burned in court costs
you know we could be pay- feeding poor people and helping you know
i mean prison is such a waste of a human being
and i do agree with your statement that to take a human life is wrong
um but you know
but locking someone up and not getting you know any benefit from that for the person or for society to me is wrong too
and i guess i see both sides in that at the at the same time that i'm saying that you know we're committing the same crime
oh exactly w-
i also agree that i mean if there is somebody out there that's crazy and cruel enough to kill somebody or in some cases kill several people at one time uh
well i'm sure they haven't gone to court yet
but uh apparently two teenage boys held up a taco bell
now to me that is inhumane
and for two people to be out in the world like that i don't i don't want them in my world
i'm i'm i mean i'm not for killing anyone
but i don't want these people around
and we want to remove them
but but i think that the whole crux of the problem is
that does you know basically you know
i i think you know that the whole idea of uh the death penalty was invented for two reasons
it remo- removes them from society
and number two it's it's kind of uh it's the punishment it's the ultimate punishment
because you know they've harmed someone
and and you know you want to appease the people that have suffered
but it it really doesn't take their pain away
and at and at the same time like you said it drains society
but it's a
the same money that we're using to build more prisons and make more prison space and pu- keep these people in prison that same money or half of that money could be used towards uh rehabilitation programs of some sort
something to get to to put these people back in society
but prepare them first
the pro- the problem is so incredibly complex
i have a friend who works on the pardon and patr- paro- paroles
and she interviews
and she says it is just really frightening how easy it is to you know have the prisons release people because they're overcrowded
and these people have not benefited from the stay there
she says just their emotional state and their way of thinking is so incredibly wrong and there's not anything she can do to keep them in you know
and those guidelines keep getting lessened and lessened because they have to do it to make the system work
and y- you want people out of prison
and you want people to get jobs and and live happy lives
but they can't just walk out of prison and do that
they can't just walk out of prison and say okay i'm going to go a different route
and i know this costs money
but it couldn't cost any more money than we're already spending
i i would like to see the money that's been budgeted budgeted for new prisons being put into the research of of alternate solutions to the problem
i mean you know everyone's trying to make it you know in their own little world
you know i'm trying to make it with my job and make you know myself okay and make my family okay
and it's so hard to you know try and be one of the movers and shakers i guess you would call them
but it it sounds like you are uh you know
and uh you know when you have a a voice you do contribute
and i guess that's you know what what we're meant to do
and i i'm a broadcast journalist
and so i feel like one day i probably will write a book or or something you know
and some of these views will be able to come out
oh you do
i'm i'm a news reporter
and so i i guess i'm i'm pretty emotional about crime things like that now
but i get to see pretty much uh close up you know a lot of things that happen that people don't see
uh i got to s- get to see a lot of crimes
and i get to see you know people's uh pain and things
and so when we talk about
most of us are so sheltered you know
and a few people in the news that bring it to us and make us see what's out there
you're you're really performing a a benefit to society in doing that
but still you know we can't sh- we can't
i i guess i would like to probably editorialize more
we can't say well this is what i think about you know
you really want to say you think or what you think should be done or how you think this court case should have gone
or you know that's a
i i'm just i'm just agreeing with you when i think of it how difficult it must be to just to just give the facts because usually on an issue that you really care about uh you want you want to you know persuade people to your viewpoint
and you're right
especially when you are dealing with a a subject like uh capital punishment or something or abortion or something where there's an an no or yes side
and you have your side
and you have to report both sides
but you really don't want to because you have your side
and you have to walk right down the middle with it
so sometimes that's hard
well that's that sounds interesting
and i'll read your book sometime
well it was nice talking to you
it's um it's very hot
in fact i've been cleaning because i live in an apartment so i can't do very much gardening other than balcony gardening um you know
i have the little flower boxes with um a v- a lot of different flowers
and i do enjoy plants
but i don't have a yard or anything that i can do gardening really
oh you're you're you're not the so-called ex-
and uh the only recommendation i would have for someone who hasn't gardened is uh one get a couple of good books of books of course
and usually they have talk shows
here in dallas they have two great uh talk shows that go through everything that will grow here which is the opposite probably of what would grow up where you are and so uh in fact you you could easily do that now listen to turn on a talk show up there and see if there there's got to be some gardening folks on the radio that says when to put your grass in and and what kind of grass to grow up in virginia and everything
so i uh
for someone who doesn't garden i'd say that that's my biggest recommendation is to
so you enjoy gardening
i like it a lot uh uh
i'm i'm with t i
uh where was oh
i i like it
i uh i always know that why i'm not a farmer when i garden though
i mean it is dog work
and it is tough i have a lot of trees down here uh
and the wind blows all the leaves on from your neighbor after you rake yours
so other than that you know those three months when it's pure dog work uh the rest of it's very enjoyable just going through the experiences of of putting little plants in or whatever i i haven't had to plant any trees because i've got so many
but uh uh but i do listen to that talk show
there there is some great people from texas a and m
but there's some great uh folks uh that have been well trained and again uh to to uh recommend gardening for this area
i'm sure it is you know different in the different areas
um i'm originally from pennsylvania
and i do go home on weekends during the summer and uh and uh mow my mother's grass and different things like that
oh i would have no idea
see you would have to learn that though
or they're they're freeze it freeze out because the roots are all in the winter uh
or do you have to start all over every year
i have to start all over every year well except i do have some um some day lilies that um you know i don't do anything with
and they seem to come back year after year
and i leave them on my balcony even in in the snow and the winter you know in the ice everything because here you know not as severe as the snow is in pennsylvania
but here we still do get some snow and ice and things like that
but we have to bring them in here in the winter because usually uh if it's not below the ground so you can insulate the roots from freezing you know the pots will will die
everything in a pot will die so you can bring them
well we do bring stuff in the garage and everything but uh it's quite time consuming by the way
but it's quite uh
but i would definitely do it
whatever subject you pick do it the knowledgeable way don't go out there and start digging holes uh
get some books of whether it be pennsylvania or virginia as as well as
then there's always a gardening part of the newspaper or communications as well as i bet there's a talk show up there right now that you if you turn the dial around you'll
you'll find someone probably in the morning i don't know discussing you know what we do up in virginia to get something growing you probably don't have to do much over there
we're i guess in the ice age it it it's pushed a lot of uh limestone and everything
to some parts of dallas you just can dig a foot down and you hit solid limestone you know so uh i think all the trees that are here now were planted kind of like the johnny appleseed type trees where people have come from
it's so scrubby uh
and i think that we even got our famous hundred year old pecan trees from alabama and all that too we we call them native pecan trees
but they grow wild here
it's what they call pecan pecan pie up there in the east
oh you don't sound like it
you how many times have you called by the way
or how many times have you been called
um i've been called a lot
i've participated probably in about maybe i don't know seven calls and you know i've called a couple of times
but most of the time i notice that um you know it takes forever to get a call through
today i was i got to laugh because i tried it this morning
and i thought everybody was gardening
well no no
this is a great subject because they're out there gardening you know
uh i don't know if you get c n n
but it's here at work in fact i'm at work today believe it or not
but uh they have t v in the break areas and there was some heavy tornados uh i guess in kansas
oh my uh-huh
tornados uh which is not the right subject
but uh they blow through here all in the spring
i guess it's related somewhat to the weather you know and and the plants and all that that uh sometimes they do essentially nothing
and the weather men yesterday were all alert
say hey there's something really terrible going to happen
and they they sure were right
but it wasn't in texas
they'll they'll they claim thirty odd people were killed up in kansas city kansas
anyway back on planting
uh it is very interesting uh subject
uh when you when did you get a house uh
your your trees grow up so well up there
but i'm sure you have plenty of trees
that that is a key thing for shade and keeping your bills down uh
but where in virginia are you all
um right now the district
washington um in fairfax virginia
oh do you have the cherry blossoms there in there or not
there's there's a few
not you know nearly as many as what's actually in the district
but um they're definitely enjoyable
there there there is a vast variety here of you know trees
like if i look out my window right now i can see you know couple of pine trees some oak trees yeah
actually i haven't
it is wide open uh and flat uh and again as i said i think the when the indians were here there there weren't any trees
but the the civilization has brought all kinds of experiments with all kinds of trees
and a lot of them have done well uh they do have some pine forest areas in wes- in wes- in east texas where you have native pine trees
but here in dallas it's i think they all were planted by the classical johnny appleseed and johnny pecanseed whatever you would call it you know
there's a tremendous amount of pecan trees that we use for you know uh for eating i think they thought that was going to be a great boom crop uh hundred and fifty years ago because they are all over the place in the south
i i'm i'm of course i'm a t i
so i'm hoping this works
t i is very good uh has done a lot of experiments in the speech uh uh-huh
speech uh synthesis synthesis
and they've come out with some new products
in fact this week they came out with some new math uh
you might see them in your advertisements uh
new math uh
speak and math uh devices
they they have had speak and spell and all that for years but they've come out with some different ones this past week
and uh my wife and everyone
what what are they going to accomplish out of all this
and i said well you're not going to have to type on the computer one day
you're just going to have to talk to it you know
so you you
it's going to be much faster of course you know
or like i can of course not that i can type very fast either
but then what about people that um
i i i personally work with someone that that is deaf and cannot speak
but she can't speak very clearly and she in fact is a data entry person
i mean she types away all day
well i'll tell you why i feel so
but i do know that in the where i live and i teach school there are so many orientals that have come here
and there's a lot of mexican people too which is not neither here nor there
but the fact is that all the orientals that are here are very affluent uh very wise in money matters and have ta- have taken over a lot of businesses
they're all the kids that i have that are oriental are really far above the american kids
and the the parents are unbelievable because they are just on the way up
and money is their main goal
and it's k- it really is kind of scary
and you can not believe the businesses and corporations that have been taken over by orientals
and it's k- it's kind of scares me not that i don't want them here and not that i don't appreciate the fact that you know that they have rights too
actually my son once said that that perhaps uh what we should do is is buy a little square of land some place in the midwest
and and that might be the solution
because i lived in iowa for for about
and i was born in ohio
so it it really
and there is there are a lot of mexican people here because we're so close to the border
and and they are wonderful people
and and i'm not
just that you you feel like when you were born and raised here and you worked re- very hard to make this country what it is uh it scares you when you feel like somebody's taking over
and a lot of these people plan one day to go back you know to to vietnam or to you know taiwan or wherever they're from and take with them a lot of american dollars plus a lot of power in american com- com- companies
and it's kind of scary
and you know i don't know
i don't know the immigration laws that uh that
well and i do not
and in fact i don't know them at all
and i i do believe there must have been some sort of quota system because uh
and it seemed to take them a long time
or or there was a lot of uncertainty as to whether they would be able to come
you know i i i think there's something about being able to to claim um imminent danger
or i'm not sure what the terminology is
there there you go
and maybe that's a an issue with a a lot of people
i i guess i haven't been in a situation where it's it's been threatening to to me uh
well i teach in the suburb of dallas
and and uh my kids go to school in another suburb of dallas and with very very good school systems
and they're considered you know one of the top three in the state both of them you know
and it seems like a lot of the orientals make sure that their kids go to these schools
and they're head and shoulders above a lot of the kids here
and the kids in this area are very bright and come from you know parents that are professionals or semiprofessionals and and uh very interested in their education
but uh i think in the last year i'm not if i'm not mistaken in four of the six high schools the graduating class valedictorian and salutatorian were uh alm- half or more oriental
and you know they're just extremely bright kids
and also they value learning
i was going to say i'm not s- i i would guess that it's not that they are any brighter
but they just maybe work harder
well i i think things come easy for them too
but i do think that they have that work ethic that we somehow have missed the boat in with a lot of kids in the united states
i don't they uh don't want to work for anything
they want it to come to them but and be there
but they don't want to work hard
and these kids work really hard
and and they have
but maybe part of that's the problem that here we've we've let this value slip
and they need to have some competition
but what i see is y-
but instead of meeting the challenge they're starting to resent them
and it's causing you know i think some some problems
well that's too bad
because we see a lot of racial problems in dal- the dallas area anyway
and it's mainly black and and and hispanic
but uh there is some there has been some resentment with orientals in the black community because they've started businesses there
and the blacks resent them coming in and taking their money
and there's been some violence because of it
oh that's really sad
it's it is very sad
so you know i really
i i've i've always prided myself
and even when i was younger wh- when i was in college i was a member of the n a a c p because i lived up north
and i was very into that the human rights part of everything
but i i've i've become very cynical in the last three four years living in texas
well and it sounds like you feel that there is need for change
there is too big of a concentration coming all at once to to allow for adequate melting into the society
well and exactly
and and uh plus a lot of american dollars
but in in the long run maybe that's going to make a better world too
you know you just don't know
and yet you know with uh with uh
but i'm going to ignore
uh anyway i just
you you kind of you don- you really don't know what to do
and and i don't
and both of my children are really tol- more tolerant of blacks and h- hispanics than they are of the orientals
they feel you know like they've taken over
they feel like uh you know they're taking some of the the rewards that they should have
and i really don't want that to happen
but it's happening
and i think a lot of their friends feel the same way too
so and i really do wish i knew about quotas and really wish i
i would i would suspect that they have
well i guess um i don't have much
and even if i i really wish i knew the situations they were going back to or coming from
and you feel you know you can't put yourself in their shoes or really understand them
and for some reason orientals are very uh
but i call them very that
and they go get it
and in stores and so and so forth it's wh-
but in stores and things sometimes they can be very impolite because they can they get in front of you or they uh they take something that you had in mind to get before you did
you know just going for it they take it quickly
and uh they don't think anything of that
and i don't you know
and so and yet they have they have a right to be here
and i know that
but it's it sometimes it's gets touchy
so and i'm sure it's a lot different
and i i'm sure that it's a lot different there
uh it's a lot different in i- than in iowa than it is here
i think i think there as i recall in my son's class there were were an awfu- an awful lot of mi- minorities
and uh of all of all varieties
but uh i don't know
i guess i wasn't involved enough to to uh really stop to think about it
well i you know since i teach i see th- see it
and and i feel
and i love the example that most of these children give the our american children
and yet you know i can see why some of the parents are fear- that are fearful too
and and it's a kind of a touchy situation
and i wish that we could all just learn from each other and not feel threatened
but it doesn't happen that way all the time
well it was good talking to you
it was good to talk to to you too
and i h-
and have a good trip in california
and have a good weekend
well thank you
a- all righty
and some is they're more educated than they used to be i think
uh i think sometimes uh leaders in government they've become more uh adroit in that area too instead of just men all the time
well uh i probably a little bit older than you are
so what i see uh is
the change that i see the most is is that uh women have much more many more occupations and careers to choose from than when i w- went to college
or but there were very few women in business at that time
but they were the oddity
and now i see
and and i see for my daughter which is wonderful
and i see a whole
because i'm a teacher
and i mean i love teaching
but there i think there are a lot of other things i would have liked better
and uh not that i would give the career up because it's it's a safe career plus because i always have a job plus i am a single parent too
and i n- i need the income
but uh and i think that's the reason why a lot of women have have started to work too is because economically it's just a must
uh you just
and and most all
they always either have
they're either moonlighting or else their their wife works too
uh it's just an economic need now
i really think women have so much more responsibility than you know as far as everything
and like you said uh one women today have so many uh
the average today of having a a single family you know with the mother as the head
you know it just really uh so commonplace
uh the majority is uh married couple with children
but still there's a lot more than there used to be
and see you never picture yourself in a situation like this
my mother always said you know get an education in case you need one a- because my father died when we were
and we were eleven when he died
and she had a nursing degree
and she was able to make it
but she said in j- you never know what's going to happen
and i thank god that i did go to college
you know isn't that funny uh because the same thing happened to us except i was twelve
and my mother had a nursing degree and was able to make it in her profession
uh but just that they were able to do it
and even today i think the chance for education is j- is is so much uh better for all of our girls
and and boys too
but but the girls especially
but i think it needs to continue to change
and i m- i think it there's still not equality as far as uh paychecks for men and women
i think that the we still have a long way to go
and i think that uh i think by the year two thousand it we're going to see some a lot more changes uh hopefully that women are you know able to get the the executive jobs
and hold positions that men
if they want to dedicate their most of their time to that they they're they can do it
and i also think that in the future that uh it's going to continue
and i think that they're going to uh uh be really responsible and and do everything just like what you said you know make make it the grade and and make it so women can be the top people in their in their field
and i think that's the way it should be
oh i think so
i mean not that i i think that i'm equal to men because there's a lot of things that men can do that i
so you know it
i don't w- i don't want to be equal
but i i want to be i want to get what i deserve
and i want to be able to be on the same level with them
if i can do a job as well as i man i think i should get the same pay you know
and and i just i'm not a women's libber
but i i think that
and i feel like if there's a qualified woman to do the job and if she's good or better than a man then she sh- they should get the job with the same pay
and i think that is happening more and more
oh i do too
well it was good to talk to you
um i don't have any i guess definite views about elderly care
um the first thing that comes to mind is kind of those horror movies that you see
i think that's one thing that i would look at if i was putting my grandmother or my mother uh in some sort of home
as far as any court cases that came out of there um the history of you know their doctors um their nurses and things like that
a group that i'm a part of goes once a month to a um they call it the heritage house
it's it's a nursing home for elderly people
and this particular one has people that are in pretty bad shape
a lot of them have had um limbs amputated or um have serious illnesses
you know that kind of thing
and um i watched
and then a new company bought it
hired new nurses and uh just really just redid it you know
just out of curiosity what what kinds of things were they doing when they were considered a bad place
well to me it was dirty for one thing
uh when you would walk in the smell was just
the you know the floors you could just
um there were a lot of people just kind of up and down the halls laying in their beds hollering and you know crying
oh my goodness
of course i don't know how many of them were you know not in their right mind
but i feel like they were neglected
and um yeah
you know neglect to cleanup
i don't really think anyone was being you know cruel or or trying to mistreat them or anything
i just think they were not doing anymore you know than they had to do
and um just kind of letting everybody live in a not very good environment
but this new company came in
and they like i said they remodeled the place
and it smells nice when you walk in
and it looks nice
and they got like several new color t v's for the people
and redid the dining room where they made it you know a lot more place for them to be
just you know small things that make it seem a lot more homey
and it's like it's a lot more like an apartment place instead of just uh
i would i would personally hate to know that my mother or grandmother or anyone is in a home like that
and my biggest fear would that they would be is that they would be lonely
and i would like to know that there are you know just a lot of activities like you said you know just putting a plant in a room
you know just makes just brightens and and and just makes them just a little more active
and just to know that they're not you know laying in a room
looking at gray walls you know
that that's what would just really kill me
i'd like to know that you know they have friends there
maybe some kind of of activity little field trips or something
well they uh
they have everyday they have schedules of groups that come in
and they will do bingo
and then other groups come in and do the services you know other sundays
so that they have at least one service every sunday
so there are a lot of things
but you really do have to kind of seek it out you know
and um i know our church does it
and there are a lot of other churches
and they are just like civic organizations
and uh i have other friends
like they also have a dog that maybe needs a home
and they will wash it all up
and make sure it's it's a friendly animal
you know and take it in and let just let the old elderly people pet the dogs
that will be something you know they would look forward to if they knew you know that the puppy is coming on wednesday
you know that would be something to look for
and you know doing the best they can
you know it um
and i know it's hard for a lot of families if you're trying to to work or trying to take care of your own family
it's kind of hard to to because an elderly person sometimes can be totally dependent
you know on you
and i know that's hard sometimes
and but it would really have to be a last resort
unless i knew that they were somewhere just really i mean just really great
you know that they were really enjoying
well i have interesting conversations with a lot of these people because um many of them of course their minds are not good
and so a lot them have told me exactly the same story you know
and then the next time i go it's the same thing you know
that just somebody to listen to them
uh just seems to make them really feel good
but he has cerebral palsy so bad that he just cannot communicate
and um he's blind
and he has seizures you know
i mean he's just like in a world of his own
and yet he wants so much
and if you come over to him if he can touch your hand he'll grab it and kiss it
oh and he's always got a smile
i mean he really tries to brighten up your life
oh it's just amazing
but he can't say anything
like i i would really like to be a teacher
but i don't think i could do it because i'm very very emotional
and the minute i mean the minute something happens
i cry on i mean hallmark commercials
and so i mean something real life i just
and i always go and do an education things
i meet these kids who are you know dropping out of school left and right
and all the sudden they're in this program
and i'm just i just want to hug them
and you know i could just imagine you know working in a home like that
and those people they're so sweet and and so genuine
and all they want is just for everything to be happy
and you know
and so that would probably just tear me apart
oh it does
and but one of the neatest things i think though is we always take our kids
and they um have gotten comfortable being around these people
and the people love them
and they want the children you know to hug them or hold their hand
and so far my kids will do it just real easily
and i think it's because they've gone since they were real little
and they've never been afraid
but that's something
you know need to
as we walk through the the lobby they'll all say bring her here
i mean usually a of elderly people like to they like to uh share their experiences with the with the younger children
you know they feel like they've lived life
so they need to share it
and i'm sure i'll be like that too
well me too
but that's great
and and uh it really helps those people i think
but like you said i'd really have a lot of second thoughts before i put any of my own family members there
and i would hate it if anyone put me in one
oh i know
i'm always afraid like oh
well nice to talk to you
and i think one thing about pets is they're a lot of company
you can you can tell them anything
and they won't tell anybody
that's like unconditional affection
anyway do you have a pet
my pet uh was hit by a car new year's eve
oh i'm so sorry
but that's good that you're going to get another one
i know some of my friends who have pets uh
and they just are really you know
the ones that have dogs are very uh protective of them
and i think that's one reason they have them especially older people that i know that have pets
but they just um really take care of them or uh are protective of them
and it's kind of nice
you come home your your pet's there for you and s- wants a little food a little attention
and my my kids
um they really want a dog badly
and they've been looking and looking
and want you know
but um i don't know do you like
it was an in- kind of indoor outdoor
it it was
i don't i don't care for the smell of the litter box
so my cat was trained to go outside
when i had a cocker spaniel it it was an outdoor dog
and uh i think i liked that better
i i think you know
but i think that uh
kind of like big do- big dogs
and you have to have room for them
and dogs take a lot of a lot more care than cats do
cats are pretty independent you know
and they keep themselves clean
and if you if you raise them right you know you don't have to worry about the litter box thing where with dogs you really do have to let them out and take them for walks and things like that
i see all the people on on sunday going for a walk with their dogs
and and i i'm kind of skeptical with my son getting a dog
and then mom gets to take care of it or something
so i gue-
and he was out of town last weekend
and of course the dog is not trained for anything yet
so it was go over there and clean up after the dog
oh that's exciting
that's that's a major chore you know if you don't if you don't keep up with it
and uh kids kind of
they want the they want the fun part and not the not the work
i think it's really important to that that if you get a pet that they're either spayed or neutered so that you know we're not just going on with this pet population and having to
that that kind of gripes on me some
but but i don't know
well if you're if you're going to have a pet
and not have it neutered or spayed you need to be willing to you know deal with the consequences
and and i think
and you know just seeing the cats you know the the miracle of birth you know put that in quotes is tha- that's a that's a neat thing to to experience as a kid and understand
and and it was a real positive thing
but on the other hand you don't want to you'd be one of these people that dumps the kittens off on the side of the road you know
th- they're they're getting old now
and it's time to get rid of them
and and that's good too
well i think that's all i have to say
and we had kind of a hard time finding someplace we could put michael's goods
and he was going to school at five
so he started the first grade when he was five
and you had trouble finding somewhere for him to be before he was five
so we could you know
and it was uh
but it's really hard to find someplace where you can send your child and expect him to learn something
and that's i mean that's
and then yeah
you do have to pay you know if you
but parents pay when they stay home with them anyway
you know my wife works
if i had any children i would uh i hope that i'll be in a position to stay home with my child because i'm not real uh uh trusting
see i don't know
uh especially today
and i just see different things all the time
and people are just crazy these days
it takes me a takes me a long time to just trust someone as a friend
much less to you know trust someone with my with my child
well see we took our time
and we checked it out
and we found a preschool for him
and it you know
through other folks where i where i work
so through other folks where we worked we found a nice preschool
i guess that's the best way you know to get
and you know i don't think i would have left him anywhere that would
before i left him somewhere that you know
you know i just i i don't think i'd take that chance
you know i think it's out of sight or out of mind
i mean you have to be you've got to be sure
i mean not that they're going to abuse your child or anything
but you never know
but you just have to be sure that they're going to be watching them you know
that they wouldn't let them drink something or you know eat something off the floor
but you you know
and who you can't you know
then you hear so much you know on the news about uh child care places
and also um senior care facilities you know you hear abuse
and so you just you just don't know
and you almost want to you know spend a couple of weeks with in class with your child just to see how it is or something
so you have no children at all
i'm only i'm twenty-three
um it's just not in the cards for me right now
anyway back to the subject
but anyway it's tough
and it's hard to find someplace where you can leave your child and trust that he's
and you brought up a good point you know
you you would hope that maybe they'd come home and know some of their a b c's or something you know
you know and he's he's doing real well
it it it has paid off for him
and he's you know got a second grade reading level and a fourth grade math level
so you know those early ages when he would you know when his mom and dad are at work
you know we could have sent him to anybody
there's a lot people at work that would have baby-sat him but sending him to a preschool where he actually learns something
his his attitude is i think a little bit
and you know but his
did you take this same uh route with your other two children
um they they were outside my marriage
so i don't know
but you know all my children
they're they're really good
and i guess no
and it helps that he has older brothers uh
you know just to have role models and things like that
like uh in one way we're kind of lucky because they're all boys
but in another way we're not so lucky because we don't have another woman in the house for my wife to share
but you know
so we faced that too
he learned quite a bit from not only from nursery school
but he learned quite a bit from the older boys
and you know he's excelled
and it's paying off for him
he's he is pretty smart
well what kid isn't
but i think it's important i think it's really nice to know that you can find someplace
i don't know you know how it is down there in waco
but in lubbock we have a few that you can send your children to
and they can actually learn something instead of just being baby-sat
do they have any kind of program like at t i or wherever your wife works um
huh because i know they're they're putting that into a lot of uh corporations now
so maybe that will be an option for
well it would be nice you know there
but then i i foresee that being just a baby-sitting thing not much learning but you know
you know where where we sent michael the first few years was there was different teachers all the time you know
and then some substitute teachers in the afternoon
and they actually taught him something instead of just watching him all day
you know and then they had a group of kids
and they put on skits
and they put on plays
and they did the halloween thing
and it's you know it was important to us
so we you know we took a good look at it and made sure it was going to go that way
do you think it would have been better for him to have um maybe one continuous teacher somebody to that he could uh
or is it better the other way with a lot of different
because i think you know as a child growing up i think is a task that belongs to his parents
you know he attached himself to a couple of those
but i think his attachments at home
and you know he gets the idea of what school is for
and uh you know i have different teachers
and this person can teach me one thing and this person teach teach me another
so i i i really can't say that it would be it's important for him to attach himself to anybody
with with another child i can't say that
but i don't have that experience
so i can't say that
you know he did well
so i don't think we made too many mistakes
well it sounds good
and he learned from it
so and that was the most important thing that we wanted was for him to learn not just to sit there and be baby-sat all day
you know baby-sat sounds to me like well you're here i guess i'll watch you when i get time
you know maybe i'll clean my house maybe i'll cook you lunch
maybe i won't you know
and they'll probably sit him in front of the television
you know while they do other things
and i don't you know
so but we had a good experience
and we really did well
well that's good
so and he did he served better than we did you know
he gained he actually gained from it you know
but i think in the long run he gained from it just being somewhere where we learned something
and it's important
but um you know just really look into
it will it will take me a long time to find somewhere i'm sure
just because i i just want to be i want to be so positive that you know my children are okay
as well as the other children in the center you know
well you know his mom didn't go back to work until you know when he was six months old
and we just didn't want to dump him somewhere
and we wanted his center of attention at home
and it it worked out real well
it's it's a lot more difficult these days because you have both parents working a lot of times
and so you have to find day care
whereas you know here
so you know i'm not making seventy or thir- eighty thousand dollars a year
so child care's a necessity whereas years ago you know the husband basically worked and the wife
mom mom was allowed to stay home
you know there was a few families outside of that where dad stayed home and mom worked but not very many that i know of when i was growing up
and you know i'm forty now
but you know when i was a kid mom was always at home
so we didn't
i think that has a lot to do with just just all children how they learn and things just because the basic family is is breaking you know
it's it's not there
i think that plays a big part in in a child's learning and you know what they can and cannot do in child care
well let's start with you
and i liked it a lot because it had a lot of music in it
who who was in that
it's it's it's uh robert townsend movie
um i i don't know all the actors or anything
but it was just it was a lot of music a lot of old songs things like that
um it's still out now uh
and uh it was called the dells
and uh it was kind of like just about their their life and their uh history and things like that and the way they went from from how they went from stardom to nonstardom
and uh that was pretty good
uh that won best picture i think
and costner got best director
right now kevin costner i mean he's starring in everything
he's doing the kennedy movie that's coming out um
and there's one
another kennedy movie huh
and let me see
um he's doing some other movie
and he's going to be in also
and let me see
and i ca- not sure about the name has meryl streep
and um what was the name of that
anyway the ba-
the premise of the story is that uh uh uh you go to a pla- after you die you go to a place called judgment city
oh i know what you're talking about
and um anyway
uh i can't remem-
the other the other actor uh
d- defending your life
and it's it's an excellent movie
it's pretty entertaining uh
what else have i seen lately um
well not all time favorite
but one of my favorites
well did you ever see home alone
i i heard it was really good
i've never just haven't gone out to see it
that was a that was a good one too
but i need to see it
fatal attraction that i don't know why i like that movie so much
and i like suspense
like uh did you ever see this is going way back uh jagged edge
tha- that was a good one too
and i liked the woman that played in that
and she played in uh narrow margin which was a little more recent
and that was kind of another suspense type alfred hitchcock type thriller
uh god i guess i haven't seen too many movies lately
i mean it's hard for me to get to movies now because it's getting so expensive you know
i'd i'd rather rent
but then you end up spending another six dollars on food
and that's just for a bok- a bucket of popcorn you know
and a pop you know
so it's it gets pretty
like if i
so if i take a date
it it cost me you know twenty bucks easy
and uh i don't know
and you're usually going to do you're usually going to go to a dinner go to dinner or something with that
i was going to say you you know you can find certain restaurants that are nice
and have good food for ea- eat for thirty dollars
it's almost more fun really
it's almost more fun really to rent movies you know just kind of stay at home maybe
so that's what you're you're uh dealing with
but then you can make your popcorn and you know be comfortable
well that's about all the movies i've seen recently
i ought to open the paper here because i know i've seen a few that have have played
haven't haven't been to one for a little while
but um did you ever see kindergarten cop
there's a movie i do want to see uh
what is it oh
it looks it looks pretty suspenseful
i don't re- recommend that
as much as uh defending your life
but it was it was all right kind of funny
oh did you see that
that was that that might be one of my all time favorites too
it was pretty scary because i was visiting a v a hospital uh near to where i live
and they were saying that some of the patients there you can't leave by themselves because they'll make a weapon out of anything you know
out of a piece of paper they can kill somebody you know
and this guy in silence of the lambs hannibal lector he was he was that kind of person
and that's that's what was so scary about the movie you know
because he was such an awesome character you know
it was it was really fas-
but you were kind of on his side because he was so fascinating
but but they couldn't leave him alone at all
and they found out what happened when they did leave him alone one time
but i won't tell you that just in case you see the movie
i'll probably try to go se- to see it in a little while here
oh very good
but it's been out for a while
have you heard anything on like out for justice
oh i haven't heard anything about it
but i don't like steven seagal things uh
has he had has he had very many other movies out
and there was one right before that with a similar title
like uh i don't know some i don't know some macho title
i i don't like that a lot
uh they just they're action filled and a little bit of humor
or you know
i like the more movies that make you think
did you ever see um um sleeping with the enemy
and that's something i really should have seen
i haven't i haven't heard much lately
and she said it was okay
you expect more out of uh julia roberts though
but i never did uh
well i saw half of it
and i remember i was in school i saw half of it
and i fell asleep
and everyone else watched it
i i uh i remember that movie
and uh it was
i mean i got in to it
they have f f x two out
i just i probably had a test that day or something
it's it's it's it's uh
but it you know
kind of on that end you know
and it's usually pretty good
i think i think though that movies are losing their luster
and i think it it's just losing its originality or something
i can't pin pinpoint it
but it doesn't seem like it's as big uh rage to get the movie theater as it used to be
i i i
um i don't know
it's it's it's hard to say
and i know i don't
you know i don't keep up with it
but uh i don't try to
ju- ju- just for that reason it is a it does cost a lot
so why go out and see something right away you know
and if something gets really good reviews maybe you'd finally go spend the twelve bucks
you know to go to it
but um you know i haven't been to a g- to an opening for oh you know ages
i get my current events basically from news uh just because i watch
pretty much a lot of television um
is it uh c n n or headline news or just local
i like to tune into to c n n because uh you know you can tune in like any time of day and pretty much get the update on
i think news today um it's kind of losing its importance
like on in on radio if you hear any news at all it's like two seconds
you know really quickly
on commercial radio i guess i i tend to get more of my news from national public radio of the morning on the way to work
so so i don't uh
but i do here
uh university of texas at dallas
but uh i'm a news reporter
i usually don't intentionally although i should i don't intentionally turn on the television to watch news
or i don't intentionally turn on the radio to listen to the news
now i will intentionally buy a newspaper to wa- to
but you pick your favorite section
and the rest
i like to listen to uh national public radio on the way to work because it's i don't know it's variety
is it is it pretty good coverage on there
they throw in a lot of you know a lot of interviews and commentaries
and they they present different sides of things
because i find like on k r l d
but each story is like no more than two or three lines you know
oh well they spend a little more time you know
and then they go into a lot of the issues and things where they they spend five or ten minutes discussing something and
especially when you look for the like popular radio stations like mostly the music stations news is is pretty much nonexistent
they have little little teeny-weeny news
breaks you know
and only in the morning i guess there's a little bit
so let's see um
and i guess i get some kinds of other you know business related news through trade journals and things
the only reason i get trade journals is like if i'm looking for a job or something
but um i think i think news is
i think it will be nonex- pretty much
and now it's it's kind of your final choice
and i think it
it's it takes a lot more time to read something
and you've got news
you know you
but i think that soon the paper may be kind of the only source again
well just because i'm i'm thinking that it it's getting so short on radio
you still you have two or three
i know in dallas you can probably get two two all news radio stations out of i don't how many popular radio stations
and then on television you have just the news at six and ten
and i just i just see that dwindling in in
i find it hard to believe that people will go back to reading over television i mean just given the way society is
and i enjoy reading
but most people would rather turn on the tube and and and
flip through the channels you know and get the headline news at thirty minutes of
and they don't have to go get one you know
one thing i like about the paper um as opposed
and and every point they make you know
and and it's all there
well that's why i like uh national public radio because they get on one of these little things
and then they'll get into something and really explore it
and it's it's informative
it's a lot more informative than you know quick half hour news shows that they tell you what they want you to hear
because that's what we do
i mean it's like each story is thirty seconds you know
so it's like you really have to tell as much as you can which is not much in that amount of time
so and it will probably get shorter and shorter as the years go by i think
communication you know expands the world now
and we saw it during the war just now is that we got all the information within minutes you know
and the question is how much of it or how some of it
i guess there's a lot of debate about censorship and and what we're really seeing
is it is it the true story
or is it a little bit biased
because even though we do get the story right away they were censored as to what they could tell us
so all we had to sit here and and ask is well what aren't they telling us you know
so that that was pretty scary
and she said that she didn't want to know what was going on because if she had a son over in saudi arabia she wouldn't want to know you know that they're bombing or or this and that's going on
and at the same time i talked to another woman
and she was so happy to know because she lived through vietnam
and she didn't know what was happening at that time
and she was so happy to get the information you know
so there's just a lot of different opinions on that
i i you know i like to to know what's going on
you know you get in the habit of like i say turn on headline news
and it will play over and over
and you just tune it out because it's the same thing
and then too a lot of times i think uh especially on television they blow things completely out of proportion
you know like this kennedy thing
you know what kind of shoes did he wear on the night
and you know it's just like okay this is ridiculous
like who cares
but what are you doing
well it was nice talking to you
well not necessarily in dallas
but it's a very short drive to areas near here
well i have done camping in the past
uh i can't remember when the last time i actually went camping was
it was uh several years ago
and then i did most of my camping in the mountains
well that must have been fun though
well it is
i have uh some land there
and so it's it's handy to to station yourself there on the land and then make trips up into the mountains for backpacking and hiking and and overnight camping
well that sounds fun
and one of them i don't really consider camping
and it was at a camp
i don't like those camping grounds where you know you got r v beside you and then another people in tents beside you
well it doesn't uh
and the first time i left him we went overnight camping
and we went and we found this little peninsula out in the middle of nowhere by the lake
and we had a ball
we just had uh sleeping bags and fire going
and we fried potatoes and bacon and everything for breakfast the next morning
oh it did
but my sister-in-law she's always done a lot of camping
and she's good
if you don't you'll find every rock on it when you put your
she was she is always prepared
i mean she brought everything from like i said toilet paper to the rake
the only thing we'd had to do we had to go out looking for some kind of a grill you know
we and we and we seen this old refrigerator that somebody had dumped and we broke the i guess it's the freezing component and we broke that out of there and put it over our um hole
oh what a clever idea i wouldn't have thought about that
well it held our pan and you know the potatoes and stuff
oh that's a good idea
well if you get a chance
now there are some really nice camping areas uh up in the wichitas which is in oklahoma and uh arkansas
it's it's on the oklahoma-arkansas border
and it won't take but just a you know just a quick look at a map to find where those mountains are
but i took a drive up through there as a matter of fact last september just took the drive through to see what was there
well i love to swim
so i like to get out by a lake or a uh you know somewhere close where we can swim
well lake lake tawakoni is a pretty nice place and we had a two bedroom mobile home there
but the boys still liked to throw their sleeping bags out by the lake and build a little fire and roast their marshmallows until the mosquitos bit and then they came in
oh oh they're grown now
oh so they don't go camping with you
well i haven't taken my little boy yet
he is so fearless he it terrifies me
oh don't be concerned
well it's the water he's not scared of
well it's easy to keep him occupied though on land
and i've them walk with me along the lakefront and we'd have a little contest finding the tiniest shell and finding the biggest shell
and or we'd hunt pine cones or we climbed some uh pinon pines one year and gathered the cones so that we could eat the pine nuts
and we did a lot of naturalist work when we were out
we you know we we searched for
and we ate the wild plants
and we gathered wild berries
and uh it's really you know the the mountains can accommodate you if you know what to find
i had my boys build their own little c- you know three leg camp stools by cutting a branch off the tree and binding them together with bark
well that sounds so neat
and uh we cooked in a pot
well i'm impressed
well they've always done a lot of camping
and there wasn't
but we just didn't get out
so and my mother wasn't into that
and that's who i stayed with
so we didn't do much outdoors stuff except swimming and we went swimming a lot
and uh oh excuse me my baby's getting sick
well if our time is up we can quit
um i've got to clean her up
so what's it been doing up there
all the farmers you know
well it's good for hay
i i'm working for a lady who has a strawberry field
and if we don't have rain she's going to lose a lot of money
oh my goodness
well we have been drenched
we have had so much rain for may and june that we've got all the uh weather people down here really confused
it it's just
you know it's quit raining you know by at least a month
and it's still
oh i hope they come
uh i don't know where where it came from
but it's been really
we got a lot of uh
and it feels like we live in houston
it's it it you know
like it rained today
and then it just kind of steamed everything up you know
uh it's been great because we haven't had to use our sprinkler system
it's uh it's hard to plan anything outside just because they show up out of nowhere
now see every everyone up here with their gardens they're not going to have much of a garden this year because it's so dry
well i hope you get some of that
and we're still uh forecast for more
uh does califor- is california getting rain then
uh i'm not real sure
and it's meeting what's coming out of the gulf
and it's just causing chaos
i mean these are good these are good summer rains you know electrical storms and and all that
so it's been it's been uh wet
and we've moved our yard i think three or four times in the last two or three weeks
oh my gosh
i mean just because it just keeps growing and growing and growing
and and one one week it just rained thunderstormed for a day straight
and you couldn't get out there
by the time you finally got out there where your lawn mower wouldn't sink we were you know
oh well see now we need
it's really drying up up here
well what always works for me is if i water my plants or we wash the car it usually rains
and it's surely going to rain
we you know
and uh let me think
and uh we w-
oh i don't know
i mean your talking september maybe
you know it was nippy but um like it was still in the seventies
you know high sixties low seventies in march
and we were there we were in new jersey last october and it was hotter there than it was here
and i was like oh i want to go home
because uh we had we packed to cool off you know brought shorts and sweaters and everything
and we just died
oh my gosh
so but i like it here
i wouldn't i wouldn't trade it for snow any day
see i like i like the snow
but i like to watch it fall
and i just like it where it's deep enough you know but not
and i can handle a vacation in it
and you know but my husband is from new jersey
and he wouldn't go back either
well isn't it weird at christmas time without snow
well see last year we had snow at christmas time
so it really wasn't it was weird because we had snow
so uh no
in fact uh you know we're used to running around in you know spring clothes in december
and so when it throws in a real cool winter we get broken pipes and and all that kind of stuff and because texas is just isn't built for you know real cold weather for long periods of time
well it's real dry down there
not not were we are
now in houston and stuff they've got it they've got it where no hairsprayer works
but here it's it's just about right
it's it's pretty dry and not too dry where you know you just it hurts to breathe
but we're just about right
we're just having this all this rain
and late rain has made it kind of uncomfortable
well we're right in a good stop because we're you know we get over in the over the hundreds in the summer
but it's it's not it's a dry heat
and it's not really as hot and muggy as it would be being over a hundred plus ninety degree humidity ninety percent humidity
see that's what's bad up here is when we do get the real you know hundred and the high nineties we have the humidity to go with it
so you're like real mucky
and you you know
yo- your legs stick together just from walking you know
so we like it where we're at
so but no
and people forget that they're live in texas
and they don't know how to drive in snow
and you know but uh i wouldn't trade it for anything
oh that's good
and i visited other areas
and i'm just a sun person i think
well i don't know
well i guess that's really about all
but in this case it's the only thing to talk about
but well michelle it's great talking to
um the last movie that i have seen
it's been it's been a couple of months
i saw um sleeping with the enemy and flatliners
did you see those because of uh julia roberts or
oh it was just
well someone had
and i thought i'd like it
and then uh one of my friends who went to see sleeping with the enemy and she told me to go
so that's why i saw that one
and i um i've seen uh
i haven't gotten to see an- you know any real recent ones
well that one is uh it's cute but kind of far out comedy
i uh am not one for the uh
i don't need the suspense movies or the
i uh i saw it and uh because my wife wanted to see it
uh but on the other hand i'm not sure i would have gone otherwise
and having gone uh
well it really wasn't on a theme that i was uh uh that into
or as i say th- i prefer the light movies that uh
my style of entertainment is is comedy uh primarily and then into action films
uh-huh well i didn't care for the movie myself
you kind of have to like to be uh drawn to this point where you aren't sure what's going to happen
uh it was interesting
but i felt that one was a bit farfetched
uh in that
well i'm trying to think of the other one i saw recently the one on um defending your life
oh i haven't even heard of that one
well that was one where uh
the the story line um
uh it was hard to accept that uh this uh multimillionaire wheeler dealer would uh would you know find himself and allow himself to get into that situation
well i really liked pretty woman
you know i just
well you just kind of went with it
but um flatliners now it's a drama
and i don't usually like them
and i really enjoyed it
i um i don't know
now did you care for that one
uh that was
i in that i i guess i i hate to be too surprised in a movie
and in that one you could you could pretty well guess where it was
but you knew where it would end up
see now i didn't
but it wasn't something that i would enjoy seeing twice or three times
i didn't think so um
when you know
but um i don't know you know
well of course uh a bunch of girls had told me and warned me
and they said oh it's a real tearjerker and da da da da da
meanwhile i sat through the movie and said well when are you when are you supposed to start crying you know
well whenever she starts crying
i didn't really uh i didn't really find it to be a tearjerker
well do you go to many movies more than once
um if i see them more than once i see them on video
but like you said i i enjoy the comedies a lot better
well these days it's uh
well if you don't with some of the movies if you don't go to them within the first four weeks the movie may have uh left town never to show up again until it comes back in video
so uh unless a movie is popular and stays around uh you probably will see it on video these days more likely than at the movie
so we have um
well i think just most people have v c r now
and we probably watch twice as many movies at home as we do at movie theaters
and i can't think of the name of it now that um
and it was it w- it was a drama
it wasn't a comedy uh
i at least what i hear on that one that it's coming out a second time in a in a longer version even though it was a long movie
we'll have to see because it's uh there was some talk about that
we're sort of in the middle of the summer um season of a lot of new movies coming out
but then there's these um periods like early fall before christmas or early spring when there's sort of a quiet period where if you bring something out again it uh will increase the revenues from the movie
well um what movies are showing down there now
oh i i'd actually have to get a newspaper out
my approach to movies is i kind of hear about them uh
but you know ask me to name the ten that are out there right now
and i'd have to say uh i uh i don't know
i i just look at the newspaper before i decide to go
i i know for sure that that one about
uh it's kind of
because some of them they uh they'll start in one area of the country
and if they it's
i i guess first of all i'll just say we haven't done much uh gardening
but uh our gardening we lost
but we lost our bushes in those and have been waiting to plant new ones
and so as far as our bushes we don't have any
but we do have some blackberry bushes
and and they were really hearty and stayed on
and we've done really well with them
and so they've been really good
and the kids i
but uh we go out
it it's hard to go out when it's this hot
and uh but uh keep the weeds out of them and and keep them off the ground so the ants don't eat them
and they're okay
i i love blackberries
and we uh
when i was smaller we my family lived in tennessee and there used to be wild blackberries that we'd go out and pick my brother and i
but i don't have any down here
uh we have some flowers that have
and they're bold
and they come up every year
but uh they're getting too thick
they're they're orange
and they look like a lily sort of
but i think they're real pretty when it rains because their petals don't soak the rain in
they they keep the the rain on the outside little rain drops
and and they look real pretty after the rain
and so i really like them
but i need to get out and and um
now as far as our grass it grows crazy
uh sometimes my husband does it
and sometimes my son does it
but it just is
i don't i don't know
and we can't seem to get ours green
and my neighbors on either side of me have beautiful lawns
and we have this god awful ugly thing
and and i know they must think
but my husband got some new fertilizer and stuff that
and he put it on the front yard to see how you know it would do and stuff before he put it on the backyard
but we've got a great dane in the back and she has eaten everything i have put out there
and she's eaten the bushes
i've tried to i spent like eight hours planting this nice garden out there and i barricaded it up
and i went and took a shower and looked back out there
and she was already in it
and i was so mad
so i can't do anything back there because she just she destroys it
but i've tried out in the front
but like you said that that freeze that came
i had some bushes that uh some shrubs i pu- put out front
and it killed those too
so i'm just real discouraged with the whole thing
the the other problem that we have
well it's funny because the one the two bushes on the ends of the house that i think are ugly they lived
that that happened to us
so like i wanted to go out and kill them too
and uh the
oh i know
and we just can't grow uh grass underneath there
but i've got pre- two good size cottonwood trees out in my front yard uh you know one on either side of the yard
and and they're big
and they're real full and everything you know in the summer time
but it it's killing everything underneath where the leaves are shading the tree
but toward the end of the summer you know when everything starts dying off and whatnot and then the light can get through the tree then the grass starts growing
but by then it's so late then the winter comes and it stops
you know it's it's it's a never ending cycle
so we've been trying to get something or to pull some grass underneath there and and whatnot
well i don't
but we've been thinking you know if we built up uh
or or some new bushes in there that would live
and so i think that we're going to try that
i i think the
now i have two long windows
and i'm trying to decide whether to put like bushes in front of them or not
you know maybe just halfway up the window or something like that so people can't see and hear too much
well i don't really have to worry about that that much because my sons' bedrooms are in the front
and they've got mini-blinds and stuff
but only only one is really like
and the other one is out on the porch
so there's not really much i can do about that
one is a bedroom for our our oldest son
and one is uh
and so i i really
well the flowers are out by the back of the house
so and that's why the front room is
so that's not too bad
but i like to look at the flowers
so i look at theirs
but it's funny because uh you try so hard i think sometimes to to anyway i do to do our yard and then it's like the wind blows
or and so even if you did get it under control it seems like in just a few
it it's really
so um a lot
it is it's not my favorite
well mine's getting there
and i do half
and and do it to where i don't have to go back out and redo it
that that's my only thing with him
that's why i'm help having him help me now
well some of the things i like to do are
and i sew and uh i like to sew sometimes for my kids
i i sew clothes for them every once in a while
and i'm i'm beginning to get a little bored with cross stitch
and then i have to bring it back
you know and and uh i don't know why that is
i don't know if it's looking at the little th-
well it reaches a point where it doesn't seem to be very challenging i think
and yet there's
but i do a lot of it in the car
oh do you
we commute from plano to dallas so i have nearly an hour both ways that i can really get a lot of work done
oh i bet
and i found that cross stitch is the easiest to do in the car
uh i've not really done any too much challenging uh stuff
i i can do it with a a needle and thread you know but uh and get about five small stitches in which is pretty good
but it's very long
oh i bet
but it's such a lost art
so uh i like to just mostly do the tie quilts
but uh the other ones are very pretty
instead of like yarn they tied uh ribbon into it
and it's real pretty
and when i look at it now she's been dead for a long time i think oh why didn't i learn these crafts and skills from her because she could crochet and do so many of the old things that aren't in vogue right now that people just don't know how to do
now did you say you could knit
well i was going to say because because if you could knit you could crochet
it's just like doing one handed as long as you learn how to to weave the the yarn in between your fingers on your left hand
and then you just use your right hand with the hook
and that's not
if you i think if you can do any handicraft you can learn to crochet
but i'm totally intimidated if i sit down at a sewing machine
and i get real nervous whereas usually the other needlework stuff is relaxing to me
but i just have a phobia about not being able to actually sew
and yet you know i think about you know
and and there are some beautiful just gorgeous patterns that people do
and i i just think that uh that's one of one of the arts that i think are really pretty
and a lot of people don't do that either
you know and so
well it's hard to find the time
i i wouldn't if i didn't have this car time ability probably because at night if i sit down i'm doing something with the kids or just not sitting down at all
you know and and i always think well i can do this and watch t v or something you know
and uh it seems like i always get my mind carried away to something else
and then it doesn't quite work
it's so i find myself putting glasses on to to watch t v and then taking them off to do needlework
and i get frustrated doing that
and you know i like to sketch
i can i can sketch something like if i see a picture like out of a book i can sketch that and that's nice and everything
but you know it's funny
and and yet i can't do you know like like uh craft uh on wood
but i certainly can't create
and i look at it
and you know you look at those things
and you wish so badly that you could do them
well sometimes even with that i i think you have to have some
well mostly uh a a little fresh water fish
but mostly lake fishing like rainbow trout and stuff because i used to live in utah
but uh down here i haven't fished much in texas
oh they're really not
what what kind of bait do you use to catch them
oh just usually worms night crawlers
oh i didn't know that
just little just little fish eggs
and it will stay relatively well
oh i didn't know that
yeah and and they really like that
now i have never caught catfish
oh look catfish uh
oh is that right
now in amarillo did you fish any of this
actually i always used to go to my grandparents' in oklahoma and they have the uh lake texoma right next to them
we used to catch some uh sand bass off lake there's a roosevelt bridge
and what we'd do is let the line all the way to the bottom and crank up you know turns on the reel about six to twelve times
and the fish would be sitting at different levels
oh how about that
and in no time something would hit it
and you could pull them up two and three times in a row
but you had to find out what level how many cranks they were off the bottom
and if you left it on the bottom there was a good chance that you'd catch catfish
and of course depending on how big your bait was uh you know would be depending on what you caught
oh i think that is really interesting
and we used to have a light at the top of the water
see and i wish i could go fishing here because i don't really know much about the fishing here
if you did it like you were just uh saying that's pretty much like rainbow trout
and then you wait and they troll it a little bit
well if you
well if you can fi-
well or even a lake
seems like every time somebody's on the bank all they want to do is throw it out just as far as they can and uh bring it in to you
but it's the opposite when you're fishing from a boat
you you want to l- make it land right on the shore and then drag like a plastic worm and just have it come into the water like a a regular animal or or fish uh well you know something coming off from the bank like they usually do
so you don't have to really get uh fish from a boat you know because they're actually right there at the shore
but i didn't used to be sold on plastic worms
but uh if
it just uh just a slow reel
and then let it sit on the bottom
but the key is to always have your line tight
and that way you can feel when they're hitting it
and believe me you'll know the difference
uh what kind of fish do you like the best to eat
oh crappie actually
oh do you
and i also like spanish mackerel
and you catch blues
and uh that's a different kind of fishing off the pier too
but but uh tell me what uh
my my neighbor has gone before and and done that
oh the best thing for crappie is those little spinner baits and and jigs
uh they have like yellow uh fuzz on a hook you know that kind of comes out
oh oh i know
uh they're sort of like well i want to say flies
but not exactly like
but they're a little heavier
and they're bigger
you don't even have to have a good rod or anything just just even a regular line and you throw it out
and uh the the other thing that's real good is small uh
and they're pure sil- all silver something real shiny about that long
and she has a lot of those those little uh
you know they're just real color- colorful things on onto her end
and she d- she's really a good fisher woman
well you sound like you're a good fisher woman too
and i am a substitute teacher at this point looking for a full-time job in the public school
well then you should be a good one to know because i my children are grown now
so uh i don't have firsthand experience right now
so what do you think
well i think the public school systems are doing a good job
but i think that um they are starting to head towards more technology and getting the kids computer literate earlier
you know my kindergartners were on the were on the computers
and i think that with the way the world is today that's got to be done
and i think that uh the schools now are starting to teach thinking strategies more than just giving them you know skills
and i think that that's something that is drastically needed because most of these kids cannot think
you know and that just
and uh this has been one of my pet peeves and probably why i went into education
so i think you know they're they're trying to head them into teaching them to think and use the education that they have
and i think that's very very important
i i agree with you that they're starting children so much earlier on things because our grandchildren
we have a uh fourth grader
and then we have one that's in kindergarten
and and i know the fourth grader is doing stuff that our children was doing were doing in the fifth and sixth grade
you know it's amazing
and her pre-algebra book is higher then
and it's like oh i going to take this home and study it before i can help you
you know so they're really they're really moving them along
and that's wha- you know
and uh so i think that it's it's appropriate to teach them you know why they are learning this not just because the teacher says you have to learn this
are you finding that uh since you're doing substitute that you're wanting to do full-time
um i have a friend that's a teacher that one of her complaints is she can't teach because she's so busy filling out all the forms
and and d-
are you do you find that
and you know you can as far as i'm concerned you can make a survey or test scores say anything you want it to say
and it's just a matter of how you're going to interpret it
and you waste so much time quote unquote teaching to the test to make sure that your scores are the very best they're possibly going to be
you know that i think it's uh i think it's crazy personally
you know the fir- the whole first nine weeks of school is is used as a review
but more than a review they're getting those kids primed and ready for the tests that are coming up in
and i think that's totally useless
i think you know there's a place and a time for all of the tests and comparisons
but i think they've taken it to the extent now that it's just ridiculous
you know and everybody's kids are the best kids that have ever hit this earth
and nobody else's children are going to ever live up to this
and that's great
but that's what they're doing with the school systems
and they're wasting too much time on that i think
well i i know that this again this this friend
uh is in the plano school district
and she teaches uh uh it mus- uh emotionally disturbed children
and she says she has um six graders in there that are reading on the level of the second grade
but because evidently you receive a certain amount of money when they're passed on or something
and i'm supposed to compare those with my my habits
um let's see
and i don- i
well at t i we have to use what's called a tex teller if we want to get cash out
and those are only available at t i
so if i'm in a mall or something i can't get cash out without paying extra money
so i'm always using credit cards
well myself i always tr-
i'm i'm a traveling person and i'm out of town quite a bit
so i use credit cards quite a lot also as far as everything from service work and gasoline in my car to my lounging entertainment and for everything
so that's uh
as far as using them outside that i'm not i don't use them too much
but i i think my wife is sort of like you
so she does most of the shopping for our household
so she'll use them more than i will
but do you get to pay the bills
so it's me i'm always i'm the guy
and i'll go in and charge something
and i'll have to give them my driver's license
but i do carry like my american express and my visa which i use for you know primarily work type things
oh it's mine too
oh is it really
so we're both beginners then
and i've been out of town
so this is my first time to to use it
now did you pick this topic
or were you given
they give you they assign you a topic
when you call the eight hundred number they assign you a topic and uh pretty uh cut and dried
um let's see
so how long are we supposed to talk for
about two minu- three minutes i think
but i really don't have too much more to say in regards to credit cards
like years ago my wife and i got married she was the one with a little bit than i was because i had my credit cards i think up to the limit
and i was giving
so now it's a little different
and i'll pay it the same day it comes
or at least i try to
and i just kind of tell my kids how much i hate paying interest
so they should follow the same rule
if you pay it that way it i mean it really is it's like getting a free loan for a while
oh you bet it's ju-
or if you travel for work and you get your reimbursement before the bill comes in
that's that's very handy
well i think that's all i have
well it was nice to meet you
and uh give it a try
in in the light of what has been happening lately with the doctors that i know and lawyers and whatnot i think national health insurance is a way to throw a lot of money at a very small problem
well if you took half the money that they would spend in the state of texas for health insurance and gave it to qualified students to so they could become doctors the problem would go away
i think the problem is that the doctor v- doctors have conspired to limit the number of doctors and that the lawyers have conspired to make sure that if you are a doctor you are going to pay high premiums on your h- uh unemp- i mean on your liability
well because i'm a nurse for one thing
and you think there are plenty of doctors
and i do know that o b which is my field the doctors' health in- the doctors' malpractice insurance is over two hundred thousand dollars a year that deliver babies
now they can't doing anything about that
people are very sue sue conscious
well that's probably true too
but people are very conscious of how much money they can get real fast these days
but you know when you think about reasonableness now i believe that a law suit should have some foundation in the tort theory
well a tort is when you do something wrong
well it uh
if the baby is born dead well that happens
if if they have complications and
well i know i mean there are guys that are real slobs
but you know there are also people out there that are really doing their job
and the people that are really doing their job are paying for everybody else
well that's true
because they have all these monitors now
and if anything looks even a little bit funny their only safety precaution is to go in and get that baby
and so it's costing more all around in health insurance for tests for surgery for longer hospital stay
so it's terrible
see i believe that there there is a system already in place for health care
you know they have indigent health care
you show up at parkland bleeding and they'll fix you
and we have that happen
and at the last minute they come to us
well uh we can't turn them away
so i'd like to wipe them all out
well i i happen to know a few
and i even claim one as a friend
but i also know an uh o b g y n who has stopped practicing
uh he just said
i mean he's not going to deliver any more babies ever
and you know he said i had to he had to ear- gross two million to take home as much as his malpractice
and most of them are very sincere
this this guy is catholic
i mean you know
well you can be human and catholic
but you're not likely to find somebody who is going to you know have a less conscientious effort
well you know who is getting rich
you know if you were able to write a malpractice insurance that would negate any financial obligation on the part of the doctor over and above the insurance
say say you have malpractice insurance and a kid dies or is malformed
and this semester i'll tell you what i it's been almost impossible for me to get you know back to regular exercise
so it was really easy for me to get quite a bit of exercise swimming
and um and since i worked at a recreation center i could uh you know use those facilities quite often
well swimming is uh one of the best exercises you can do
and there's and there's no jarring on the
and and it's least hard on your body
it's the least hard on your body as far as uh impact
um flu- yeah
well i do uh little aerobics oh three or four times a week
but it's not enough to
boy if i go in the summer time i try to jog jog a couple of miles and uh well you know even doing that three or four times a week when summer hits that's a hard thing to go out and and go jogging for uh half hour or so
but so i'm not quite getting the level that i need to
do you do you kind of think it's a chore
or do you enjoy it
i like it uh
so uh to do a whole lot just requires a lot of oh coordination as far as scheduling and that type of uh deal you know uh
uh i um i used to uh i used to weigh uh two hundred fifteen pounds
and now i weigh only about one about one seventy-five um
and uh i had started weight lifting quite regularly
and so i got my weight down
and it's kind of easy for me to forget about it now because uh you know when i'm not fat like i used to be i don't worry about it
although lately i have noticed you know even if i gain like two pounds i start i start feeling it
it's amazing how uh how much uh it changes
and i weigh probably about the same i weighed for oh i don't know how many years
but uh it's changed places
and things don't fit just quite exactly fit the same
but uh so do you do uh
in texas uh does
um i'm living in a dorm right now
and so right downstairs there's a facility
and i really feel kind of guilty for not working out more than i do because there's a facility right downstairs where all you know all we have to do is is uh run down there
or is it uh
if you can have find the time it's just the
i really do because i like to get you know get off alone and just do that for a while
but that's hard
it's uh like anything else whether or not you want to sacrifice another half hour
right and uh kind of have
if you're having the pressures of school and uh everything else it's kind of
course it's really you know
and you feel
i stopped eating meat about oh uh must have been eight months ago
i mean any kind of meat
or and i and i really feel a lot better
well there's a lot of fat in meat
that's it i mean that's about where almost all of the fat comes from and so i found that really helps
and unless you really like uh fish
and i like it
i mean if you go
and i like sugar too
that's that's a problem
anyway well it's uh nice talking to you
think we've uh covered all the subject
well good luck to you there in idaho
well you too
good luck uh
let me tell you it's uh
well i'm in graduate school now
it's a little different uh challenge isn't it
well it's good talking
where are you going studying
do you see as uh the changes that have occurred in the last
but uh to me what becomes socially acceptable
and i i don't know if it's a factor of me growing older and seeing things through different eyes or if it's a factor of our society actually moving in that direction
but i notice things on t v being more um open more i believe uh
and you know and specifically nudity things like that uh
i i've said several times to my husband that i feel like gee in ten years they'll have just full nudity on t v
and nobody will think anything of it
and to me that's surprising
to me that's that's a big change to accept it
and it comes across i think subtly you know a little at a time to where you get so used to seeing a little change that you know when they go one step further you don't notice it that much
well i think that society has come to a point where they're not responsible for any of their actions
somebody else uh made them do it
uh that's what i seem to see a lot of that uh no one is willing to take responsibility for their life and their choices
it's rather sue these guys because they made a foo- uh a seat belt that didn't work right
or uh that's what i think is a big one
and i think there's a lot of that
don't you think that maybe a lot of that came from um oh you know the the the era we went through that was like you know hey if it makes you happy do it
you know kind of like disregard to others
and and yes
we should take care of ourselves you know
and we should see to our own lives but not to a total disregard of others
um i don't know
and hers isn't a social thing as much as it's a stage they go through
but whenever something happens it's you made me hit that
and so i try to tell her everything isn't always somebody else's fault
you know you have to watch where you're going
and and so it's what you just said kind of hits home to me just through her
and another thing i think has changed quite a bit is uh the roles that men and women play
um in your opinion good or bad or both
well both you know
there's some great things that uh have come about with more equality
but i think that also
i think the role of women changing has been good in that women are feeling like in terms of their self confid- confidence their self worth you know i can do something
i can be somebody you know
and i think that's good
but um i think when you push you know maybe i think when that was first trying come about with you know what we know as the women's lib movement i think it was too extreme
um i think you can be feminine and still be all those other things too you know
and i think there's definite roles
and i think you know part of the break up of the family maybe it's because of the the the social changes
the fact that uh during their early changes where you know women did come more speak maybe speak out i was going to say come more out of themselves
but speak out
i think now less men are you know because they're used to it
um but i i don't know
i i i don't know why the families are breaking up
they go in and say well hey you know i'll stick with it while it's good
and then i'll get out
and i i i think that directly affects the effort that you put into that marriage or that commitment
uh it's been probably a month or so since i've been to the movies
course my my favorite now is is dances with wolves
oh it's an excellent movie
uh silence of the la- uh of the lambs was good
oh it's a i guess it's a mystery you'd call it
it's with uh jodie foster
and it uh it's pretty good
another one that i think i really liked was uh the fisher king
that was um robin williams
and uh and uh i can't the last name
uh we've not been having many opportunities to see movies lately
um we really enjoyed um dead poets' society
um several years back one we saw we saw we really really enjoyed was uh ordinary people with uh timothy hutton and uh mary tyler moore
and uh uh who played the father anyway excellent movie
that was that was an excellent movie
oh we loved it
uh he made kind of an odd sounding robin hood
but uh i mean you know basic
but you know it wasn't a bad movie
really and and i thoroughly enjoyed it
but i then i wasn't expecting any classic either
well um they did a real good job with it
um they didn't try to make him super human or you know invincible
they just just
i haven't not an opportunity to see that uh
you you know
i guess it it really isn't for everybody
it's it's pretty deep and uh uh philosophical
but i thought it had a wonderful message to it it's the kind you came out and looked at somebody and said you know i think i liked that
and then the more you got to thinking about it the more you thought you know i did like it
but when you first came out you weren't real sure
it sounds kind of like one uh we saw at home here on the rented it um clara's heart
um whoopi goldberg
and she played a uh
uh the nanny type
she she was a oh now i can't say it a haitian
anyway she uh she seemed to be that sort of person that seems half crazy
but then again she's got a whole lot on the ball
and the movie had the whole lot of philosophical content more than more than you know
it wasn't you know blood and guts and violence and and car chases type thing
and it's with sean young
and it's a it's a mystery
i mean you knew you knew when the murder was going to happen or something
but it was still so well done that it was enjoyable
that that takes a good bit to make one that's predictable that's still worth watching
i had uh uh
i like the i think it's called the uh
but no no
the jagged edge with uh
um serious problems in the public education and what can be done about it
well what do you think
well i that's funny because i just um quit my job to stay home with my kids
and um i was a teacher for seven years in the public schools
so i know a little bit about it not
well tell me about it
well um there there's some
it's such a a broad you know topic that y- you need to boil it down
but um one that um i thought was a problem that i thought it was a serious problem that i'm not sure it's being taken care of right now uh was like bilingual education for um different
um minority groups and like asians and um uh mexican americans and and just people in general that speak other languages that sometimes come from other countries or coming from different areas and they
and um as the school district i'm not sure how to go about it because it's hard to get one teacher that speaks all these languages and so most of these children are put in um either special ed or a bilingual program and then for just a small amount of time
and then they're into their
and so the teachers are not sure how to teach them math when they don't read or speak english
and so um a lot of the money isn't put into that
and so these children are just kind of sat in the corner
and a lot of the teachers
it n- it was not the teacher's fault
do you find that those parents um
and at the same time i've heard that it's even harder when both parents are required to work and can't spend you know that that time you know typically the mother was at home with uh the children and
and really society sort of dictates that uh you know both the parents work
and um i know i've heard some people talk about just the fact that even as far back as the you know the second and third grade uh if the kids had you know proper reading skills or learned proper reading skills that that would make a lot of difference
and it and it teaches language too
which is really good um
well i work at a university
and and it's really tough when we're uh uh
i i uh work at the university of texas at dallas
uh we have uh some pretty selective admissions requirements for incoming freshmen
and you know there are some students who are in the top ten percent of their class even some who are maybe you know in the top ten o- of their class
and their s a t scores are very low
and a lot of it has to do with their uh
their their language
it uh makes it tough because you know when they come in with scores that low they may be uh good students
but they just haven't achieved to their fullest potential
and they're going
to fail unless some sort of remedial uh education is given to them
and then it then it comes into well who's supposed to give it to them the colleges and universities or
well i know richardson school district has a has a wonderful program in the remedial reading um where you know
and and uh some children who need extra help are put into this um reading program
and it is just excellent
i wish that all the children could be exposed to that program you know
and i kn- i know that there are some parents that say how do i get my kids in that
and yet they don't qualify
but it's unfortunate that they don't qualify because i think everybody would benefit from these programs
so how many children do you have at home
that's why i i quit my job
uh you know i've been teaching since they were gosh newborns
and you know being a teacher and you see all these parents who are working and working and working and just you know don't have the time time time time
it was kind of getting to me where where i'm doing the same thing
and so um you know my children are getting older
and i was missing out on a lot
so i just decided to stay home for a while
well that's good
okay uh i guess we are just supposed to talk about things we do in our spare time
uh i basically read books
so i will just stay up and finish a book that i am
and i will work on one for a little bit you know and then the next one
but that's just kind of
well that is pretty impressive to have three books going
and what what kind of books do you read
uh just really different ones
uh i have one that i was reading on uh raising your children and then another one on a an autobiography and another one on uh uh uh like a crime story
oh do you like those detective stories
oh well that is interesting
actually i like to read also
but uh usually fall into one or two categories either true science fiction or fantasy on the one hand or highly technical
you must uh work for t i
and i am a computer scientist
but i have a lot of other hobbies
i am kind of uh i guess what you would call it a project person
and i love
like i have a shop
and when things break around the house i always try to fix them myself
and so hobby
it's its' funny uh
but it is a hobby too that i enjoy to do
well essentially anything you find in a house uh a stove or oven or a broken piece of porcelain or uh chipped tile on the floor i mean just anything
and you have a shop
well it it is not anything elaborate
but enough that again for anything in the house i could probably
well that is great
and in the car
and so uh i think i probably would consider that a hobby
he is he is pretty uh mobile in that area too
he he works on the cars
he rarely takes them in and uh he works on irons and all t v and stuff too
i think it it
but it can certainly help your finances
so do you have any art uh how do i say it creative or artistic hobbies
uh not really
i mean during christmas i work on you know like uh holiday sweat shirts and those kinds of things
well that's good
but but uh not really
well i don't necessarily either
i can plink out a song or two on a piano and i can uh
i guess uh graphic arts is that what they call it
but sweat shirts is certainly impressive
uh i belong to this organization for uh if if you have preschool children and uh every once and a while they will have a craft uh section for the moms and those are really neat
and we learn to do the uh transfer pictures
so we learn different crafts like that uh
well that is neat
do you do you cook for a hobby
or do you
but uh you know i
and usually once a week i will bake something
but it's not anything elaborate you know
but i think that still borders on hobby
so i have little projects
but drive my wife crazy
uh i wonder if you can construe raising children
and i stopped because it was so
the book is so detailed and you have to
and uh it is so detailed
well uh sort of mixed feelings about it i guess uh uh
i i s- i lean more towards the control side than than towards you know just the the free free army
uh on the other hand i it's it's sort of an issue of of uh
i'm not i'm not a great fan of of government control in general
and so it's it's kind of a tough issue
well i guess that i would like to to say that perhaps someplace in the middle where people could somehow qualify or uh have a legitimate use for the the the weapon i suppose because also living in this area the the problems in d c come home very quickly
i'm i'm sure
uh so you would take a position where somebody without without a uh uh
in other words if they just wanted to have a a gun to have in their home uh you wouldn't you wouldn't like them to be able to do that
well i'm not so sure about that
but i think somehow uh safety courses
or i don't know whether this could be something that was done in school
but somehow people
you know at least there's the moral issue that they they knew better
which is sort of you know flaky
i i have uh i have the impression that that the the majority of the problems that we have with guns are not are are probably not from the people that are are buying them through legitimate channels anyway
uh that may be wrong
uh you know i mean certainly there there are cases of of you know children who find their parents' gun or something and and shoot a brother or sister or you know things like that that need to be definitely avoided
and that's that's certainly within the channels
but uh a lot of the the crime i think that goes on i i don't know to what the degree the guns are are purchased through regular channels or they're illegal guns
this morning in our paper it there was an article about somebody who had bought three guns in virginia because all you have to do is get a driver's license
so he went over there and got a driver's license the same day bought three guns and went up to new york and sold them for you know very high markups
now in a sense that's a legal way of getting the guns
but certainly the the purpose is not very legal
i i mean i think uh some sta-
or i i don't know if it's been actually been implemented
i think so uh
or at least there's been talk about doing uh you know like waiting periods and and things like that
uh and and uh you know i i think stuff like that is perfectly good
i mean basically if you if you don't intend to do anything stra- you know if you if you're buying it for legitimate purposes waiting ten days shouldn't be a problem
you know and and things
i've you know
i i don't own a gun and and don't really
and i'd just as soon a lot fewer people did
uh but on the other hand you know uh like i say i kind of kind of against government control in general
and i suppose com- uh you know c- total ban would lead to more illegal weapons
and i you know
something about banning is that you know there there are so many weapons out there that that they're not going to disappear anytime soon
uh and they're already
i know there's a ready market for them you know
the stolen stolen guns can be sold
i mean the first thing a a a burglar will pick up if he can is a gun
because uh because they they can be so easily sold
and you know they're they're
but uh it's not like they're going to disappear all of a sudden uh even if you do do a total ban on them
uh it's a real tough problem
i i don't know
i mean i i grew up
and that's and that's sort of almost a separate issue
but that's true
i mean some people grew up with guns in the house
we never had any in the house so to me the you know the first time i saw a gun up close was a pretty scary thing
and i'm not sure that's good either
well we you know we i grew up with them
i mean i did some of it
but uh you know we didn't have any we never had any handguns or anything like that
we had you know had shotguns for for quail and pheasant hunting and things like that
and you know it was a whole different thing
and and gun safety was taken very seriously
and it was you know
i mean before we go hunting we we took safety courses uh you know
and and and it
but you know that's that seems to me to be just a whole another issue
i'm not certain that people are are are terribly concerned about other people
do you uh have a family budget
or how do you work your budgeting
uh we were both working at the time and so forth
and uh that
we had to do that until we finally got the house paid for and and other big bills taken care of
uh we have a a budget
but not as strict now as we used to because we don't have quite such a tight financial situation
so it it's uh it's helpful
i mean yes
and that did get us so that you know the house is paid for and uh other major things are taken care of
and now we can relax a little bit more because basically we don't really require as much on a daily or a monthly basis as we did before
so we don't have to have quite as strict uh a budget as we did
oh well we don't have a real strict budget
uh we have a a low budget to work on
but we uh you know
and then we just spend about so much
we don't i i don't know of a written figure of expenses that we you know keep to or anything
but i know that i go to the grocery store that we always stick within you know five dollars between here and there
i think i've i do that automatically myself
i mean i unconsciously uh you know stay in a within a with a certain amount because i i have enough food already stored here that i don't have to make any large purchase at any one time
and course we have a large garden here that we grow a lot of our own stuff
and we freeze a lot of that
so a lot of the vegetables are taken care of in our own p- personal storage
oh you guys sound pretty self sufficient
and then uh the next time i go to the store why i pick it up and fill it up
so it's it's worked very well that way
that way we
uh the other person might not know about it
well that's a good idea
the other thing there the topic was talking about was if if uh
all i can think of is if you don't keep a real a real tight budget how do you control expenses
but uh one
well not fly back
but somehow we get back there
and uh this year we did it by train because it was the least expensive
well actually it's more interesting too if you've got the time
and uh you know we could go to both places without having to spend so much for plane fare
and so uh we find that if we're careful with our you know just everyday things like grocery shopping and and gas and entertainment things like that then uh somewhere in out in the wash it will come out that we have enough to get back there
well i think we unconsciously
excuse me my throat's not as clear today as it should be
uh we are uh going to be traveling to europe with a choral
we sing with a so called pennsylvania choral and we make a two weeks tour of of uh foreign countries
and of course that costs money
so we uh
each of us watches the funds that we spend and make sure that that we gather together over a period a time enough money to to make this trip
so th- that is another way of uh budgeting and i think we just sort of unconsciously do it
we uh just live a normal life
but we don't throw any money away particularly
we save it for this trip which is uh always very very nice
but whenever i find you know a dime or something on the ground i i'll probably pick it up
you know just count it up at the end of the year something
well let's face it
the when we're talking budget it is important to to have a budget
and uh i i keep track of mine on a more rough basis now by just watching the level of my checking account
and i have a money market account also
and uh i keep those levels up above a certain minimum
and i'm always trying to
well are you in the market for a new car
uh well yeah
well act- actually i'm looking for another car
but uh uh new
uh sports car
uh usually either black or red
well not so much that as it is
i've had so many times when uh uh you know i'll have a friend next to me or i see somebody uh guy broken down on the side of the road and try to lean over and roll down the window
or you know if i'm driving along and there's somebody next to me and uh somebody that i know and you try to talk to them it's real difficult to drive reach over and try to roll down the window
and uh so power locks power windows are just just things that uh just really help a lot
well i guess i'm uh more traditional in that i don't like p-
because the people that i know h- who have them always seem to have trouble with them
and uh so i don't i just don't like anything that i can't figure out why it doesn't work
and then i want you know good uh gas mileage
and i want an air bag
and uh i guess
somehow i just think you know i like the idea
well it it see- sure seems to save lives
and uh yeah
i actually i like the anti-lock brakes
and i have never had a chance to
but i've never tromped on the brakes to see uh you know on ice or water just to see if they didn't lock up
but uh you think you'd buy uh an american car or a european or japanese
well i actually i don't know a lot about different brands
i tend to have you know my requirements like the last time i bought a car i i guess i did sort of prefer american
and my requirements were basically you know good repair record good mileage uh
i wanted s- uh stick shift and so i didn't have a whole lot of choice
there was one car in all of the the metropolitan area that i could find that you know was sort of a medium priced car with a
it it turned out to be a a chrysler uh
and it basically it was something that a military guy had ordered and hadn't picked up
and so it had been on the lot three months
and they were really eager to sell it
so i guess in this area at least you know if it's not automatic it doesn't move
well actually i much prefer a stick shift
and what i'm i'm curious
i i know why i love a stick shift
well i just wanted it because again i had i guess traditionally always had a car that had one
and i thought it would be more reliable
i mean most of the sports cars are stick shift
well i'm not even sure all of them are anymore at least in this area
but now the people i've talked to don't seem to have stick shift
and so why do you like stick shift
uh i guess i i grew up on it and it's fun
it's it's an enjoyable part of driving
i do feel like i have uh more control over the car
and it it to me it gives me more a lot more control in snow and ice and slick conditions
uh it i- it does uh
it it's really more fun than anything
else as long as you're not stuck in heavy traffic it's fun
and actually it's probably safer on you know at long trips because it keeps you more active
uh of course i like gadgets and and uh fun things
well let me go ahead and press one
well and when i have my spare time
actually it's a cherished commodity now days huh
uh i do enjoy uh sewing
i hand uh
and i i've been doing a a picture for my father-in-law
but if i uh ever get enough spare time
and some other things i like to do are is music and uh also reading
well i enjoy singing
and i uh
one thing that i like to do uh is sit down and play the piano
but i uh sit down and enjoy playing musical selections that i am familiar with
my fam- my family is familiar with
uh a couple of hobbies that i also have is uh
and the biggest hobbies i have right now are my kids and whatever they are involved in
like my uh oldest boy is involved in soccer
so we go out and play kick the soccer ball around or play throw the football
and uh we also like to uh ride bicycles
so we're riding bicycles
and so a lot of the hobbies that i have right now are centered around my my children and also things that my wife and i like to do together
and uh so personally
i really enjoyed uh mountain climbing
i really enjoyed skiing uh and a lot of outdoor activities
uh there's not a whole lot of mountains here in texas that i can go skiing with that right now
but hopefully i will be able to get back to the slopes some day
but uh i grew up in arizona which has some mountains around it
but uh never did get out and ski
didn't have the uh i guess i didn't have the person out there saying hey let me take you skiing
and of course i was at that you know stage of my life where i had to be taken to p- places
and then of course once i got to the age where i could have done it myself i had other interests i guess
and so we we went quite often
and uh in fact my brother still does a lot of skiing
and we would go skiing and enjoy that
so but uh luckily it's kind of unusual because hobbies it's a it's a nice thing to have
and it's good to fall back on those hobbies when you have time to like you mentioned
and i am finding out a lot of the spare time that i had isn't there
it's uh it's uh taken up by activities with uh work with family with uh civic and church responsibilities for me
i i find if i i make i have to make myself realize that it is important to get out there and you know just even to go for a walk is good recreation for me
and my youngest daughter is going to be starting up soccer
so she's real excited about doing that
so you have participated with that in the past
have you par- participated in that in the past
well i did with my older daughter and she was in it for a few years
but she has got so many interests herself that
and well the first one to go
she still likes her piano and she is in band
so she's got lots of hobbies or uh activities going on
well leslie it's been very nice talking to you
is there anything else that you would like to uh
well thank you
and you have a nice evening
well are you a fisher person are you
well it's mostly from the rivers and lakes
well what kind of fish do they have in your neck of the woods
well it uh
down here we usually catch catfish and bass stripped bass you know where i fish
and trout up at uh lake shasta when i go up there
but i like it all except uh really i don't i don't really care that much for the trout
i grew up in nebraska and uh grew up fish cat fishing in the little blue river
and then uh we moved to uh south dakota and uh did a lot of walleye fishing on the missouri river
and uh now that we are down here i think a lot of people do some uh bass fishing and strip bass fishing
but uh i still uh i am sort of a catfish man at heart
see well uh like in uh iowa and nebraska those little bullheads they look just like catfish huh
you know that's what i mean cause i am from iowa
and uh you know we use to catch those little bullheads
you know uh did you get to go fishing very often
so it's been a little over a year now
but uh i i am not quite sure what residency is for a fishing license here
and i so really i haven't gone fishing for about two years now and it's driving me crazy
but uh one of these days i will go over to uh lake lewisville or uh
well uh you like to eat them after you catch them
because there's are a lot of people that like to go fishing
but they don't like to eat them
most of the time uh if we catch something we'll take it home and eat it
uh and you're right
i mean i like to fish for trout
and they are really uh uh good fighters
but uh if i went to a restaurant that probably wouldn't be the first thing i would order if i had a choice of fish on the menu
if i go to a restaurant and order fish it's usually either salmon or uh red snapper
or do you fillet them out
how do you how do you
we uh skin them
and then i just uh flour them salt and pepper them and cook them
you know uh that's the way my mother taught me to fry them
well that's how we do it too
uh although we uh use to set some uh trout lines out
and we've caught you know fourteen fifteen pound catfish
and sometimes those are good to uh do on a barbecue grill and just leave the skin on and uh do it with uh butter on uh on on tin foil and then the skin just basically scrapes right off
and uh wer-
and it really tastes pretty good
well you know i don't think i've ever tried cooking those uh catfish quite that big
uh most of them are just the small you know pan frying ones
well i am hoping one of these days i'll have the opportunity to catch a big catfish like that on uh a rod and reel
but uh so far it's just been on uh on the trout lines
and uh well up in uh south dakota on the in the missouri river there we've uh tied into a few northern pike
and uh they really uh
but in the summer time they'll uh give you a run for your money
so when you were
so it was just like the rivers and uh the lakes i suppose huh
in in nebraska
most of the time uh we just fished uh in the river although there were a lot of sand pits and things like that that we could fish in
and a lot of them ended up being close to the river
so if the river every uh flooded you know then obviously they would dump some catfish and bass and stuff into the into the ponds and the sand pits and so we would do a lot of fishing there too
but uh south dakota didn't really have much for
it certainly is uh going to be a pleasure to chat with you
uh through nancy dahlgren
she um she had somehow gotten the information from t i and was distributing it around
well now what would you say about these everyday invasions of our privacy
um see i'm not sure that
but i think that the opportunity is definitely there for um people to invade your privacy when they want to
i think it's um
well it's certainly not that difficult to tap a phone
and let's see
well what's the first thing that comes to your mind
well the thing that i thought they were uh concerned about was was people calling on the phone from all over the country to sell you something and in reality in many cases they knew or they had information about you that was purchased from some other organizations
and i thought was uh beginning to invade the privacy of people because the things about where you live and and maybe what you purchased in past months is then put down and sent to someone else in the same business
and they in return come back and try to sell you something with this additional knowledge
um and i think that all that information is quite easy for anyone to get
it's possible for almost anyone to get information about your credit history for instance if they just um twist the right arm or claim to be from the right organization when they're calling the credit company
it's you know possible for a thirteen year old hacker with a modem to find out almost anything about your personal history not to mention change it if he wants to
you mean your history in regards to uh the charge card company or something like that
well for instance yes um
and they'll probably goes into other things like you know your records with the government or utility companies or anything
do you consider these serious uh problems
um uh not not yet anyways because i don't think they're widespread enough
but i think they have the potential of becoming serious problems
well what should we do about it
or what could be done about it do you think to correct it
um i'm not really sure because the i mean society is going more and more electronic
and there are certainly benefits to its doing so
and it's hard to hard to say whether the um risks have potential of outweighing the benefits or not
and i'm not sure what can be done to ensure that they don't
well i would think that uh information held on records uh by any company or charge card dealer or person should be absolutely private and and not be allowed to be uh to given out by those companies
i mean it should be made a a uh national or a state law to protect people so that uh you would then feel more free to deal direct with these companies
in other words if you call the company yourself directly uh and then know that what you tell them will be on their records but will not be available to anyone else uh you know from the outside so to speak then you would you would feel more free to uh to go into detail with them but but we have no control of that now and then uh you you're when you're talking with them you really don't want to tell them everything that's on your mind because you you feel that it someday might be used against you
and and then if i'm lucky i might be able to hear something through news wise
but uh other than that that's probably how i get my source unless something really tragic
but uh most of the time it is through the news in the evening
so that's about the
uh not that i don't enjoy
but uh part of it is because i just don't
and i might look through it real quick if there's something that catches my interest uh in regards to what's going on around the county or little bit of the state
but the majority of the time now i don't get a daily newspaper where you know i get tons of uh news coming in
oh you do
we have we have two newspapers
and uh i'm uh in in a government position that i'm in the news a lot
so uh i i kind of look through to see see what uh i'm quoted in
but uh how how bad the quotes are every day
to see if they did it or if they uh criticize you or put something in there wrong
or uh sometimes there's uh letter to the editor about me
or there's a even uh editorials for and against what i'm doing
but uh but t v uh the t v i i don't really watch even if i'm even if i'm on it
well that's that's kind of like you said then
we we are kind of on the opposite where i get home and uh while i'm cooking supper the t v is on and watching the news or trying to catch up with what is going on
and uh very seldom do i catch the ten o'clock
so by that time you know old news is probably what i hear through the grapevine or whatever
but uh unless there is a big issue going on like when we were at war then i think everybody was glued to the t v to find out what was going on
but uh other than that no
c n n had the uh
well it brought kind of uh more of a vivid uh look at what was going on when they were dropping the bombs and just a lot of different things
but uh yeah
and uh other people that you know do it differently or don't even watch any news at all
well the thing is with with t v i i uh
a lot of times the the news on uh the local t v is so brief you really don't get the full picture of what uh what's going on
and uh that's that's a problem that i have is not getting just a little brief uh idea of what's happening
a clip you know a sentence or two
and that's about it of what went on
and uh they have so much other information to cover in such a short period of time
but i like the weather report
so i wa-
i alway always i always turn that on that's one part i watch because of uh i go surfing down here
and i always want to watch the weather for when the waves are going to be good
so you're right on the coast line
you're not uh further up
i suppose you watch for huri- hurricanes coming in and things like that
that's about the only time in the in the summer uh if you're watching t v for the weather even though it's very hard to predict what's going on
they'll kind of say well there's a thunderstorm warning or whatever
this is the what is expected
but a lot of times things happen and change here so drastically uh so fast you know where movement that was coming in has shifted or whatever
uh hundreds of miles out
so i can predict my my week and where i'm going to be
so i can be at the at the beach when the waves start coming in
so anyway i don't know if our time is getting up here
or it's got to be fairly close to that
and uh maybe people that have a lot of responsibility over a large mass of people
but in general uh you know
and i know that companies do
uh so you know they kind of have gotten into the idea that let's drug test them and let's put them through rehab
but there's got to be like a limitation
and or do we kind of say well you can be drug tested
and you look okay because you look this way
you're you're very conservative
and and there's just no way that we would think that you would use drugs
but the guy that doesn't fit the stereotype of uh the conservative or whatever could be drug tested
uh you know whether legal rights and of that person
there's certainly a lot of things to really consider uh when you get into drug testing people just at the work place unless of course like i said they have a large responsibility over a mass of people
uh that's about it
it it it's just not the com-
and i think that's what companies are doing uh more and more because there are products that are out there
if if uh if the company is liable for something that that a employee does while under the influence of of a drug you know then by all means they should have the right to to to
and there's also the case about just uh uh health health and welfare of the uh
and not only a- not only low there's all sorts of a of a benefits uh financial benefits associated with having you know having people file fewer claims being sick
there there's the whole question that that a that a work force that is known not to be on drugs is going to be more healthy
the only thing is uh
if they have had like uh medications in the past let's say once a month or twice a month or three times a month or maybe that week they take an advil
and the advil will apparently come out positive as if they smoked marijuana
uh and there's poppy seed type things
but uh where's the line where you where you say to somebody i'm going to drug test you tomorrow
so please do not take these medications
you know how can how you can do it
the question becomes what do you do about somebody who tests
and th- the only thing that i would say on that is it could blacklist an employee later on
let's say uh you've taken medication of some sort even though they usually have you at the time list what medications you've taken
uh let's say you do come out positive
and you've taken advil or any of the ibuprofen products out there
or you've had a cold
and you've been on medication or whatever
is it then the chance that the employer will look at you in more of a negative fashion and say well you know this is kind of iffy you know
or or they on drugs
where there might be in the back of the mind of the employer that this person uh is on drugs
or make up they may make up their mind that let's get rid of this employee
i think clearly the person who is the line own- the line manager the employee should not be privy to the information of drug testing
that should go to an entirely different uh agency within a corporation
and it's a
it it's kind of like uh
uh i don't know
but uh since i've had children it has changed a little bit
but uh when my husband and i were uh camping we'd take this domed tent that uh is easily collapsible and uh go camping and uh just kind of roughed it
but uh we'd get up at three in the morning and start on our little uh escapade for the day and uh kind of uh do a lot of different things and then stop when we wanted to
but uh that's kind of changed now
and you don't want them up that early
would you then go ha- hiking
i mean would the camping be part of a long hike
so we kind of did a little bit of hiking sure and a little bit of uh sightseeing uh different areas uh sitting back at different areas and spending hours
were you up in in wisconsin
or would you go into can-
well there's uh places in wisconsin
there's the apostle islands uh which are in bayfield which is a wonderful place
and then there's also uh what we found uh in the state of uh south dakota the black hills
and we just have this uh really good time there
and uh sorry to say
so that kind of puts a little bit of a hamper on your uh you know
if if you're going to go camping who wants to deal with bugs
and it's just wonderful not to be bugged all night long with a humming mosquito at your ear
well most of my camping
i haven't done much since i was a kid but uh we'd basically take the tent up in the sierras and uh usually just camp near some stream or some lake
and uh just
it wasn't even a a full tent
it would be more a tarp uh strung up between trees
and my dad would take uh four kids
my brother and myself and two cousins and uh we just thought it was absolute heaven
uh there was certainly nothing like a a bathroom a shower or anything
and uh and i i'm not sure i'd do that that anymore
but it's it uh uh
actually some friends of mine and i are planning to camp this summer uh for four days
also going fishing uh and i have a idea it's going to be a a lot more equipment and a lot more stuff
than it when you were younger
with kids they don't care you know uh a l- about a lot of things
but as adults uh it's like if i don't take a shower every day i feel like you know ooh
i i just don't feel right
so there's lots of places if you're going to go camping
it's kind of
if you can find uh some really nice clean uh campgrounds versus uh if you go to state parks uh
but uh they're certainly not up to a standard of a k o a where it's you know a little bit cleaner
it's not you know in the same category
state parks you know you get a little bit fearful too uh you know things like that simply because it they are supposed to be patrolled
but uh you know it's it's a little bit different
but so we've always kind of stayed with a k o a and then uh did other things besides just sit at the campground at night
if you're going to be gone all day long walking someplace or doing tourism or whatever uh you're camping really is just for like in the evening to start the fire to sit back and watch a fire uh to enjoy that you know and then to get up in the morning and get a shower and get cleaned up that kind of stuff
so we never really spent that much time at the campground as much as we did
uh caught his interview last night with david frost
and it was the the first time i had you know heard uh his views expressed by himself
but the whole phenomena of him coming out of uh literally nowhere and no party uh at least no apparent party support on either side
when you when you said it it was kind of like a surprise
uh in that at- you know in that aspect
like now the new house bill that went to minnesota uh being that it is their neighboring state and that i lived in minnesota i'm more familiar with the politics that involved with that and that being passed
but uh as far as politics in the grander uh part of it as if you want to look at uh election type things i'm not quite sure even if i'm going to vote
uh it gets harder and harder each time an election comes up like that to make the decision on who would be the best to run
well it seems that the decision so far has been filtered by uh you know party politics so much that when the candidates finally get party approval party support and therefore get presented to the public the the candidates are already beyond what uh most public uh feels is acceptable behavior
you know the
one of the common criticisms of clinton is uh gee he'll say or do anything in order to get to the white house
and and up and to the point of uh perot being a serious candidate it seems like that that was a requirement of being a a contender within the party is to have done all those things
i mean here's here's a guy who for twenty years has been working toward you know getting the party nomination and and preparing himself for the presidency
and now it seems like both he and the incumbent president are you know pretty seriously threatened by somebody who comes out of a whole nonpolitical arena
he might be a a one of those
uh it it's kind of when you think back of the old politics where a dirt farmer uh
i mean they were not rich in in any means
and it has been kind of in the past uh i don't know maybe fifty years that in order for a person to get involved with politics they've had to have money
and you had to have the views of the people that were going to be paying your way
uh so it makes the common person uh
and i don't know if we'll ever see that you know where a common person could ever get in there that has good moral standings and uh has uh you know
you think of abraham lincoln and you know just the background of abraham lincoln you know teaching himself to read
he didn't you know do all the other things that uh you know you would think that was real popular to do and to get po- politically involved in and have money
uh and now it's
and and yet even he was a a consummate politician in the sense that uh not only did he uh fail in business twice with bankruptcy and failure but he lost some eighteen elections before he finally won one
and the first d- and the first and only election he won was uh the presidency
he he had lost every other office that he had you know
he was appointed a couple of times to like uh uh state legislator
so you really know a lot of his background
then then when he finally you know did win an election uh you know it was the presidency
whether or not i you know
i really have to ask them why you know
uh it's the toughest job in the world to do
and not only that you don't have that much freedom to make choices
i mean you have to go through so many different
you have to go the house the congress and all of the o- other things to get a bill passed
and sure you can veto
but then it's not like you have all that power
and i think long time ago presidents did have a lot of power
so uh then do you keep kids
or do you keep children for other people
oh that's exactly what i have
my my little girl was three and a half in march
and my son was two in january
well mine was two in march
and the three and a half year old will be four in in july
so that is pretty close
but i'm home with the kids all day
and i have really uh tried to make that a priority even though it's financially a big strain on us
uh i work part-time
but uh my husband's able you know mostly to take care of them when i'm working
oh how neat
but uh we adopted these two little guys and that was another reason why i really wanted to be here because you know they have had a couple foster homes already
so he probably doesn't remember
and his brother was twenty twenty-two months
well that's that's pretty interesting
well i have always wanted to be able to stay home with my kids you know
that was always my dream you know
i wasn't necessarily a career person but as long as i was single and had to work i was going to get a good job and do the best i could
and my husband was in the type of business that you know
so you have to build a clientele
and by the time we had kids i couldn't quit
and so i haven't been able to quit yet
so i've had to deal a lot with child care
and course we're hoping within hopefully the next two years i'll be able to quit and stay home
but uh i started out uh
oh that's neat
and it worked out pretty good
you know we had always said from the beginning that if it gets in the way of the friendship then i'll take them somewhere else
you know the friendship is more important
and uh it was a wonderful experience for my kids because she really loved them you know
and i i knew you know
that's the hardest thing i think you know to to deal with is that people love your
i put uh my oldest in a preschool program just for him to have the experience of two mornings a week of being with other kids and starting to learn some taking turns and you know that kind of thing
and uh he was in there for three months when i pulled him out
and the the teacher had eleven kids
and i had several friends who had had recommended it too
but it really gets down to the particular teacher
and she was a new teacher at the school
and she had eleven you know three year olds in a room
and i just think it was way too much
but she had no help
oh that is hard
and she was just my uh
and she just kept saying how wild he was
well you know there was kind of a connotation there of him being you know it being a problem
like he ran back from the bathroom singing and skipping she said
well you know at three years old i don't find that to be a behavioral problem
i mean it's kind of like she was there was so much going on that she felt like she needed to control more and it's really hard to con-
you can't control eleven three year olds with one person you know
yeah you know
so i just finally took him out plus financial reasons
but i was real careful and visited and everything ahead of time
but i still felt like even after all the checking i did
i felt safe that the kids weren't going to be left alone somewhere in a room where a teacher could do something inappropriate with them you know because there was enough classrooms close together that it was like a house with different classrooms
and i felt like that was a big factor for me
that they would would be safe you know from any kind of abuse or that kind of thing
well when when my friend decided to go back to work and whenever we had problems it worked out okay because she would come and tell me
and we'd work it out
after that i found another girl that had gone to church with us that you know they needed it financially
and i though
well you know we'll try her
but she came to our house
and that just did not work
uh i mean she loved the kids
and she was good with them
but uh you know they were filthy
now i understand kids go out and play
and they get dirty
and the and i was like gosh
and then you know my own furniture and stuff was like you know
the kitchen table the i'd find peanut butter and jelly all over the table and the chairs
and i was like
and then in the end uh she basically ended up stealing a hundred dollars from me
so i was i had a pretty bad taste in my mouth
well you know i work eight to five thirty
so what am i supposed to do
so i well i had been sick
so i stayed home with them
and we went to some of the kindercares
i was i took the kids there once just to try it
well that's what they said
and they said well bring them in this week for a free day
so i lined up someone tuesday
they had a mother's day out that my baby-sitter took them to you know which was fine
and so i stayed with them monday
and then friday my husband and i split
but on thursday i didn't like the kindercares
i had one bad i had two bad experiences just that one day with medicine that my son was supposed to have for a cold that they never gave him
and the other one was that the the younger one got bit really badly by another child
and what they did was they took my
oh that's horrible
and doing something with him
well not only was it going to cost me like a hundred and fifty dollars more a month which i didn't have
we're we're a christian family
and you know they because they're you know like public
so you feel like your values aren't getting
and i don't want them indoctrinated you know
but i'd like them to be able to say gee god made the flowers you know and things like that
you know basic things like that
so uh i talked to another lady at church
and she said oh i found the most wonderful place that i've been taking my daughter
and i've know this girl
so i really i you i i value her opinion
and she told me about a private one
it it was associated with one of the churches here
but it's you know it it was lubbock view christian church
and it's a private academy
and so i went over there
and i talked to the lady
well they have like a three year waiting list
but she said i had a mother tell me that she may take a job in san antonio
and she has a three year old and a toddler which mine was at the time
and she said i should know something by tomorrow which was friday
and she said if she leaves she said i'll let you have her spot
and so friday afternoon at five thirty she called me
and she said she's going
oh what luck
and uh so since october then they have been going there
oh that's great
and the cost was not near as much as the kindercares
so they don't have to charge as much
oh that's great
and the hours are wonderful
and i just i think it's the best thing
i told russ yest- that we should have done this a long time ago you know
so i guess as long as i have to work i feel good that they're there
they teach them you know the alphabet the numbers the things which you know if they learn they learn
i don't feel like i have to indoctrinate them by age three but it's kind of neat when they come home with it you know
it's not a big you know trauma to them to learn something
oh and the teachers
well taylor got bit several times
and taylor bit several times
and the teachers dealt with that
and we keep them apart
and we scold them
and we correct them
and you know they mark it all down
and they let you know
and he doesn't do it anymore
and they work at the potty train-
i just just
and the older brother is
so it is it's hard
i know and that's hard
well and it it you know
but i understa-
i i i wish you could find a good mother's day out because that would be good for your peace of mind also
even for just a couple days a mornings a week or something to have something like that
so i i think i'm going to look for that
i was been meaning to do that you know
because some of the churches do have them uh you know for like six dollars per child and that's not that big a deal you know
and that's usually like you know
so that was a pretty good pretty good time you know
so that worked out real good
well i'm tickled to death
and it was good talking to you
well i guess
it said child care criteria and i think we both listed an experience
well thanks a lot
and you too
i was thinking about camping and different i- people's ideas about it
and they got the big old antennas up so they can watch their t v when they're going
and we've just gotten one of those little tents
and that's what we camp in
so we kind of rough it
well so do we
so we'd sleep on those picnic tables at roadside parks
i mean i know it's dangerous
but we did
and we were doing the same thing
and so we were on top of a picnic table with our our sleeping bags i guess
and this ranger comes up with this light shines it on us and said that we're just bear bait out there we had our food you know
gosh bear bait
and we go up there fairly often
and we've done things like when when it's kind of cold
and we've all got heaters in our tents
and in the summer
but we've got the fans going
so we're not roughing it too much
and we have taken t v out there for the kids
and they've got their electrical hookups
so it's not so bad
like a week at a time or just weekends
and they even they had a library at one time out there
so that's really not roughing it so much
and a pool to go to
and there was nobody else
and it was just really nice that time of year
but we didn't need it
well my husband has even camped at lake lavon with one of his friends
i mean it's not very many miles from our house at all
but they had
and we've taken
and it ended up when it came time for us to pull in for the night we'd take a vote
and most of the time we decided we wanted to stay in a hotel
instead of getting out all that stuff you know
but we're set now
and we've got our bug light
and everybody's got their sleeping bags
w- we were looking at those in a magazine
and yeah you can if you can reverse the
nozzle on your vacuum cleaner and it blows air out instead of sucking it in
and you can fill them up that way
but something that's smaller would be a lot more convenient
we have a s- my husband and i we have a pickup truck
so there's plenty of room to hold things
now we've used a hair dryer before
but i put it on hot and also melted it
we take we take our dog camping
she sleeps she sleeps in the tent with us
oh me either
and then one night we were camping
and it came just a torrential downpour
it was just that bad you know
and we decided we'd just go across the road to the office and see if we could rent anything
so i got a condo with a jacuzzi
and it was wonderful
oh i bet it
when we were younger when i was a kid we camped in virginia
and we had one of those little pop up tents which is really nice because it kind of gets you off the ground
but it seemed like it rained every weekend for about a y- the year we were really into camping
you know you the lid pops off
the little tent comes up the top and it had two double beds in it
oh since the beginning
so do you work for t i
uh well i work as a temporary in the speech lab
and what exactly are they going to do
oh they turn them over to somebody
and they're going to i guess they're going to try to teach computers how to recognize voices and search for specific words and stuff
so any voice no matter what the
oh that's kind of neat
like if they say i i we just type it in like that
well i guess that's it for camping uh
and you make sure that you keep up with them for the next time
and they've got the elastic on the inside of the poles
and you just put them together
and it's a dome tent
and that was sort of miserable
it it was in your bed
it was in padre island and in a truck off corpus not but not in a tent
oh well that's about all
well it's good talking to you
are are you at t i austin
well i left t i in january
but i signed up for this before i did
oh that's great
uh uh my daughter has talked to my daughter up here with us
and she's talked to students uh
so i guess they have uh sent this to their customers and people in colleges and things
so my daughter has talked to two students uh that were non
so i guess
oh i think that's a that's a good idea
w- we're on finances
have you have you retired
actually i left t i um had basically set my sights to leave t i when they announced there would be no salary increases in ninety-one because i i def- definitely need to make a little more money
and uh i haven't really accomplished that yet
but i'm trying
it's uh that's
uh i've been with t i
and and that's a tough thing uh the salary thing
well what about our our our financial budget
well you you should have a lot of information on a budget then if you're uh
i i hope you're you're a person who does things better than
i i don't have a budget
that's one of my goals for this year is to try to get myself in a good oh long-range planning budget mode
um i'm a single mom
and i've been just uh trying to get
well you you you deserve an honor for that a gold star for that i guess
h- how about yourself
well i guess i do
so that i've been thinking about that for quite a while
now mo- monthly no
and i did you know that the macho thing
and i got so sick of it trying to balance the budget uh one
and i always tried to show my wife you know here's how you
or here's how you do the checks you know
and i said i'm not doing this anymore
and i've been happy ever since
well that's great
and i don't even
and i said i've been a happy man since i haven't
fooled with that checkbook you know
so i know it's a big pain to try to do that
it it really is
you know that was always a a major problem in our marriage
it i don't really need a budget to tell me not to spend it
you know i'm always afraid of
so um no
i i've i've finally worked myself into a spot where i can budget
when i when i was first divorced i had um i sat down and budgeted
and i had outgo that was wha- much higher than what i had coming in
i think uh that that is a tough uh
seems to th- seems to be that way
and and so now that i've gotten you know i lost the house now that i've gotten past that i can sit down and say okay
i don't know if you have an i r a or uh you know
and i've got two girls also
and i haven't saved anything for their college
that's you need to do that i'll i'll i'll give you a hint
i don't know if you're a ta- a radio talk uh person listener
listen to bruce williams uh for financial advice
he's on oh
and he gives very practical financial advice about cars very you know not not nothing college level basic stuff
uh i don't know
well i'll check that out
it's uh it's five seventy up here
and i'd listen to talk shows for everything for gardening and everything just when i'm doing chores
and and he will help you avoid a lot of little things uh financially
well that's that's good to know how
there there's a lot of advice out there for how to get a budget
and i i'm not expert again because
well you must have done something
and you're you know
i'm not uh i have one again at u t down there now
and she's almost gone through her whole college fund you know
sure go ahead
but we'll find out
they give us ten minutes uh
uh the only advice i give you on college would be there's a lot of scholarship money out there
and you ought to well as your daughters approach the college age uh start finding out about the scholarship monies because there is a lot of money out there
and and how did your daughter get scholarship money on
she got you know five hundred dollars at a at a clip through bands through leadership
uh there's all kinds of civic organ- organizations that will give you you know one shot money
uh you get a president's award if you're you're in in high school doing cer-
this up by here in arlington uh
and of course you if you you score high on the s a t
you can get you know two thousand a year you know or more
she she did very well in school
and uh but she only got first year money
there were there were two or three people
and only two or three people applied
oh i'm definitely going to be actively looking into that
the year that they graduate you know before though you know while they're graduating there's all kinds of little bitty money that little clubs will give away churches and everything
and they don't even have a dozen applicants because uh uh the kids are going off after the big money
uh of course you have to have some sort of record in high school uh of of achievement and everything
but sometimes it's just uh
like our band gave money away
we gave we give uh two five hundred dollar scholarships just to kids uh who we think were worthy you know
well that's great to know
i i don't want to i want to chew up the whole line here
oh well you're doing you're doing just fine
and and uh actually i when i talk i usually like to ask a lot of questions
oh i'm an engineer
i'm uh in fact i'm working the night because of the cutbacks and everything
uh my job
and so they put me on nights
i i call this my recession job
and i'm working nights just kind of covering uh shutdown equipment and everything
uh it beats being laid off and everything
and uh you you got to be a little flexible
uh in my old age i'm trying to just hang in there until i get my kids through school
and then i'd like to teach maybe mathematics or something
oh i hope you can do that
what what i did is
and and i've i went to t i just right at the time that uh my marriage was ending
i had been a a stay at home mom
and and i i mo- was very fortunate in starting
and i really enjoyed it while i was at t i
but you know the cutbacks were really getting to be rather frightening
and i had less than five years
and also i wanted to make a little bit more money
so i decided i'd like to go out and try sales
and uh i'm i'm out trying to sell telephone systems to businesses
and the potential there is fantastic
well it's tough right now for everybody
hey i've got another clue for you for college
uh we have a friend who works who is a secretary for t c u you know up here
they give you scholarship a hundred percent if you're if you work for t c u
so check that one out you know
i've got i've got two friends that work at at u t
and because it's full full scholarship
now it's uh not room and board
but it's tuition full tuition paid if your parent works at t c u
well that sounds fantastic
and her her mother went over there just for that
well brent i've been um i kind of gave up my career about three years ago to stay home with my children because i thought uh if it it's only going to be another year until the youngest is in school
and i thought it was a good sacrifice to make
because um it was important to me to to spend some time with kids
i know that when i was in school and getting my degree at the same time my husband was it was really hard on our family because i would he would come home
and i would leave
and then when i would come home
and he would leave
and um so i think one day one of our kids said you know
and they said well when is dad leaving or something
and so i think um it's become real important to me that we try to spend time together as a family
so there's one or two nights a week we have a
on monday nights we set aside time where it's called uh family home evening
and we stay home that evening all of us
and we do things together
oh you are
so you do that
and right and then we try to do a family activity on saturday
and then the family home evening too
and then you know sometimes we try to do our lesson on sunday night and then our activity or something on monday
we're it's real important to us to spend time together
well that's good
um how many children do you have
what what do you have
and the boy's five
and the girl is four
my oldest is uh four
and my youngest is about to turn three
and they are a handful
we've my uh well when we first got married my wife worked for a year
and uh she she got pregnant
and then we decided she would stay home with the kids
and uh we made that decision
and uh so sh- after she had the first baby she stayed home
and and we had a second baby
and she's still at home
and so uh you know at work a lot of people are you know
i think well this is not a normal situation anymore in our in our world we live in
most of them uh continue to work if they have have kids
i only have one other person i know in my in my group here that works where the wife stays home
and that's because of religious values as well
and they and they think that's important
but everybody else works
and they drop their kids off at day-care and and leave them
and i don't know i just don't want i just don't want strangers raising my children
and it's it's just not um it's not as stable for the kids
and they everybody decided to come over and talk to me right now
but uh it's yeah
oh it's open
i i try to go out of my way to to plan things that he can do with the kids because
since i am home with them and so i get a lot of time with them he needs to have um some time with them
so he when he comes home he um you know it's his job at night he puts the kids to bed
and he reads to them
and he spends about an hour doing that
and that's that's pretty good quality time
and um but it's hard for him on saturdays
he he wants right he wants to run out and get things done
and so um i try to say well why don't you go fly kites
or why don't you do something
and if i have something in mind then he he remembers that
we feel that you know just spending time together
you don't necessarily have to be doing anything you know that costs money or or you know that requires you to go a great distance or anything like that
it's just the kids like to being together as a family
and so we took the kids and and went by the farmers market down in in down there in garland
and they had a blast running around the farmers market looking at all the you know
and they had a little pen there with animals in they could pet you know
and they liked that
and then on the way home we drove by the local high school
and there happened to be an f a f a a future far- f a future farmers of america f f a going on there
and they had all kinds of pigs and horses and goats and sheep and everything you know all out in this in the in this schoolyard there
so we just said hey let's stop
and and the kids got to go around and you know see pigs and animals and things like that
and and for them that's wonderful you know
they they thought it was the greatest fun you know
and it didn't cost any money
and uh you don't have quite as much money when when the wife doesn't work
well that's right
but i do think um you know like the current trends are that um the family unit is devaluated
we find that you know back just even fifty years ago when people had financial problems the first place they went to was their family
and families took care of themselves
and um but now you know people don't they don't support each other that way
oh definitely motherhood is devalued in this s- society
if you're stay at home and you're a mother it's like what a waste
people think you know you should be fulfilling yourself
and and a mother isn't an important important thing as as having a career
and and that should be first and and children second
but they don't have kind of an what we call an internal perspective of things
and it's not an easy sacrifice for a person to make
because you know i you know i have interests that too
and it is hard to make uh those interests not be as a major part of my life
uh at this point
and when when we started uh having kids she had to work for a little while
but then she just started substituting
so she would just substitute once or twice a week you know just for that little extra money when we were in school
then we would just come home and just be you know go to a neighbor's house for an hour
but she wouldn't do that every day
but now that my my uh youngest sister's at b y u now
and so they have no one at home
so if you know it's not it's just a temporary thing
it in the middle of it it seems like a long time
but you're right
well i see that we both share the same belief here that it's important that we spend time with our kids
and and in spite of
you it's it's hard sometimes at work because you know people say oh we're taking a cruise
we're going there you know because they have a lot more money
and a lot of them decide just not to have children
it's it's amazing they either have one or none
and and the one person i know that has one they they feel guilty
and so on uh on weekends she would you know spend all of her time with her kids and spend lots of lots and lots of money
basically i think they they really spoil the child
and and and they don't want to have anymore children because they just don't think you know that she doesn't think she could be a mother at home
so she just doesn't think that she could you know
the guilt feelings she can't deal with with it anymore
well it is
my wife uh likes staying home
uh she works at home some though
the place she works with worked with before um worked out an arrangement with her where she can work at home
well that's good
and so uh that it's kind of a seasonal thing
but the rest of the time she's free
so she enjoys staying at home
but uh the money part of it is not as rewarding obviously
but there's different rewards you know different kinds of rewards
i think it's an investment in your future even if it's purely not not religious
and you really have to make uh quite a bit of money
i know there's you know
when you adjust your income for what you put out for day-care you know you're only making like five
um now we're supposed to talk about social activities
well the changes that's occurred
i think um well i guess it would be like your generation compared to my generation
i think your generation is um
what do i say uh
uh they're they're they're polite
like it how was it maybe ten twenty thirty years ago as opposed to what it is today
other people just in in general i think and just just towards people and property
and um i i guess they would would be more conservative some of them i guess
we are uh somewhat conservative
but as far as the uh socially our crime rate has increased
and although it's more publicized as opposed to what it used to be it seems like violent crime is on the increase from what i've seen
and um our prison population has significantly increased i would say
um our economy too is really it's just not what it used to be in the sixties or even fifties from history from what i've read
and uh even the
well it started spiraling down i suppose in the seventies
and uh our recovery uh economically has not been like it used to be
to me also our nuclear family is not the same because more people are living together that aren't married uh i don't i don't know if uh
but uh i don't really want to either
because i have no problems about it either way and um kids are i i suppose have been raised by single parents more than they ever used to women are more on the rise too so far as getting their careers established
and uh they don't no longer feel dependent upon men
well well do you think that that maybe
i mean uh i've heard different you know like um like
i know my mom and like other ladies they complain because they think that um the women now are too busy with their own personal life and career that they really don't have time for their kids
i mean they they are a lot of them that have to put their kids into day care or having more with baby sitters
and especially if they don't have boy friends or husbands
and uh i guess that's why you always hear these stories about kids being neglected
uh in fact uh there was one lady in this area
oh my gosh just a baby
not a baby she was old enough to uh
oh my gosh
but that's just an extreme example
i would imagine you know the situations are out there
well um um well i think the education like our education has um increased dramatically
but then i think also that we're forgetting like basic things like we should know like i i think well um in the morals and values of like my generation for the most for most people are totally different from the morals and valleys um values of like per se your generation
but i think as we get older it gets to your you know what i mean
i think the kids now are are i would say louder now until after they reach like twenty-five
and then i think they really have a strong decline and start to settle down and realize things
um i could agree with that because used to conservatism was inherent at a much younger age
and kids nowadays are just given so much that they really don't have to work
and you know and they they don't have any intent to go working until they have to
um what else considering beside family economics um
i mean we can we can now travel around the world in no time
it's just a hop skip and a jump to get into a plane to go from the east to the west coast and uh well i i think what's happened too is just our technology is just advancing so rapidly that and there's so much information available out there that folks out there just have a hard time keeping up aside from just going through their daily routine of living to get from day to day and to keep abreast of the knowledge out there we got to constantly read go to school uh
t v watching has sure hasn't gone too much out the door because t v is still well
the cable system and the satellite dishes has made it to where a lot of people can just leave regular t v programming and watch a lot of other a variety of programs out there as well as use of the v c r so that i don't know if it really hampers or it helps our education system
i don't know because i know i don't watch while i'm up here at school i don't watch hardly any t v
like thursday night i like to sit down and watch a few shows
but i don't any more
i mean there are even though there's a few up here we call them couch potatoes
but for the most part i will i will
well i live in an all girls dorm
but for the most part we're all between the ages of eighteen and like twenty-one and there isn't really a lot of t v watching
well that's good
but i know oh well i guess they have their crowds like during the soap operas you know like in between classes or something but i can't say that there's really that many people that like sit in front of the t v all day
well that's a change then
oh of course going to school too it's different from the home environment
but then um like i know this girl
or she's just working like within the school
and um yesterday she was at the kindergarten
and there's this little boy
he like didn't want to do anything
and he said i'm not doing this
and he sat at his desk with two pencils in his hand and pretend like he's playing nintendo you know
so uh i don't know how
i mean i never really watched that a lot of t v when i was younger
but my parents really didn't allow us to watch that much t v
so i don't know
because uh t v kind of ruined me
because that's that's all that we had well not really
but i mean it's uh for the top medium of entertainment
well we watch a lot of i guess we watched a lot of t v in the winter time
but in the summer like right now my mom well like she doesn't let us watch t v until like eight o'clock at night you know
well like my younger brothers and sisters at home
like when it starts getting nice outside in the summer and everything she'll she makes us go outside
and we're allowed to come in and watch t v until it's dark because she doesn't like the t v herself and if it was up to her we wouldn't have one
so you know she feels that kids are too dependent on it also
oh is there anything else
work ethics oh
it's get- it's maybe getting better um a little
of course we- we- we're having to weather through the savings and loans all the other scandalous items that well the greed that overwhelmed us in the eighties and uh i think i think it's going to have to have it's patchwork put on us because we have so much to pay for now
well it was nice talking to you
and uh what are majoring in
and i'm in california visiting right now
and i live in virginia
i'm sitting here going oh dear
well um so
what changes uh
but uh in my lifetime the biggest is in more women working
and um you know just to jump ahead a little bit
but then we can back up
for the fut- well yeah
because i don't see that really yet in positions of power really
um do you work in private corporation or government
and before that i worked in a bank for eight years
and now i'm retired
i don't i see um
which do you work in excuse me
and i work in academia before
and um actually there's one um woman in our i don't know what you'd call it uh institute who is a manager
and i mean in a since perhaps um a lot of she gets protected a lot because it's almost like a token
and and it's sort of unfortunate because i think that they don't accept her technically
and but she's a good paper pusher
and it's in a technical position really
and you know she should be more technical for what she does
and i think that's sort of unfortunate
because it doesn't it doesn't really help the cause in the long run
but um you know i don't know
and and teaching i still see that that's where most of the woman are
and you know and it's always been that way
but not at the college level
and i worked at the university for a while
and there are there are woman there
but they're not the high paid professors that
well they did have one woman dean
but and i guess she she probably did very well
but that's the minority
um and do you think it's because women aren't qualified or or just don't or don't want the job or just aren't hired for the jobs
uh i don't know how
and of course at this university uh
this it's a big engineering school
and i don't think there are many women in the engineering college
and that's where the high pay is
but i'm wondering how many women actually major in engineering
act- but you know i say that
but yet i know too
well i think there are more than there used to be
but they may not go into teaching
i mean the two that i know obviously are not in teaching
um it's it- i suppose in a since i was surprised when they told me they majored in engineering
i but i don't know that many men that have majored in engineering
i mean it's just because i'm in the humanities it's just
but um yeah
well i met one one day that uh had just joined the faculty in agricultural engineering
and that really surprised me
oh that's interesting
i mean i i suppose that that it's difficult to really say why because uh you know there there probably are a limited number of women who are interested in the subject and well qualified
and maybe there aren't you know
i don't i don't know how many go on and get a p h d in engineering
which could be you know part- partially cultural anyway
so that it might be circularly being the same problem of of expecting not to get hired for the good jobs anyway
so why spend your time getting qualified
it's a it's a rough
um and i guess what i what ama- amazes me is the number of men who are willing to stay home with the kids
or and in our case we actually have one father who works part-time a six
hour day so that he can take the kids kids or kid i'm not sure
is it uh was she the major wage earner
this is uh
i mean did she earn more money that he did
or you know
but but yeah
i would imagine she might um
because he's you know he's a really nice guy
but he did say that because he was in the humanities and he's now working in more of a technical situation that he had trouble finding a job
so that maybe he you know maybe she was more qualified
but but still it's interesting that you know he he's been doing this evidently for a a good number of years
and uh but it's unusual
uh i know one uh gal
that's she's a c p a
and her husband is a house husband
and then they had a child
and he he was still the house husband
oh he was
oh now that that really is
oh she was
i don't know how she's moved away i don't know how it is now
but i know uh we're we all went out one evening
i mean i think that would be it would it would strike one as strange if there's no reason for somebody to stay home that
that's what your going that's what you'll always be
but but yet you know we have to think about that
because if if she had offered to stay home we wouldn't have thought anything stran-
so so we're
it would it wouldn't have been a doubter
because if yeah if if somebody does if and breaks tradition you're surprised
you know well uh i mean it it's an interesting topic
yet i must say it's not one that i've given a great deal of of thought to
it's um one of those things that you know seems to happen
i don't i don't feel for the most part that i've been discriminated against
i but i don't like administration
so then i'm uh uh probably a poor example although you know i was an administrator and could still be i suppose
you were you were more ambitious than they would let you be
and the money didn't go with the positions
well i would
the promotion promotions came
but there wer- there comparable pay for the responsibility
and i was told you don't need as much pay as i have because your children are older than my children
or your husband has a good job
actually in a since i suppose when i was hired into the government um at i was taken advantage of
and and that's true that you know sometimes other people get get higher increments
for you know even
i think we uh are programmed to just take it
i hadn't i hadn't thought about it because i do like what i do
uh i just sort of ignore the administrative
part of it since i didn't like it when when i had to do it
so i i figure you know nobody must uh nobody must like it
but i know some people thrive on it
well since i don't have a whole lot more to say on the topic
i think um this is a tough subject because uh when you come from two different parts of the country uh the political views are really different
i uh i i guess i've had to discuss a number of what might be considered controversial issues
i guess like like they're nothing i guess nothing is as awful as abortion
but like gun control and uh day care an things like that
and there are some very different views uh of the people connected with the program which i thought was really interesting you know
well now you you say two different parts of the country
what are are are you referring to yourself
well being in in baltimore see
maryland is um is sort of um is prob- as as a hub of liberalism
you know compared to the country uh
you know very uh in in many ways uh very liberal
though pennsylvania and new york uh i aren't actually as liberal
maryland is a very liberal uh state
so so where here we have um we have gun control laws
and most people in maryland vote for that you know
so it really is a different um
uh well of course you talk gun controls down here in texas
and you're asking to be lynched
that's that's right talk to
and i talked with a woman who actually you know h- had just purchased a gun that day
and was going target shooting you know
and it was very different
it's really um this has opened my eyes to thinking you know
at one time i just sat here and thought well how can anybody believe that
because i'd really never met people that did
and now i talk to people that do
so that's it's really interesting
well it's very true
now i'm a uh new yorker by birth
although i claim florida as my home now uh
but i also have two sons living elsewhere
but i lived in te- in florida for ten years
and i kind of like it down there
but they had a gun control law which went a little bit too far
i think uh
well in your words they were a little bit too liberal
i mean they p- they i believe if i'm correct i believe they permitted their carrying concealed weapons
they uh sh- quickly did away with it
i think in the next session they they uh modified it
but it's still legal to own
well you can possess 'em here too
and uh like
uh the the brady bill that's
the the one week uh seven day the delay
that's uh that's
i'm i'm with the n r a myself
and uh uh really the only objection we have
and next thing you know somebody's trying to take more
that's and that's the
way i guess most of the um the
political organizations work you know
and and both of them
um i would say i'm probably liberal
how is your what is your feeling about uh uh expressing yourself by burning the american flag
well i'll tell you
i i think you know if they if they didn't give as much coverage to these idiots that burn the flag it would never happen
but i i guess actually i believe that if somebody wants to burn the flag i guess that's their opportunity
they're they're they're right in the sense of freedom of speech
but i- i would never
well now wait a minute the- there
and i uh uh the the
of being able to display your uh your
ideas you know
the what the country stands on america stands on is that they can do that
but i i still
what the stan- flag stands for i guess to me is
that if somebody wants to voice their opinion or display their opinion openly and if that is a a way that they can
now uh well i i still
burn unless the actual fire hinders somebody's health and well-being you know
but i i think that's i
but i think that's that's uh it's that's taxpayer's money
buys their own flag and and burns it that's fine
but that that's
uh then you don't draw a line between public property and uh uh uh what a public uh symbol
oh i think what america stands for is the right to be able to disagree with the government
by s- b- freedom of speech
i think i i
the idea you know they always keep saying like the framers
and um i believe that the idea of burning
my understanding of how it was framed is that you this coun- the thing about this country is that you can disagree with its government
and you can display
uh i yeah
and and so that as a freedom of expression and speech and
whatever i i think that that's viable
um as long as it's your flag and and you've made your your point i think
because realistically like for you for you you don't think it's right
and i would never do it
i i love this country too much
and that symbol means a lot to me
i guess it's just one of those things where if they if that's what's something it's a need for them you know
well here again we uh
even though you uh physically you agree with me
you you wouldn't do it yourself
nevertheless you maintain that it's it is the right of of any citizen
uh um so long as it's their possession
ok you're you're that's
and i used to know as a boy scout
but all i remember was the red in the flag represented the blood that was shed to to create this country
and to me that's uh uh black eye to every man that ever p- uh carried a weapon or killed for his country
i i the um i i it's i find it you know personally disgusting
i don't think that i don't think that uh we
have a right to stop somebody from that you know
i guess i get i get uh all
it's it's very easy to do
it g- when it's uh it's an emotional issue
and you sit
and you try and think
and and and you know you try to say to yourself
uh but logically um
even you know for instance the pro life pro choice movement uh you know
because you know that's just a disgusting thing you know
i think it should be permitted under certain circus- circumstances
it that's uh that's what i mean
but but realistically when you think of it it just sounds like such an awful thing
and it evokes an emotional response
ever been decided when when is a uh fetus a human
i think the um
the um th- the uh christian uh point
is is always the point of well it's at conception
but then um a friend of mine's a doctor and argues with others that conception is a biblical term
and there's no concept of conception in medicine or biology
it's very it's it's uh you know it's a it's a topsy-turvy world
and it's really something how um political
ideas and viewpoints within one country can vary so much and also within um
on their o- within the own uh
how it'll sway from one e- one extreme to another
um i think that in this day and age everyone needs to have some sort of exposure to community service
because it it seems like
and i'm i'm thinking of the com- of community of people that are in jail now
i think that maybe if if if some of those people had gotten exposed to the community gotten exposed to working with other people that some of the things that they did they would not have done
because they they understand people more
i agree with you in the sense that uh i think that it's important for people to uh also share give something of themselves and uh i think that there's too much in the in in a way of self-gratification today
and there's not enough sharing
and i'm i'm speaking about people that are like born rich
and that's all they know
and i'm thinking that community service would help them uh just get a feel of what else is out there how other people are living you know
if they were to work in in a a i don't know a soup kitchen or something
uh you know on the same note if poor if poorer people
and i think the peace corps is great too
because uh it you go to different countries
and you see
uh in fact i saw an interview on t v the other night with uh patrick swayze
and he's making a movie in i think it's uh calcutta or either india
somewhere where it's it's a very poor poor country
and he said that people in the west
he said since being there and i guess he's been there about six months
and he said that people have no idea he said of of what human sacrifice is you know
since being there he's he's learned to what it is to be poor and have nothing
and yet those people have uh such uh a happy
in in other words they don't dwell on on what they don't have
and they're happy with each other type of thing
he said that out here he said that when he comes back he knows that it it's ju- completely changed his life
and i i think that that you know
and maybe he wasn't before
and now he sees
and i think that anybody that works in the in some kind of service or for the community or something
they can see you know
you don't see what you don't you can't know what you don't see
so and you have to experience some things
you know a lot of people know that people that other people are poor
but you they don't know what poor is
unless they actually see it and you know help or something
well i i know that it that must be true especially if you do something along the lines of uh you know helping them learn how to survive how to plant
and i've seen so many
uh extraordinary things on t v
that people have done working in the peace corps and how you know uh the people of the community they worked in is so much better
and i i really believe that they can in something like that
there's something i i've really be skeptical of you know
if you want to send like you know fifty cents a day
and you can help a child
it's i don't know i guess it's just me
but i don't know whether to trust that or not
and how do yo-
and things going on you know
i would love to help somebody you know
but i just i can't bring myself to trust this this company who is trying to do this or whatever it is you know
just because people or so i don't know just today people are just so money hungry
and so you don't know what they
it's uh it's it's not like it used to be even in in the years of my growing up
i mean i'm fifty-three years old
and i have seen a town change from a town to a city and its
uh people you know grow from a small town to a large town
and you would think that more people would be better you know share more
do more you know be more community oriented and all
but if they just get more uh unto themselves kind of
and and it's not the sharing of
uh a neighbor to a neighbor and we would go out and not even lock our doors and not even worry about it
but you can't do that today
but today i mean you know it's like you wouldn't even think of doing that
if you don't have bars on the window you're not even safe you know
even when when i first moved to dallas from new york it seemed like dallas was so open you know
and this was only uh
well i guess it has been awhile
and it's amazing now how much it's changed
i mean i don't go out i don't go
outside at night you know
cause i i heard i in fact i was talking to someone from dallas uh just last week
and they was saying that uh
and she had gone overseas to tokyo
and she asked them there if there was some anywhere that she shouldn't go because she was alone
you know being a girl from another country
and she said they thought for a few seconds
and they said uh no
they said to her that even if she left her purse on the subway okay
that she would have that purse returned to her this is how confident they were
okay with nothing missing okay
this is a foreign country and you would think you know uh being uh an american or whatever
you know a foreigner there that
i mean if you leave something anywhere you might as well forget it
and she told me she said she could tell them for fifteen minutes places not to go in in and around dallas
and that's where she was from
and i've i could live in an apartment
i live in waco okay
and you either live in really low priced housing or you live on the other side of town in the high price apartments
and i live
but i live in the high price apartments simply because i feel safe here and i pay i'm paying probably the hundred or hundred fifty dollars more than i would be paying somewhere else
but i wouldn't be able to sleep at night and that to me is worth the extra money for me to be you know
i feel very safe where i am you know
and that that's why i think if people were more exposed to uh
especially uh young kids getting out of high school
to have the same exposure and you know uh to further their worldliness so to speak
and go to see uh foreign countries that they would not necessarily be able to afford to see
join the navy to see the world type of thing you know
but nowadays they don't do that anymore
it's not a a thing a
a lot of young men don't even uh have the desire to go into the service
or to uh you know do something for someone else
and i don't know
you know to mothers not being at home
and we were saying that the basic uh the the basic family is is disrupted these days
and so i think you know before the father would work
and the mother you know would stay home
and having that mother there that base i think
was a big part of of family a big part of of what you know your your uh youngsters thought about what they did
and the thing is
like i think a man can afford to support a woman
but the woman affords the luxuries
in in other words like anyone can live
so to speak okay
it it's what's important to you
now a family
i i think that like girls today have children
and six weeks later they're back to work
don't eve- ever see the
it's it's the most beautiful thing that happens between a mother and a child
and i mean once the child's in school if you had a job from say nine to three
i mean they they're in school
but it's kids that come home and don't have a mother there or the kids are at home in the morning and
where you on the li- phone a long time
you were he was waiting for what again
well let me go a head and push one
well basically i like comedy shows
uh murphy brown uh designing women
i mean we have two t v
but neither one of them work
so for the last year
i mean we just got married
and we decided well for the first year we we won't get a t v
so i mean i'm totally out of it as far
and um we went through that after about five years of marriage
and we went we made it almost about eighteen months without a television
but then all of a sudden when you get one you realize um gee
i needed that you know
and then you get to remote control the stereo phonic
and then you never use the v c r
and now it's like we're just glad we never went out and bought a compact disk player cause we wouldn't use it
i mean it's cause your never home you know
well i don't know t v shows
what can i tell you um
um i like things like i just mentioned
oh that's the one with candice bergen in it um
well see another thing was i worked on second shift for like a year and a half
and then before that i was in college for four years
and i never watched t v then because i didn't have time
and the uh
well i don't
but i could tell you in school that uh the only thing that ever saw in the dorm was uh the one soap opera all my children
and until then i never paid attention to soap operas
and to this day twenty years later i'm like i'm in my thirties
but i'm going jeez i can't believe that thing's still on television
i mean i al- i almost got hooked on it cause everybody would took about it at dinner and everything else
it you know it was like
they you know
about the only other kinds of things i like um
i like to watch a lot of news um
well about almost a year
oh my god
and then you'll get one
i mean i never really watched it much growing up
but i thought you know my husband would really like miss it because he he was an only child
and he wa- he's seen a lot of t v
and i figured oh no
i mean i don't miss it that much
and he did miss it
and i've seen cros- cosby show probably ten times
it's a nice you know it's a pretty funny show
oh you have
it's just a you know over priced
boston yuppie you know
and then uh i like watching a lot of like college basketball and and pro football
i mean that sounds kind of stupid
oh not no
i like the pro actually i like pro basket ball as opposed to
but i like the n b a play-offs
back when like the pistons were in them
uh sherman texas
sherman texas oh
i was just saying where am i calling you from you know
well then i don't know if you like the the mavericks or not
um we're supposed to talk about television
so are you really from texas though
well sounds like you're from up north
cause i wondered if you really you know if had any teams you like watching from up north or something
uh actually i'm a big chicago bears' fan
and uh um i always watch them no matter who's on
well i'm from indiana
so i like the bears
i watch uh huh
i like i like tennis
so i mean i'm not i haven't played in years
but um i just like to watch you know
two players really get go at it
but i don't
i wa- used to watch oprah a lot in the afternoons
and i see her every once in awhile like if i go workout at t i
you know they have those t v right
was she was her show big when you where in school since you haven't been out that long
i mean back then
and the show did you see the show where she lost all of that fat
she pu- she wheeled it out on a cart
and then man she's really porked out again i guess
oh if you don't have a v c r we just got one after nine years don't even spend your money on it
cause you know if you like movies like we do you do it once in awhile
and then you know you see it when it first comes out if you really want to see it
and then it usually comes on television within two years
we got we've got the dollar cinema in sherman
so we usually see like first-rate movies
really that's television
so i mean
i mean i i always
well it's hard to talk about something
i feel bad cause i mean
oh that's okay
my husband had been on this project um
and i i she called in
and it was all about we don't have children and it was all about um sending your kids to college
and she was from boston
and she i shouldn't talk about this but she was
and sh- she was very snooty
and uh her kids were going to places like amherst and b u
and i said i didn't know what that was
i she went oh
and i thought um
so i know
i mean it's like don't worry about it
television at least you know everybody's
uh what was his name wolf blitzer
did you see it him when he was doing the coverage of the gulf
um i might of
what was his name uh
but what about this wolf guy
but just th-
they made jokes about him like on the carson show and all of that
and saturday night live
like i'd come home from second shift and watch him like for an hour and a half
i mean i haven't seen it in a couple of months
actually i think it has
i mean they finally like
and some of those people
and they you don't know if it's a man or a woman
and they say well they're trying to deduce what he or she is
so to see if it's a female they say well do you carry a purse
and pat says no
so you still don't know because a fanny pack is man
or now days you know
it's yeah it is pretty funny
i mean they do some crazy things
like when wayne's world
and what's that other one where they
well you've must have seen it recently
well i don't know
because i've seen it off and on probably
you know i mean you're not totally out of the loop
i mean yeah
we we bug our we you know
one friend of ours got rid of his because we motivated him because we you know cause we were getting along out ours
so he sold his
but the rest of our friends we go and watch them
i mean you really you can do without one
but after awhile it will start um you know
i mean you just kind of all of sudden
cause you're going well jeez
and you just end up doing it
but if you haven't been married that long you know
oh that's a good school
well your from indiana yeah
do i do i have a southern accent
oh real southern
it is um
i'm trying to think i went to high school in chicago i'm trying to think what purdue kids watch
we watch uh m t v twenty four hours a day
and then every now and then they'd days they taped days you know
and you know other then that i'm sure they watched
do you know that i've never i think other then accept on a commercial or on news coverage or something
and i wouldn't even i mean i don't even have cable
somebody uh to you know give me a hundred and fifty um
i mean my neighbor her husband sits in front of the television all of time
and they've only been married five years have a cute one year old kids
well i heard dallas is pretty bad with the crime
well you know you know last night i was listening to the uh ten o'clock news
and for the first five to seven minutes of a news broadcast all they were talking about was the number of shootings the number of drug deals that were going on and crime
and and it's so depressing just to even listen to the news anymore
i mean uh back a couple weeks ago they found uh some people i don't remember at some fast food restaurant
they had been i can't remember if they had been shot or if they had just been thrown in the freezer
but i'm pretty sure they'd been shot and put the freezer at the fast
and i've worked worked in fast food restaurants
i remember us- i used to work at uh kentucky fried chicken
and and i just couldn't believe um you know that
and uh because of uh the crime
that they would um kill people just for the few couple hundred dollars that they would have in there
uh in their cash drawer
and he well i don't know he decided not to work one night or something
and one of the guys that was working was shot
and kenny quit the next day
he just he couldn't deal with it
oh i understand what your talking about
i have uh uh you know a real problem uh
it it doesn't matter if you live in a small town or if you live in a small town or if you live in a large city like this
um so but i just think about the all the different ways that we have to protect ourselves from
um i lived in louisville kentucky for a while
but i lived on the outskirts too
but louisville was pretty bad especially during like the uh kentucky derby
so i don't know um you know
it's asking about what kind of steps we can take um uh you know just as citizens to try and um uh protect ourselves
i know i have uh um home security system
plus i have the uh the special lights on on the outside
and i have
if you if there's some kind of movement
then they'll automatically come on um
but i mean it's just i'm constantly think about keeping us safe and protected
oh that's what i've got
are your ba- are they babies or
oh well good that they're a comfort to you
i've got a a four year old he'll be four and a three month old
and it's scary
i'm used to living in uh
but we just
i'm used to having you know eight or ten houses on one street
and this one's got houses on either side and you know
now now the nice thing uh
i feel a little bit more comfort since we're so close together like this um
i i feel like that there's going to be uh less crime
or your neighbors going to be watching out for you um
because it's it's practically it's in their backyard too
oh oh well
we think our neighbors are stealing from us actually my husband
they uh well the one of them's a teenager that lives next door
and her friends are pretty wild
and so he went and got a locking gas cap for his
they weren't stealing it out of mine so much because my car the gas thing is kind of weird where it's hard to
so he he went and got a locking cap
and they cu- tried to break that off
oh my goodness
he went down to uba and noticed that it was hanging off where where they had tried to break it off
and they stole our tailgate off his truck
well we can't say they did
it had to be somebody that you know could do it in the middle of the night
and you know they'd seen it earlier
it's uh more of a matter of what you the steps that you do to keep yourself safe
and um so that's that's why i try and uh do
well the only thing that we can do as citizens is you know like uh watch groups that they'll have
but they can be dangerous too
you know that
you know i was going home the other day
and i saw um a guy who who looked like he was breaking into a window
and i thought gee whiz you know i don't know if he's really doing that or not or if he's th- he's the person who lives there uh
you know and and i was thinking well i need to call the police when i get back home
and because it was about oh about four or five blocks from where we live
and uh and i thought no you know because i wouldn't know if that was really a robber or not because it was in broad daylight
but anymore you know the crime happens in daylight
as it does in in night
well i watched it on t v oh i guess last year sometime
they'll break in at the day in the daytime
and i hear that you know it's if you lock yourself out of your house
and you try to get in your house it will
uh a professional could break in in
so scary you you think you've got yourself all locked in and safe
and and uh somebody could break in uh
oh i have a dog
i'm getting me uh i want a german shepherd
um i don't want any of those ones that will up the kids
but i do want a german shepherd
because my husband will leave every once in a while
and i'm scared here by myself
so that's ano- uh
but he is just as vicious as is you know if you bu-
and i thought that uh you know we'd have to have a big dog
but we doesn't need a big dog
we got this little bitty dog that uh
part dachshunds and part cocker spaniel
and he um ease very protective
well that's now that's one of the best deterrents for a robber is a noisy neighbor even if the neighbor's got a noisy dog
but it's easy to fool a dog too
you know throw them meat or um a a real intense burglar can just get another dog that's in heat
oh wow gosh
well it was nice talking to you
and i maybe we'll meet up again
okay well texas
new york does not but uh they're they're trying to reinstate it
and the governor's opposed to it being that uh the democrat that he is
and mario cuomo but the state legislatures are more and more coming to supporting it
i uh i ethically don't like the idea
but or i should say morally i don't like the idea
but uh social eth- eth- and ethics socially and ethically i think it's a good idea in certain crimes
i'd i would agree with that almo- even more
but i'm really offended
uh just the existence of you know murder rapist whatev- wh-
right that uh after they've gone and done horrible things molested children and kill
them whatever that society has to pay uh upwards uh thirty thousand dollars a year to incarcerate them
and texas is having a problem right now
and it's the the the the the cri- i think that's the the repeat crimes and the repeat offenders is happening down here where they're they're patrol the state patrol board is letting people walk that have done oh heinous things from calli- from killing police officers to i mean just multiple you know mo- molestations to murders of children just you know really bad things
and they're get these people are getting out like three to five years before they're even suppose to be considered
and now they can't find them
and they're finding bodies in di- you know
i mean you thi- think why they say it's because you're over crowd it's over crowded
and you think how is is everybody that stupid
or is the world really that rotten
i i don't know
we have the largest murder rate of any developed uh
but uh yesterday a lady i work with just told me today that uh in the state capitol here in austin texas they had been uh looking at a bill uh making it easier to accept the bill to access to access handguns
and they passed it which basically means without an f b i check any person here in this state over twenty-one can get a gun
here in new york it's a lot harder than that uh it takes uh it takes almost six months to get uh handgun permit in this state
say that good
now the the
and that's with uh
you have to have uh oh a police investigation
and i know because a friend of mine wanted to get one and listed me as a reference uh
and i know it
there is it's very easy to get uh uh you know
which aren't the i i don't consider to be the kind of cri- crime uh
weapon you know
i mean i don't like guns in general
but when i think about uh this topic like capital punishment i look at somebody i mean i just remember when i was in college in a dorm
and i think if he'd been around one of my family members probably would have killed him
but in florida in the state of washington when they had the ted bundy case and how they just exe-
well it hasn't been just
but it was in the i think the second or third quarter of last year nineteen ninety and i had you know i knew some people that said why are you glad
you di- you know
and i said just maybe because he got a lot of media hype and all that
but i actually i mean
a- and the thing with bundy was though he escaped
and then yeah and did it again
i mean and that's just maybe because of the little more th- they said celebrated that uh
you you see somebody's mini series
and you hear about somebody's crime
and this gets back to capital punishment
but the man had stolen uh not stolen but kidnapped uh some wealthy ex-athlete's daughter somewhere in florida
and they changed all the facts that they said it was true and they buried her alive and peter strauss had played the lead role
and the man and and at the end of you know how they have these mini dramas at the end they said this set person was paroled like six months ago
and you're thinking oh
i mean you know i'm not sure that capital punishment serves as a deterrence
but it does serve as a pun- uh definite
pun- you know
in that particular instance uh
but i but i don't but i know it's on a
and all and be all
and all and be all
they think that if they electrocute or slip or do something or gas somebody uh that they're not going to have the crimes that they do have
and we happen to live in dallas which is extremely crime
and we just moved here uh
we've been here before lived in minneapolis saint paul uh which has an exceedingly low crime rate
and then we were transferred back here
and when you're gone from some place like it for about six years as we were you really begin to see uh just how problematic just living is
and and is that like near albany or syracuse
it it's uh near syracuse
it's about uh
well i i actually live in a village of sylvan beach
i work in rome uh
what what type of area is that
uh it use to be use to be a uh uh have a lot of heavy industry
but it's kind of uh
and uh now the air force is the largest employer in the uh area
and uh uh
how is the situation in there in terms of crime and and things that would
it you know
you still have the uh more drug problems and typical
uh small city type problems
but i don't know that there's a real uh
now dallas is a
on some days uh
the good ole boy network here is uh very strange like i said
they believe that if they kill somebody you know tit for tat and
that does something uh
but yet they want spend the money to build the new jails that
i mean they really are over
i mean that's that's just not a cop out uh
and i just you know i'm originally from pennsylvania which i think is basically like new york these days
i'm not sure if they i don't think they have capital punishment there
i think i think penn- pennsylvania may have just reenacted it
because i'm from uh
from pennsylvania also just uh just outside
and i'm from pittsburgh
oh well we'll forgive each other
uh because they use to be very very conservative when i was growing up
i and i can't i haven't lived there in twenty
and then the east part of the state has got all the bleeding hearts and all the welfare cases
that's a different top- subject
but uh i don't know
you and i think are honest and candid because we could do it on in this
but i think everybody if they were touched by it would say if they had any sense of rage that could be brought out
do it if somebody in my family or if it happened it me you know
if your friends or family got uh had that happen to them i think everyone would
don't think that uh you can rehabilitate
i mean i just don't uh oh
and i just
and it was something uh it was basically the essence was does the crime fit the punishment
and when you see how many repeat offenders there are uh check check fraud cases where they go to jail for five to ten years and uh rape rapist getting their hand
just slapped you know and how it is based on the judge and if the time of day that the court is in session
you know all these uh i- i- intangible things
and you're thinking
well uh i uh yeah
because i guess it's a pretty pretty rough thing to be uh electrocuted
is it uh
tha- it's more that don't have it
but amazingly it's like uh massachusetts went back
and reinstated capital punishment oh maybe six or seven years ago
i don't know if they've used it since then since they've reinstated it
but uh it's on the books
i don't know if they've they did something about
i they didn't they didn't they were again-
well did they have it
they were against it uh
but i haven't been back here long enough to to realize whether or not if they've done it in the last
well i guess it depends on what age
so i know
i mean i lived through it
uh are you old enough to know about the war
uh just barely
i am uh twenty-nine
but it was on the fringe
but just uh yeah
had some friends that were that were in it
it ended uh when i was in uh college in uh when i turned nineteen in nineteen seventy
i cannot even remember at this point uh
when i turned nineteen it was the year that uh the draft was still going on
so i learned a lesson in gender
uh in terms of the war i do not know uh
actually i do not really know that much about it
i just know socially the impact it had here and what you hear in the media you know uh
i guess i think it was uh uh not that great that we were in there uh in terms of for how long it lasted
well i think it is uh basically the same way
it is certainly has affected uh u s policy though
there is there is no question it had an overwhelming effect of how we approached the the thing in uh iraq
because uh the whole thing that was bad about vietnam it was no different from iraq
i mean it was uh one country picking on a smaller weaker one
and we are going to consider ourselves against in war
and in full faction
it was sort of of a president's war rather than a country's war
uh i do not know how you were historically
but i was a little bit older before i realized just how long it had been going on since l b j and i mean i pa-
it seemed to me like it was it seemed like it was going on forever
it really well
so in terms of when you were in school i am sure that it was you know the majority of your high school and junior high years
uh one of the things i did not like was the weapons the weapons i can't even say it the weaponry th- systems that they used
uh it just did not seem that uh i do not know technically we knew what we were doing either
and then you heard about the things like agent orange et cetera
and you would think
of course now i- w- uh now everyone's more uh you know environmentally uh intelligent than they were back then
that is true uh
i mean back then it was not commonly known that saccharin was bad for you and all these other things that people that people know about themselves now
uh monetarily too i just do not think we have done enough for the uh vietnamese people as a whole uh in south vietnam in general in helping them restore themselves
you know and i don't know if it is because there are not any oil fields there
i do not know if they uh i do not know if they have that resource or not
but i just think it is kind of a shame that uh you still hear things about the children that are orphans there
uh so on a whole i do not know war is not good
and that one i probably
uh my main opinion would be w- w- we should not have done it
well you know a little uh a little bit more than i do
i did not uh get to live through it
that the people that i know that it did
uh felt very strongly
so most of the guys i work with are uh oh at least some of the guys i work with rather are veterans
and uh from vietnam
and i have not talked to any of them that that were not you know glad that they went or or rather thought that the reason they went was a good one
and that that
most of them are ver- very strongly that that the reason for america to be there was a good one
they just felt that the way america backed them up was not was not at all right
in term of uh
and and the finances how they started you know
like air attacks and stuff like that dropped off like crazy
because the congress would not approve you know
i mean i think it started actually like like in the late fifties i mean like in fifty-eight fifty-nine
so it really
i mean because i know in nineteen sixty-three i mean i was nine years old
so i mean i remember uh right around then that's when i first started hearing about vietnam
but then as i got older and studied in school i realized it was even going on before that
you know and you think to yourself oh my goodness eisenhower
and i know i know you know a lot of the vietnam vets that are my age in their later thirties uh guys that i know that they are just kind of bitter you know
they they you know
but it is that kind of idea
you know they just do not feel that socially they were given
like a friend of mine called it the yellow ribbon syndrome
so well i won't keep you any more
that is probably as about as much as we both know
but thanks for talking to me
uh were you calling from texas
oh i know where that is
right in right near d c
uh pretty much
uh dallas it is uh ninety-two degrees here today
but at least the humidity is uh below forty percent which makes it kind of like phoenix
little bit little bit cooler like eighty-nine
but basically the same thing
well you are not missing too much then
well take it easy
well carolyn the uh one of the main things i'd like like to know is uh how do you feel about the knowing about the environment of a nursing home before you would send someone there to live and so forth
uh i'll tell you
i i watched what went on um with the twenty twenty show i don't know if you saw that a few days ago
and actually they specifically talked about some in the area where i am here in texas
oh you knew of the
i'm not familiar with those homes per se but um they were in the area where i live uh
and it was really revealing to see some of the you know the things that go on i guess in some of these homes
so i would definitely
i guess that the big thing would be once you got someone in a home like that to to make sure that you went daily you know and made sure that they were cared for
well from your point of view
but how do you think they would feel i should say about moving from where they have lived most of their life into a whole new new home situation
well actually i have that kind of situation because my mother lives with me
and she's eighty-seven and uh from the time that we were tiny she said you know i want you to promise that you'll never put me in a rest home
so i know how she feels about it
you know if i uh if i ever had to put her there i think uh it would be probably when i just could not handle it any more you know if i she got to the point where she was totally bedridden and and i mean i just didn't have the skills or the strength to lift her or whatever it needed
well how do you find that your your personal relationship is with her know that you're both together all the time and you are having to do a lot more for her than normal
does that does that cause any problems between the two of you
uh i wouldn't say any more than usual
i think it's very hard for her um to be waited upon so to speak
i mean i think it's hard for her to have that role of not being able to do as much as she used to
um on the other hand it takes on almost a a switch of a mother child relationship
my mother lives in an apartment with my sister and uh so i except for the three or four months this summer
and of course since i see her only once or twice a year i was just thrilled to have her here with me
and i spent every minute i could to be with her and uh cooking foods for her you know just to make her her life as though she were on vacation
but somehow another it that doesn't work between my mom and my sister
and they they find they they are
and my sister's uncomfortable because her mother's there
so it's it puts has put pressure on both of them from that point of view
so that's that's kind of bad news
and by the same token my wife's mother is now moved into a nursing home
and after all she has been a farmer's wife
but she doesn't like the food
and when she
so that's another one of those things you have to solve
well that's got to be a big adjustment for someone that's as you say lived on a farm for sixty years
and then go to something like that
after all their their life is so totally different
because in those early days the food they had to make it from scratch so to speak
i mean you raised your own chickens
and you killed your own hogs i suppose
and then they they had to store the meat in uh
but they had regular little places they they would hang it you know to cure it and so forth
and and now all of a sudden it uh comes in differently
do you have a do you have any uh major preferences as far as
t v uh
i was trying to think of some while they were calling you uh
all the uh the one with the two little girls in it what's it called
the the two twins play the the twins play that one that the youngest girl
uh i don't know
but that's not it
i i like uh
i really like watching the old nick at nite shows you know
and uh we we can watch those all night sometimes if
uh lately i've been getting into talk shows
just you know controversy and
which which one does which ones do you like
it depends on the subject actually
where where it's more interesting
his name is uh
he's he's black
and has a bald head
and his first name starts with an m
huh let's see
oh it's like
his first name's like mar- marlo or marlin
anyway he always has like really strange shows like uh
see i don't i don't like those
but i mean yeah
it seems like uh
so and i'm working too
so everything keeps me pretty busy
uh speech pathology
oh that's what i'm majoring in
uh this is my first semester
who who who who what when did he teach
he uh he taught about a year ago
he used to work at uh uh university of texas at d-
uh oh shoot
but uh he worked there for like fifteen years and then part time u t d at night
and and then they stopped funding the program there
and so now he's at texas women's university
oh is he teaching speech pathology there
he published a paper uh couple of years ago i think didn't he well one that i read
does he publish a little quite a bit
and he has he has some like different programs out
like i don't know what they're called
but they're like
and he has like little ani- stuffed animals with them and like little cards and stuff
he has a test he has a testing yeah
i re- i remember
well that's interesting
uh what are you studying
uh i was i am studying nursing
but i'm thinking about changing right now
i just i don't know
and it's really tough to get into the program down here
so if i don't do that if i decide to stay in nursing i'll probably come and go to t w u
i'm living in the t w u dorm across from collier uh
that's that's where the speech program is uh
and there all those nursing majors
i i tell you what
that's that's a tough that's a tough uh field though
i i have a lot of respect for those people
i mean they've spent a lot of hours studying
so you're at baylor
so but i get to come home at on the nineteenth
and i'm so excited
oh is it
it's in provo actually
i really i really like it out here
but i've been i i've been away too long
so i i've been away from there too long
uh how how
well i play a couple of instruments
um clarinet is my primary instrument
and i also play a little bit of saxophone flute and piano when i get the opportunity which isn't very often
i play uh the violin and play trumpet and i run a municipal band
and i sometimes conduct
so i'm pretty busy too
was about forty-five miles away and i play in a slightly smaller one called the lockhaven symphony and community orchestra
so are you a professional musician
i'm uh just retiring from penn state university only i i should
but uh i've been working at uh penn state and using up all my nighttimes
and weekends uh going to these orchestra rehearsals and and concerts and so forth
and that's just
well we rehearse once a week
that's amazing because i i i have it set up here that we have at least six to seven rehearsals per concert
well one thing is we have a summer ser- summer series
and every single sunday night we play at the library to have a little out outdoor stage set up and so we do that every sunday night during the summer
and then i don't know we just have an awful lot of engagements
and we're just having to turn a lot of people down um because you know uh we don't want to do things like have a concert back to back or even two days in a row
i mean you you must back up and play some of the music twice
you know you get your little sousa book
and you just flip
so your you don't play pretty well a full concert band music most of the time then
um and it's always a mystery
because it actually doesn't matter who shows up
because so many people switch instruments so often
but um yeah
um i think there's about seventy
but on any given night there's not seventy you know
because about the best i can normally hope for is about fifty in in the band i have here
but that fills a stage and keeps us busy
and so they want to play things that uh push them to do
so that's why we have to work real hard when we get a concert together
and the last one we did was in a large uh mall close here
so that worked out very nicely
well let's see
well there's another band around here
someone at work is trying to get me to join that one because they need clarinet players and their concert schedule isn't as heavy
but they have more in the summer
i think they have ten in the summer you know one one week after the other
i think they're like monday nights and they don't have rehearsals during that time period
are you just saying you you sight read every concert
uh well it's not really sight reading when you've done it you know again and again and again
but some people are
and where where does this happen laurie
well they're in the suburbs of dallas in richardson and plano
well i declare
well it's more of a i think it's very much more of a social group than anything else you know
and and people always bring refreshments for after rehearsal and hang around for an hour or so
do any of your you in your group get paid for any of this
um well the conductor gets paid a little bit you know
um i think he's the only one that gets paid
and you do have to buy your music
who who sponsors you basically the city
um but we do get an awful lot of music you know
we can borrow music from any of the area colleges or you know if some some group just isn't going to play any more they'll just give us their music and that type of thing
and we do an awful lot of you know
but we get a lot of donations
well i i work the same way
well i'll be darned
well what do you think
well providing universal health care insurance for the whole country is a pretty big task
and i uh personally i don't approve of it for two reasons
number one is that i think that uh the federal government has a problem with the deficit right now
and if they were to administer this they would uh
number two i think that the quality of health care would go down because the competition would would be dried up
and really no one would be would only answer to to the government to a big bur- bureaucratic mess
and uh i've seen what it has done in other countries
and so i don't think uh i don't think we should head in that direction
and i do agree that they exist
because health care insurance for for everyone is skyrocketing
and it's become to a point where basically no one can afford it anymore
well i agree that it's a big task
but i think that i think that the u s should move toward some kind of national health care plan at least as a long term kind of goal
and possibly y- just starting with more regulation of health insurance and that sort of thing
but i think that ultimately it would be a good idea to uh
it uh just because it seems that uh health insurance costs are sky rocketing well as fast as the national deficit perhaps
and so that
and that's a that's a vicious cycle of course
so what you're saying though is instead of having the national government uh government administer giving health insurance to every man woman and child with throughout the whole company you see more of them as regulating the high costs uh that people are forced to pay for it right now
is that is that correct
or do you think that
well i uh well i wouldn't exclude the possibility of the government actually administrating it ultimately
well with the with the costs as they are right now do you think that the government uh
because what that would require is for us to pay uh more taxes
and the the in- the people that can afford taxes the middle income and the upper income will be paying more c- taxes to to pay for health insurance for everyone whereas right now the the public themselves get health insurance
and they provide their own health insurance
the well as it is now the middle and upper classes are paying more than their share for the health care of the whole country because they're the only people that can afford health insurance
and so that the other people have no health insurance
and you know they'll get medical care anyway at least in emergencies
and somebody winds up paying for that
and basically the people paying for it are the people who are buying health insurance
so i don't see that anything that this situation would get any worse
you think it might b- get better huh
i i kind of disagree
the reason being is uh we have
i guess it's my my fear of the national government and also because the bureaucratic rules that it would take to administer it
and uh the the health insurance companies right now pretty much regulate and are pretty picky and and uh don't allow cases where they might throw them out of business whereas the federal government if they took over everything they wouldn't care because they'll never go out of business
and so you'd s-
i i feel that the cost would increase dramatically also
but in the same sense the the care and the the attitude of the doctors and the professionals within the medical uh field would would diminish
well i think
um i'm not sure what contributes to air pollution exactly
but i guess when you think of it everybody has some sort of aerosol in their home you know
and it's kind of dangerous
uh i don't know
we live um well i'm close to salt lake and there's mountains uh you know all around
but sometimes i think tend to hold a little bit of it in you know
really it's it's fairly clean um
but you know how quite a
but you think the mountains and the are kind of a barrier
but but uh anyway i don't know
when i drive down you know along the just along the freeway there's a lot of plants that they're burning things
here in texas i know a lot of the pretty much every place here is relatively flat
and so i would think that that would probably contribute to us not having that big of a like a smog problem or something like that
we we have a real fog problem um
the last few years just in through december and january it it really is foggy and and seems to just um
it's kind of like it it just stays for a month quite foggy
but uh gee
i don't i don't know what else
i guess i've never really uh thought about the fact like in california they they have a lot of smog problems
and it's real hilly there
so that is probably something that plays a
i think probably just uh a lot of factories um you know they have the smoke stacks i guess you call them and different things like that
that's that's what i see burning a lot
i know uh-huh there are some oil companies
and i'm sure that that contributes a lot
aren't they supposed to be coming out with some sort of uh special gas or something that doesn't emit certain chemicals or something
oh i don't know
i haven't i haven't heard that
i know uh
but i know i think they they differ from state to state
but um you know that's been a new thing in the last few years
and i guess some cars are a lot worse than others
i think those uh
well do you um are you working for t i
i i work in waco at a t v station
and that's how you got involved
no we we have um
my husband's sister lives in dallas actually
and they kind of got it us involved that way
yeah but well i don't i don't know
i know that um
i know they're always churning that up and i i think they burn a lot there too
we just had a big uh thing here in waco
and uh it's it's really been a big fight because a lot of the people that live by the landfill don't want it expanded because they're thinking that they're water is going to be contaminated somehow
and so they
well i don't think i'd i'd like that
you know we um when we've taken things to the dump just the dump uh that is uh you know closest to us
and i know that on windy days you know they're always moving the the trash over to different spots
and they've got those big bulldozers
and you can see the dust flying
and and i'm sure that their homes are really quite dusty
one one of the big concerns is they have a there's a school right across the highway from the landfill
oh is there
so the parents were really really upset
worried about their their kids getting huh
they they've been fighting over it for the last year
and they just now approved it
so they're going to try an appeal or something
cooking and food huh
uh i don't cook a lot actually
so uh i am kind of interested in cakes and uh muffins and stuff like that
but i can't seem to get them exactly right
so i am just trying to perfect some things
i uh have uh a bread recipe that is real easy that everyone always really does like
that uh doesn't require kneading the dough
and it is always it is wonderful
and what is funny is that you use uh bran all bran and it looks like it is a wheat bread
but it is actually all bran flour and uh you know it is just regular
the type that you know yeast and that sort of thing and you let it rise
and you can let it rise in the refrigerator and then punch it down and then uh make your rolls
they really are good and they are so easy to do
last year i had a christmas party at uh my office
and i uh made the tuna fish sandwiches
and everyone uh i mean i think everyone knows how to make tuna fish
so i thought that would be easy for me to make
and i can not go wrong with that
and so i made it
and uh i used celery seed in my
and i just thought it was so strange
because i never i thought that that was what celery seed was for
oh how funny
and so but everyone really really loved the tuna fish
and they just couldn't get over the fact that i used celery in it
and it just surprised me
well see i i have always used celery i mean i have used celery before
but i never used the celery seed in it
well what else do you put in it besides the celery seed
just like uh really fine onions and green pepper and the celery seed
and i use like uh miracle whip salad dressing instead of the actual mayonnaise because i really don't like the helman's mayonnaise
but if you use salad dressing with kind of uh you know kind of i guess a tart taste
but i uh it was the first time i have
i was brought up with tuna fish you know where you put in uh oh chopped hard boiled eggs which is now is a no no with cholesterol and uh
you know chopped up dill pickles
like i don't think i had eggs that night or something
but i would have put eggs
but isn't that interesting
so you you you use bell pepper and onion and celery seed
and sometimes i use the miracle whip
and sometimes if i am using like regular mayonnaise to spice it up a little bit uh i will use a little bit of mustard with it
just to to put a little zing in it
i like uh to barbecue baby back ribs
and uh and and they are so easy to do if you uh have a good barbecue sauce and you uh just cook them very very slowly in the oven
and it is not hard to cook like some meals are
and it is not of course it is messy to eat
and uh i make lasagna from scratch
and people really like my lasagna and so uh sometimes i am requested to make that
and that is not too hard to do because you can do it in advanced and just bake it
and not breaking the uh the uh pasta
then i have a wonderful recipe for strawberry pie
it just takes forever but it is uh when the strawberries are nice and big and fresh and yummy
but this one is basically it is like a normal pie crust
but then you use this sort of uh
it is a cream cheese uh uh layering
but you use uh thin it out a little bit
uh or make it a little fluffier
and you put uh line the whole pie crust with that and so it is sort of like in a way uh using cheese cake
but and it is not a real cheese cake
and then you
and just put the strawberries
and uh it is really making me want to exercise
because every single woman in the audience is uh about ten pounds
so uh i started anchoring last uh anchoring uh
exercising last about last spring when i uh joined the president's health club
and i was really motivated and going
and uh i went uh for a little while uh
but it is hard to go regularly for a long time
and where i live in waco uh they do not have anywhere here that is affiliated with president's
so now i do not have a club
and i am uh i do not have any motivation to just go out and jog aimlessly or something like that
so i am not exercising at the time at the moment
so i wish i could
but i just do not like just running with no where to go
i had gone gotten up regularly for awhile with a neighbor uh
and i thought that would be the time to get going
and so we walked pretty steadily for about three weeks
and uh then she had to get back to work and which was
and so she is not around
and i just don't like walking by myself at night or in the dark of the morning i don't seem to find time in the day time
and of course it is motivation that is keeping me from really looking for that opportunity
i think a lot of the times if you have someone to uh work out with or walk with or something it does give you that motivation
and you can also i mean you can you know pretty much do it privately if you had your own private uh sort of contest you know where you would try and see if you could lose more weight than your friend or something like that
and that would keep you going
well more than weight
of course i could lose uh lose certainly from ten to twenty pounds but i think more than that
and that is something that i am motivated about now because i do need to get myself feeling better just in better shape
but uh all the same it is connected to my attitude
because i am not feeling as perky and good
it is hard to get my attitude to uh to get myself up there
and i understand that walking is suppose to be the like the best exercise
and you have less chance of hurting yourself
cause it it works everything and it gets your breathing up and it doesn't yeah
like i understand running hurt your shins or knees or something like that
and it felt good
but then i had pulled a muscle in my knee
actually i hyper extended it or something
and uh boy
so and i have never had that problem before but i guess that age just starts to catch up to me
i guess my my favorite exercise in the uh in the gym is the bikes
oh is it
and if you watch television they usually have television in there or something or if you listen to a walkman it is pretty it is pretty okay
again that is sort of weird because you you are not going anywhere
and uh i use to play racquetball and i really liked that because you know to me it had a point
you know uh there were points you could you would make
and there was a point to it
but running and jogging and just not going anywhere is just
well i have got a dog now
and of course she needs walking and that is a little less trau- uh burdensome or boring to be walking at least with her
and i can put on the earphones to have something to listen to
like you were talking about walking at night and in the morning or early in the morning uh
you see a lot of uh mostly older people though but that uh walk in the malls
you know like early in the mornings and things like that
you know i have never even thought about it really
we we have uh over here in plano a little recreation center that has got uh a walking track
that it is also for security as well as the convenience of doing it any time of the year
but i find it very tedious because i am watching the clock constantly
and it there is just nothing else to look at
and i actually get more tired doing that than
and that is a little less
well what kind of music do you like
well seeing as how i'm a musician
well i like everything from hard core country to you know wagner and mahler
and i like new age stuff
i i basically have a wide range of musical likes
do you uh
that is not there is uh things written for doc severenson and uh a few other people
but the rest of them are just parts
well i love baroque music
so it is one of my favorite periods
in fact i
well we used to have uh ralph dutchen
but now he is in massachusetts
then there is a trumpet player at north texas the the teacher the main teacher
and he has played
and the two of them have played natural trumpets
and occasionally when she can't get those people we use you know just uh e flat trumpets with valves
and like glen bell plays
uh rick uh bogarts played
so do you like romantic music
well that is what that is mostly the rest of good trumpet marks are romantic music mahler and ruckner and strauss
uh i like i am liking it more and more now
they are mostly uh mostly mozart
but uh you know the i just like the melodies more and uh libretto
and my trumpet teacher used to play in the fort worth opera
because i don't i have not seen him playing anywhere lately
but maybe it is cause he is playing in fort worth
well i am basically a church musician
and we do all
and we hire lots of instrumentalists off and on for uh different things
so i am always making music
well there are some of the few organizations that have the funds to uh you know do like big big works
but we hire you know we hire an orchestra at least twice a year
but he plays pretty regularly
uh i think so
because i heard glen bell taught at plano as well
they are the two of them are mainly pretty much the they have cornered the market on trumpet
well we uh are a group of uh musicians that just kind of have you know formed out of a desire to sing
and many of the people in the group are very professional in the sense that they or just real talented i should say
lot of them are former music teachers or currently teaching uh
there's one gal that's in the uh plano community orchestra uh
just you know different backgrounds
uh i play the piano and uh i have a four year old who who has started to play the piano
he does that uh musically listens
and then he can play which is kind of interesting
i think it's because he's always heard music in our home all the since he was a baby
oh they did
and that's lots of fun
how did how did they get involved in that
uh basically they read in the newspaper that there were open auditions
and so they went and tried out
and my husband played harold hill from the music man
and my son played one of the children in a band
oh how fun
and uh my son plays the clarinet in his band at school
and my daughter takes piano lessons too
but uh we just really like music
it's a i i especially like it as an outlet when the t v goes off
and uh who do you have her or him take it from
uh i have him take from a friend of mine who teaches suzuki
you listen to the music and then learn to play it by lear- by hearing the intervals and things like that
i teach uh
and you play what's on the piano
but he can't learn like that
he's only about i guess he's about two and a half in his real understanding of things
and uh so when my friend played something on the piano and he played it uh with his right hand
we went wow we better have him do s- do something
you know educationally
so that was really fun
well because my
so my husband and i love to go to the musicals when they come into town into dallas
well i have an eight and a half year old daughter who's taking piano lessons and started out at the age of just turning five because she wanted you know she just seemed to enjoy it so much
and now my my four year old four and a half year old daughter is is trying to imitate her older sister and wanting to play
and she actually does some very nice chording just naturally
oh i think that's great
so i wasn't sure when to start her
i didn't want to push her too early either but uh kind of had a mixed feelings about that scene
that's really hard i think because especially if you start them
and then they get pretty good
and then they get close ten you know eleven or something
and you're like god i really want
so sometimes it's hard to to know exactly when
but i don't know
knowing from what my daughter has gone through she's she learned a lot
and of course it was something she had to keep relearning if she ever got away from it
so uh i don't know if she's any farther ahead than those kids who started when they were eight
or or should i say seven
i mean she's not a gifted pianist in the sense that she's going to excel just naturally
but uh so
but so i'm kind of you know just playing with it
but at this point we're going to kind of wait i think just more for the financial reasons of it anyway
well it can get expensive that's for sure
i my friend is is very generous in in letting us have my children uh do the suzuki method without paying a lot out
oh that's good
so it's been good for our family
well as a piano teacher do you have any feelings for kids who come from a suzuki method
i don't have any suzuki students uh
something happening to me at christmas time that that verified to me that i will al-
well i don't have an elderly person that i could send to a a nursing home or anything
my both of my parents are dead
but i did have a friend that was in a convalescent home uh like a nursing home
and i h- went there very often to visit her and uh
i think they would be better off being at home with their family you know
we have a an eighty seven year old mother in law living with me right now and because of her circumstances she can no longer live independently
and even moving from her house to our house has been tremendously unsettling for her
and we have several young children and they about drive her crazy
oh i can believe that
because most elderly people can't take having a lot of noise and kids running around and things like that
well we've you know we've struggled a lot with it because again most of the nursing homes i've been in are very depressing to me
and she's still alert enough that i think she would really know that we were putting her there and i think she would really resent it
and i think that would make it very hard
but on the other hand i see my wife with
oh see now that's that's that's really a sad situation
really you know
and when the kids have kids come you know she's always saying you know why do they have to be here
and she'll say that to the kids' friends
so it's a hard situation either way i think
in a case like that you know you more or less think it would be better if she were in a nursing home because you have your family growing up where
but the cost of these nursing homes are so
you know so you really have no choice that way if you you know if you're not rich or s- you know
uh i know this lady that you know that was a friend of mine
now her husband was still alive at the time when she was in there you know
and it was costing him a small fortune to keep her in there
i think we need to develop some alternatives like adult day care that's more readily available you know
you know just come home for dinner
and then usually they want to go to bed fairly early anyhow
you know so that would probably be nice if we could ever get something like that
but there's not many of those available right now and they're very hard to get them into
and we tried sending her to a senior citizen center
but they're really not prepared to cope with her because she's somewhat senile
and so a lot of the activities that they're engaged in she can't participate in
but i think it's an issue that you know
with the graying of america we're really going to have to as a as a country figure out how we're going to deal with this
because it is a difficult situation
and you know you hate seeing them just sort of send off and not well cared for
if if they don't know anybody and they don't know what's going on around them and everything like that well i can see maybe a nursing home would be better you know
but if they they have their wits about them and everything why it's kind of hard
and then i think it depends on their physical ability too you know
well uh my mother always said she hopes she never had to be like that
and uh luckily i mean she lived by herself
and then you know one day she had a heart attack
and she was gone
so she never did have to go into a nursing home or anything like that
but there's so many of us kids there was like seven of us that
you know she could have taken turns living with each one of us you know for a sh- a sh- a period of time because we all don't live in the same city anyhow o- nor the same state
uh i i have a couple more that live out here in california
but then i have a broth-
uh why don't you go ahead first
uh short term uh it works out pretty well because we have just enough to cover expenses with a little left over
so budgeting in the short term isn't too much of an issue because there's not that much uh extra to go around
uh long term is
so we're we're starting to think about long term considerations college and retirement
but with not a whole lot of discretionary money it's kind of hard to figure out how to do it
that's kind of uh
to what we're doing is budgeting you know
month to month is uh kind of taking into consideration what the bills are and what's extra
so that's kind of how we do it uh from month to month depending on what insurance is due or whatever
uh long term that's a little bit easier for us because uh with our jobs we can take out extra money towards savings four oh one k plans uh that kind of you know retirement plans that kind of stuff
so we can kind of put aside some money that actually is better for us not to see versus when it's on the paycheck
and you have to try and take out some of that money
so uh long term probably is a little bit better than short term simply because uh it's automatically taken out
so uh that works out much better for us
so that's kind of how we do it anyway
and the old uh if you can't see it then you can't spend it uh idea
and if you can't touch it you can't spend it either
so that kind of works out where you get into uh some plans that you know you touch it you're going to get a penalty that kind of thing
so it leads you to kind of say well i'm not going to take it out
i'm going to keep it and uh
so you'll have that
so that's kind of how we do it
but ours is more like month to month too uh
so anyway other than that uh is kind of how we do it
so i don't know if we're our time is up or what
uh they'll uh
we we actually do have some money in a four oh one k
i just wish i could afford to uh put more away each week because i agree that it's a an excellent way
and uh it grows uh
it it seems like at first you're not going to see a big return
but as the years go on if you're with the company for any length of time then it gets much better
so you know you just have to kind of look at it that way
and there's other savings plans or other things that you can do
automatic you know deposit from checks to where you don't see it
and uh you know exactly whatever is in our checking account is basically just about what gets spent
and we don't see it
then it works out to where you know you don't look at it
and that's it
it it's easy because you do spend it
like i said you know you kind of look at it uh
you better have some other way of uh savings
otherwise uh checking accounts aren't the best for you know long term type of planning
so and you don't get a good return on it anyway
i guess there other than things like the stock market or mutual funds there's really not much of a return on anything these days
it's a bad time you know
i mean it it's nice for people buying homes
but for older people who have money in c d or whatever it must be awfully hard to see rates go down to three and a half percent or whatever
you know we have some in-laws uh that uh had theirs in some money market certificates and other things and uh kind of took them out of that because they got so low
it's it drops
so your better bet is to uh try to get in with something with your corporation if they have some kind of uh savings plans or something like that to where they kind of match the percentage or whatever so or some kind of profit sharing
i'm i'm with a small company now
and i hope that uh if we're successful that they'll go in for some sort of profit sharing that'll be very nice
well i guess we're kind of running out of steam on this topic here
well uh just briefly
uh i worked in a nursing home
so i kind of know from way back uh how things used to be run
and i think there has been definite changes of nursing homes
but i think uh if i had to personally put one of my parents in a nursing home they would have to be pretty bad off to where i couldn't take care of them at all
and they cook meals
and they clean their house for them
so they still have their own independence
and not reliable you know
but uh i don't think
the nursing homes when i was working in them were very much understaffed very much uh in need of good personnel uh
i wouldn't have you know
but they they were not given the time
and they were not given the money basically to staff appropriately people to help
and i can remember lifting a patient all by myself simply because there was not another person to help
it's either le- leave the patient in bed all day long or get them up
and i would have preferred to get them up than
but uh uh so i think nursing homes are have changed
but hopefully they have
wel- th- i guess i haven't had that much experience
i've only seen like my great grandparents in a nursing home but i have an aunt who lived on her own until she was well in her nineties and then she she got sick
and she ended up in nursing home and my parents went to visit her
and it got to the point where the nur- it seemed like the nursing home didn't want to deal wi- her anymore and so they gave her drugs to keep her asleep
i i think that's that can happen
and i think in the nursing home that i worked for
but i'm sure that some of the patients were uh given medication to keep them in uh quiet
and they would just lay all day long
and uh the ones tha-
they were not on the same you know ward
but they they were in the same nursing home
so that these mentally ill patients could walk into where the other uh older people that were in there for reasons of uh you know age uh
the mentally ill patients could walk right in into the rooms or do whatever they wanted to basically
because if you weren't there to watch them and keep them in their own wing they could they had freedom to just walk around
and a lot of them were i think there was a couple that were schizophrenic
and i remember one time watching one of the uh schizophrenic patients actually go out on i don't know what they call it a binge or whatever you want to say it she grabbed a hold of this
and it was kind of funny when i looked back at it
but i mean i remember the patient getting very upset
that woman actually pulled uh the other person's hair
i mean she just came up right behind him and pulled his hair you know
and it was a guy that was just really upset
i mean he said what the hell are you think you're doing you know
and i laughed at it then
but then i'm thinking god you know
so i think there's laws now that kind of protect that nursing homes either have to keep the mentally ill totally away from these people and not in the same type of facilities
and a lot of these older people have their you know they're not insane or anything like that
they don't have these tendencies to to lash out
but seeing that kind of made me think twice about
because it seems like the small town nursing homes there's a lot more personal attention
i i kind of look at it this way
and you have more competition
and i think nursing homes have to be better than when there's one nursing home for a whole community
and this is back in nineteen seventy-seven that i worked there and i look back at it and say jeez you know
i- it would have to be awfully bad for me to put my parents in there
but my grandmother uh later on got cancer and uh could no longer
well actually she
well far too much for what we get
i mean uh-huh
well i think uh you know when i look at uh all the things that are coming out now about over spending and spending money that's not there and buying things that are extremely expensive where they could buy it at a at a better discount uh
when you when
you mean like those you know twenty thousand dollar toilets
that's exactly uh the whole thing
and it's just
as long as the person that's spending the money uh doesn't think about
oh i can go out and spend anything that i want to
so they they think well i'll go out and buy a four hundred toilet seat
and i could have went to k-mart and bought it for you know ten or fifteen
i mean that kind of thing
e- i don't mind them getting what they need
it takes you know very little to just shop around and
and i know a lot of uh corporations now are looking at their amount of money that's being spent
and they're looking at what's the best buy
it used to be you could go if you had a company you had to go through certain people
and you didn't care what you paid
going to actually shop at best buy for best buy is one of our electronic stores for fax machines things like that instead of going through these office supply companies that mark up their amounts and say you know i'll give you a legal pad for five bucks
and you can go to another shop and get it for maybe sixty cents or nin- or ninety cents that kind of thing
i'm also wondering why our taxes are still so high considering like the world's probably in better shape now than it has been in the last fifty years
except for everything keeps going up you know
and i know as a middle class uh you know
and also i have one dependent has my daughter
and i keep looking at well where's the tax so-called tax uh relief for having children
i mean there is none
oh i know
i mean i think i paid just as much as when i didn't have her
i mean i don't even you know i don't even get to see half my paycheck
between four oh one k and and the thirty-four percent they're taking out for taxes
but you're still going to owe the government as much money so by the end of this coming year what's going to happen is all these people are going to find out that they owe the government
and it certainly isn't going to be in their savings uh account
and there'll be a lot of problems because of that you know
put people into you know january or february which is always suppose to be
so they're going to have to just cut back
so i don't know where the answer is
in the first place you know there's also like taxation without representation
well i don't feel represented anymore in our government
i mean it
well that's the whole thing
well i don't think people think they can make a difference
and when you've got candidates as you do
it's candidates that have money and it's backed by big business
and big business says well we don't care about the little person
and uh you know you're not going to get anymore abe lincolns around
well who knows uh
but but that that's going to backfire because
generations from now we might uh set back in our little uh rocking chairs and watch our grandchildren go through an entirely different system of things and say you know this government itself isn't working
just like the communist government of uh the old u s s r
and maybe that's going to happen to america where they'll say hey
and each state take care of itself and no government type of uh you know
but something has to happen
i mean i'm certainly fed up with it
should they uh should young americans be forced to do a year of service
i don't i don't think they should be forced
but i think they should be i guess encouraged to to do some kind of public work i guess to just to get them i guess involved with community maybe you know
but but other than that i think it's it's a good idea to get them involved in city and community activities and you know like the uh shelters and uh
helping out uh volunteering i guess if they can
i i i'd force them
i think that uh i think it would be i think mo- i think a lot of kids actually do a lot of work
and no one just realizes it
i think they start out young like in uh girl scouts and boy scouts
i was a i was a boy scout
as part of being a boy scout you had to do you know projects all throughout
and then to become an eagle scout you have to spend a do a yearlong project
that's see that's what we did in girl scouts
and that got you involved real good
and it i think it starts kids out on the right track
and then it lets them decide if that's what they enjoy doing
i think i i now i think people generally volunteer
i think i think a lot of people a lot more people volunteer than than uh than we than get credit for it as you know like in hospitals and uh and the shelters and stuff like that
and even if it is a couple times a year like at the holidays i mean at least they're getting out and doing it and
well we have a funny commercial around here
we could they could solve all the world's problems or something
i guess if we all give five hours a week or five percent of our salary we could uh
or just or just gave or or or just forced our kids just to to force kids to serve for uh parents i guess
my my yeah
i've noticed a lot of uh
and i think that's pretty neat
they uh go along and have so many miles i guess of highway to take over and they clean it up
and i think you know again
and i think it gets them prepared to to learn how to volunteer as they get older
i know i did you know in girl scouts and everything
just started trying to get them something together l- l- like like that around here from for from the community because uh we had a big ice storm uh very very recently
i'm in uh new york
long way uh
and we just had a really big ice storm
and basically half the trees in in our city i'm in rochester which is uh right upstate half of the trees in the city uh are no good anymore
you know we had three hundred thousand people without power
you know it was
and you know and and they and we didn't have power for a week
and there are still people who don't have power
it's been it's been it's been ten days already
and there are still something like ten thousand people without power
oh my god
and were officially yeah
and we're officially in a state of emergency
funny thing is the news the national news how they covered it uh
and and we've been in a state of emergency for over you know for ten or eleven days
we just got our phone back today uh
and and they're you know putting out ads now for people to come volunteer
well that's good
because we have you know
every- everywhere that a tree is down people need help
we're all all a lot of older folks need help getting
and they and and they certainly can't carry it themselves
that's one thing we do at our church is uh
and we go along
and i'm really not sure how we find the individuals
but we find older people that cannot afford to fix up their homes that n- desperately need it
and uh we go along with all the material and in one day more or less go in and say roof paint fix whatever we can
oh that's great
i mean it's not a lot because you're just doing a house at a time
but you know every little bit helps
and is that supported by all donations to the church and so forth
oh so he
so he donates a lot not everything but a lot of the material
and it's not you know we don't promote it a lot outside the community because we don't want recognition for it you know so much as we just want to help people out
so it's real neat
and i and i bet it gives you a real good feeling to be doing that
but it helps people
like this last couple we helped you know they were in their eighties
and she was bedridden
and i just you know just tears your heart out to to see this kind of thing
and you know if you can do any a little bit it helps
that's that's uh that's real good
we had uh we had organizations like that in college you know
and some did like that some did elderly visits
some did uh some did you know big brother big sister stuff like that
and i'm convinced that that that at least twenty-five percent of our school participated in some sort of a some sort of group you know
ac- activity like that
you know twenty-five i don't know twenty-five percent
that's that's a lot of kids though
and she thinks yeah
it it was a small school
still that's a you know that's a good chunk of kids
but i mean a a a lot of people would get involved
and you know because there were all different
they had a dance marathon for charity or to to support that
such that you know lots of people got involved that way
but uh like i'll agree with you though
and you know
i don't think that some people i don't think have uh a year in them to volunteer if you know what i mean
or some people unfort- just just can't even afford it
you know whatever
the peace corps doesn't pay very well you know
and then you know and then and then their parents
i have a uh a a friend whose whose son is in the peace corps in guatemala or daughter is in the peace corps in guatemala right now
and you know he and his wife just went off to visit her
and you know i know i could never afford to go visit a kid in guatemala
you know so
so i think you know
and and and the kid's certainly not making much money
so i can see where that that
so i mean i'm grateful for people like that
i don't see how they can just yeah
well neither can i
so i i i i i i
and i'll do my little community service throughout but never never for a year again
so so i guess our vote is no
well it's been nice talking to you again
and i hope everything works out up there
we're we're slowly getting everything back together again
you know it it's taking time
but everything you know
well good luck
well good luck to you too
all right uh
and with have little regulation going on because of deregulation during the reagan eight years uh more and more s and l simply began to take riskier and riskier loans
and then when they began to collapse one after the other i think almost like an avalanche of of property values devalued
i don't have a a field for whether or not this is the equivalent of what was called the teapot dome
uh i vaguely recall
but i've never gone and done any study on it since the s and l thing
that teapot dome scandal is when i think during the hoover years where gobs of land was was sold at really inflated prices on the theory that there were natural gas beneath it
and that that appeared to be corruption within the hoover administration
i don't have a real since of of like corruption that caused s and l all though i have a feeling that people look the other way when things began to go sourer maybe
i think people just started you know no- not being as careful with the loans that they were making whenever you know whenever they gave them out
or maybe because everyone else was doing they figured they would just go ahead and approve it also
but if it captures some of the the feeling i have from the people making business decisions that if they failed it's sort of well no skin of my back
or i i just since that they didn't have a commitment to the stability of the organizations they were were making the decisions for
and i don't know whether that's because they had other opportunities to which they could move you know that it was that easy for them to find new work that they didn't weren't stuck to where they were
and things begin to collapse
or whether they had extracted enough money in a percentage base that they that they didn't care any more
i just i'm rather puzzled about the
i know well
but i don't as much as i should know about it
and um i do know that one of the reasons that caused it is the fact that the federal reserved backed any loan that the savings and l made with a a hundred thousand dollars
so they were kind of insured with that hundred thousand dollars
and i think that's kind of why they they were making the riskier loans
because they were like oh well we have a hundred thousand dollars insurance on it
well they didn't they didn't have a since of risk
and uh plus where the fact where they were allowed to make loans in any almost any type of loan
and like some banks you know they're limited to the types of loans that they're allowed to make
and i think the s and l were more open with the types of loans that they were allowed to make
and i think if they would be more bound to certain loans and not as high of insurance by the reserve then i don't think this would have happened
well do you think we there's a final accounting yet not in the since of pennies an nickels
but do you think there's accounting on an ordered of magnitude or or that that they really do understand how much money it is
for awhile it seemed like every time i opened the paper up it was escalating in terms of damage uh
did is your since that we now understand how bad it is
or is there more to be heard yet
um i think that people just basically got tired of hearing it
and it wasn't
i think it's still you know i adding up
and i think it will be for awhile
so you don't think necessarily they don't have a complete grasp yet
i i don't think they do
i don't think how i don't think how they could find that big how much was really lost or how much they were going to lose because there still are some s and ls still open
and it's it's very possible for them to go down in the future because of this
do you think to possibly is that it will help with the regular banks
i i don't know
i thin- i think it would be harder
but i think there are some regular banks that will go down with it
it seems that i recall reading for the last oh let's say starting three years a go but not so much in the last year of bank risks of relative to the loaning funds to third world countries like mexico venezuela
uh and argentina based on oil loans
and then the price of oil had had gone south resulting in those loans being very risky
and i guess i read articles of various banks that have done the right thing to contain their risks given that they had made multiple billion dollar loans
i have this vague since that that could happen that that there are still monies loaned out to third world countries that could end up being totally lost
oh yeah um
but they just wrote off like millions of dollars because they know they will never get it back
you know and they just they just wrote it right off
i think i think we've lost a lot of money
and you know like we every never going to get it back
and so you think that it's just gone
cause we- we're you know we're talking about some peens that have just like even gave up on like getting it back and trying any more
like my since is it was there to try to protect small investors
but it ended up protecting big investors
so i guess i i feel like as long as we have the possibility for this large numbers of people to be protected the possibility exist for these sorts of problems
i think is it necessary to have um the backing um
it it's it's just for you know safe purposes you know in case something would happen um
i don't i ne-
um so your since is that the that uh the loan guaranties which really were accounts guaranties
so the so that the account holders that if something went wrong they would have their money
and given that the s and ls have had disasters then those account holders are are their money is still being protected
and that is it's million of people with anywhere from thousands to tens of thousands i guess of of dollars being protected
it it seems like um there was a lot of money being protected in multiple accounts uh
if if you take ten million people and protect ten thousand dollars it still only a hundred bi- billion dollars
and we're taking about monies way in access of that now
so it's obvious that we've protected large accounts
and and it seems like maybe that needs to be thought about rethought
i guess i'm content with the need to have protection on on accounts
but i feel likes it's on an individual basis
and they're all protected by the government
and and let alone any of them that went bankrupt
and i guess that means that from my perspective it could happen again
because that means
i'm not worried enough uh
and then i then it will happen again because we don't pay attention to those kinds of things
but i think it will be a long time in the future before it does happen again
because i think like the bank people in any kind of people like that are going to be worry enough not to let it happen again in the near future
but i think later on they're going to start and forget about and start making the riskier loans
because i mean you're going to have to take some risk
and as long as their backed i think they're still going you know start taking on riskier loans
and i think there is a chance of it possibly happen again but not until you know late you know in the future
well perhaps if there are regulatory uh constraints put back in place
maybe we have learned a little bit of a lesson here about what happens if you remove a little of the regulation uh
well my family moved to texas about eight years ago
i i have never lived here
so um when we came back to texas i was really kind of excited
and there wasn't a tax on food that we purchased at the the grocery store and things
and all of that was new to me
because i'm sort of feeling like we're getting a better deal here
well i lived in missouri and then in utah
and them um both places had pretty good state income tax
and um we've always paid tax you know on everything we purchased even food at the grocery store
so i thought it was really you know kind of a pretty good deal not to have to pay tax on your groceries
and but i think i mean i don't enjoy paying taxes
and it's hard
but um i think that is what we have to have you know have our streets and have have our government and
and we have to pay for them and pay for the employment of the people that run them and and things like that
and i think i guess what i feel is that most people um they don't like to pay taxes because they feel like there's some people that aren't paying their fair share
and um that makes you feel bad
and you know when um when last year the elections were going on the governors election and state and you know
i i didn't have anything against clayton williams personally or anything
but um it was kind of hard for me to think here's someone as wealthy as he is
he claimed he had he didn't have to pay income tax
and he thought you know
there's some people are living pretty pretty good life styles
but they're not paying income tax
and that's not fair
and there's you know some people you know who are abusing the systems that we pay taxes to support
and all that makes us feel bad
but i think all in all how i feel is that um i'm willing to pay the taxes because i think i like our country compared to the other countries i've studied and visited
and i'm willing to pay extra to live here and to enjoy the services that i enjoy
and and i think that you know i don't think that there's any really any system that everybody would think is fair as far as being taxed
so i guess in texas with
so it's really the people that have money to buy things are paying the more because they're paying the sales tax on the larger items that they buy and stuff
we um lived in kansas city for a couple of years
and we were kind of in for a rude awakening
they had personal property taxes on like cars
and the first year we were there it was kind of like eight hundred dollars
and we're like
so i mean that was kind of different
and then to file a a state income tax was also kind of tough too
so it always seems like you know we're always paying taxes for something
and it was kind of nice this year to finally be able to get a little money back
i um have a accounting background
so i then have also done tax returns in the past for other people when i worked for an accounting firm
and uh you know it is kind of sad to see how the people that have the resources to hire somebody and have the money to spend to put there money in places they don't have to pay taxes
so you know i think if i can understand why the rich people don't want to pay
you know a large large percent
because you know that's not really fair either
if they've earned money by themselves well you know people just kind of given the money
well it is
and sometimes i think um well for myself that income that we have we pay a certain salary
but i think the employer keeps in mind this will be deducted you know
so so many taxes will be deducted from it
and so i think you know our salaries are a little bit higher because we have to pay taxes on it
and so i think you know in that way we're compensated um just by our society um
yet you know they don't pay you um what just what it would take
and if you pay taxes on it you wouldn't have any money left over
and and um but some of the people that make a great deal of money and everything i wish that they would i guess because i'm not one of them
i wish that they would you know realize that they they couldn't make this kind of money
even if they made that kind of money there's some countries that have like fifty percent income tax you know that have
they um they wouldn't be able to enjoy the in that
so that you know they need to be willing to pay a little bit more for it
but they need to pay for it too because they couldn't do it somewhere else
um i like texas um not having the state income tax
and i hope that
because um we've had enough industry here that i guess it
industry here is able to to fund the state because we have oil here and things
i mean that's what i've always heard
is that um
they must have enough other stuff because the way the oil has been the last few years that that really has not been
there's something about um the industry in the state
and the city had enough money
it was really nice that they had um that
but um they would have um so many community outdoor theaters and and like uh community country club type things
and i really liked that
why people decided to expect certain services
and i you know like
but um i'm i'm comfortable at least in this year with with
and i'm willing to sacrifice i guess
and i want to be here
and i enjoy i enjoy living here in this country
and having seen other countries i'd much rather live here and pay taxes
anyway well i guess i better let you go
i haven't ever i need i've never initiated one of these phone calls
you get what uh get luck of the draw
anyway well good luck to you
and um you're in texas
well i guess we should get on with this
um did you get the message about what it was
i think they'll always represent a threat wheth- whether or not there's an active cold war or not uh
it's it's a totally different economy based on different beliefs and and uh different priorities
and uh given the the uh military powers on both sides i think it's always a threat
i i suspect they're not our biggest threat anymore
but um i wonder if they're i wonder how much of a threat they are
i agree with you that that they'll always be somewhat of a threat given that they have that there's just it's just so big
and there's just so much military machine there
and and it's recognized that the two great powers are us and them
and and the great powers are always pitted against each other
but i wonder how much longer they're going to be a them
they they're going downhill pretty steady
but i i agree right now they're not
oh i agree
i mean if we were to if if something were to happen i'm sure they would all of a sudden band together just for the sake of for the sake of uh of of unity against us or something if if if need be
actually i feel kind of sorry for them right now because the people are are are uh wanting things that we have that they're not allow-
i mean just some basic freedoms
and and their government is not allowing it
and gorbachev seems to be going back on some of the things that he's been trying to push
actually i noticed this i mean this this this most recent scare of his where he said or he just decided that instead of having uh instead of having i can't think of the word now
if there are any demonstrations for in favor of boris yeltsin he decided well i'll just cancel all demonstrations altogether
so i i i think that he he he's actually
and he's also i think he's also making um the military angry at him
i mean i've heard stories now where the where the um the military is running around
and they're sort of getting restless
and a restless military is the kind of thing that happens you know
see i'm concerned that that since he's banned demonstrations altogether that he's going to do the type of thing that happened in tiananmen square
and he's going to wipe out no telling how many of his own countrymen uh right in the middle of red square
and uh it's going to cause a more civil war than is already occurring
i i wonder
he he seems
i mean and it it might be something that he wouldn't be able to control
that's that that's something that really true
that's that's certainly true
i mean his military may just go out and say well we just
and we're to not let you do it you know
that that's real scary actually
i mean i i i would expect their own problems would keep them away from us for a while
but it could be real dangerous
i guess as long as uh they're fighting each other we don't have to worry about them wasting their time with us
but wouldn't it be nice if no one had to fight anybody else
that but that's a that's an impossibility i think given the differences in the world
and people are just too different
well i don't i don't know
i think that un- underlying we're all pretty probably not as as different as everybody thinks
but unfortunately people people aren't that insightful
well that's that's certainly true of it
so therefore he's wrong
and he's bad
and we have to wipe wipe him out
i was i was discussing with someone before um
this someone before actually one of these calls matter of fact about another topic
but it came up
one of these calls matter of fact about um another topic
but it came up
one of these this this poem everything i wanted to know i learned in kindergarten or something
that this this is the idea that i think is actually very is is what i think we should all revert to
the idea that um
and in kindergarten we learned to share
and we learned to um play with each other
and whenever we'd start a fight we'd all apologize and hug each other you know
and that would be all
if we could just do the same thing sort of with with with everybody else i suspect we'd we'd be fine
but people grow up
and they forget
because i often i often sort of wonder how having never been to the soviet union um how different the people there really are you know
not right now of course but at some point i would like to go to moscow and and to just to see all these things that you can see on television now and can read about
that ten years ago we didn't have this kind of information and we didn't know what things were like
i would i would love to go there i mean like again not now but at some point to go see what what this is like
i mean this this is amazing because this is this is an this is an example of an entirely different culture that wants to be like us
so it would be interesting to watch
i and i the the people
i just feel so sorry for the people in the country that they can't i mean they they can't do any-
they and they there's nothing that they can do
and the ones i even feel somewhat worse for even um
the ones in like the baltic states where they don't have a strong leader then you know
at least at least russia has some sort of strong leader
i mean they have yeltsin who may who may yet sort of help russia
but um i mean the baltic states i think are just sort of trapped
i mean they were taken over couple you know not too long ago and then just sort of told well you're here now
it's a i think it's a sad state of affairs
it's it's probably not dissimilar from the uh what are they the the the i'm trying to think of the name of the the something like that in northern iraq who are actually countrymen of
i mean some of them were split off into israel i believe
and some of them are in turkey when actually they they don't they're their own people and their beliefs and their own culture system
and they were split up into three different countries
and and they're very dissatisfied
and they're they're causing wars right now
and i don't think it's that different from what the baltic states are are going through
um um um uh actually it sounds very i mean very similar
they're sort of being they were sort of forced
and now they just want to sort of speak up and say hey
and they have like a problem
i i mean i think their big problem up there is you know unfortunately
they all want the you know
whereas the baltics are saying oh we want our own
the the one that i think
one of the wom- women that i work for is married to an iranian
and so she has a lot of insight because she knows a lot of the history of the countries over there
and within five or six countries there are probably ten cultures of people
and that's they don't all have their own country
and and some of them are mad about it
um actually my wife is syrian
so i i also i know some of the history
and actually the other funny thing is that i'm i'm jewish
so we i i know
and i know
and i sort of toured the area
and i know that it really is very lots of different cultures in one place i mean and it's the same thing i thi- it's it's almost the same thing out out in the soviet union right now
there you know there are
i mean we did it couple of hundred years ago here
but they wanted to do it
and i don't think the people here two hundred years ago were that different
that's that's certainly true
i mean they had the same ideals and the same basic beliefs
i wonder i wonder if now the people in the soviet union don't have ideas very different from that
the- the- they might
i understand the topic this morning is uh our policy in latin america and you know what we've been doing down there
so uh as you indicated you don't have too much input into the area
it it just so happens that uh our daughter-in-law is panamanian
and uh we have been in panama
and i have worked in el salvador
and uh we visit mexico occasionally
we we do have a little information on it here
oh very good
because actually um when i was in college i visited mexico several times
i was in the peace corps and um
but but recently i have been following the middle east rather than
that's that's for sure
the u s policy uh towards central america as far as uh
well i kind of go back to to the el salvador thing because texas instruments had a a plant down there for a while
and i worked in there for a little while
and at that particular time
let's let's see
that was seventy-three seventy-four kind of before the the uh the civil war really picked up down there
and u s policy at that particular time there was of course military assistance to uh to the government itself you know
anything that's that's anti-communist you know we kind of had a tendency to be pro
and i believe at the time that i was down there that uh the government uh the salvadorian government you know really gotten out of hand yet
the uh right wing death squad type situation
but i don't i i wasn't really aware of it's being you know terribly uh you know at the time that that i was down there
but uh our policies seem to be pretty much one of uh you know trying to setup businesses down there and use the one resource anyway that salvador had
plenty of and that was people
we didn't seem to be going in and taking anything out of the country other than just it's it's labor
because everything that t i did anyway we we shipped in
and it was worked on down there assembled and then sent back here
i didn't feel that we really ex- exploiting them any
um so you don't you don't feel that that we were um exploiting in the sense of we were benefiting
and they weren't
in the particular incidence that i was aware of now t i wasn't the only ones in there
there was uh several other companies
and uh of course we kind of concentrate on
i felt like we're going in and taken all their um their gold or oil
because uh it just
the only thing that they had a great abundance of was uh you know human beings
di- did we tend to um change their attitu- attitudes
like sometimes when americans go into foreign countries they tend to flaunt american things americanism um consumer products t v the whole works
there was a uh
the time that i was down there i stayed quite a a bit at the uh uh one of the big hotels san salvador
and at the time i thought there ought to be a law against american tourists because they for the most part tend to be the most obnoxious as a as a group
and i saw this in panama also
uh oh you know it's it's the uh the almost stereotype you know
flowery shirt shorts camera hanging around their neck you know demanding this that and the other thing you know
we're we're here
and we want this
and we want that
that's that's the stereotype that's very strong down there you know
the the the you know that sort of thing
i i i believe those of us who were working down there got a little bit more appreciation for you know the local uh culture
but yet they were having to deal directly with uh you know with the uh the local people
and uh but boy
there is a there is a bad uh uh you know the old brash or ugly american-type
and i saw incidences in the hotel where i just wanted to go over and crawl in the corner and say oh my god
those are those are not americans
but there are
and uh of course now i i do have to i remember one case where we had some canadians in there who were every bit as bad
but i mean it i think it's just kind of the north american situation
but i didn't see quite as much of that sort of thing as panamanians are just about as
they're uh they're they're every bit uh
i i know when my my son was in the air force
and he was stationed in panama
and he married a panamanian girl
and when she came up here uh you know
she's y- kn- except for the language situation some of the cultures she's just about an american
you know is as far as t v and and you know the the moneymaking part of it and all that
and the local population kind of um you know sort of accepts that
but i've also seen the other side of it too
well you were in peru
but um i there weren't as i recall or at least i wasn't aware of that many americans there except for a very heavy concentration of peace corps volunteers
and it was one of the big targets
and um i don't i don't think at that time at least peace corps was uh an obnoxious group in the sense that that we were very controlled regarding number of days off
and and you couldn't just take up take off and leave your group and go explore and and things like that
but and i was working actually in the savings and loan program
so that was quite specialized
what uh what area did you live in
well is are they is peace corps still active down in there
i don't have any idea um
i mean there were thir- i was uh per- peru thirteen which meant there were twelve groups before mine
and and some of them were quite big in the sense they were community development
and they were building schools and doing co-ops and things like that
health um inoculation and and things
oh has those influences lasted
do you know whether the the things that that you and your groups before you did did those did those live on
or were they reabsorbed
because um some of some of the the peace corps uh that i knew of did marry peruvians
and every now and then some news filters in that they went to see some of the old things
and of course the savings and loan program um that was that you know that that just continued to grow
i mean we were just a very small specialized group too to get that going and spread
and then of course peace corps bowed out of that because that's uh uh something that nationalized very quickly
well that's that was kind of the the aim wasn't it to get it started and then have it
o- so you know well that's
i knew that there was a lot of a lot of effort
and a lot of work went into a lot of that
and i just wondered if if it lasted and if it took you know
i've you know some of the programs i would have concern about like um the language teaching you know
i mean why should we push english
and a lot of people were down there teaching english
and when they talked about hungary or someplace one of the eastern law countries requesting peace corps to teach language you know to me that's a little bit marginal
and the textbook was in english
but basically i taught it in spanish
because i mean i really didn't see the point in their knowing stuff rotely and writing it on a test
my brother-in-law teaches at uh northern illinois university
and they were in china here a couple of years ago
and he was over there at uh the university of shah and and teaching
so how do you feel about the metric system
i i i have a foreign actually i have more than one foreign automobile
and i i i find the uh i find the the nondecimal system with all the halves and quarters
and they give you these measurements like forty-two and three eighths inches
and we had to go a little less and trying to figure what's less than three eighths uh
so you used the metric
and you just go you just go down
and and you get out the the so many inches
and and we just marked a little bit less than that uh which is somewhat awkward
but had it been millimeters you could have done
they in essence have gotten around it by by listing uh decimal inches
do you- are you involved in any engineering drawing stuff that
uh i work in metal fab
and tenths of inches are are normal
and you know me- you know it is broken up in you know the inch is broken up and has been for quite some time for in tenths hundredths thousandths ten thousandths of an inch
well have have you do you are you involved in any other uh metric type things like
i i have a suzuki motorcycle
and and i've had motorcycles japanese motorcycles for years and years
and the metric system comes easy to me
i think it's interesting you we- you know when yo- you go out there
and you're looking for a wrench
and you want the next size larger
i've got i inherited some some stuff like fifteen thirty seconds
well now that one's fairly easy because that's probably slightly under half an inch
but some of them like like twenty-seven
and and there are some thirty seconds and some of the things that that uh don't translate
to go from from eighths to sixteenths to uh thirty seconds and remember where it falls it
and and you've got to go over there and try it
and i suppose you know i need a larger one
i mean obviously you can look at it and say well anyway
do you do you drink adult beverages
we- th- have you noticed that um that a lot of the um a lot of
and and the next
it's like a fifth like fifths of whiskey i thought was always kind of strange
i i always wondered about that myself
and and they had quarts at the same time though
but the idea was is that by with five fifths um they could uh they could uh they could sell five
and and um it was
it's uh i find that interesting
but it's like you know the the the the soda and this kind of things coming in on- one liter bottles
and um i i think it's kind of generational
although i must admit that that i am not i ca- i'm not conversant in saying you know that's three centimeters away i mean or or or
it it's like i say i work in a machine shop
and uh everything's still inches
everything's still fractions of inches or pa- or tenths or thousandths or or
it's it's hard to think though
it's like a mill you know
we we do uh um well we use a one mill bond wire or one point five mill co- bond wire on on semiconductor devices
and well what's a mill
but what really annoys me is the way we in the united states have been converting to metric
and before that we had a horizon uh you know plymouth horizon
and both of them were a mismatch of both
don't you find that interesting uh that they that
for ho- why why why pieces
could you could you get any connection on which was metric and which wasn't
and the starter was bosch american
the bolts were were eng- were were english then
it was it was annoying
one one half of the starter wa- you know three bolts on the starter
and two of them were american
and one of them was metric
and uh you go from the uh water pump up to the radiator
and on the water pump it was all metric
and and on you know the factory fittings you know the factory uh screw lock uh uh radiator hose clamps
because if if you look at general motors the size
and and and of course ford and chrysler
if they all went if they all went metric
but in a sense um you know it's like when yo- a measurement though when when you put uh you know one point four three two inches whe- when you're milling something uh you simply set your uh equipment
or or you measu- or you got your calipers there
and and you measure you know
it's it's not a problem either way
and you go to look at it
and you don't know which set to reach in american or metric
and and you're never quite sure
well is that a metric bolt
and you beat on it
it it can be annoying
and my other con- concern is is the american government going to force us to go
oh i think i don't think so
i i think that th- uh i think they've now just taken the attitude that well if it happens if it
because it there a lot of things that that uh um like sports you know
and uh uh but automobile races
and and it i i don't think it i don't you know i don't think i don't think it's particularly bothersome because in reality uh
you it's like troy ounces in ounces of gold
how many ounces of gold you know
i was trying i was trying to figure up gold content on something
it had has uh gold plated uh header
and and they're trying to think of what's a troy ounce
now that makes you know
and and is that going to change too
well i mean and and then there's a metric ton
and then there's a ton
but what's a metric ton
uh se- i don't remember
i i read it
and are we still going to maintain drams for perfume
and and then but then the medicine
and and some of these other things
and and the chemistry in those kinds of areas
and and so um but but when you go to order a drink um you know say they they i don't know it's uh
and what will a shot be
and and but you know when you go to the store and and you're trying to figure you know well this box is is uh is is twelve ounces
and and this one's uh uh three pounds um
and the other one's two point one kis
and and you're you're lost
and and i don't know
i i think that i i think i think the federal government is going to more or less leave it alone
i think they've got i think there are more pressing problems
uh what i was thinking about is an economical issue concerning it uh
but but are are the tools that uh
are you talking about cutting equipment or tools for tha- for set up
uh tools for set up and for measurement
uh you got to have a one tenth indicator
it's a hundred dollars uh
five tenths indic- uh usually two one tenth indicators at a hundred dollars each uh
you got to have uh six inch set of calipers at anywhere from sixty to a hundred twenty dollars
you got to have a zero to one for sixty dollars uh
so you've got thousands of dollars or so
but i was thinking about though that that when you actually get to the milling equipment though when it starts turning
well i know
but whe- you when you when you simply drilling a hole i mean a real simple thing like gee
as in metric size hole or a or an american sized hole
and and what but the thing is then you've got to with screws
and that's the other issue uh
well and thread
uh i don't go to the movies a whole lot
but uh i went two or three weeks ago for the first time in a long time and saw dances with wolves which turned out to be an extremely good movie
i i i hear
we a whole bunch of us were going to go see it
it's playing at school actually in about two weeks i guess
so we're going to go see that
but you enjoyed that
it's it's something that uh
and i was telling him about a couple of weeks ago
and he said well i'll wait until it comes out on uh tape and rent rent the video
and i said no
it's uh the scenery and the landscape and the country that they're in needs a big screen
it's just uh just amazing amazing picture
i've heard it it it's not one for the videos
but you know every now and then you find one that you say yeah
well this is the one for me this time
um let's see
i was just sit- um
friend and i went to see out for justice which is steven segal because uh we're both big karate fans
so we wanted to see what this is like
and uh impressed with actually
i wasn't i mean i've seen his other movies
and i just think he's pretty good
but uh this movie
oh his his his karate is pretty good
i generally um
i'd be just fine without them because you know kids come running out wanting to beat each other up
well well they do
they get i remember when we used to go to see well i remember when grand prix came out when i was a kid and some other movies like that
and i suspect today what they see is bound to be what they want to do when they get out of it
well that that was number one for the week actually too
so so it was a little bit uh
but but in the middle of that conversation we sort or picked an um an interesting point
and and and that was that that helped us sort of feel good about you know about ourselves and about one around us in that at least at least if everyone's running around seeing karate movies and stuff like that at least they're still going to see the real good movies you know
and it turned out to be an excellent movie
it was it i was absolutely enthralled by it
oh patrick swayze
and i especially like him
oh you know what's pretty cute actually um
i've i've seen the ads for it
but i'm not real sure what it's about
and some friends called up and said do you want to go see this movie
and and they said it starred um meryl streep and mel brooks
and i thought what a strange combination
well actually it starred that that it's actually albert brooks
so it's lot better
so it it was a strange combination
but it turned out to be a very cute movie
i mean the whole premise is that they go out
and and they die and they have to
and they happen to meet in this this town um this this sort of city where you're set up
you know they
and they decide if you can move up to the next level
but it's something like that
and and they have to decide whether or not they're good enough
and as it turns out you know they meet there and fall in love and stuff like that
so you can guess the rest of the plot
it actually it's it's really funny because they run through you know what they have them do is sit down and see scenes of their lives
and that's pretty good actually
well i guess that's where the title comes from then
and you have a they have an attorney for you know attorney for you and attorney
and you know the prosecutor's job is to make sure you don't move up a level
and the defense's job is to make sure that you you do you know
it's uh it's a neat little story actually
i was i was i went thinking it'll be okay not great
and then i actually came away thinking it was really pretty good
we've got a couple of movies out recently ghosts and defending your life that have to do with uh after life i guess
and it kind of makes you wonder
i'm also besides working at t i i'm a graduate student at north texas and working on master's in communication
and i think about these things and people trying to define their own world view
and uh what exactly do we you know do we see about this world
or why are we so fascinated with the other world
um i'm i'm sure that it seems like
it certainly would would explain the preoccupation with
but i suspect it's always been a preoccupation with that sort of things
well it has
and there's no real way of finding out
well did you ever see um flatliners
i did uh did not
and she really liked it
that's that's that's probably one of those ones that you know
probably probably worth seeing on video
actually we really enjoyed it
but it was also right along the same lines
i mean they they would go ahead and kill themselves for three or four minutes to see what happens
they said she said that this was almost believable
you know you get the medical profession doing these kinds of things
and you never know
i i it's a little far fetched to
but but it was um it was it was odd enough you know
and they didn't just sort of make it silly
it was you know it was done fairly well i think
so actually i actually enjoyed that as well
so then they get crazy
and and it doesn't end like the story has been going
well i guess that covers our topic
well it was n- nice talking to you
um i think that there is something definitely wrong with our school system just because of the results that you see coming out of the school system
as far as uh people dropping out of school uh grades on test scores being low uh more and more people taking g e d trying to get out of high school instead of just going through high school
you know something must be wrong as far as uh mak- not just the teaching techniques but just motivation
within within the schools themselves
oh it's okay
uh she uh
well the the results
i i hear what you're you're saying about the results
i'm i'm in a kind of an interesting situation in that my my wife teaches school here in plano
and i know that uh the results that they get out of the system sometime is is certainly not
and i know uh
i work around you know a lot of teachers
and i u- i understand how uh supportive they are of their students and how excited they are
but some how i don't think the students are getting excited
i've often wondered if it doesn't come back to the the home environment
and uh it if uh no matter what they do in the the classroom if they go home at night and you know it's all totally undone uh
the the thing that uh uh that karen my wife has has run into so often is that you run into a group of kids that are going to succeed no matter what no matter how bad their teachers are
these people somehow manage to uh you know
it's uh unfortunately probably what maybe twenty-five or thirty percent of them do that
not not even that much probably
well ye- that would be be at the absolute most
and uh you know those those that you know come out you know fall out of the system that are are real trouble
i i wonder whether that's just a uh uh
if you know in a democracy where you know people have kind of uh a freedom to sort of do what they want
you know there there's an inefficiency there
and you've got to let those you know those
and speaking speaking of doing what you want uh just in society today being that it's nineteen ninety-one
um a lot of teenagers and young people have a lot more freedom as far as what they do
oh oh yeah
as far as you know even even something as simple as staying up late um watching television late um
you start dating too early you know
that can that plays a big part because you spend eight hours of your day or more in school
and so any other part of your life that's going to definitely affect your school life
and sometimes in some systems they make everything so competitive you know
you from the minute that you walk in until yo- until you leave your your competing against somebody else
or your competing against uh a system or or something
and then a lot of
and when they get into a real competitive system they just say oh well what the heck
and uh tend not to you know do too awful well
and he is now in in a program that's trying to get him out of high school because he he fell back several years ago
and he's going to he he will have gone to school five years
um and the reason that he was doing so badly a couple of years ago was because his mother died
and he was having to uh support his entire family take care of his brothers and sisters you know
and all that had an adverse affect on his school life
and that and that's a perfect example of how your home life you know plays a definite part
and you know
an but now now that he's in this program and you know he's i guess okay
he's he's making straight a
and you know it just it it was there it was just i guess school was not a number one priority for him at that time
survival becomes more of a priority than than education
and unfortunately you know there's uh there's and old joke about uh you know
you don't you don't really appreciate it until you're much older anyway
i know when i went to school uh my attitude was kind of one of you know these people are you know taking a tremendous amount of my time
and i've got better things to be doing than sitting here listening to this stuff over and over again
i guess today that would be uh some how or other there would be a program of some sort that would take care of that sort of thing
the uh the cure some of the cures that i've heard for this that that sort of make sense
uh most teachers after they have taught for a very long especially at the the lower grades can spot a problem almost immediately
and uh it's kind of these intervention programs
now a lot of people will get to looking at these and say hey that's socialism
and that's communism
and that's you know
and then it gets political
but uh boy
or i don't care
i mean that's the point i'm at now
i mean that's the point we all should be at is like finding some solution
i mean you know nothing totally radical
but if it's something that you know might help you know
because there's not a lot being done
well you know the the radical programs in some cases are just totally unacceptable
there are kids families that should just simply be taken out of the homes you know
and uh uh you know uh just removed from those situations
or they're never going to get anywhere
but yet politically that is not a very popular view
i'm sure that if you you know ran on a platform of you know we're going to find the kids that are having trouble at home and we're going to take them out of the home
uh but unfortunately it's it's something like that in lieu of that you know is the intervention programs in school where the these kids are are spotted fairly early on
and uh you know there's well that's get to be a problem in texas you know
i mean it's it's almost like
but you know you can counsel a kid eight hours a day
and then he goes home
and and uh you know in the in worst cases he's got parents either on drugs or or something like that
or they don't care
you know mamma wha- guess what i did in school today
well who cares you know
an a lot of it a lot of the parents now are so young
you know that they're they still they still don't know what's going on
and how are they supposed to you know teach their kids that are coming up you know what's going on
i mean it's just it's a vicious cycle
that we're you know dead smack dead in the center of
and we have to try to swim out
you know kind of like the bermuda triangle
and it's almost impossible to swim back up
but um yeah
its just the solutions that you know they're going to be in our political system
i don't know if you've ever had too much to do with uh oh especially asian japanese families coming
here in plano we've got uh quite a few
uh engineering types people who have come from japan
and they put their kids in the u s schools
and they're appalled
you know not so much at what the schools are teaching but what they let the kids get away with
you know they they see most uh
they're they're quite upset about the uh the disruptive influence of school
most of them would say you know those people should be removed from the school system
and in japan they would be you know
but uh here again you get back into a political thing where uh
i mean i've only been out of i've been out of college only two years
and you were saying that you don't appreciate education until you get out
and i i already you know i really didn't i really don't see myself going back to school or anything
but i appreciate more what i had
and i had all these classes and all this knowledge and this big library across the street from my dorm
and i just didn't take as much advantage of it as i should have
oh oh okay
so i mean all kinds of resources and you know just there
and i'd give anything to have that right now in my in my regular li-
i mean you you have everything given to you
but then if i was young i wouldn't see it
well that's that's it
you you don't have uh
but you know now that it's gone i
and you know i kind of look back at it sometimes
well that was a lot of fun
but we- you know i'm not sure that that i took the greatest advantage of you know what i went through there
and i experienced a lot
and i i feel like i got a good college education
but just when i got out i feel like i should have spent more time in the library
i should have taken those continuing educations classes or whatever they were you know
the informal classes that you don't get credit for you know
i guess our we're in the process of a home repair right at this point
because we're we're painting the outside of our house
certainly uh uh
and interesting enough this time we're changing the color which makes it an addition
and uh the colors that were there changed the and the colors that we painted changed the entire look of the house
that it's it's helping
but it's it really is looking good
uh we went through a process of of uh home repairs on a on a rental house we had
probably the most extensive and uh the interesting part of it was how much we learned about what we could do
um we didn't have very much money
and so we had to do it ourselves in kind of a slow process
but we learned how to do uh retile bathtubs and uh oh just all kinds of things that are unusual
so the other thing that we did was the roof of our house
and uh we did that a different color also
of course uh being a woman most of these things were done by the men
and uh so i wasn't directly involved
but uh they really were helpful i know to our house
um howard and i were talking about home repair the other night and uh in connection with scouting
and uh uh i think it's neat for young people to learn how to uh take care of their of a household you know like uh fixing faucets dripping faucets
as a matter of fact one thing i have a young son
and one thing we did was we had paneling on the inside of our uh front of our house or the hall way of our house rather
and we were repainting the the front room in the hall there
and we took down that paneling
and he helped me
and and uh he was it was fun to work with him
and uh and uh help putty up the holes together and and do things
oh i like it so much better
you know it really does
you know and people that have been to my house before and then now really have liked
nice to have it come out positive and look look good
well we have a lot that needs be done
we have uh uh carpeting
and and we did have a new uh floor put in our kitchen
and um i have my mother living with us
and so she was in a room with a carpet
and of course she's quite aged
so that meant she had problems now and then
and it was really good to get the carpet out of there and put a linoleum down
so it was easier to clean and see where the dirt was
so that was a really positive uh uh
i i was impressed
i think that uh
and it was it seems to me like it's probably more expensive to put down linoleum almost than it is to put down carpet
but uh in the case of the linoleum they have to rip up everything and and fix the floor
so it's uh
but they have to put stuff on the floor
and it's uh kind of a process
well it sounds like you have some pretty good experiences with uh with uh uh home repair
well my husband and i have gotten into some some problems with credit cards
we we tend to run them up to the maximum and then ask for more
they they're they're really bad for us
um matter of fact we've gotten rid of all of our credit cards except for a mastercard and a visa
and we pretty much keep those maxed out
oh i was going to say that that sounds like like pretty many
but i see what you meant
we had cre- i had probably twenty credit cards for
i had i had an american express american express gold an optima all the different department stores um two visas two mastercards
i mean i had
any time anybody would you know send me an application you know preapproved or whatever i went i took it
and it really ended up getting us in some real serious trouble
um because see the more credit cards you have the more people offer them to you
and the more you use them the more they send them to you
but each of these had an annual fee also right
the american express was probably the worst um because with the gold card
i can't remember how much it was because i didn't even have it very long before i gave it up but i know the green card was like thirty-five forty- five dollars a year
because i mean you had to pay it in full every month
exactly you know
i that's it
so i sent back all of mine except the ones that were free
and um then then i also limited it to one of each one mastercard and one visa
and here most of the stores will accept those
and actually i then got a discover card since they pay you back
and that was one of the ones in the group that i ended up um closing
um it really wasn't my choice though
i mean i ended up having i ended up actually losing my credit cards
um i ended up going through a credit counseling service um because my husband and i just don't handle credit very well and um when when you do that they automatically once you start with their service they close your accounts out
oh i see
so i'm still paying on all these accounts
but my accounts are closed
so and i would prefer to keep it that way
once we once we're paid off um i would prefer just to have one mastercard and one visa
and that's it
actually i pay off my cards every month
i think that's a really good way to handle it because that way if you if you paid off every month you never have to worry about well how much do i have to pay these guys you know this month you know
this you buy what you can afford
i mean if you handle it just like you would like a check or cash it's a lot easier to keep it in check
well and also in a sense they're giving you a loan for a month
so that you know if i were smarter i would have that same amount in savings and get the interest which i don't do
but but yeah
the the thought of adding you know x percent to to the price of what i buy
i just i can't accept
and i and i think at this at this point in time with the economy the way it is i think that um it's going to get even worse
um i'm i'm glad that we're starting to pay our debts off now um you know
we only we started this last year and we probably still have about another year to go before we're completely out of the hole
but i think this they way the whole economy is going right now it's just not good to be in debt
that i would that would be a very scary feeling for me to know that i was you know juggling payments to different people i guess because i never experienced it
and it's not because you know i'm rich or anything
well when you when you're getting rid of the whole credit card cycle and if you really get into the mind set i got really good at juggling money and basically robbing peter to pay paul
and it was scary because i was so good at it
and i thought this is not right
i mean this has got to stop because eventually it'd end up catching up at catching up with me
and it hit me in the face
but it sounds like you know you you learned from it
and you're coming out of it all right
i don't i don't think that
well when we buy on credit we just don't have a concept of how much money we're spending until the bill comes in
and then all of a sudden you look at the bill
and you go oh my gosh
but now the fact that you still have two cards
are you do you use them more judiciously
we pretty much use them for emergency type things like transmission fell out on our car and that paid for a new transmission um and and things like that
um and we try not to use them for incidental type things like you know gas and stuff like that
i've i've gotten i've gotten a lot more away from from credit cards
and i pay by check a lot more now
well it sounds good you know
like i said it sounds like you're you've really got it under control
i i admire you for having having that mind set for not not even getting you know past the thirty days
i would that's ideally the where where i would like to be
and like i said once once it it happened i couldn't because my son's tuition came due
and i guess i had you know not really counted on it quite at that point but um yeah
you know and and i mean it was i thought a lot
sixty dollars interest or something for for just a couple of months
and i'm going jeez that's outrageous
but in in you know retrospect it wasn't all that much
i mean a lot of people pay a lot more
and and you know but still i mean i figured i didn't need those items if it cost me sixty dollars more to have them
i i think about all all the money that that we've spent on interest on all of our credit cards
and it's just incredible
but now did you use to not feel so badly because you could take it off your income tax
i'm i'm fairly newly married
i've only been married less than two years and before that i never owned a home or anything
so i never had any deductions
so really it was always just money thrown away
and i never really thought about it because
i was so good at it that it just kind of got stuck in the back of my mind and just never um became a real problem until all of a sudden it came an insurmountable problem
i suspect that you know thinking about it and looking at my friends and the number of credit cards that they use and you know the amount that i know they buy i guess probably a lot of them are in a similar situation and you know just don't talk about it
most most people don't like to talk about money
and especially if you if you don't feel you're handling it quite right or that somebody might make fun of you or that it would be
but i think the the average american is probably pretty heavily in debt not not including like a mortgage
a mortgage is an understandable debt because that's you have you have to have a roof over your head
and i would much rather own my own home than than be renting it like we're doing
i mean we're basically you know kind of throwing seven hundred dollars a month away
but you know right now with the way our credit card situation is there's nobody in the world that's going to give us a mortgage on a house
but but once i suppose you you prove yourself by paying this off next year you'll be in very good shape
it's it's going to it's going to take quite a while
but um i'm not really counting on it real soon
uh the weather here is warm
and it has been sort of raining on and off
and uh i am an avid gardener
so i m- m- measure the rain in our rain gauge on a on a regular basis
so i can can avoid wasting money on watering
and uh but it has been threatening to rain for the last couple of days
and it has not
but it is very warm here which is typical for this part of the time of the year
i think you are i think you are earlier than we are as a rule aren't you
your your your s- growing summer starts a lot earlier than ours
it starts in uh march as a rule
people are have got their gardens in a lot of them now
uh probably not
but we have had we have had a frost as late as as in june
oh that is nice
we will be glad i will be glad to give you some of ours
usually we get it in in great quantities in april and may
and then it stops for three months
it has really been nice here uh
but i don't know if we'll get it or not
the the weather they forecast for our area seems to go right past us and misses us just by well not too many miles
well i know the wea- i know the weather is very important for people who make their living off of off of the land
we we live out in the country
but we are not a farming person
uh we have a garden
but uh but we are not farmers
well you know there are some disadvantages to being down south
and that is it gets so hot that you know a lot of things die during the summer from the heat
they they really do
and you have to be very careful to make sure you keep everything watered
well and that makes it bad too because uh when more with water being at a premium
they they have really been rationed on their water
and it makes it real hard to have a yard or
well my parents are now in san diego
and and they've got pebbles in their yard because
well they are not allowed to water
so what do you do
uh it is very it is very rough on them
because the the summers are extremely hot
but your humidity is different though than ours i think
and it makes a a bit of a difference too
um what is your humidity like
oh i don't know
uh i do not know what what it is percentage wise
but it always seems
it is it is drier in dallas than it is in houston or san antonio or even austin
but it is not dry
and and i have lived here for many years
and i think it has gotten more humid over the years
well it could be
i know my brother's home has been flooded a couple of times uh
oh does he live near the lake
well there is a lake not far
but it is more run off from surrounding you know areas and that
and uh he is just in an area where it is just low enough that it's you know it it collects there
and uh he has had a couple of inches in his house several times
that is that is a problem uh
they tell you when you are looking for a house or or or buying land to build on
to be very careful and check the drainage because uh
it is it is deceptive
and uh i know exactly what you mean
we are fortunate or uh we are on a where we are we get flooded it floods below us
but we are uh we are high enough that our house itself we never you know have had any problem like that
oh well that is fortunate
and uh we really like it here
well i i like it i like it here
uh i i grew up here
and and but i i did grow up here
and this is very much home for me
i i i liked it when we visited there
one of my one of my theories is that you always go to warm places during the winter
and you go to cold cool places that well i go to cool places during the summer if i can anyway
an- and usually it has been when we have gone it has been nice
but it is it is hot to me in the wintertime down there
but it is nice
it is a it is really a nice area
i i had a friend from england visit once at christmas
and we could not get her out of the what she called the
and she went back to the north of england with a sunburn
oh good heavens
it takes me about four and a half hours to do to mow our grass
and i try to cover up
well i that that is really healthier frankly
well i have had a little a couple of problems
and uh i decided it is not worth it
i i like to get tan in the summer time because i think you look healthier
and uh we are just crazy
but you you know it is interesting because you get out in that sun an awful lot
now my sister is a a sun fiend
and uh she is five years younger than me
and i think that is why
it it just makes your skin more leathery
i don't know the the the theory the scientific principle
but it burns something off the natural oils or something like that
well the elasticity of your skin the collagen or whatever they call it
and you lose a lot of that
uh that sounds like a good that sounds like the right theory
but uh but we have really had nice
and when it has rained it ha- it's been a good soaking rain
and uh it has just been a really nice spring
well that is great
it has been it has been very nice here too
and i hope it continues because my parents are coming to visit this evening
oh that is great
and i want them to have nice weather for their visit instead of driving around in the rain
uh probably four or five days
well that is great
well thank you
well i hope the weather stays real good for them and and uh that you have a good visit and everything
and i hope your garden does good
and so okay
well it was really nice talking to you
and uh good luck in your this venture
it is uh like i said
so i hope you enjoy it as much as i have been enjoying it
in in fact if i had not been preparing for this the out of town visitors i probably would have been making some phone calls in the last couple of days
and i forget to make a call
well i am glad you have broken the ice with me because now i will i will start doing it
well thanks jean
is uh that a sport you like to participate in
and i'm a second hand spectator as a result of my first husband's or my late husband's interest in golf
he's uh i guess he'd be a fanatic if he thought he could get away with it
but he he limits it pretty good
i um have tried to go out and play golf
but i stand there and swing and swing
and i can't even hit the ball
but i am very good at watching it on television
and he was really uh enthusiastic about keeping up with the tournaments
oh so he's really into it
and as and did some you know instructions at the country club for a while
but uh golf tended to be so-
i am not really deeply involved in any following any of the sports
but golf was one that i developed a working knowledge of a lot of the golfers
and therefore i enjoyed following those particular players
well part of it was the personality and their sportsmanship
you know the competitor
and i became involved in following his career
and uh i know that that my husband
and he thought he was spectacular
i'm not going to i'm not going to stay interested in him
so i decided andy bean was good competition
any time they both played why he was just real excited when tom was you know shown on the television
and i followed andy bean
oh he's interesting
but he's quite a character
and there are some really really wonderful people in the game of golf who do give wonderful role models
and i think it's critical it's critical to have a good role model in any field any sports
do you ever watch those where they just play for a certain amou- you know
well i myself really have not seen a whole lot of point to the game of golf
and then you hit it again and lose it again
and i know the whole point is to get it in that little bitty hole
but seems to me like if they made the hole bigger it'd be easier
oh i know
i sometimes wonder why men like it so much because they get so frustrated and mad at themselves when they don't do well
they play like maybe once a month or less and so they all hit like in the low nineties
and they think they're having a really good game
well my husband's average ran in the mid seventies so he wasn't bad
but as far as influencing young people i think that that is uh that is one of the sports that you can carry into old age
but it is a good healthy wholesome lifestyle uh
but i think that that is one of the sports that's a good healthy way to to move into maturity safely
and a lot of seniors a lot of elderly people don't even take up golf until they're you know in their later years
and they can still get good at it
and it's something that
well maybe that's what i'll do when i have time later on
but it's it's also something that husband and wife can participate in or you can both enjoy the same sport and participate in separate circles
you know you can go to the country club together
but you've both been out and exercised
and you have enjoyed the day
well i'll tell you what if if they're not real good golfers sometimes it is not fun to ride around and listen to their exclamations all day long
but my husband's pretty tolerant
so he's not too bad to watch
oh mine had a very short fuse
i mean just get so mad he'd just wham that club up against a tree and break that rascal
but he doesn't seem to show it on the golf course
he's because he'll talk about the other guys he plays with doing that and how immature he thought it was and stuff
so i guess he's real laid back about it
he he'll come home though and he'll shoot when he was shooting in the hundreds
and he'll tell me what a great day he had and about this great shot he made and everything
well i shot in the hundreds
but i made this one good one
did you have to listen to long stories about now on the seventeenth hole i hit it and went this way those are it's hard for me to
well one thing that is a is a drawback about it i think is the cost
requires special you know special equipment
and then they want to play another course that's not they're not a member of and other fees
and i can imagine what kind of costs are involved if you're going to try to go pro because you spend hours and hours and hours practicing
and they don't give those sessions away
and nor do they give uh instructions away
and he said well fine
he said we'll just take you over to the course he lives near brookhaven we'll just take you over to the course and get you some lessons and let you see if you like it
but those kinds of things happen though
you you get a little taste of it
and you say hey this is not bad
and you really begin to develop an interest in it
but i am not an athlete at all
you know i'm always the one that got hit by the bat in baseball
and hu- hu- hung my fingernails in the net in volleyball
so i am not an athlete
at least you're just com- you're competing against yourself i guess more than everybody else out there
i really i i haven't really acquired an interest in it
but i'm open to try anything
the one thing that is also detrimental as far i'm concerned my skin is very fair so i'm going to have to golf in the evening
or i'm going to have to golf at a time when the heat of the day does not cook me
and i don't think the
we keep our newspapers and stuff like that and we keep our newspapers and stuff like that
and we take them to be recycled
uh we we have a pretty nice recycling center uh in our city now
and we take the newspapers and plastic and glass up there
they're open like two days a week
and you can just take it up there and drop it off
and everybody up there looks pleased with themselves when they're taking their stuff in like they're doing something good to
because he said every time i turn around you're telling me some new rule about recycling
like yesterday i was tell him you have to you're supposed to squeeze the plastic jugs
but what are you supposed to do with them
where you're supposed to squish up the you know like collapse the plastic jugs
and i wish that our recycling center took paper bags
we like to put our just put our newspapers in a paper bag you know and then carry them up there that way
and we have to bring the paper bags back every time
do you uh take your papers somewhere
or does someone pick them up
we we usually collect a you know collect a quite a bit
and then we take them take them in
we um we don't take our cans up to that center though
we don't we don't um use aluminum cans
so we generally don't have those to do
it takes us about a year to save up enough to be worth you know worth bothering to go in and do
but do you um have any ideas on anything that would make
you know they they charge you you know
it's like a flat rate i think for picking up your garbage
and some communities are trying to do that now
and i think that maybe if they only charged for the garbage that you did not sort and have set up for recycling
they they charged you by by weight of how much trash you were actually sending to a land fill
that that might be a better way to do it
and then people would would know that it was going to cost them money to not sort their trash
you know because then it would then it would make monetary sense to them you know to say hey you know if i just spend the time to to sort this out where this stuff can be recycled then i don't have to pay for them hauling it off
my father was telling me about some program he read about where you buy your bags like you buy your garbage bag from the city
and you pay more than just what you would pay for an empty garbage bag
but then you don't pay any monthly fee or anything
so how ever many bags of garbage you throw away that's how many you have to pay for
they are talking about going to curbside pickup in our in our city
and i don't know if they decided to do or not
but i think they said it was going to add like either a dollar or three dollars a month to your bill to have them do that
although i think a lot of those programs can operate at about a break even break even point
i don't know uh
the center that they've got now where you take your stuff in i i think that should be making some money
and they sell i guess they sell everything to some waste company that comes and gets it
but i wish that uh more of the cans you know like the cans you buy vegetables and fruit and stuff like that in were recyclable
and i don't know anybody that takes that
th- my husband likes pepsi
and those cans are steel instead of aluminum
so we can't can't ever recycle them
um now i didn't know that
cause we just usually if we're going to uh buy sodas they're in the the two liter bottles
but well that's all i can really think about for recycling
oh well people that call on the phone all the time to try to sell you something you know that that try to sell you the s- newspaper and uh wha- carpet cleaning and uh what else roof repair
well i think it's a waste of paper the people that always leave uh junk mail and because um you just end up throwing it away most of the time
probably eighty percent of the the junk mail that you get is is um something that you don't need
oh m c i m c i really does
oh now see i i really don't have much trouble with i just say no thank you and hang up
well they wo- they won't take a no for an answer here for some reason
but i uh i do telemarketing
so uh i'm very polite
and i just say no thank you and say no thank you very politely
and i hang up and
so i think the only thing that really bothers me is if
and they try to get information out of me
like the census bureau united states census bureau
and i don't understand what their need to know is
and i think that is my biggest objection to anything as far as invading my privacy if somebody wants personal information out of me
but telephone calls i figure they don't bother me one way or the other
uh i know when i do telemarketing um i'm a soft person
if if someone says i am not interested i'll just say fine and back out
and i make very good sales
but i'm not uh as i said i'm not half as pushy as these people because i don't really care
i mean if if they're not interested fine
and i'm not pushing something down their throat that uh i don't think is a good item anyway
but i feel like oh movie stars or
sure it's part of their i guess they're portray being a movie star
but uh i think they go too far
oh yeah because they follow them around twenty-four hours a day
and you know they do ted kennedy
so it's a different story then
you know but but ed mcmahon i mean you know who cares about ed mcmahon
and he has a chauffeur
but he never drives a car either you know
i think my seriously my classification of of invasion of privacy is trying to get personal information
without your and without your permission
this to me is is my invasion of privacy
but you can always write to uh oh i forgot the name of it and stop the junk mail
so i c- wrote to them when it came on the air
so i don't get any of that bull
tha- it works by the way
but uh the telephone doesn't bother me because i leave it half the time on uh you know answering service anyway
so i figure i can turn it off one way or the other
but i think that's the only bottom line thing that i dislike
because it does
other than the u s census um
oh the the carpet place that called me three times
but if people don't use the telephone
it's like i don't know when the police has their project going
and i don't know when the other ones have their project going and when they want to pick up down my street for things
and uh that's i-
well you have to have the telephone
but you can't you know
and and it's sometimes it's hard to screen out all the calls that you don't want
well see there's no way of knowing
that's you know that's the problem
like the product i sell uh i sell mostly to older people which can't get it in a normal public situation
and uh most of them like it because the company i work for is nationwide and uh reputable
and they know that hey we're backing it one hundred percent
but if we were denied the right to call people up these people would never be able to get it
and they'd never have it then at that point
because we offer it in a very low you know quantity
so i mean i i don't know what to do as far as that's concerned
but it is nerve racking
but at least as i said you can always say no thank you
like i own my own home
and you just know about what time
like some days i hate staying home because the phone rings all the time
but uh i don't know
when they call up and want to say well tell me this this this this and i'll give you a free something or other
and they say well don't you want to know what's free
and i s- no
and i don't like that
even if i guess it's for coupons they they have a survey they run
and it i guess it one of them is supposed to be a smokers survey
but the questions go a lot farther than having to do anything with smoking
and they ask tha- you know they start out
and they ask you even even to your income level
i think that's you know
well i just found out that my car
and it doesn't
and i bought it uh in uh eighty-eight
well i really i- the last car we got was a was a used car
but uh mine was a year old
and we bought it for very functional purposes
and that was we bought a station wagon
but we wanted one that could carry a lot of equipment
so we chose a nissan stanza wagon
and i've never been sorry
oh that's wonderful
and uh while it is still good
if i- you know we all say if i could have the car i always wanted i would either buy a nissan maxima uh
i a or or foreign cars actually
but do you feel though uh craftsmanship is much superior to the american abilities
and uh i you know i've read all the consumer reports and things
and they just run head and shoulders above the american made cars
but i had uh had a ford escort that absolutely needed taps the day we got it
uh you know i mean it was ready for the graveyard
and i spent as much on that car in twelve months as i spent for the car
and that was just trying to hold us
and it was an older car
but you know escort is supposed to have a great track record as far as sales
but it's just it just was not deliv-
and you get stung a time or two
and you say no thanks
so i just trusted the consumer reports and the auto
uh reports inst-
and he gave me four choices of cars to buy
uh the nissan came
and and we bought the nissan for functional purposes not what the consumer reports said we should get
but it served our needs
uh later on his reports the reports that he studied showed that uh nissan was head and shoulders above the rest in the area- in the class that we were looking for
and that and i'd rather have a maxima than a cadillac
but it's comfort
uh there's a lot of features on there that are desirable if you're going to pay that kind of money for a car
i mean but where are they where are they
what what is their location
is it uh asian
oh it is japanese
and uh if i couldn't have my luxury maxima then i'd buy me a fancy little red c r x sports car
i mean you know every othe- every one of us have two sides
if if if i had the car i wanted
probably um uh let's see i like the looks of the lincoln town car
but i i don't know the performance of it
and you know
i would get hung up by my boot straps if i ra- if i ever mentioned the ford product in my family
and uh i i really have not seen
now a lot of the american cars actually are are parts are produced in foreign countries and assembled here or vice versa
well that was one minute
uh at any rate do you have color preferences
or what would be the features that you would be looking for
um well the comfort of a large car that the security of a large car
um and the luxuries of a large car
uh now color preferences
actually i think probably if i were going to get a- if i were going to be practical which doesn't mean i would be
because simply because it's more visible at night
and it's cooler i believe
now the interior
and i'd have to live with that
and if i got the c r x it would have to have a real good sound system in it because i'd want that too
um can you uh hang on again hon-
um so you like to listen to uh a lot of music
or do is it talk shows
i generally would p- uh prefer to listen to uh well i listen to k c b i a lot
but i will listen to the news and the and the traffic and those things at work
but if i'm going to be traveling in that car for any period of time
and you just can't enjoy it unless you've got a good sound system to produce all the all the characteristics of the instruments
so i do love classical music
or it li- or or uh
do you listen t- do you lik- listen to w r r
and i do like them
and i'd like to have a compact disc player in the car
i i do a fair amount of cooking
and and i love having guests to dinner
and uh i usually prepare something depending upon the guests you know
it it i like to prepare chicken that seems to please everybody pasta or a casserole
unless it is unless it is i catch a fish and i prepare it
and then i just uh you know i just broil it and put lemon on it
well that's about the way i prepare most fish
uh i made scallops the other night
and uh basically uh i found a recipe to make it in the microwave
and you sprinkled uh you swished around a little melted butter and do uh oh i do not know micro- microwaved them for about nine minutes
and you had to add sesame seeds and bread crumbs on top
so if you are looking for a french recipe that was good
and uh my husband liked it
and uh no
unfortunately scallops are one of the more expensive uh fish items
but you know i i look for them to go on sale at the grocery store
uh one of the things i love to do eat out
oh there's a restaurant called string bean on spring valley and central
it's just it's just home cooking
and uh it's kind of kind of like black eye pea
but i do not think it's a chain
and that's that's the other restaurant black eye pea
so i do not really like uh
or i do not like greasy places
i i do not feel like they are very healthy
and i always
feel like the home cooking places are are the healthiest meals
you know i tend to have chicken fried steak when i go
and i and i got uh chicken marinara the last two times
oh how was it
it was uh it was great
because that's that's what i like
i do not like it you know i just like a baked you know a piece of chicken
and then i get like green beans and mashed potatoes
i i tend to uh i get teased by my family a lot because uh i like experimenting on on food
and sometimes i go for ex- fairly exotic things
and my father teases me about gourmet cooking
uh the last time we had some uh friends over for dinner i tried a dessert that sounded wonder- wonderful in the recipe
and it was just a total bust
my uh my brother tried to make uh a bunch of things uh way back
oh my that's ambitious
and then we had uh german shepherds at the time
and we took some and gave it to the dogs
and the dog never you know he treated it like a milk bone
and he never did finish it
uh and uh then he tried to made grapefruit citron one time
it's uh supposed to be candy
and uh it it did not turn out very well
it was you know
it like made concentrated all the acid of the grapefruit into uh into a kind of a candy stick
huh see i am not
and uh my husband accuses me of putting him through dessert depravation because uh you know we have ice cream
and that's why when i took did this experiment for the company we had about three weeks ago
uh everything else was fine
but that was a fiasco
well you have to put eggs and everything don't you
and i i also don't have much of a sweet tooth
so i can live without live without dessert for the most part
or make everything diet
uh do you cook for yourself
or do you cook for others
well when i was single i used to uh i think my favorite meal was a a baked potato
and i mean i never put anything other than a little butter on it
if i had or if i had a little cheddar cheese sometimes i would grate that up
and uh it's amazingly satisfying
but you know there's hardly any i guess there's hardly any protein
so it fills you up
and then the cheese has to make up for whatever the protein you get
i did- i did not say it was nourishing
but it was satisfying
tha- but you know i never really enjoyed cooking for myself
so i ate very simply
and i was that's why i think that's one reason i like having people over because i could try things
i mean i must be a frustrated chemist or something like that
cause cooking is a little bit like like being in a chemistry lab
or blow up
i i once had a an old boy friend over to to dinner when i was recently staying with my parents
and uh i had this wonderful recipe
and you were supposed to make a a toffee like substance for a pie by uh boiling evaporated milk three hours
and it does turn to toffee inside the can
and uh the only problem was when i opened the can it just flew all over the place
and and the boy friend thought
it was he was supposed to be there at six o'clock not seven o'clock
so just at the time all this happened the door bell rang
and there he was
and i had to have my my my my dad sort of entertain him for a for
uh i really do not remember
and i have made i have made it since i've i and several times before
and i never had that problem
and uh he he was a gourmet cook
and he had a very sophisticated taste
i i really wanted to impress the heck out of him
uh as far as
i i do enjoy cooking
so i was awfully glad i was given this
oh i didn't i didn't quite hear all of it
oh i see
um i think uh that's pleasurable for all of us
so what are your thoughts on dining out
well i i really choose restaurants more for the quality of food than anything else
well a little bit for the price
but uh i think that as far as quality of food goes the m- some of the most expensive places i've been had the w- the really the the worst quality of food
um a lot of places that even don't look don't look like much
some of the some of the best food i have ever had was out of a outside or inside of a place that we drove up
and i was like i'm not eating in there
and uh we went in
and it was the m- it was the most wonderful food
um a lot of uh one place that we went just recently uh was to atchafalaya
and it it was just fabulous
i mean my husband was aghast because i ate turnip greens and liked it
and where was that at near your
it's uh it's a hari krishna run restaurant
uh i think so
uh it starts with a k
that should get you close enough to to be able to find it
i think it's uh probably listed in the restaurants you know
but it's uh it's just fabulous food
well we like arby's
they use the they use the insides of the animals heart and liver
and they they form it
and they make it look like roast beef
and i said no
well that's not what i heard
from one of somebody that was supposed to know what they were talking about
oh my goodness
well that's happened before
but we like good s- uh w- we're we like mexican food
and so um
how about the health food uh restaurants well like this one
but it's probably not advertised as such is it
health food uh restaurants that
well well like um
but they ought there are restaurants that cater to the people that are very health conscious you know as far as their cholesterol levels and their their fat content and you know the amount of calcium and so forth that are in each product
and they list them
and it's called rodolfo's
and they r- have very good food over there
uh i don't know how expensive they are
well it was pretty reasonable
i it was around ten dollars for lunch okay
wha- which is kind of high for lunch i guess
um you were served by maitre d's and and uh um men waiters
i i won't really be interested in going to in going there
i feel like i'm i'm paying you know five dollars for the food probably and five dollars for something that i could get along quite well without
well i guess if you were having if you were trying to impress somebody w- like taking somebody that you hadn't seen for a long time and wanted to show them a good restaurant
maybe maybe that
and now the red lobster i found is very nice at lunchtime
i like the the seafood that they when they had it you know the broiled
well they have lunch specials that
you can't you can't beat that price uh if you went to a cafeteria
but i know a lot of their a lot of their specials sometimes are fried things
well i had the i had a broiled chicken breast
and it was excellent
and it was exce-
now why would you go to a seafood restaurant
oh it was
he doesn't understand why somebody would go to a seafood place and eat either chicken or steak you know
well i've never had catfish either in a restaurant because i'm from the north
and that was a no no
and i haven't gotten over that from the north
oh catfish is wonderful
and so i kind of stay a-
because of all the pollution in the lakes and the everywhere i mean there isn't any safe haven anymore for fish
i- and especially uh in wisconsin and michigan they say no buying of our fish
so yo- i am
and the the best brand of chicken to buy is the uh pilgrim pride because they don't use all these hormones to remote uh unnatural growth in their products
so i mean we have to be on the lookout if we want to stay healthy
so i'm i you know i
oh on one hand i see that
and on the other hand uh my older sister remembers when uh at one point they were taking radioactive wastes and storing them in tin barrels which i- i guess
had a half-life of oh five years if they sit empty on dry land
so they're putting radioactive waste in it which reduces it dramatically
and then they take these things that will rust
and they throw them in the ocean which is going to speedup the process even more
well i'd like to get ahold of some engineers and knock their heads together if it would do any good
and then they wouldn't think
so they shot holes in them to sink them
and this is before i was born
so i mean we're taking thirty years ago
and and who's you know the tuna is radioactive to a certain extent
so i think
everything everything we eat should have a label on it
you know so there's you know there's some things i think we can av- we you know we can't avoid for health purposes and some things that we just need to like you know
well you know
so i'm either going to be i'm either going to starve to death
or i'm going to get over it and just go ahead and eat as healthily as i possibly can you know
and i wish i didn't
before i got married uh about the only credit cards i used were gas cards because i didn't like carrying you know the cash with me all the time
but i just never wanted to get into the hang-up of using credit cards and having all those bills hanging over my head
and the only reason i got it was you know there was a while years ago when you couldn't cash a check without like a mastercard or visa
and so that's why i went ahead and got one
well actually i i have a whole wallet full of credit cards
um oh i may use i try to use at least one gasoline credit card a week and try to use a different one so that
and i i'll use those if i need to run in and buy a dozen pair hose right quick or something like that
and for the most part i had used those for like uh charging airline tickets
or i fly southwest a good little bit which means i can just run that card through the machine
uh and it saves a lot time
and that's what i was using it for
however we had a had a a very pressing financial family crisis which said you have no alternative
and you do not have any other options so i charged all three of those cards up
and right now i am paying and praying
but it's one of those i'm glad it was there
well i never did right
most of my charges were uh medications
oh i see
or it was uh the doctor would accept mastercard or visa
a lot of times you can get by using those for uh uh
i've found some doctors that say you know
and so many of them don't anymore
well i have not
i say well i need a checkup in six months
and i kind of set that aside and just pay for it
and i can handle you know paying for it and waiting two or three weeks
oh it is
and it's very difficult to get out
i i ought to go to the credit union and borrow the money and pay this off
but you know the interest even though it bothered me it didn't used to bother me so much because of course you could list it on a schedule a
and you got all your interest you know towards your tax deductions
and now they've messed that up to where it really is a financial burden to have to pay it
and but it but it is easy to get into a credit card problem
and i i think about young people that think you know
i have my first credit card and and they just don't understand that you still have to be able to make the payments
and it's not just paying back what you've charged
uh you send in uh uh fifty dollars
so i'm looking at three or four years before my balances are cleared on those charge accounts
now as the monthly payment uh i mean as the monthly payment amount goes down that will free up more cash where i can continue to make the larger payments
uh as long as i don't have a major disaster where i have to use it again i can i can do that
and that's frightening to me
uh i i just i my husband is in business for himself i work for t i
but he doesn't and uh
i've learned when you're in business for yourself that that you don't count on something until it's happened you know
but he's got some you know it's those once in a lifetime cases
and after ten years he's got two of them and they should pay through next month
and and we're both just looking at each other every night going man that will pay off like both of our mastercards you know
and you know just in one lump
because that's the only way you can do it is to have a big chunk of money or it's like you say
and so i'm really looking forward to that
well you either need a big chunk of money
or you need a large reserve so that if you do charge on that account you can make a single lump sum payment
now those are very handy if you have the reserves and you can make lump sum payments sharp good no problem because you're living on the other guy's money for a while
but i can promise you that those credit card companies are going to ride high on my money
and it just irks me
and i've got three cards
and that just blows my mind
i my house is paid for
but even the payment on that doesn't equal the payment on one of those credit cards
well my car is paid for now
but but you see again the credit cards came in handy
uh i went to a seminar
i said for crying out loud if i had the money to in- you know
well the smart half was don't pay it for consumables
don't you know if you can't afford to go to a restaurant and eat out and pay cash don't put it on a credit card you know
and and so that that is the smart half
but uh and i can remember before we had kids we did that a lot
but it was no biggie you know because we could pay it off
so we cut that out real quick
and uh but i i do like having them there
there is a bit of security in having the credit cards and knowing that in times of crisis they are there to use but you have to have a very good sense of saving and or common sense not not to get yourself in trouble
well well pat did you vote in the last election
oh you did
oh that's great
well why do you think
for example you know he'd say well look you and i see different sides of the fence
he said so i just won't vote
i think i think that's a lot of people
in the past um three years i've had three different addresses
so i just haven't
because i mean graduate school or whatever
so i haven't kept track of it
i did when i lived steadily in one community i always i voted
but this past time i didn't
well actually i voted it for the presidential election
but then i didn't vote uh i guess in the two year for uh some legislators and things
well characteristically in some in the local elections typically those people who vote are those who feel very strongly about an issue
and that's probably one reason why i voted in the the last election but not really this one because this one really didn't matter that much
well of course of course listening to government the instructors you'll find out that everything matters
but then you could go crazy worrying about everything
well you know they also say that most people vote their local politics that that local is far much more important than uh national issues
well that's the way you get to national and that's the way you make changes about your neighborhood
oh i definitely think so
uh i know that i have been involved in preparing and in in uh carrying out a lot of the local petitions that take place
but it makes a big difference when it's the difference in having a child run over in the dark
and uh it took a close call to wake us up and cause us to take that kind of action
and that's completely unnecessary
but if you just cross that major street the character of the neighborhood changes
and it's less savory
and that i was just very i felt very strongly about that
and they were at risk
and it was for elderly people who lived alone
and they were going to put a cluster of of houses there for them
but even clustering together for the elderly does not ensure safety
and all it all it did was to in my judgment make them
and so we we did get a petition together
and we very strongly resisted it
and it was placed in a actually it was placed clear closer to my neighborhood but it was on the
and uh it it i think that they're they're much more comfortable there
uh i haven't seen too much crime in my neighborhood
although we have a good crime watch program but it's it's very serious just across the street
did um did you think
i know that texas's last gubernatorial uh election probably brought out a lot of voters
did that did that seem to
because that re- that got national attention national attention i guess having a woman governor running against a man and whatever
and that's it it was a dirty election
people were calling each other uh names and every bit of the trash
it was a it was a dirty campaign
well you know what's funny up here uh i live i see a lot of virginia news and i guess uh senator robb and governor wilder are active right here
and they have some type of wire tapping problem going on
and the people in virginia are complaining
see robb is married to lynda bird johnson and the people in virginia are complaining that he is he's using texas politics in virginia and they're really complaining big time
because they said that we don't have that type of trashy politics up here like they do in texas all the time
of course now that's not all the time
so you you guys were getting yeah
we've had some pretty we were having some pretty healthy uh campaigns that were based on issues there for two or three of the gubernatorial races but i historically texas
and they vote on those people who are least likely to do damage
i know that um i'm previously from pennsylvania and dick thornburg who's now the attorney general is going to run for senator because uh john heinz a senator from pennsylvania died in an airplane crash and i know that they're expecting a gigantic turn out to landslide dick thornburg into as into the senate because they don't like the governo- the governor's political appointee or whatever and they're almost expecting landslide out uh turn out right now for
so you so you see
and we're going to support him
that was true in a lot of cases in in a couple of the older sixties campaigns
that's that's true
uh even when john kennedy was elected there were so many strikes against him
but there were people who believed he could make a difference
now that's not to say what has transpired or what really was
because the those were big political that was a big um turn out election
and and it was people going to vote for i think more than those who voted against
i know i know that in my own uh area of people whom i knew and how they were going to vote they didn't go to vote against uh a politician as they did a little bit later when nixon was running
they went to vote against the less of lesser of the two evils in certain cases
and they voted their convictions
well i think that also happened with ronald reagan
he was he was landslided in
and people really saw that was
uh so uh what do you consider the most important benefit besides salary
boy i i don't know
that's a that's a a tough one
uh uh and it's uh i suppose it's it's changes as uh as percep- my perception changes of of what uh i'm getting gypped on
and uh and i guess right now the one in my mind is health insurance
if i step back i'm not sure i'd i'd uh say that
what what about you
well uh i right now i'm in sort of a weird situation
i'm a graduate student that uh i don't have that many benefits per se
uh sort of get
but but on the other hand one of these days you'll be out looking for a
and i can see from her angle
uh uh i think health insurance is real real important
i've i've i've i've discovered
i mean even in my case it's sort of they're really uh a pain in the neck about it up here
because the university makes me buy a small
they they have a mandatory they have what they call the mandatory portion of their health insurance they offer insurance to everyone
but then the basics that are major medical they they force you to buy here
now i'm covered by my wife's anyway
but i still pay them a hundred dollars a semester for uh mandatory
so that's sort of annoying that i'm paying for something i'm not getting in that case
i'd rather that that went to something else
and and yeah
and the benefits you're getting for that hundred dollars a semester uh you you never use because you just use your wife's
i mean uh
and and and it turns out that actually uh the benefits they you know that that hundred dollars sort of would would entitle me to go to the university health services here you know and and use them
and it turns out that i do think they're v- they're excellent physicians there
so through my wife's h m o we've registered for them as our primary care physicians
so we go there anyway
so they're they're so if they were to bill which which i believe they don't
but if they were to bill the h m o for my business they could in in theory be getting paid twice for the same thing
but they're not thank god
uh but anyway uh otherwise i would imagine uh good vacation is is important although i don't know if that's really a deciding factor for many people on a job
i don't you know
i it uh the the that that's a a negative about uh where where i am in that uh well i came out of uh i worked five years civil service
and there it's uh
but anyway it works out as i remember basically to uh
you start at at uh two and a half weeks or something like that
and it at three years uh it goes to four weeks i believe
and i i'm coming up on i've been at t i now uh uh coming up on fifteen years
and it and it just uh this year is going to go to four weeks here
so that's really
that's a that that is a a a negative but uh but not probably not at probably not a deciding factor
i mean i don't you know i don't i know my wife uh
i think she gets you know about two weeks a year i guess but they're pretty good about it if she wants other time off
they you know usually let her
well that that
that's that's the thing is how how flexible they are for comp time kinds of kinds of things
and uh uh that's the the the uh
that's a why it hasn't made all that much difference is because the with the civil service that you could take you could take your vacation in increments of one hour and uh and but uh there wasn't uh anything as far as comp time
so you tend to dribble away a week of it a year uh you know an hour here a couple hours there kind of a thing
uh whereas uh here i uh things are free enough to that uh the the actual vacation time per year probably isn't that isn't that much different
that's well that's a that's reasonable i think
i think the i think the health insurance
i think that's that's going through changes everywhere to uh
the they've uh uh gone through a couple years ago here where they uh will cover you much better if you go to their designated hospitals
and now they're in the process of developing a list of of uh designated doctors uh
so that just routine visits uh they will compensate much better for if you go to their designated doctors
which which uh
my assumption is that that will not include my doctor since uh he keeps real busy without having to to uh
i think i was watching something the other day about that actually on uh a news special or something like that
and they were saying how in some sense that that's good because that makes health care affordable for everyone and makes you know lowers the cost of everything and all insurance
and in other cases it's actually bad because it winds up people you know don't get to they have much less of a choice in who they can use and stuff like that
well and and i think in the in the in the much bigger picture than uh to some extent hospitals and doctors have some uh fixed amount
and if if you don't work for somebody that's got enough clout to to uh uh give you you know give you these rates and make this agreement then uh you're not covered by that
and and the added costs get passed on to you
so uh i'm not i'm not sure
it my uh one of the phrases i use is that that it's moving towards uh private socialized medicine that uh in terms of the negatives of of always heard in terms of socialized medicine you have no choice on who you who you go to for a doctor and things like that uh where it's the government that decides
here it's it's uh
uh and but it but it's the the same the effect is the same as the
you you uh get left out of the loop more
i i i know that their uh idea is that uh if if you have to pay a bigger share you'll you'll be more careful about spending the spending the money and and helping hold down the costs but uh i i i don't know
in terms of in terms of uh the health care i uh find that that uh although i've i've been lucky enough to never have any big problems but that that uh the cost is not a a big factor
i want to i want to know if the doctor's doing the right thing to make me get better
you want to know that that that when you pick a doctor you know you you could pick one who you could have some sort of a feeling about
that that's the
well how do you feel about spot test- spot testing for drugs
i uh i think if somebody's not on drugs they have no reason you know to be afraid of it
uh i do think that there has to be some controls uh
like i don't think one test positive should uh be uh
i i think they should test more than once
it's it's it's refreshing to hear somebody
i mean all these people that are against it that may the- you know they may not even be on drugs
they they call it an invasion of privacy
and i don't see that
to me that just doesn't sound like a valid argument because this company is paying you good money that you're working for and they i believe that
they have the right to know if you're using a a dangerous substance
there's so many jobs that uh
and you know and it's uh uh how can you do anything about a problem besides if you don't know about it
you know and i just um i i think there definitely needs to be some control to it
i i i agree that you know you there needs to be a a well thought out sane approach to
just because you you something can get mixed in the mail
or uh the chemicals could react incorrectly than than what you would expect them to
you you know
or somebody's test gets mixed up with somebody else's
i mean those things do happen
uh i certainly wouldn't want people's lives ruined uh
and you know i've the the the company that i work for uh has just recently well you know within the last couple of years instituted for all new hired employees
and they they say that there's been you know they they they've also implemented random testing
and it hasn't happened to me in the couple of years that you know it's been in progress but uh i i fully agree with it
and there's you know there's all these memos going around about folks that are disgruntled and feel it's an invasion of privacy
and i i agree with you
if if if you feel it's an invasion of privacy you've you've probably got something you're trying to hide
and you maybe need to look for some other type of job to do that uh doesn't require the testing
uh to me it's to me it's not an invasion or privacy
i think it's people have a right to know if if uh their their life maybe's in jeopardy or uh
their work the work they're doing for their company
uh those things are all affected
it doesn't seem to uh bother the quality of work but eventually it does
i i don't think that's an invasion of privacy
and it's destroying a lot of people's lives
and then and one of the few that they don't have a cure for
and it's you know it's it's destroying people's lives
and i i think that person plus anybody in danger should should b- know about it and be aware of it
it's it's kind of hard to
i guess the gay movement has had a lot to do with considering that that uh an invasion of privacy
uh do you work for uh texas instruments
and i'm i'm down in the the central
but i don't know how familiar you are with texas
but i'm in a we live in a town uh near a town called temple
oh that's probably why
it's actually we got about two inches of rain in about three hours yesterday
oh did you really
oh that's great
and it's cooled things down somewhat
we we need rain real bad up here
it's uh everything's really getting dry
and uh it's getting real bad
well i hope you do get some rain up there
uh i can't think of anything else uh
i i guess being in agreement kind of tends to limit the conversation you know
uh i can understand
it it's funny that you mentioned that
t i is pretty much a worldwide company and we have manufacturing plants all around the world including some places where the use of certain drugs that are illegal here are not illegal
oh i'll be darn
i mean uh uh from a quality standpoint that's not i mean just because it's not illegal doesn't mean it doesn't affect you the same way
i i can't think that would make any
but like if you're going to do business in another country you've got to respect their rules
i mean if if you know that that's the trade off
you can't you go by their laws
and uh some of the countries are very much against drugs
and you use them you
where where is it they lose the if they steal they lose a thumb or a finger
you know that's quite a deterrent
well in saudi arabia you know using uh alcohol and drugs and something like that you get the death penalty
so it's pretty strict over there
so i guess you know we re- we have so many freedoms over here we sometimes forget about
well people tend to take the first amendment out of context
which which means you know i could do anything i want to
and you can't stop me
and you know
they they abuse it is what they do
i'm i'm glad to see more and more companies implementing the policy
uh what what contacts do you have with the public school sy-
well i have a boy
and he just went into middle school
and i have a girl
and she's in uh grade school
and then i have a little boy who goes to uh
and it's called early childhood
and i have a young a young boy in that
so i i have a lot of children in in the school system down here
and um i think we have excellent teachers here
i am really uh
like the stu- like the way the teachers work with the students
uh i've not been so um happy with the schools
like my last year my son and daughter were in the same grade school before he moved up to middle school
and it was just packed
i mean it was a a fire hazard if we had any kind of assembly there with parents
and it was just a real problem
uh so we had to do a bond issue and and um vote to take money and either have students bussed to different schools if that's what the prefer to do or to uh work on the work for another school to be built which is a good idea
but in the meantime the school still has lots and lots of kids in it
so um i think one thing is that would
and secondly when we have enough schools sometimes we can't get the the support for the teachers that we need to pay them to keep good teachers
well i think that's i think that's uh true
i i've got a little different uh contact
but i've i've got a one son that graduated from high school last year and another son that's a a sophomore this year and uh my wife teaches kindergarten here in richardson
uh but in general i i think the the you know one of the reasons that we we uh the chose to live in richardson when we when we came here was the was the schools
and i think that plano and richardson in terms of the uh things seriously wrong with the public schools are not nearly to the extent th- that
we see through the out the country
and i think i think part of that is that is the the uh a big part of that is just the demographics
the population in those schools are are typically uh people that very much value the education and support the the school systems and and uh although there's still some still some problems
but uh i you know i when i was when i was going to school
and and in my family school was certainly valued
but if there was ever any sort of a uh if ev- if i was ever in trouble in school i was also in trouble at home even more so
and i think that part of it is is not exactly with the schools but with the with the uh the culture that doesn't doesn't value the education and doesn't value the schools and doesn't support uh what the schools are are trying to do
it is so hard with a family system um either divorced or or just one parent or just li-
and then if both of them have to work even that is a a hard situation for the children uh to to have a supportive system around them to make school work for them and i think it's real important that the parents work with the school um i think what you said is is really a pinpoint though that the student and the family life really adds or detracts what's happening in the school so um what about your wife
is she she happy at school
she has she has two half day classes
so she has uh you know on the order of twice as many students as as the teachers in the higher grades and uh uh but her her background is in is in uh child development and and uh so forth
and so kindergarten is as high as she as she wants to teach
and she's she's teaching rather than something else because that that that's the jobs that are available and that the schedule matches uh you know with our kids and things like that
uh and but uh the
so the ques- the question had something to do with usage of personal computers um
we are we are talking about computers this morning
um i'm a firm believer in in having lots of them
boy well you've uh you've got me beat
i have a a zenith here and at home i have a commodore and a zenith
and my wife has an a t and t twelve hundred i believe it is
well actually on my commodore i mainly study lottery numbers would you believe
i have written some uh programs in basic whereby i can select any number of uh drawings and from that extract the numbers that have appeared the most i have another program in which i can look at the cyclical uh appearance of these numbers to see if there's anything that's consistent on that
i have another number that allows me another program that allows me to add all the numbers i want
and then it generates a complete set of numbers so that all combinations are covered so this is what i do most of the time uh
that's what you do on your at least one of your machines on your commodore
and of course i have uh word processors
and i write all my letters it's wonderful uh
my uh thoughts in my head come in bursts of about a paragraph at a time
and i get them all down
and naturally on a computer if you make a mistake who cares
you can go back and uh correct
so how about you charles
well i um i do an awful lot of preparation of documents um uh
and i use word processors and and fancier programs i mean you know graphics programs and simply make all of our slides
some i do on an x t now maybe we don't call these personal computers um
i started out with you know an i b m p c back in the you know about a year after they came out and you know
so whe- where may i ask where you work sir
or what what what section of it
of in in in an obscure part of the defense department
because see that's my type of work too
i work at the applied research lab here here on campus
and my my field is underwater acoustics and there's a lot of things we can do with computers into uh studying how uh things vary in the water you know and uh taking advantage of them and so forth
so it's a very nice very nice field
and i i am retiring at the end of this month end of december excuse me
are are are you are you also a professor
or or do you just research
i'm a i'm an associate professor
but my i i'm a full time researcher and it's uh been a very very interesting career believe me
what are you going to what are you going to do when you stop i mean take all your machines with you or
well uh the ones here in the laboratory obviously i'm they're going to stay
but i have similar machines at home
i would consider doing some more consulting when i get home but i have a very very busy extra life anyway
and i play in several symphony orchestras and uh i run a concert band
and so i have a lot of external uh interests but i do want to get very deeply much more deeply into computer work because obviously the world is going to be controlled run and operated by computers in the future
because it is really taking over
and the amount of work that we're doing and the depth of things that we are studying can basically only be handled by computers because uh it's so much
here again let's say i'm starting to getting ready in preparation for retirement and uh so basically what i'm doing is slowly getting rid of my things
for many many years i had a full size acoustics uh study laboratory whe- where i could take recordings and and uh perform experiments with them and so forth
and so that's gone now
and so i'm sort of out of business
uh as i say i worked with
fellow named steve blazey was the fellow i worked with for many many years and he is now retired
so it's been an interesting life
and computers have come in towards the latter end of that
seem to have the topic already on top of th- tip of your tongue there
so why don't you go ahead and start
isn't the uh the subject auto repair
that's something i like to do and uh something i something i can do with now the sophisticated auto cars we have today with all the computers and everything
it's uh and there's not a whole lot you can do without the equipment and electronic analysis that needs to be done on a car
but i do like to get out and tinker with a car
and it's something i can do still
i uh in fact the last thing i have i've done i i don't even remember what it is
oh that's too bad
uh but the last thing i can remember doing wh-
and that was all right because like you said that was pre technology days i guess
and uh you know you could do a lot of it yourself still
and uh i didn't tinker too much with the engine
it was it was in pretty good shape
but my main concern and what i enjoy doing was was the interior
and uh it was it was pretty shelled uh
but it was fun
it was taking the whole thing you know the whole interior apart and you know ordering new carpeting and uh
and did you install all that yourself
well that was i bet that was a lot of fun
it it was
i my wife enjoyed uh she you know helped out a little
we sanded down the the insides of the door panels
well that's too bad
a sixty-seven chev- uh mustang is about the uh top
i i really enjoyed it
and i was surprised at at uh the availability of parts yet
you know you can you can still get factory original parts
but uh you pay a premium
but you just don't get them
i i didn't
i went ahead and got you know japanese made duplicates or wherever they were made
you know prefabs and all that stuff
well you know that's that's fine
i i don't think that there would be uh
you wouldn't you didn't notice the difference did you
well actually there was
and uh i had heard rumors that it was because they couldn't duplicate
and so like the the glove box was just a little little wider
and the carpeting uh stretched a little too far
but just just little things
you know one of the screws on on the door regulat- uh window regulators
you could get three of the three of the four to lineup
you know thin-
oh it was
the end result is after you put your your panels on nobody sees that
it it runs it works just the same
that's that's true
well you know that that is something i really enjoy doing um working on our car too
the uh i just changed my oil oil tonight
but uh i enjoy also working on things like the brakes
and uh in fact just two weeks ago i helped my neighbor out on his brakes on his car
and uh either if it's a drum or or disc brakes i enjoy working on those kind of things
but i i honestly don't have the tools for the drum
i know you got uh certain spring lever that you got to have or some uh some spring pulley or something that you got to pull that spring back over onto that notch
uh my dad has got all that
and and i i helped him when i was growing up
but i don't have that stuff now
because of the drum brakes i you know don't have any choice but to take them in
and you know it it doesn't doesn't hurt every once in a while to have them done professionally too
because um i was helping my neighbor out
and one of his drums needed to be resurfaced
and i don't have of course the equipment to do that
so he took it into a shop and had it resur- uh resurfaced and and fixed that way
it is true uh you know
the other the nicest thing about them is uh everything was standard
and you know
uh what do you think are the major social changes
what age uh if you don't mind me asking
well i'm i'm uh thirty-one
oh well you're you're young
so you should take my word
oh i you know i've seen a social change
and it's uh uh and besides that i came from california where social change is like you know
i mean every second
you know social change in california means it takes another two or three minutes longer to get to work
and uh when i started work there in it started you know actually going to work in eighty-two
between eighty-two and eighty-five uh it started out taking me an hour and fifteen minutes to get to work
and then it became you know an hour and a half to you know some days two hours to get to work
that's that's social change
well what do you think is is the major social change
that's that's a that's a tricky one
i think one the women uh in the work force
and i think the fact that they're becoming uh more uh
but they're more apt to be in political offices now
i think you know we've made great strides in that respect
i think that it thirty years ago when uh i was newly married family was very very important
and i think now it's revolving back full circle
oh i think it's that's probably for two reasons
uh you know the number one is women wanted to get out of the house
and the second reason was is everything costs so much more that if you don't have you know equal rights so that your wife gets equal pay you can't make twice as much
well i know that economically uh a wife almost has to work anymore
and yet i'm also noticing uh in the areas that i'm working and stuff more and more women are wanting now to stay home with the children where fifteen years ago they didn't
i mean you know they wanted children
but they still wanted to be their own person out in the work force
but i see i am seeing women now wanting to stay home more at least until the children are up to you know school age
and uh i find that very interesting that that it's sort of reverting back
i i've i've i've found that too you know where the wife is married and and
i mean not not married
but still you know after five years it's like first kid and then they're out of the work force for another ten years
but i think most of those people are still out
and and we won't see them back for another two or three years
uh i'm very rarely do i meet anybody whose children are are you know past that age when they've been away for a few years
but uh it's kind of different
it uh i i note that i had taken care of my grandchildren recently while my daughter and her husband had been out of town
and i do not envy these mothers or these fathers that have these the children that they have to rush home from work and pick them up at day care get them through their homework get them to their soccer practice get them to their piano lessons
i mean that's tough
and that's that's
parents uh even rarely see their kids for weekends which is you know kind of rough too
and and i'm finding you know running into these uh women that are wanting to have their children at the age of thirty-nine forty i'm thinking at the age of fifty-two you're crazy
and you're absolutely nuts
and the other one well the other one i don't know what her age is
but i know she is she is somewhere in that hairy age of half a century up there
and uh boy i'll tell you
these are the the go-gettingest happiest people i've ever met
well you can be go getting
but you can also get gray hairs and have a nervous breakdown
and it's not my children
one is uh
and one is uh four
so and uh
and i've always worked uh from the time that they were little
and so i decided to
well i think that's wonderful
but i teach school
and i teach uh middle school age children
and so i see a lot of uh variation in what happens when kids are at home
uh i have taught school ever since my children were little
but the advantage of teaching school is your hours are closer to your children's
and your holidays are too
so teaching i think is a a good career to have and still be able to spend a lot of quality time with kids
well that's what i was doing before
and uh it just seemed like it took a lot of my time with them being so little
and it's really hard
well with them being as young
and uh i really didn't have that much of a choice because my husband was trying to finish his uh college work and his master's degree and so forth
and so it was a matter of somebody had to have a
and that's what was kind of what where we were you know
we i really didn't have to work
but i felt like i really wanted to work
and i felt i also felt like boy i was sure missing a lot
and they were growing so fast
and i and it that choice was there
but it's different staying home
well i think that uh we need to spend more family time together with with children today
uh we made a point to spend a lot of quality time
and the activities that we were involved in were the activities the kids were involved in you know like uh through scouting or you know anything like that
and uh we always made a point to have breakfast together and supper together now
when uh the kids were in high school it was harder to always have supper together
but we did always have breakfast together
so we we had supper together as much as possible
but when it wasn't feasible you know we kind of kept a master calendar and when it wasn't feasible well that was understandable
but uh we've always tried to spend time to talk and uh have some time together time
and we sat around the table
so i think that's been important because we do have a close family and even though the kids are basically uh grown uh they still like to sit down at the table and us all eat together when they're here and uh have spoken before of they want that kind of you know situation for them when you know and their children when they marry and have children
they do what they see you know
and with the dysfunctional families today i'm sure with a as a schoolteacher also you see what happens to these kids when these families never communicate or they're dysfunctional as far as the between uh oh second families uh one parent families or all those kinds of problems that they have
and then you see them magnified in the children
so i'm sure that
you are really you really
boy oh boy
i taught early childhood so i had the little ones
and uh you know i saw it there too
and you you know you just
and m- i think most teachers realize the value of quality time with children and i think we make a point to do that
because we see
uh i wish we could reach more of the rest of the world
i think uh the major problems in education are not what's happening in the schools
and uh they expect us to you know have create miracles at school and fix all the problems and take over the roles of the parents as well as that of the teachers and you get to a point where it's completely impossible
i i know exactly what you're saying
and you just get more and more frustrated
and yet you feel for the the kids
uh what do you consider an invasion of privacy
uh i was just now told that's what the topic was
and uh i guess invasion of privacy uh to me for example would be unauthorized use of credit cards uh-huh
and uh i guess recently one of the t v stations here uh ran a series of uh news casts on unauthorized credit card usage and how easy it was to get a person's credit card numbers
and i was quite surprised at that
i guess i can consider myself fortunate that uh it never happened to me
now i've never i've never had that happen to me either
like i was in michael's the other night and charged something
and they asked for my home phone even though you know the charge had been approved
if i was the type of individual that uh had an unlisted number i i think i would be hesitant to give it
you know that they they now have a uh i believe it's a federal law that you do not have to give your phone number on charge tickets
one of the things that upset me when i lived in california was uh they did a lot of things with s- your social security number
and they would not cash checks unless they had your social security number
so we had our social security numbers imprinted on our checks
and i was really you know unhappy about that situation
i can see you know where that was
i i don't mind my phone number and address or work phone being given you know when i have to cash a check
but i neither am i a person that
you know and uh
one of the biggest things i think that's going on in this country right now is the selling of uh mail lists and things like that
you know uh recently we uh i purchased some magazines u s news and forbes magazine
and every since that day i have been inundated with you know uh subscriptions to this subscriptions to that uh this news letter this investment letter uh even to the point of people calling me at home
and prior to me ordering these magazines i never got those kind of calls
i discovered with uh charge cards uh i feel like that i don't know whether it's the stores themselves that sell the list or whether the uh uh credit report bureau sells it
but i get catalogs from people i've never even heard of
and i know they have to be coming from my charge cards you know
from some some list
from some list you know that knows that i have a say a charge account at at neiman's or something
because then i'll get catalogs that you know are within that range that i would never order from ordinarily
and uh you know and i get i get tired of that
i because i look at all that junk mail
and i think of how inept our post office is and how that's taking up
and they're not even paying full postage
you know and if you did away with some of that our postal service might give better service
i think the general public would be you know uh tremendously upset if they knew how easy it is for uh let's say the criminal individuals to to get access to people's records uh their credit cards driver's licenses checks things like that
uh i don't think anybody really knows what to do about it
well you know let's face it
computers can be gotten into very easily if you if you really have the the know with all if you're you know so inclined to uh oh what do i want to say have the smarts to be able to tinker with something like that
you know and have a basic knowledge
uh-huh you know
and uh which is scary
i mean you know our lives are on computers
and uh and i don't know
i kind of i resent the calls of an evening trying to sell me something
fortunately i haven't uh haven't uh been inundated with that situation yet
you know either wanting to clean our carpet sell us storm windows
and i'd like to tell you first of all what's happening in our community here in plano
right now we have a pretty nice recycling program where a lot of the recyclable materials can be picked up by the by the collection agency or the the city along with your garbage can
uh you can put out newspaper
you can put put out certain types of plastic material
and that is on a roll out effort right now
not all the citizens and the people in plano can go ahead and uh participate right now
but uh that will be rolled out to everyone i hope in the next year or so
and those that aren't participating they have the specific drop off sites where you can take glass and newspaper and aluminum
and i think uh overall that's an an excellent opportunity
because i hate to see our landfills being filled up and uh growing bigger and bigger and bigger where they are becoming a big problem for o- not only the people that are living today but for the future also
uh i was read-
and it's not a city
i mean uh i'm out in i'm out in the wilderness literally
well i like it
and uh well give you an idea
it's three and a half miles of dirt road to the concrete i mean to the asphalt
and uh we i do some interesting recycling things
and i'm going to incorporate into my uh garage area a weight activated uh crusher
so when i drive the car in the in the driveway in the afternoon it it will just drive it up on a ramp that actually puts me on top of the the uh pressure side of a uh hydraulic cylinder
and the weight of the car will crush
hope- hopefully it's not my wife
well let's hope not
you can be uh get in trouble for that
well i thought i'd you know i'd use it as a an escapement type thing
but what you do is you just build up the pressure and then you go over and release it
and then it just it just drops you know
well it's quite similar to a hydraulic jack isn't it
well what what it will be you just you drive up on the jack
but you it won't go down
anyway i have another uh recycling method i use
well anytime they send me a return envelope i put all that stuff back in the envelope plus the other stuff that i you know happen to gather up
because uh well like i say we live a way
and when you throw trash away you throw it in my yard
and i don't like that so i don't do that
so i take it
and i send and i mail it back to them
and we might be able to incorporate some of that
well i think one of the the best ways to eliminate uh or help the recycling problem is to eliminate non reusable items
for instance uh i saw a thing on uh nova i think it was the other day
this guy has designed recyclable materials i mean recyclable items
see so plastic it's all out of plastic
it's he's a design he's a engineer designing stuff
well that's a great idea
and and in- incorporating you know reusable materials into your uh you know your assembly line into your actual scheme of product operations is is the only way to really do it on a on a broad scale
make it financially uh attractive to recycle and somebody will find a way to make money at it
well there is a guy in dallas
he collects trash you know
well he's he's out for cardboard
well i've found out too that uh you know a couple years ago
and at one time we could get a pretty good return uh with the boy scouts
so a- are you a news person
uh i really am
i enjoy i enjoy listening to the news and getting as much as i can although you know i'm a full time student
and i work full time too
so or not full time
but i work quite a bit
i like i like to listen to national public radio uh all things considered
and i like to listen to that and catch you know
i don't get i don't get a lot of uh sometimes i don't get the current events you know because that show kind of has feature stories that might not
so so the real the real current news and the hard news is is not there is not really enough of it there
i've had i've had that frustration too
you you li- you like n p r uh programming
uh in general
uh i watch a lot of c n n uh and c span
uh i i subscribe to three newspapers
uh you know i sort of can't get enough of this
and and i when i travel elsewhere i'm often amazed at the local papers how little they have
h- h- h-
of world world events and national events
well in in dallas what are the what is the newspaper situation
and a uh major uh a one of our major papers just closed down
they closed shop and said well we can't put any more papers out
was was that the the better paper
it was a it was a more effective paper as far as i was concerned
it it had uh
uh which i like
i don't i don't like to you know i like to save the editorial information or the
i like just to get to the you know find out what's happening pretty quick
and i feel that the other newspaper uh
the t- the dallas morning news is the one that's still here
and uh the the morning news was was i- is okay
but you know you have to wade through a lot of editorial garbage as far as i'm concerned
but if you if you were to look at the front page of today's morning news morning times rather w- would you would you see things about what is going on in europe
but y- you know you see you see troy aikman's knee surgery
a a quarterback for the broncos or for the for the cowboys
uh you know you know you know what i mean that there is uh
not something you'll you'll uh be interested in ten years from now by any means
how how about you
uh i guess in washington d c you guys have several papers that are pretty pretty effective don't you
i i rather like the washington post
but i also get the new york times and the wall street journal
uh and uh each of them covers different things in in dif- dif- in different ways
and so it's you know if i only looked at one of them i would have a different perspect- clearly would have a different perspective on the world
uh i i have a question
uh does does the wall street journal uh
i i've kind of gathered lately that uh maybe their information is not just only related to business
is that is that a correct assumption
that that is certainly true
uh they will they will have articles
like a few days ago they had a a nice article on einstein you know theory of relativity
you know that started on the front page ran in into the full almost full page inside
now these are feature kind of articles
all the all the uh you know the bulk of the paper certainly is about business kinds of activities
but but there is some very good other articles uh you'll find in the in the journal
do you find that you're uh
uh i wish it were in more depth
uh that doesn't mean to say longer
uh c n n has has you know was was pretty good during the war
uh and they were you know sort of had a unique vantage point for for doing that reporting
so but you know it's not it's never quite
uh exercise huh
uh as a matter fact i work out in the mornings
and uh i have got a routine for every morning of the week
and i don't work out on saturday or sunday but uh i do i do a combination of uh uh running and weight training
i uh actually i just uh joined on my own
and i have been thinking about getting with a uh one of their counselors just so see what uh they might have to offer as far as uh alternatives
but i pretty much uh worked on my own routine
and uh what kind of running do you do
and uh i run one mile on monday wednesdays and fridays
and then on tuesdays and thursdays i run two miles
and then after that i work out with weights
is is just aerobics
uh i work out with free weights
uh i mean the running
oh uh yeah
it is really the uh aerobic work out part
you do it you do a mile in about eight minutes or less
uh about seven minutes
then you wouldn't then you don't get uh out of breath
that is that is a pretty good clip
and i am pretty winded by the time i get done
but i mean it's not pushing it real hard like you know if you tried to make six or something like that
i i uh could probably go faster
but then i would wear myself out
and i wouldn't be able to work out anything else
i i don't run much any more
and i don't i don't lift any heavy weight uh
oh i see
so this uh
do you just try and keep them i guess uh firm and uh
and uh uh i play the trumpet
and the uh the more upper body strength the easier it is to play
uh that is true
so you really have to build up around your neck and your shoulders to keep from uh hurting yourself when you play high
oh i see
you have to you have to do it correctly you know
oh i see
uh so you are in uh in part of a band
uh i play at church
oh i see
but it wasn't the trumpet
so i was just wandering if that was what it was or something
so do you have any plans of maybe running more when the weather gets nicer
uh well the weather is nice except for when it rains you know i mean in dallas
but that doesn't mean it gets done
i i mostly jump rope more
i use to do a little bit of jumping rope uh when i was uh
well a while back i was more into basketball and uh i could do a lot of jump rope and other jumping exercises to try to build my calves
and uh but it has been a while since i have done that
but you know it it doesn't uh doesn't uh accustom your legs to the kind of strength that you have like when you are running for a long time
they tend to tighten up whenever whenever you have to do something at uh uh great length of time
i i uh that is true
i have noticed that uh
and it also builds too much mass if you just you know
so it is like i i lift weights with about the same curl weight as i do the squats with
and uh then it doesn't bother me very much
huh that is interesting though
uh i have been thinking of changing uh
and i am thinking of uh changing it up
uh that is why well you know i was thinking to talking to one of their counselors and seeing what different exercises they could get me on to uh get out of the routine
because i have heard that you know you get locked into a routine then you are going to get to a point where you just stop developing
so i am looking at changing things a little bit
that is uh i have started doing more push ups
and and it has helped a lot
and then i add sets to it so that i don't like you said wear it out
uh clothing at work
um i work as a news reporter
and a lot of
i work in a since i work in a small station
this is my first job and so i dress very variedly
um sometimes i'm shooting and doing photography
and so i'll be in jeans one day
and another day i'll be on camera
and so i'll be in a suit
and another day i'll come in
and i won't know what i'm doing
so i'll wear a pant suit
so it really varies
oh me neither
i don't i don't wear a lot of makeup or anything like that
it just it takes too much time out of my day
and i don't i don't know
i don't mind it at all um
um i work at a bakery
but we we have to wear white pants and um any color t shirt as long as it's not like a bright color like a pastel
and we wear aprons and have to pull our hair back
oh italian i guess
and uh so i don't mind having having to wear a uniform because i don't have to buy you know right as mu- you know many clothes
that's one thing i would like is just to sort of have i really don't like uniforms but just to have something i don't have to get up and decide what to wear
but i i like to wear comfortable things like cotton and baggy things and
and when it was time to go out i didn't have anything to wear
but i don't mind
um let me see
i just oh my feet bother me
and they're just tedious to go find shoes for me it's just
i wear size nine and it i don't know if just the shoes i get i either don't like them or they don't fit right
and i just wish that i could just go without them
oh wow i love shoes
but um let's see
um if i were in a bigger market when i do get into a bigger market i'll probably go out and buy a bunch of suits and things and uh where i wouldn't have to shoot and do a lot of other things
and i could then i would be able to dress more business-like and things like that
but we're all kind of just out of school at this station
and so we're all you know
so it's pretty fun though
i like the look the the like suit look professional like you know look
um i'm going to be a teacher
so i'll probably just wear casual clothes maybe skirts and some
i like this the uh suits with the
they come like with a mini type skirt you know and the jacket
but but i'm pretty short
and so that really doesn't flatter me
but i think it looks good on taller people
i mean i i have like two pairs of pants because i can never find any that are short enough for me and it's just oh ridiculous
i like the like stretch pants the cotton ones
and it it's just like a chore to pick up my feet
because i'm used to wearing the little whi- white girl tennis shoes
oh yeah i have a pair of those
and i'm used to those
they're just sort of you know
like your feet i mean you don't feel them
it's it's you know like exercise or something for your feet
and so i know what warm is
like five pairs of socks and
so i guess we're recording now
um as far as spare time they talked about
i don't i think
i've got a a six year old and a um
well my baby's one today
and i'm also i'm expecting
and so i i don't know
well i've i have had some because i was working for p i e
and they went bankrupt
so i've got quite a bit of spare time right now
and i've been making dolls cloth dolls
oh have you
it's a they're all cloth
it's not uh any porcelain at all
so so you just sew everything up huh
yeah and i make the clothes for them
and then uh don't ask me what the other hair i made
it looked like um it looked
well i made some of them with regular wigs
oh did you
i went to the flea markets and bought you know like the wigs for a dollar
oh my goodness
uh do you sell them
oh have you
i just have to get a place where you know i can sell them actually
uh if i would just work all day long making the clothes and everything probably about two and a half days
and then i also crochet
i i i can crochet and knit
um actually i started an
but it's been a whole long time ago probably over a year ago
and it's sitting in my closet half done right now
but it's a knitting one
but i don't know
i i didn't like it
oh didn't you
so then i went to crocheting
but now i want to learn how to knit again
i i kind of like that
but i just like i say haven't done it for a while
and i do like sewing sometimes
i i've made a few of the you know just the little valence curtains in my house and things like that
but it it's just finding the time for
i in fact i just bought a serger in december
oh i would love one of these
oh that's neat
i haven't done everything on it yet you know
but just what little bit i have used it for i really like it
oh those are wonderful aren't they
you know especially making the seams and things like that you know it's
that and that's what i hate doing is the finishing stuff
so i like that
oh that's neat
well do you have um uh
well fifty-seven's not young
but they don't have any children
so i just make clothes for my dolls
well how did you get involved in that
just you know just like sewing and stuff and decided to buy a pattern and try to make a doll
so you did buy a pattern and then started from there
and they they turned out really cute
you got to have a pattern for the body you know
ha- have you ever seen those bunnies that they dress
i i did make some clothes for one of those dress one of those
i have quite a few of them actually in my house
i and most of them i have bought um already clothed
but i did i did make the dress on one
and i kind of made the pattern up
it's not it's probably not the best
i i bought a bunny pattern one time
but when i sewed it up the face of it looked like a mouse
oh it did
see it was too pointed
so i tore it back apart again
and i haven't tried another one
but i bought a little lamb pattern and the material and everything to make it out of
but i haven't made it yet
uh do you do any kind of painting or anything
i tri- i tried that
i did i i ended up just stenciling a um a blind like a just a roller shade
but i i can i had a hard time stenciling
and people have told me it's very easy
i my neighbor did it first
and i seen her house
and i saw how beautiful it looked
so then i decided well i was going to do it
and uh it turned out really really good
uh mostly flowers you know
i've done it in the all uh all my rooms
oh credit cards
oh do i
and then your are in debt
uh i get in a rut with credit cards cause they get me kind of in a vicious cycle where you use them a lot one month and then you have to use whatever money you have to pay those off and so then you have no money
uh i probably have one of every credit card there is
well uh it kind of comes and goes uh
i use uh citibank the uh advantage one pretty much cause you get vantage points for every dollar you spend
so as long as you pay it off every month it doesn't cost you anything
well that is a good idea
is that that through a visa
but uh i got all sorts of credit cards for my business that i use
i pay like the minimum
well you shouldn't do that
so i have got myself
you never you never get out of the hole that way
i have got that is why i have got myself with all this trouble now
but i pay most of them on time and everything
so it is kind of strange
and every time you try to get out of debt the economy goes to pot because people are spending money right
the rest of the uh and me we have got to pay fourteen and eighteen percent
the thou who doesn't need credit gets cheap credit
i would be interested to find out how many people or how much uh people use credit this year say in nineteen ninety-two as opposed to nineteen ninety-one even nineteen ninety
i think i think it would be amazing how much how many more people use it
well i think so
i would be very i would like to see some numbers on that
do you do you have any uh credit union where you work or anything like that
who who do you work for
uh i work for channel six
it's it's an n b c affiliate down here
a lot of i call on a lot of my business is down there
uh gene he-
so you probably work with uh uh
and uh what else
are you in that part are you in the south part of town now
well i live actually in hewett
so that is where davis iron works is
you know do you know parker machine tool down there
bobby parker and uh
but i am not sure
huh prime air
they make uh humidifiers and uh filters for air filtration stuff for hospitals homes something like that
they have uh uh a place i guess that would be similar to prime air
i went i have gone through there uh
so once and a while we go up six there rather than take forty-five
oh i don't like that drive
they they are bad at hewett too on eighty-four
so of course i couldn't pay that on a credit card
well i was just wondering if you had had any experience with um the care of the elderly
in fact uh
and we cared for her the last oh seventeen months of her life here in the at home
aside from uh
and uh you know those times well she was there in the the regular hospital
and then she was diagnosed having inoperable type of cancer
and so the doctor elected to have her uh finish out uh in the hospice program
and uh i as far as i'm concerned that is far and above any nursing home because uh she's around her own fa- you know the the elderly parent in question is around their own family
the uh hospice program provides a hospital type bed well it is a hospital bed and all the oxygen
stuff and a uh and a visiting nurse at least every other day et cetera et cetera et cetera
well that's nice
and it's all taken care of by by uh medicare uh
and uh it it's it's really neat uh
and i you know i wouldn't i wouldn't banish uh my old loved one to a to a warehouse
and that's that's what i basically uh view a nursing home as a warehouse
and uh i think a lot of people struggle with
i guess the problem is that the spouse of whoever you know the parent is
well that's really sad
but uh in this case uh spouse and i uh are uh we're are are uh united in this area because
i guess her father her grandfather and grandmother both lived with uh
so this isn't like uh uh just one one uh instance
in fact uh her uh uh experiences were were invaluable to me
well i know when the i remember being a child
and my grandmother had had
and they did for a long time i couldn't
tell you how long until she got uh where she had to have complete care
they couldn't you know keep her in the house anymore
and it was really hard on everyone
she had to have you know twenty-four hour a day care
and i don't remember much about it except that there was a nursing home at that time just a block or two from our house
and that um they put her there
but it was very hard on everyone to see you know grandmother be like that
and i don't know that you know
well maybe well as as you say the care of of grandmother or was was just such that such mom and dad couldn't handle it
well i do remember that she was you know totally incapable of taking care of herself in any way
and that that they couldn't they found that they could not you know give her the hygienic care and everything that she needed
well then then there's almost then there's almost no no uh uh choice left to her then
but like you say there is a tendency for people to be abandoned though you know
i do remember the other patients there uh
in fact just uh just uh sit and chat with them for five minutes and and be interested in what they have to say regardless of what it is
and i guess that's hard on people to give
but anyway well i'm
and then then
and i was just pr- i just praised the lord that that we were able to uh
so what do you you in your lawn
or do you hire someone to do it
we've been doing it ourselves for most of the time uh find that it's really a little more economical
and we have oh i find that i have the time
and i kind of enjoyed it over here in texas
and it was very con- very frustrating because i didn't have the watering system
and it was it was just too much work and not enough enjoyment
but over here we get enough water automa- you know naturally as well have the automatic sprinklers
and so it's a lot more rewarding so
well we do our own out here uh you know mow it ourselves and everything
but uh our water supply right now is bad
oh that's right
uh we can water here in patterson i can water on tuesdays thursdays saturday and sunday four days a week
uh now if it we don't get some rain they might limit it to not even four times you know but uh yeah
we do our law- our you know mowing ourselves and everything
and i do our
i find that i've been doing a lot of perennial planting which i never did before and it's been real enjoyable although i didn't do any this last fall because our past winters have been so cold um they'd freeze down
and by the time they the flowers would come back to life it was supposedly the time to pull things out for the spring and summer planting
so i was getting kind of disillusioned and tired and and spending too much money on something that was kind of more of a problem than it was rewarding
so um i'm going to try to wait now and just do the spring and summer type plantings and see how that you know feels
i just uh we in fact we just pruned them way down
and i just had to replace one of them
so i just bought that yesterday
and i'll probably go outside today and plant that
but um i like to have the roses where i can have cut flowers all year long
oh did you
i even had uh roses on my table for christmas dinner which was really pretty you know
but um other than the roses i don't have too many flowers
um those are nice
i plant gladiolas and those are always pretty
but they get so tall
and they they bend over so fast you know
i haven't done much in in bulbs
in fact i received as a christmas present a a planter that had bulbs in it that we were supposed to go ahead and water it any time and after it started to sprout put in a sunny window
and it it just grew like crazy
but i don't have
well is it that one of those amaryllis
uh no i'm thinking white narcissus or something like a pa- like a white paper flower or so
and in plano and most of the newer areas of texas uh they have just the the minimum square footage for lots to where you get a little bit of a backyard
and we did plan it to where we have some some play yard left over
but it's it's um you know very small
but most of the houses here if you have a pool you don't have anything else in the backyard that's about the size of most of them
so uh i guess we're kind of fortunate
everyone looks at that with our yar- at our yard with kind of sense of awe like wow you really got you know some grass
well that makes it nice
well it's hot enough here in the summer time that we could have a pool
but we don't have one you know
but they are a lot of people that do have pools around here you know but we just we just have dogs and um
so we do have a garden you know
it's just a small one you know
but we had lots of tomatoes and uh zucchini it's amazing what you can get out of a little you know it's probably about twenty by i don't know twenty by six something like that
and it's amazing what you can you know how many plants you can plant in there but it was nice
and i don't think this yard is a very
um i guess if i had to rate it from one to ten i guess
and i think there should be limitations of like semiautomatics
uh things like that should not be just given out to anybody
in fact you know i can't imagine
so i guess you know being that i come from a hunting family
but when you get into a a lot of the more complex weapons i would say yes
uh i definitely think that there some things shouldn't be limited like like you said rifles and uh hunting rifles and
and but i think the i think semiautomatic weapons people say
but i i personally cannot see any use for them other than uh for for like people who dislike have some sort of crazed you know ambition to use have high powered weapons or something
to do massive amounts of killing uh
and i mean you can only how much do you wa-
the only thing that i can see is the police having it in a case where somebody is uh uh you know going to kill a massive amount of people or uh somebody that's escaping that's uh very dangerous semiautomatic would allow more rounds to be put out to hopefully catch the person and and uh get him down
but uh you know i i think of my family
uh they're very much into sporting
so they have may have some shotguns
they may have other type of uh hunting type things
but i figured if the if the criminals had to take a hunting gun
and nobody would see it
but yet you can't stop people from having you know a handgun in their home
even if there are small children around there's you know
but uh i guess i i was always taught
uh you know and i don't know if that makes a difference if the parent sets down to them and say this gun can kill you you know and don't ever play with it
uh so i don't know if that makes a difference or what
well i think par- uh in that ca- i think that cases like that it's definitely um i think if you're
we have to get rid of them all because you know they can only they only seem to do bad
the criminals would get them i mean even if they had to go across border to get them
and people who people who have them and are responsible with them are are are being punished
and people who and they're saying that
how to use you know to make sure the guns
because we had guns all over our house when we were kids and not that they were laying on the uh couch or anything like that but uh i never had an interest in them
being in the fact that i knew that guns could kill and i had four brothers and never messed with any type of guns and so it was kind of the idea that we knew that a gun could kill and that a gun wasn't a toy and of course
and we went through
uh the national rifle uh club
and you're going to learn how to have safeguards and and know how to protect yourself
but yet have this
well i think i mean we i grew up in a family
and and my father had two guns because he used to hunt years ago
but he stopped before really before i was old enough to remember
but and i knew we had the guns in the house
and th- the time my father was keeping them just for protection at the time
or let's go get the gun
it was just something you knew was there and th- it was your father's
and y- you that was not something you'd go and play played with at all and i think maybe uh and that's the type of the thing that should be you know stressed
an- and i don't know if the kids nowadays are different than what
so do you have do you have the long
see i was raised in new york
but i guess up there you all don't have too long of a growing season do you
uh well we probably have about three months
do do you do your own gardening
but we don't farm much
we uh but we do have a garden
huh see i got mine in
well let's see
and i enjoy tinkering with it
we hit you know a hundred hundred and two sometimes
but you know we don't do too much during the summer as far as tomatoes and stuff
i can usually i can put in oh probably mid-march i can put anything in the ground
you know beets and onions
but then i have to wait for my
you've had more freezing this winter or this yeah winter i think
had just a few you know that freezes a little here and there
but every once in a while we get a freeze around the middle of april
and it's pretty tough
are you do you work
or are you retired
i work uh i'm only forty years old
uh my husbands retired
but he's not a gardener
he he he's been helping me more
but he really isn't uh real crazy about gardening
uh i i really enjoy it
and you know i'm a golfer
but it gives me time outdoors and time around my house
and i burned my grass off here in the last couple of days getting ready to start to the spring season and see if i can grow me another nice lawn
it's a lot of work you know
but it's a pleasure to like you said it's good to get outside
and and i like i like my garden too
we didn't have to we have just a small garden
but we planted corn last year too which takes quite a bit of space we we didn't have too good luck with it
because the uh we had a couple of good real good wind storms
and it really damaged the corn so we didn't get too much corn
so but i uh what i did with my garden is i have a a two by six frame that's five by ten
i have two of them sitting side by side and then i put uh like a black plastic
they call it wedet and i put that down
and then i put up a couple of inches of pine moss on top of that and i use a one of those black poker hoses that actually oozes water every where so i waste it up and down there a couple of times
oh that's great
and i only have to water about two hours a week and it's pretty nice
we don't we don't usually cover ours
and other years we've tried newspapers and uh but we generally don't we do our watering from our spring
oh you have a spring
we have an old fashioned pipe sitting that you know water runs into
and then it stops
and when the water comes up it comes on again
and we use that to water our garden
oh that's that's pretty nice
but you actually enjoy it huh
oh i do
i i can imagine
do you go more for natural keeping them off naturally
or do you
i uh uh try not to use any insecticides at all
i sometimes i can't manage
well our lawn is is a big lawn because because we live out in the country
and so we were not our lawn is not perfect you know
it's just the it's just a lawn
well mine's full of dandelions
oh did well did does your wife ever make uh bake in a hot bacon dressing like for
oh it's delicious
and it goes real good on dandelions
now i've tried dandelion wine but i've never tried any dandelions just to eat
use the greens if you get them when they're young and tender you know before they have grown too too tall
because they do get a little stringy
but uh they're kind of fun to to try
get a get a few
and then throw them in with the rest of your salad sometimes
uh but i've been cutting our grass too lately because my husband's back
and he's been having trouble with
so wasn't allowed to run a lawn mower
so it takes about four hours to cut our grass
and we have we have hills
and i just go ahead and do it
so you all are into so you all are into the lawn big time huh
i only get well i guess i got
my my whole section of my house is probably a tenth of an acre then i have a pretty nice backyard
and you know i've got enough room to throw horseshoes
oh that's great
that's a lot of people don't have that much space even
and it's nice
and i'm only a mile
so you have all the conveniences of
and and the country also
and i don't really have all the room in the house i need
you know those
the they called uh rolly polly bugs
and if if you touch them they roll up in a ball
but i'm plagued with those things
and i haven't figured out
i i don't know
or you know if you leave a piece of newspaper in the yard too long they get in there
but you can find them during the daytime if you pick something up that's been laying around
a slug is actually kind of slimy and these are just
but they roll up
but i'm plagued with those
i think you have a lot more insects down there even than than what we have
you know i think it's a big problem because we're in more of a tempered zone
you know we don't really we only freeze down here in january and february at the most
and they be can be a real
and you spray in one part of your lawn
and they just move to
so you got to
and your your your neighbor gets them
and then he sprays his yard
and you get them back again
but we're not doing too bad down here really you know
right now they're they're big now
so we we have daffodils
but they're just beginning to come out and bud
see mine are up and bloomed already
uh they're such a nice bright early spring
and then in in my back flower bed i have uh tiger lilies and they bloom in you know
they're they're nice and green you know
they're uh they're up above a foot
we're ha- it's raining today
well do you all have a
what kind o gra- grass do you grow up there
do you grow uh bermuda or
well our grass like i said is just grass
see we i have bermuda
and i still have the old standby crabgrass here and there
they suggested that we uh discuss what we think of when we say camping
what do you where do you like to camp
oh i can camp just about most anyway
camping or uh motor home is nice uh travel trailer pop up
i used to uh live in the ozarks and uh liked to go up there and just take a backpack and strike out into the woods
but i used to do it quite a bit
you'd have a lot of hills in that down in that area
and go out
and find a creek
oh that's great long as it's not raining
i we used to have one of those little caves you can go back in get out of the rain
oh that would be
but i don't know much about camping in texas
well i'm in pennsylvania
but uh we're up here in western northwestern part of pennsylvania
well you kind of know what it's like then
but we've uh we've done uh many types of camping
we've we've done tent camping
and we had access to a motor home which is really super great
you can get the they have some nice camping grounds you know that have the water piped out just set it up
and get out of get out of the city for awhile
we when the children were smaller we used to go to uh delaware along the o- ocean most every year
and that was fun
and uh we really enjoyed that
you're getting fad- you're fading out
oh maybe my dropping my phone
well we used to
but uh we used to
but uh i think the worst the worst thing is when it's raining
that's kind of kind of rough when you got to fight snakes off when your sleeping
uh copperheads mostly
one year they were they were just everywhere
we had a real rainy spring and then it was all year
but you still backpacked and camped out
well i lived down in down in the bottom of a big hollow
and we had to pretty much hike out most of the time
i would think i would think a cave would be could have problems like that too
it was more it was just big enough for a couple of people to sack out
well that's great
the first first couple of times it's pretty scary
oh do they
they've uh they've had longer hunting seasons than that even to get rid of more of them because they were uh increasing so much
they down here they they stopped for awhile
or they really made it hard to hunt them
but uh we we really like camping
i i must say that uh we ha- we really have a lot of fun a lot of memories in that from camping
well it's good to get out and smell some fresh air too
it's just so it's a lot of work too it's uh get- you know getting ready and taking care of everything
but it's um it's really refreshing
well i think we're about to run out of our time
well it was really good hearing from you
and i hope you get back into camping again and do a little more of it
and you have a good day
so uh do you think russia's still a threat
well i guess i'm maybe naive
but i never did feel that russia was a big threat to us
i mean obviously there's
but i somehow think that war is one of those things that maybe is inevitable
but uh i don't look at it as a threat in the same sense that that i think this question was meant
well i think
h- have you ever read the book nineteen eighty-four
you know like how uh these two there was like three continents that were always fighting with each other right
and you could picture it as being russia versus the u s d- during the whole time
and what they would do is they would get their prisoners and kill them as soon as they got them because the people there could realize that they were the same as as themselves you know
the prisoners of wars were were the same as the people living in that country
and you didn't want that to happen
and to me it had always been that way
and this government controls everything right and then you have the people inhabiting the country
and these people have nothing to do with the government itself
and these people are the same as you are
and what goes on is that every time somebody attacks a country supposedly u s or russia attacks a country it's not going to be within the borders of the u s or russia itself
in lith- in lithuania they they were announced to be a separate country
but yet the the government that's in moscow told its army to go in there and get those people
and the u s didn't go in there and try to save those people
you know it's like you're not going to go in there and say no
but what happens is you don't mess with us we won't mess with you
but let's mess with the neutral countries
you know and now it's like you know they're saying other people were were i guess other leaders were still crazier about it you know
like other people you could think that they might use a bomb here and a bomb there
but russia has never been known for throwing an atomic bomb anywhere
and the u s has
you know it's like they it seems like they can their their army or whatever can can go in there quicker than an atomic bomb can and do do the job with uh you know less suffering
you know but i think i think the thing is is that there the thing
like they were saying they go you know
like libya could start a nuclear war because of whoever is behind the button but not the u s s r
but i guess there was concern uh that i- iraq would use you know nonconventional warheads with with the chemical weapons and things
but yet it didn't happen
i mean why not
my my point of view to that is is that it would have had so much i mean the attack would have been so complete on iraq if they had
i mean the first you can imagine the first uh chemical weapon used that would have meant a total attack of the iraq country within you know three hours of when the weapon was shot
oh so you think it was fear that kept iraq from using it
but yet the
and what happens is what happens is
i mean if he were to use that he might as well commit suicide because he's going to be captured and you know
but the u s also makes a lot of uh you know treaties with other people like saying okay
and we'll take care of you like marcos right
but yet you can still come live here you know
i think that's that's that's not very likely
but yet you know as as the parallel russia is that saddam hussein is using the chemical warfare on his own people
and i guess that makes sense what you said that uh within their own borders they feel freer to do what what they feel necessary
and uh you know there's there's just you know
like people will go like they like the u s goes and goes into panama
see i don't believe in war
i don't believe that anybody should die you know
and so then you know you have
because what happens is
suppose i'm i go to war
and i'm holding a gun
and i'm just looking at myself holding a gun
and whoever shoots first survives you know
but that same person also has a family
and you know his parents are going to cry
and you know life ends there
and to me that's ridiculous
you know i mean i just don't believe it
but it's pretty hard to think that you know people are just going to shoot each other down
and it's legal in a situation like that
well or that that it resolves anything in the end that that negotiations couldn't resolve
i mean i mean saddam hussein lost so much money during the war that it was ridiculous
and he all he was trying to do was make money at the beginning so and keep his power
well it sounds like neither one of us thinks that the soviet union is a real threat to the u s
i i don't think so
i think uh they're getting they're especially getting their life back together now
because a lot of things that you saw on tv
a lot of uh inhabitants of russia would love to stay in their country just as long as they were able to express what they wanted to
a lot of like dancers and stuff like that
so it must be a beautiful country
it's just that you know they won't let you get out
and when you want to get out of the country that's what you want to do
so oh well
uh how you doing
oh you're right here
i just uh called and came in
oh are you
i just got a little booklet uh this not what we're supposed to talk about just got a little booklet in the mail with the gifts
and i thought i better make some calls
well i haven't had a chance i haven't got a chance to look at them yet
my daughter uh got a few calls at home
i guess they give them to computer students too in uh virginia something like that
one i think worked at a university university um and the furthest away i've talked to someone has been new york
uh we're supposed to talk about the elderly now i guess uh
do you have anybody that you uh are close to that decision on or anything
or i've thought about it for myself and all
and my wi- my wife's mother is in a retirement home
she's not in a nursing home uh
oh well that's a
did i didn't we push
but uh she's she's down in san antonio and it's it's a uh it's a brand new one
it's a catholic uh retirement home for nuns
it's at uh trinity uh
well isn't that neat
and they have a retirement home for the nuns and they take some lay people
and that one's really super
now i i know what they're talking about on regular retirement
they do have a wing where the people who are really sick you know have nurses
oh that's good
and then they have other wings that we visited uh that are very nice
i mean it's just super
they they they have uh like uh a guard with locks
she she she's perfectly healthy
what made you all decide to put her or what made her decide to go
well her husband died
and she just did not want to take care of the house and she visited the place and then fell in love with it and decided to just shun all responsibilities of any kind
well that's good
and so she's happy as as heck
and they serve meals of course
so that's nice
now i i know the ones where you're really ill we visited a long time ago when she had a grandmother that was in one
and they were all more or less hospitalized type you know really really sick
oh you got more experience than i do then on it
well it was really it was really sad heartbreaking i guess
and uh i just oh i just felt for those people especially the ones that never got visited
oh that would be awful
i never thought about that you know
that just bothered me so much especially you know at my age
and that really made a bad impression on me
i always thought not really bad of them i mean because they are most of them i believe are probably pretty good for the people
but i don't know
it's just a it would be a tough tough decision
i think that uh hopefully we as a country are learning a little more about it
and they're getting nicer
and boy that really pumps them up
if you just have people your own age you never get a chance to see kids or anything or animals or anything you know you can't take care of them
but it's nice to have them visit and everything
you know sometimes that even helps them just being around young people to because some of them are so um just stationary i mean they'll get in a wheelchair
or they'll just sit in a chair
and and until you come along and really try and pump them up they're just stationary
and i feel like gosh that's all they do all day long
so i do love to see young kids go and and men take the pets and everything
i think you do get more by stimul- by stimulation
my in fact my mother in law just visited
she's just about seventy-five again perfectly fine
but one and and she visited us here in in dallas
when she went back every time she goes back to uh san antonio my wife has two sisters there too she said she's much better
she's much more alive and and uh active when she's been on a visit with somebody else you know and and our routine has obviously hectic with teenagers and everything and she's much
and so the stimulation part is really important i think like any animal anything you just lay around uh that's the fastest way to die i think you know
um of course i've seen those reports on t v the horrible ones and that scares me
anything bad i like i like to
but it's sad
and you know i've seen them on t v with uh bed sores
and oh they just stay in the same clothes or the same sheets and not do laundry
and i just think how can you do that
these people have given so much of their lives you know to to america you know whatever
and here is how we treat them
when i was uh younger we i lived in the east
and it seemed like there were several people that i knew that had their uh parents i guess they would be but well in their seve-
and one of them was even a woman who was fairly old
and i guess she
and i think whether it's more a custom up there or maybe because i was younger and it's just not a custom anymore to have uh you know the grandparents live with you anymore
i guess that uh well we aren't getting away from that which is not right
i think uh you learn a lot from them from all their experiences
and and that's one of my favorite things to do is sit around and listen to their stories
because they really have a lot of good i- insights that my fa- my husband's father is really old
he he had him late in life
and he's he'll be eighty this year
and i just uh he lives with different you know people in the family
well that's nice in a lot of ways
i think well my kids better not do that to me
i don't want that you know
so i i think of it well how would i want to be treated rather than well
it's easy to say oh yeah
but when i think i don't want to do that you know
i say well i'm going to build a little house behind yours
and i'll take care of your lawn he says
but i'm not
oh you're going to put me away
that's what we that's the way we call it which is really wrong
but my wife's mother and the one she's in san ant-
i mean it's a little hotel you might say
again a swimming pool and grounds
and she has enough room
she has two bedrooms and a and a separate living area
they don't have kitchens or anything but they have little it's like uh on each floor they have a little kitchen area where you can go down and have a make a meal you know
well that's great
now can she leave um on a day by herself
it's it's it's nothing like that
i mean she's totally on her own
uh and she still drives which we do does scare us some because she has dented a few things you know
and we keep thinking about that you know because she they get less alert
and they don't care
and i've seen some of these elderly people on t v you know the ones from florida that just run into people
and they don't even understand what happened you know
that's like their one last thing that they can still do
and you take away that driving ability
and that would really be hard
i i know
we've well we've thought about doing that for my husband's father because he
oh he still drives
that's gre- well it's wonderful in one respect
but i don't know if you can afford the insurance
well luckily he drives a big old tank
so he i mean i don't think he he could get hurt
but he he hasn't had any accidents luckily
i mean people are all different
i i wonder if they should give them a test or at least maybe not take their licen- maybe give them a refresher driving course and just to see how well they are every five years
they um you know they're testing that they're you know thinking of doing that
and i think that would be a great idea because i think they do come become less aware
and they just i don't know they and they don't hear as well for one thing and that doesn't help
well everybody needs retraining
it doesn't hurt uh
and i don't know why you couldn't after sixty-five every five years have a refresher course and then take another driving
it would sure the insurance companies would would probably help pay for some of that you know
but i think they maybe should do that
and then the families
do you have you noticed any new uh trends in politics
well the one i think is interesting is the california los angeles police chief who says he won't resign
and did you hear yesterday that mayor bradley said that uh he should
i think it's i think what's interesting is that uh the political activists jesse jackson and a lot of other people went out there and are demonstrating
i find it interesting that uh outsiders would bother to go in
how do how do you feel about people like jesse jackson getting involved
uh i think sometimes it's good for people outside
they get a different persp- uh perspective on an issue and stuff
i think though that it should still be uh sort of up to the majority in the area
well do you but do you think gates should resign
and he obviously failed somewhere along the line
well well speaking of that kind of issue have you kept up with john wiley price
oh um i think he's got good intentions
but i'm not sure if the way he goes about what he does is really right
i was talking to someone who said that uh for all his obvious attention to efforts to get media attention that he actually is a worker on the uh
i guess he's on the county uh oh board of supervisors or and the the the uh at those meetings he really comes quite well prepared and is well informed and is a hard worker and is really quite agreeable uh
and that this stuff we see in the you know in the media is uh
well he's really just trying to make a political statement
i i find that an interesting element of politics that we don't that that most people would not know that john wiley price apparently is a is a you know
of course he's got in this this deal of racism and the you know name calling and all this
but apparently he's a a worker
uh you may disagree with him
but i i i find this whole
what do you think of this uh fourteen one and ten four one in dallas
oh i think that they should go ahead and go to the uh fourteen one
i to me it's just fair you know
an equal it seems like every area should have an equal voice
but did you see the map they drew up on uh on how they were going to divide up the districts
it was it was the strangest
i'm i'm not sure it was gerrymandered
but the way they drew these little patterns and stuff i i i guess i'm a little cynical of the of the power base
i i i and i don't quite understand why the power base uh doesn't uh why they don't go with fourteen one
i you know and you know the it seems to me that what happened in the in the election that a lot of the people they said particularly the the uh i think it's hispanics don't vote because they don't think that they have any affect
i i guess i am disappointed with dallas in that uh the fourteen one it
you can you can disagree with al lipscomb and uh
what's what's the lady's name
you can disagree with uh what they're doing and what they're saying
but in reality i think they're they're trying to represent their constituents
a- and i think dallas is doing itself a disservice
and i don't know why certain groups are fighting so hard to keep the ten four one
and i but i think even i even those people are
i think it's it's kind of interesting that everybody's so busy politicking that the question is are we getting anything good done
are you involved in the schools at all public schools this whole thing down there where they're they're trying to um uh you know devote all our money and raise our taxes and better schools
and and it all seems you know like everybody's trying to one-upmanship on everybody else
i i have got to run to a meeting
i don't think we've gone our our ten minutes
but i think we've we've talked long enough
well there's been a lot of publicity lately about that new nancy reagan book out by uh kitty kelly the unauthorized biography
so i i don't particularly read um biographies or autobiographies
i i'm more of a fiction and nonfiction reader that n- n- not of that nature though
well i the reason why i was thinking about looking at it is because it's supposed to
and so it's supposed to have a lot of unflattering things in it
and i thought just purely for entertainment i might enjoy that
but i i wouldn't want to go out and buy it like you know the hard back copy of it
but i might check
if they if they had it i don't even know that i'd probably read it even if it was at the library though
i i just you know i'm just not really interested in reading about other people's lives to that degree
you know unless maybe they lived a long long time ago
for me it would be interesting to find out what life was uh l- like you know in that period
not not really interested
well i uh
if i read a biography it's mostly because maybe i have to uh you know
back when i was in school i had to have information about that person or um preparing some kind of lesson
and i need to have more information about people
but i i do like to read some biographies
but that one just sounded like gossipy
and i wouldn't want to sit down and just read it cover to cover but flip through just for just to get a good laugh
i think the last biography that i read i'm not i think it was it was um on lady randolph churchill
and that was excellent
i think the first one is called jenny or something like that uh because that was her name
and i've been looking for you know the other half of it and read the
and it was absolutely excellent
and it was very descriptive of of people with money back then and uh affluents in england uh that you know were associated to the king and all
and it was
it's it's been a while
uh i love to read
i mean i'm constantly reading
i read i like uh mysteries
and i like um
as far as improving myself uh i haven't read any lately
but i was reading classical works that i hadn't read before
you know that you might have needed to read in school but that i just didn't read for some reason or another another or that you know that you can only read so many in school that they make a requirement of
and you have so many out there that uh that you you know you never get a chance to read
and so i said
well i think it was because i read um dickens' a tale of two cities
and i just um that
and i couldn't believe i i could not believe that it took me so long to read such a good book
but i hadn't read that one
and i i was like i thought to myself you know what other things are out there that are that are classics
you know that have withstood time and that are just excellent
something's excellent about them whether it's the way they were written or whether it was the material they were written you know that was written about
and um so i started reading
i had this like you know i had a binge of bo-
my mother uh
but my uh mother sent me you know like bookl- you know uh boxes full of different books
and uh she just would get them real cheap and stuff and send them over
but she she is constantly was i guess because
it seems like uh older people have much better uh
in their schooling they they got more of the classics than i did
and she knows so much more of them than i do
i wouldn't even know you know to go look for that author or that book
well i like the classics too
uh i think that there's a lot of books out now that are kind of garbage
and i well i don't prefer to read a lot of the things like you might find at uh well like at a target or a supermarket or something where they have a bunch of books out paperback type books
usually i i'm going to the book store for a particular reason uh
pro- probably you read a book review or something
and and uh i buy some of the not self-improvement books but uh self-help books
like we just bought a new house
so i bought a couple of books about how to buy a house and what to look for you know
and or how to repair this or repair that in your own home
and or how to how to do something books you know for reference
and uh and those are really helpful i think in helping um
well you know like some w- symptoms medical symptoms like when how do you know when to take your child to the doctor or not
but purely just for enjoyment
i i had a major in english and linguistics
and so i ha- have a lot of books in my home that i can read from the classics
and i do enjoy those quite a bit
and um so i tend to for reading just day to day uh you
or i just enjoy uh you know the newspaper magazine
well what i do is i usually have two books at one time
you know uh just depending
well some authors i can just you know basically drink in
but others eh i really do have to work at them
and then um whether you know they're a foreign author or whatever um or if it's their style or or just understanding the material
and then i you know i- some of those it's like i said
but to me it's worthwhile in the end
and i usually remember those a long time later
and then i have books that i read just purely for enjoyment
i mean yeah
i particularly like dick francis books and just some of the the authors that are uh for mysteries just you know just uh purely for entertainment
except to be momentarily pleased you know because i don't i can never remember
well i think that's good because you do have to use your mind and imagine up the circumstances and things
it's not like uh most television where you you know you just you can sit there and not even pay attention very much but
that television it gives you everything
so it's ber- basically mindless
i mean all your y- the only really thing you are having to use is connecting the things that they give you you know
what you're hearing and your your si- uh your sight
but they give you everything else
and it's usually the television that we see nowadays seems like that it's it's it doesn't even have some of the underlying uh things to it you know that maybe the old movies and things had you know the underlying themes and stuff that maybe you had to kind of figure out
or you know like with hitchcock or something where you're you're you're either expecting something or w-
i i don't know
it just i don't really care much for t v at all
i mean i sometimes get hooked into it
but i really i really get mad at myself when i do because i r- i realize fully there's no really redeeming value for
well that's right
well i think it is good to to read books and and
you know when you develop your imagination that can take you into a lot of other areas because you've developed uh your your your mind in in seeing things you know
even if it's your own set way you know
