 yeah
 yeah
 okay
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 yes
 uh-huh
 so do we
 yeah
 right
 that is a really pretty state park
 uh-huh
 i'm not sure
 i'm actually in the air division
 it's a similar thing
 i have in the past
 
 you buy something on credit
  yeah 
 no
 and always kind of thought that too  kind of an extra buffer 
 i'm sure the people love golf up there like they do down here
 true
 we still have a lot to see though
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
 it just breaks my heart to see these poor little old dogs wandering the streets looking starved
 yeah
 oh
 okay
 yeah
 yeah
 yes
 right
 well that uh that i think may go on a lot
 uh-huh
 not
 right
 yeah
 yeah
  to  a certain extent
 oh
 diagram
 yeah
 yeah
 
 up until his death
 do you think there's very many really good day-care centers around your area
 yeah
  yeah 
 we're renting a house
 
 yeah
 yeah
 no
 i hope you get better
  uh-huh 
 everything all parts of the food
 right
 can't say it
  right 
 no
 with a baggy sweatshirt
 how'd you do that
 i'm going to check that
 okay
 it's usually not a one time accidental thing i don't think
 uh-huh
 i still believe i get very fed up with government sometimes
 uh-huh
 it's all the dirt i have
 so which is fine you know
 uh-huh
 
 right
 we'll see you
 that is
  wren 
 you must have some of their lines memorized
 uh-huh
 twelve children
 i was going to say you didn't have the typical
 yeah
 yeah
 i found that out
 yeah
 i'm not in the middle of anything
 okay
 yeah
 yeah
 oh really
 yeah
 i do too
 yeah
 they eat it one to two meals everyday in north africa
 i like that
 was c n n
 right
 a little bit better than some of the others
 yeah
 a ring at all
 yeah
 yeah
  yeah
 uh-huh
 warren moon's an  excellent
 yeah
 uh-huh
 oh shoot
 yeah
 they were just covered with them
 right
 all right
 
 yeah
 how do people in texas deal with dallas houston and san antonio
 i've noticed that
 exactly
 uh-huh
 me too
 uh-huh
 whereas it would have been
 the engine blew up
 okay
  right 
 
 that's true
 
 it's just a point that i have observed that we
 
 uh-huh
 we need rain really bad
 yeah
 yeah    
 he was raised in the south
 you probably have some friends that have television
 my god i can't imagine
 i'm trying to think what else is on television
 right
 yeah
  okay 
 uh-huh
 i really like   a lot
 the grass was dead everywhere
 
 when we had our larger cars we didn't mind uh keeping them up
 uh-huh
 those were not good cars
 yeah
 i'm not really expecting to get anything out of it
 
 yeah
 as long as it's not used to delay the trial so much
 that's true
 uh-huh
 right
  i'm a historian 
  golly 
 the language barriers
 if something is out of style i do not really care
 one is bad enough
 uh-huh
  yeah 
 not
 do i have kids
 y-
 i guess it just couldn't handle
 they do yes
 those people down there don't really
 uh-huh
 yeah
 no
 for which if they would just pay me enough money i would be willing to consider
 i've got a lot of
 sure
 interestingly   in honduras
 we've all got to do it right now
 gone are the days of those things they use-
 i don't know
 that has broadened so much also
 exactly
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 a girl
 like i say i've made a couple of calls to texas and just talked to all different kinds of people
 oh
 i try to keep it pretty reasonable
 yes
 yeah
 no
 yes
 it was just a total fiasco
 really
 uh-huh
 there was no trees where i was from in amarillo
 yeah
 lubbock is
 uh-huh
 be interesting to see when as mexico develops industrially whether you know without
 yeah
 it depends on the state you live actually
 we're sort of like the middle east peace talks ourselves
 i haven't
 yeah
  uh-huh 
 i do too
 really
 yeah
 uh-huh
 right
 seems like it takes so long between conviction and carrying out the penalty that i don't see that it makes any difference to sentence anybody
 makes a lot of difference
 that's exactly right
 yeah
 i do cringe when i hear some of the problems we've had
 not at all
 even to watch it
 uh-huh
 yeah
 i haven't read his book
 six seven and eight
 i wasn't
 i don't know what it was
 yeah
 okay
 you
 yeah
 exactly
 all within in an hour
  yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 so we've got four cars for our five licensed drivers
 yeah
 yeah
 i see
 uh-huh
 they bring home notes that say they have to get a good night's sleep and eat right in the morning before
 right
 the one
 have you ever had them just come up in different places
 how long have you been in raleigh
 yeah
 uh-huh
  please come back to work 
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 i think it was 
 let me push the button
 sure
 just a little bit of begging will
 yeah
 they made a little patio area where they can go outside
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
  no kidding 
 they have a fish that's called an oyster cracker
 yeah
 uh-huh
 right
 yeah
 young mothers
 
 if i start into something and i really enjoy what i'm reading
 uh-huh
 i wasn't in central america
 we're fixing to get in the car
  i couldn't help myself 
 we got it at a little bit of an incline
 
 to be a lot of fun
 i hate to see that
 in my car and let someone else check the oil even
 uh-huh
 no
 have you ever camped on sand
 what
 just the volume makes a big difference
  uh-huh 
 right 
 that's four each
 it really is
 they like to be outside as much as possible
 uh-huh
 i got to shovel it all lots of fun
 i've even had some of them
 uh-huh 
 the same in some of the areas around here
 right
 yeah
 the first one i got
 yeah
 i just hope it doesn't go up any more
 that's true
 
  that's  really sad
  right
 right
 because there's just not enough of me to drive them around everywhere
 the men that are out there fixing power lines are tested a lot
 yeah
 levels of it the one from seventeen hundred til say the end of the civil war
 you're not old
 yeah
 yeah
 frank e
 yes sir
 right
 okay
 i'm just teasing
 yeah
 it's something
 it's so comfortable
 that's right
 right
 there was a high error rate in the analysis of drug results
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
  lawry's  prime rib
 or something like that
  right 
 more especially where you are
 i know
 i did
 uh-huh
 okay
 yeah
 yeah
 bleachers
 cocoon
 uh-huh
 seems like a nice place to go
 when i was a couple of years ago involved in some pretrial stuff and
 it's just i don't have a trailer hitch on my car anymore
 you're buying these knock offs
 uh-huh
 i said no turkey is only for thanksgiving
 uh-huh
 when i was growing up we had cats
 we still have lots of little goldfish
 yes
 yeah
 i think they will probably win one or two more games than they did this year
  to  really be camping
 one is in ninth grade
 yeah 
 that's true
  chairmen 
 d-
 i
 yeah
 little baby kittens dropped and stuff
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 
 i had one lady one time
 uh-huh
 yes
 i said
 i'm not saying just give them money
 that seems to be the norm of most movies
 i just want to kill her
 yeah
 uh-huh
  you  must have come to washington at least once
 that's the whole thing
 right
 he needs to get outside and play
 uh-huh
 oh
  somewhere  on one afternoon
 i don't know where i really come down on it
 
 
 i'm not quite sure
 uh-huh 
 yeah
 okay
 boy that's pretty good
 i don't have one
 my voice you mean
 i now have grandchildren
 i know i really
 exactly
 
 do they time this thing for us
 
 uh-huh
 it is
 
 i come from florida
 it's amazing how vegetables trays will go at a party
 right
 
 i know it
 yeah
 yeah
 oh good for you
 
 right
 i like to know where it's going to
 uh-huh
 where's bob or what about bob
 uh-huh
 in utah
 that's computer stuff
 i imagine
 that's when i was in the elementary school years
 uh-huh
 you're kidding
 i have
 uh-huh
 yeah
 i'm actually working on a data base at home just to keep track of things nothing special
  uh-huh 
 what division you all in
 uh-huh
 you may never get the truth
 yeah
 it's probably true
 uh-huh
 yeah
 i like country and western
 yes
 yeah
 wasn't that what part of the lottery is going to go for if we approve it
 uh-huh
 he had my vote double
 home from work
 right
  know 
 yeah
 yeah
 definitely
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 okay
 okay
 your first ones you mean it
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 right
 do you have a sam's wholesale warehouse up there
 this was yanked
 yeah
  right
 uh-huh
 it's kind of an easy thing to talk about
 okay
 that's where i picked it up
  uh-huh
 right
 yes
 you can't get in there
 with a
 the jeezer music as i call it
 you didn't have to mix paint then right
 yes
 i didn't know that
 yeah
 it's good to have a partner
 uh-huh
 we've had a real nice mild spring
 uh-huh
 they fought individually
 they have some wonderful camping areas there
 we do
 do you work
 in the dallas area
 uh-huh
 they said
 i think the kids need some time to play
 the whole lot i'm sitting on is roughly half an acre
 yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 we don't get to go that often
 south padre
 yeah
 we'll catch our news that way
 yeah
 that's funny
   i had no idea 
 i don't go to east texas
 no
 yeah
 i like cows too
 uh-huh
 who do you work for
 yeah
  a lot  of people are
 yeah
 uh-huh
 we- the the middle girl doesn't get a whole lot of attention
 yeah
 yeah
 i think it was like
 as well as hot lunch
 take them off
 yeah
 
 flimsy
 i don't know
 right
 he brought it home
 if you could come up with a device that's the thing
 which is a shame
 i guess you'd have to call them great men in some sense
 that was poor quality i think
 uh-huh
 like you're judging us
 i work for t i
 uh-huh
 right
 everybody in the country is preapproved i think
 it was really
 i found about it on the network
  uh-huh 
 yeah
  i don't know 
 yeah
  right 
 yeah
 okay
 maybe supply some arms or something
 i can you understand that
 do they have many buildings that have security there
 yeah
 
 it is so safe there that you can leave your purse on the subway
 i live in atlanta also
 uh-huh
 i go to a few games
 that's not real surprising
 smell the continuous
 that's part of that propaganda thing
 and colorado springs
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
 the woodworking
 it in a million years to do it myself
 it's
 i'm jealous
 really
  yeah
 yeah
 no
 uh-huh
 yeah
 you're amazed at how much that adds up
 uh-huh
 yeah
  enough  to
 parents and children husbands and wives
 how about your
 i kn-
 that's true
 right
 i can't
 uh-huh
 at that stage of life you only have so much money left
 i don't have
 i'll let you lead out
 right
 that's right
 yeah
 too
 owens
 the car all the time
 it was a really cute little kid too
 they're like
 yeah
 
 really
 yeah
 i mainly play the guitar a lot
  from  acid rain
 uh-huh
 i wouldn't want to look at them
  uh-huh 
 yeah
 we used to camp a lot with our
 yeah
 right
 ye-
  wow that's good 
 they can come from all over the city
  uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 
 there are a number of good movies like that
 do you have children
 but
 yeah
 yeah
 not only can it be fun
 i know
 my goodness
 it's
 it would be hard
 i think they're a little bit biased sometimes
  little  value just in whatever you do
 what about you guys
 was it bad
 right
 that i think is my invasion privacy because it's the government
 i agree
 do you have children
 i'm like  god  
 yeah
 like if you order something through a mail order catalog
 you mean in cable
  yeah 
 yeah
 yeah
 i got it right on the tip of my tongue and can't say it helen something
 uh-huh
  right 
 uh-huh
 yeah
  
 i do too
 i don't know if i have anything handy
 for some reason i just couldn't do it
  i think  it was sixty eighty
 right
 uh-huh
 whoops
 go right to personnel
 uh-huh
 he never really got in a game never did a whole lot
 no
 yes
 uh-huh
 oh
 yeah
  god i  can't believe we moved out of an apartment and had this much stuff
 right
 uh-huh
 oh
 i've
 wow
 uh-huh
 yeah
 you got to take them for walks
 i'm kind of old fashioned i guess that way
 uh-huh
 and raise my children
 a keeshonden
 you're not too surprised on much of anything
 yeah
 yeah
 it's just
 uh-huh
  yeah 
 and then people the the wrong people will just fight their way
 do you
 that's right
 and you got the cars
 yeah
 yeah
 central
 that's
 is she of alzheimer's or something like that
 uh-huh
 yeah
 that's probably what i'll try and look for whenever i do have
 uh-huh
 my husband does
 it'd be nice to be a pro golfer
 interesting
 
 
 the store and come home and sit down and watch it
 was that good
 i think it's a little harsh to say that they should have to spend a year or two
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 you just do it and be done with it and don't worry about it
 yeah
 okay
 about five or six years ago my dad  who plays every now and then took me out with him
 more of that
 what we have
 uh-huh
 i was going to say it must have been wal-mart
 well i've heard this one theory that if that if a kid commits a crime that uh instead of the prosecuting the kid they prosecute the parent
  right 
 yes
 you bet
 they're not cutting in any other corner
 that we can't improve these things
 it was really suspenseful
 okay
 i understand we're supposed to talk about spaceflight
 then you're that much farther ahead
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
  that makes sense 
 yeah
 go out to the nursing home help guide some craft programs perhaps work on some
  right 
 yeah
 yeah
 there were places where she could actually take her
 yeah
 i have heard it is
 just
 yeah
 uh-huh
 that's true
 uh-huh
 yeah
 and you wanted to go back some
 
 okay
 
 go ahead
 right
 i do
  uh-huh
 for some reason they put a bathroom light switch in the hallway
  did you 
 yeah
 uh-huh
 that's easy
 where are you from originally
 it's it's pretty tough that way
 yeah
 uh-huh
 
 well it's a matter of name recognition
 
 i know
 uh-huh
 it was funny
 sure
 i work at texas instruments
 yeah
 that's right
 bu-
 wow
 i love that
 no
 uh-huh
 right
 right
 yeah
 yeah
 yes
 like i said if we don't have we also set aside money for entertainment
 the eagles yeah
 is texas one of them
 yes
 they just used things
 it's just as boring
 right
 all right
 have you ever killed your mother
  uh-huh 
 it wouldn't be perfect
 sometimes called the dismal science
 i try to
 c o u s c o u s
 that's really nice
 it was really enjoyable
 yeah
 i never learned
 yeah
 
 uh-huh
 yeah 
 exactly
 
 it's not just random people
 how about you
 yeah
 uh-huh
 that's one i can watch
 that is one solution to it
 right
 now particulates would come from trash burning or incineration or something like that here in dallas
 oh
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 i was going to read while it was on
 uh-huh
 well pretty soon it's going to get to the point where no one is going to be able to afford to send their kids to college or to do go to college
  yeah 
 yep
 disposal is a problem
 it's loud and repetitious without having a great deal of meaning
 
 but she just wants to be able to have that freedom
 it's hard to say
 how do you like it out there
 uh-huh
 i think so
 uh-huh
 
 yeah
 it's really neat
 boy that's a good deal
 right
 uh-huh
 yeah
 just life in general
 right
 yeah
 yeah
 it sounds like you have a baby there
 it's just if you really want the majority of the people to vote then give them a couple of days
 i guess my husband got a letter at the office
 you don't
 uh-huh
  okay 
 yes
 uh-huh
 that should be a lot of fun
 and i don't know that's true or not
  that  it was a virus
 yeah
 i don't know
 uh-huh
 i have seven cats
 yes
 uh-huh
 what
  uh-huh 
 there are those teams that play in professional national football league
 i don't like it
 yeah
 that's why they want them there because them somebody takes care of them all day
 
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 hearing anyway
 four or five years
 
 she had injured her back and needed a walking partner
 yeah
  uh-huh 
   no  
  uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 i don't
 that gives me plenty of exercise
 absolutely
 i need a hole there
 yes
 i see
 that gets
 uh-huh
 hi
 
 that is for sure
 it
 i almost never watch television as a matter of course
 i was just thinking
 i do
 i think it was just rare
 uh-huh
 
 uh-huh
 that's why i was thinking it couldn't be just a totally funny part
  bye-bye 
 uh-huh
 yeah
 
 i went to
 yeah
 we do a few things
 yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 aspen
 yeah
 definitely agree with that
 you'd think it would carry mostly religious
  he may never have  all those motor skills back
 it was also extremely difficult to stay awake sometimes because there was so many witnesses
 right
 i think that's really important
 oh
 our community doesn't really have any organized recycling drive
 uh-huh
 there is a lot of crime
 i was born in new mexico
 it's a little more understandable under the circumstances i guess
 i have a four year old and a three year old
 no
 i think we realize it's failed
 okay
 wow
 sure
 yes
 okay
 yeah
 did not know that
 ten
 
 uh-huh
 yes
 yeah
 or is it like
 he is in the navy
 it is
 okay
  yeah 
 we like them around
 sure
 yeah
 yeah
 i hope to get up there
  some of the scuds 
 
  just started shooting people 
 i think so too
 
 
 yeah
 they use freon twenty-two in air conditioning systems in houses and the like and heat pumps
 i don't have a headache any more
 even i would kind of like to go
 yeah
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 reba mcintire is a little too country for me
 we've got methadone programs where people who desperately want to get off drugs can't  get onto the program 
 it's wonderful
 
 we've only been in i think it's science place two
 you have pets i understand a couple of them
 no shirt or anything
 i think twenty thirty years ago a lot of women
 oh
 right
 uh-huh
 in my day we talked quietly behind our hands about people that we suspected might be
 he says i'm following the orders of my president
 i think it
 that's right
 oh
  yeah 
 uh-huh
 
  yeah 
 right
 it was a cadillac
 
 uh-huh
 i
 i had two cars there for a while
 yeah
 what kind
 
 what
 right
 huh-uh
 uh-huh
 absolutely
 uh-huh
 we didn't have to go with sleeping bags
 yeah
 
 that
 yeah
 right
 yeah
 yeah
 nursing is
 that
 uh-huh
 are you familiar with that
 they're really happy that i don't cook anymore
 uh-huh
  usually if you  can find somebody
 okay
 my god i think it would be next year is what i'd read
 
 television sure makes child rearing easy on you
 it's too cold
 i stayed
 i love seafood
 that one kid that becca likes he has aids
 i guess the first time i played golf has been probably about eight or ten years ago now when i was in college
 i think we put too much on politicians
 right
 isn't  that funny
 pretty good
 you know
 no
 i like his movies
 my husband went to is in graduate school actually right now
 right
 uh-huh
 pork barrel politics
 you had to come home and  clean before you could  even do anything probably
 yeah
 that's right
 i may
 it is it is
 that's what she plans to do
 right
 it is
 i am actually a junior
 uh-huh
 i lived
 uh-huh
 that's right
 yes
  yeah
 she got about two thousand dollars worth
 yeah
 i am one of those crazy people that reads the directions
 yeah
 it didn't sound
 are you there
 uh-huh
 yeah
 it's god's country
 social lives and so forth
  i was  in toledo last summer
 ye-
 exactly
 yeah
 uh-huh
 it's not a lot
 i'm five three
 it's beautiful
 
 and glass
 right
 i know two of my daughters had to have that
  right 
 
 yeah
 yeah
 
 yeah
  
 not too far away
 okay
 need to teach them good values
 they're the ones that probably are paying the highest
 had watching them
 yeah
 oh
 type of deal
 n-
 that's what i remember from living up north is that you'd get everything set and then you'd have a frost
 i
 yes
 that'll encourage me to always go since i spent that much money
 
 uh-huh
 reverse that trend at that point
 oh
 i looked conser-
 e d s has eight years
 right
 sure
 when does it become detrimental to our family to the point that you have to consider that as opposed to considering her current circumstances
 uh-huh
 yeah
 
 
 i grew up about the same time you did
 look how young she is
  yeah 
 uh-huh
 i imagine
 right
 
 this is the neat thing about the place we ended up at
  right 
 right
 
 uh-huh
 it was totally irr- 
 now there might be now
  
 i
 jim hart was playing
 start up
 okay
 yeah 
 they don't really pay a whole lot of attention to buffers
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
 they've got three daughters
 now they have gotten this wonderful idea of not taking out as much taxes
 isn't that bad
 i guess you could consider that a hobby
  yeah 
  children 
 
 ready to go
 yes
 the headlines on the news or whatever is someone says they found a cure for aids
 we're going to have a baby this summer
 we've gotten out a time or two on a rented basis
 yeah
 uh-huh
 oh yeah
 that's the bad thing there is that we spent so much money
 just from the heat of it all
 bye
 i see
 uh-huh
 i guess it'd be best if you knew each person and what they stood for and why and everything
 uh-huh
 you're almost looked down upon if you don't try to do all of these things
 uh-huh
 no
 i understand
 right
 
 uh-huh
 yeah
  altogether
 bye-bye
 i i think
  uh-huh 
 that's true
 everywhere you went there was sand
 i work at n c n b now
 you always have the lack of funds
 ford products
 it really is
 it does indeed
 city water has chlorine in it
 yeah
 right
 that is hard
 that's what we're doing
 uh-huh
 sure
 
 right
 i've
 yeah
 you lost an investment
 i think at t i it took five years
 okay
 what a dead place
 
 is he still around
 i'd like to go just sight see a little bit sometime
  yeah 
 oh
 uh-huh
 i hope you have kids just like yourself
 yeah
 right yeah
 
 but they don't have
 you understand what i am saying
 my dad is a farmer
 i
 uh-huh
 i play a lot of racquetball
 okay
 right
 i know
 my grand mamma died a couple of years ago so but he's you know
 there's a lot of things that they don't do in school anymore
 uh-huh
 the judicial system is aimed at the citizens
 it's a euphonium
   yeah
 it is for me
 i don't
 uh-huh
 yeah
 life is to interesting to read fiction
 yeah
 no
 uh
 yeah
 i've talked to
  uh-huh 
 they had five or six servants you know and and a lot of expensive uh holdings and all that
 yes
 uh-huh
 ye-
  as mexicans
 uh-huh
 yeah
 you guys sure want to be out of range
  however you  come to that conclusion
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
 yeah
 it's like let's see if we can get her to run up her bills
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 
 do you know anything about  that 
 i don't work at t i
 great
 to give it  a little more body 
 if it's life and a day then he's not eligible for parole
 i won-
 of history
 it was
 i went
 was i supposed to do something
 to a parent
 yeah
 it's a good experience
 we're in a recession here
  we've never  even seen that
 uh-huh
 
 you want to be around for the crisis and things like that
 oh
 right
 yeah
 uh-huh
 go ahead
 this was when the peace corps first are started
 uh-huh
 yeah
 drove it right to the shop
 right
 okay
 now a friend of mine who was studying social work here in philadelphia worked for an adult day care program for mostly for patient's with alzheimer
 like some member of the family gets the flu or whatever
 i just get aggravated about it
 we just couldn't leave without it
  uh-huh 
 telephone pioneers of america
 maybe they're burnt out or
 we're tired of doing it though
 have you just started doing this
  no
 it was terrible
 i never heard   
 exactly
 nowhere near that expensive
 huh
 yes
 uh-huh
 
 yeah
 you probably have nice big pine
 but uh
 uh-huh
 i see
 i might just donate my little one to the scout troop and let them
 white
  yeah 
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 no
 
 it sounds like we've covered all the bases
 and it you know
 
 what do you think about that
 no
 yeah
 right
 tried to get fondue and white wine
 yeah
 yeah
 do you have friends there
  that sounds good 
 
 yeah
 she's a
  yeah 
 boy
 uh-huh
 we've been sort of opera fans for a few years now
 you hate to  get rid of it because you know how much you spent on them
 yeah
 yeah
 i don't do any drugs
 
 uh-huh
 i just took grades one through six
 uh-huh
 i enjoyed talking to you
 seriously
 in education
 i see
 are you involved in the legal system at all
 yeah
 already
 it's not bad yeah
  bye 
 they get so heavy they kind of weigh it down
   i guess this is what you call a natural end
 so many people are moving back into those old houses and are restoring them
 that's right
 my goodness
 i am sort of rereading it
 okay
 no
 
 because it seems uh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 it was made back in the early sixties
 uh-huh
  i'm with  the f b i
 okay
 one was still in diapers when i started baby-sitting
 absolutely
 that's discouraging if you own property

 and she'd been
 obstinate
 that's it
 i just read one about grace kelley
 well the oth- the other instance i think of their inability to to handle things the cholera
 
 houston
 uh-huh
  how   about that 
 regardless of the racial makeup
 okay
 uh-huh
  people just 
  uh-huh 
 is it
 some kids are really having it
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 it's not getting any better

 my goodness
 right
 if you want to play tennis or racquetball

 but
 i had very flexible hours

 um
 it sounds wonderful
 i just tell the credit card company don't pay the charge
 so it was it was you know the best
 uh-huh
 no
   that could be 
 yeah
 uh-huh
 i don't blame you not nowadays

 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
  going to 
 she's gorgeous
 uh-huh
 slow down a little bit
 
 they stay up until all hours of the night
 i'm pretty sure he was this past season
 so it's it's always nice to see people that like each other
  uh-huh 
 you may get a cold snap or two or some rain or something like we've been getting in december
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 i was cau-
 right
 is it
 in dallas yet
  it's time to  replace it
 uh-huh
 something my husband
 you're right
 yes
 
 that's a good point
 right
 i'm in a book club
 i never did that
 shrivels up and dies
 it's called the christian music station or something like that
 huh-uh
 uh-huh
 yeah
  yeah 
 they've got sixty or so of iraq's planes
 you've got to see it especially since you have a german
 even the bench warmer i would
 which is everybody that i know
  the take 
 the golden delicious were fantastic this year
 
 right
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 you work for five six seven
 i've never been to texas
 wayne's world hey man
 i haven't been to mexico or canada or

 or something
 i'll have to keep that in mind
 how many kids do you have
  right 
 yeah
 they were just pressed aluminum
 i know
 oh
 do you exercise a lot
 it's a special occasion
 it does
 not yet at all
 that's great
 the thing about when it gets hot here is i don't like the humidity
 yes
  bye now 
 right
 uh-huh
 stupid
 green
 not right now
  yeah 
 which ones
 oh
 yeah
 yeah
 right
 the only gripe i have is performance
 it was very very difficult
 uh-huh
 i don't have any friends that have the disease
 i i
 i'm sure there's a lot of people that have had
 yeah
 uh-huh
 you talked about thanksgiving there are interesting meals at different times
 
 let's talk about the baby
 that would be even
 i'm not real familiar with that
 yeah
 yeah
  oh 
 okay
 right
 right
 yeah
 neither one of us do
 that same house here would probably cost three-quarters of a million dollars
 uh-huh
 i know
 they don't take any stands on anything
 uh-huh
 what
 
 you too
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 i
 yeah
 all he saw was my hair
 now they go to a state college
 yeah
 i don't know
 yeah
 i felt like we roughed it then
 yeah
 
  i 
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 that's for sure
 they just totally wrote it off their book
 yeah
 i agree
 use different words instead i think
 
 okay
 i know a woman who's just wonderful at that
 that is true
  we- 
 well i agree with the boredom of the election process
  right 
 yeah
  by  the thought that i have to support
 oh
 it's a crystal
 okay
 and uh you know i- i was amazed cause i'd pick up a local paper and i'd read about all of these you know really interesting things going on
 that's what i would do too
 
 okay
 good luck in your car hunting
 it didn't show me anything
 put a little bitty portable computer in there and a plasma display
 uh-huh
 no
 uh-huh
 you too
 do you all just sort of chip in and help out with stuff when you are there
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 right
 you've been to the city
 
  nay
 yeah
 yeah
 
 excuse me
 she was my favorite character on there
 uh-huh
 that's true
 my husband wants to go into medical school and be a neurosurgeon
 uh-huh
 yes
 yeah
 uh-huh
 yeah
 debates would come up up there in massachusetts and you know in that area over uh air pollution
 uh-huh
 right
 yes
 exactly
 if it was it would probably have to be a pattern
 not this bill
 yes
 uh-huh
  i think so 
 uh-huh
 yeah
 really
 every morning
 how high are the taxes going to be when my children are my age
 she said it's getting too big for us to take care of
  too much of a  difference
 yeah
 we just went ahead and laid them down
 yeah
 they could go visit them during the day
 i was just saying that way
 uh-huh
 everything had a little bit of curry in it
 you are very very much aware of what goes on
 i
 i watched all three games of that
 he doesn't really like mine let alone another one
 nice talking to you
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 really
 uh-huh
 yeah
 
 yeah
 in denver
 yeah
 it's hard to know what the good movies are anymore
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 it's very successful for some of
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 they say
 when you're too old to do anything else go play golf
 
  on his 
 that's what i heard
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 if you get junk mail on a regular basis from any particular company you can
 how
 uh-huh
 that's what i've heard yeah
 yes
 yeah
 i'm real
 that's right
 yes
 uh-huh
 yeah
 that's right
  i don't know
 how about you
 have you painted anything recently
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 you just
 you kind of
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
 i guess if i did maybe i would
 uh-huh
 see
 i voted absentee one year
 most really care in this center really care
 who's going to pay for mine
 give an incentive
 we stayed right on the same track with each other
 they not only give me a demonstrator but the hardware as well as the software
  uh-huh 
 uh-huh
  it's a  hard question
 really
 lawn mower broke
 we both have older cars
   i went to metropolitan a couple of years ago
 uh-huh
 it's kind of scary
 oh
 
 did you read tom clancy's a clear and present danger
 
 she always lived here in the south
 that would be wonderful
 yeah
 i don't know who that guy is
 
 yeah
 right
 if enough of the public
 yeah
 yeah
 you have a good day
 i
 who do you think
 uh-huh
 yeah
  uh-huh 
 yeah
 one place i think i didn't take her
 right
 i can go ahead and start
 they had a free day  at kindercare 
 both my mother's parents and my father's parents were immigrants
 no
 uh-huh
 but not
 you almost have
 yeah
 it can be very educational
 uh-huh
 he learns from the older boys too
 you just have to go once a year
 uh-huh
 i am
 they couldn't put anything in it hardly
 
 the only trouble is that you can afford to go anywhere
 yeah
 uh-huh
   so much more to learn now that it really makes it more difficult i would think
 yeah
 that's exactly the kind of thing i would have said
 uh-huh
 they really impress me
 that by doing that we'll be free
 yeah
 i don't think they're in a conspiracy
 that you'd heard or that you owned an album of
 yeah
 rather than a home
 uh-huh
 what is that sound
 uh-huh
  what  is your problem
 it was really very official
 you know at least you get out of here at three
 marvelous
 uh-huh
 purple buddy
 yeah
 i still watch cartoons sometimes every once in a while
 yeah
 yes
 okay
 everything here
 it took that long
 yeah
 generally then i dress you know nicer
 yeah
 organizations to do
 it might be advantageous to do that
 yeah
 i guess i'd would like to see somebody like yeltsin to get more power
 i think we ought to worry about our own species
 a big le baron
 right
 paper just seems so innocuous
 yeah
 yeah
 no
 they're kind of low to the ground after driving the explorer
 it
  yeah
 yeah
 i think that's where they hit most of us
 ooh you took on a
 right
 i have
 and you got to have it
 uh-huh
 to minnesota
 oh
 huh-uh
 they're
 yeah 
 isn't that interesting
 
 yeah
 yes
 we put them out for people
 walk down the street and
 it sure is
 right
 my immediate reaction is that it's some sort of strange phone message
 that's right
 matter of fact if anything she's worse
 they really are
 yeah
 oh
 right
 what
 so
 yeah
 but we're still experiencing a very uneven
 what is it
 yeah
 yeah
 
 that's just great
 uh-huh
 yes
 yeah
 i hardly drive
 after it came out
 oh
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 do you think most states have that
 uh-huh
 depend
 oh
 sensors and things like that
 in new hampshire
 oh
  right 
 
  okay
 uh-huh
 i didn't realize it would melt so easily
 there's so many different ways to catch fish
 sure 
 pets get like that don't they 
 i think it worked out very very well
 there you go
 yeah
 uh-huh
 cold or something
 that was another funny thing
 right
  it's just so well done
 yeah
 that just bugs me to death
 yeah
 there's a little more craziness down there
 i said a few things to him when i got home
 do you
 yeah
 yeah
  yeah 
 oh
 yeah
 it's going to be a short conversation because i agree with you
 it certainly does
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 right
 so do we
 uh-huh
 gosh
  i wish i were dealing with baudelaire 
 boy i have  to hunt them down
 the drug problem that's another one
 you can tell
 ye-
 absolutely
 
 is that what you're saying
 with
  uh-huh 
 no
 uh-huh
 it's more spirited  
 that's an excellent movie
 some i guess like
 i'm a student
 it is
 uh-huh
 yep
 uh-huh
 you did that recently too uh
 huh
 it's a sad story
 i'm for anything that cleans up the air or the water or or or anything
 mister mom
 uh-huh
 yeah
 but i think the hardest thing to do is whenever you've got a person who's mentally very alert and active and their body just hasn't kept up with them and i think that's in a way it's more some an area where some of the day care uh
 right
 grass
 yeah
 it was a le baron with everything on it
 
 and and just very happy to get that
 
 they definitely do
 what can they do about the oil burning over in kuwait
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 i'm a summer person i like the heat
 they're usually more afraid of you than you are of them usually
 uh-huh
  right 
 it's true
 uh-huh
  uh-huh 
 it's really ridiculous
  uh-huh 
 
 uh-huh
 if you'll take lessons the first thing they put in your hand is an iron
 now they're down into the hundreds nineties
 it was horrible
 yeah
 okay
 oh
 yeah
 but it took our total time
 yeah
 i've
 huh-uh
 yeah
  a  difference
 right
 i think it's going to
 uh-huh
 no
 uh-huh
 sure
 i know
 uh-huh
 that's sort of like what truman had
 that's very true
 i thought that was a real unusual thing
 simple as that
 it's one thing to send grass there
 exactly
 it's completely trivial to for instance listen in on someone's car phone or walk around phone since they're just radio signals
 uh-huh
 that's okay
  magic 
 
 
 people donate more money
 she knows something right that she  
 have you been sailing
 yeah
 yeah
 we have that here too
 it's beautiful
 i work for t i
 my wife and i feel that we never have a moment that we can call our own
 you're not kidding
 yeah
 yeah
  bye-bye 
 it's too
 you
  uh-huh
 i know
 uh-huh
 i don't know
 an
 yeah
 
 right
 yeah
 and and c- came  
 our house is kind of on a little hill
 where did you go to school
 yeah
 you know
 agreed
 sure
 yeah
 she thinks it's wonderful
  you're  going to have on extra expenses for car
 is that how they do it at t i maybe
 okay
 uh-huh
 usually in the week i'm  
 yeah
 yes
 yeah
 right yeah
 it was fairly expensive though
 they were very good
 yeah
 that's
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 me too
 yeah
 my next oldest daughter that's in college in california is a world twirling champion
 uh-huh
 really
 that sounds good
 personally
 like when you're in a bad part of italy or something
 
 it's when
 i don't live in a house
 
 i grew up in oak cliff
 uh-huh
 that didn't last long  
 she had to label everything
 what would happen if the   required young people to do service to the country
 yeah
 yeah
 which was a chocolate sack
 we just have the basic right now
 good
 i'll probably talk to you again
 yeah
 
 yeah
 do you do a lot of camping
  then the only advise passed  down is don't go to georgia tech
 i agree
 good
 it all depends on what i'm fishing for and the time of day
 yeah
 i don't know now
 yeah
 you can
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 of course it wasn't sunny like it is here
 right
 what do you have
 this isn't for me
 yeah
 i know
 yeah
 
 yeah
 are full and there is nowhere else to put our garbage
 i don't either
 wow
 do you have any children
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 huh
 uh-huh
 yeah
 i like people like neil diamond and
 what about you
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 it's lazy
 yeah
 maybe they gave up that right when they committed the crimes
 uh-huh
 what was that
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 um there's a large minority population
 they were fourteen pounds and
 uh-huh
 that's right
 sorry about my mind
 they do
 it takes a lot of training and a lot of abuse to get a dog to really  respond 
 uh-huh
 i would love to
 uh-huh
 different times
 
 
 i saw on one of the talk shows this woman judge i believe from florida
 oh well actually yes
  uh-huh 
 it's it's the uh ongoing acid rain problem
 yes
 we-
 i guess so
 yeah
 the thing that worries me about that is that if you just raise salaries across the board you're going to be
 right
 yes
 uh-huh
 
 yeah
 okay
 
 i thought he was great
  yeah
 more so supported them when they got home
 he ought to be able to perform
 many more deaths have occurred in and dealing with coal plants then ever around nuclear plants
 i see
 as a crime free zone any longer
 but it seems to be getting worse and worse
 you won't even
 yeah
 yeah
 that's a
 oh
 that's about all i have
 you will not pay your bill at the end of the month
  right 
 one of these twelve by forty-eight's that got repoed
 they've been there eight years
 i work for  n i s t 
 
 okay
 no
 uh-huh
 their room and board
 some evenings are worse than others
 right
 yeah
 no earthly idea
 joe pros
 just because of exactly what you said
 uh-huh
 i really can't get into that
 i just bought a car
 i just don't see the designer's
 no
 uh-huh
 i don't know
  yeah 
 they're people who farm on the hillside and then leave the hillside to another hillside and farm on that hillside
 it's fairly easy and fast
 yeah
 because we have to go down uh once a year here in maryland and get out car's exhaust systems checked for emission content
 
 right
 yeah
  i don't know 
   temporary
 i don't know
 you don't have to put it down
 uh-huh
 yeah
  i have been just  so happy
 i don't know
 oh
 he tried to make bagels one time
 uh-huh
 
 depends on what you consider expensive
 there's too many lawsuits
 are we picking him up every saturday
 exactly
 do you like to make your own guacamole
 yeah
 boy he's a big one
 have you
 uh-huh
 yeah
 people would always bring them when they go to the countries
 oh
 yeah
 okay
 like you say you bowl
 yeah
 uh-huh
 i'm not sure how we get that
 we couldn't find a place to camp
 i see what you're saying
 right
 i got one at work that i bought for one of the guys there at work
 yeah
 in the summers
 right
 boy i tell you
 rugby is definitely big in college
 yeah
 he might see it one day
 that's true
 yes
 do you have the overcrowding in your prisons that we are facing down here
 yeah
 that's right
 yeah
 i had rather do other things
 coronary cholesterol and chlorine
 hold on one second
  uh-huh 
 
 i didn't realize that there were groups that go in like that
 life is  so much more enjoyable
 
  bye-bye 
 yeah
 it just really gets way
 major
 okay
 they withhold what they're supposed to and at the end of the year it's not enough
 huh
 i know
 
 you do it
 okay
 they just don't care
 i don't want to go there
 i sure don't
 right
 it's a scream
 i appreciate it
 or something like that
 just about any kind of music
 uh we've got
 right
 quantum leap
 yeah
 it's more high tech
 uh-huh
 she'd much rather be here with me
  i think so too 
 
 he may uh-huh
 oh
 uh-huh
 yeah
 is that right
 last weekend we went to six flags saturday
 okay
 uh-huh
 be-
 i just i think it's a bigger risk than
 you could take a little longer  and  just watch a little bit more i guess
 
 they're dealt with
 he didn't have a problem with reading
 yeah
 really
 it is interesting
 that sounds good
 uh-huh
 
 no
 yeah
 yeah
 in the salt water
  i've  got some onions out
 and i d- drive uh
 yeah
 i'll bet
 right
 i just like willie nelson i guess because he's such a character
 i'm a graduate student
 it's real easy to get isolated in your own little community
 i don't want to have to mess with it
 i'm wondering with the boom down here
 where do you live
 that's correct
 yeah
  in politics 
 uh the causes of crime
 
 it really is
 
 uh-huh
 i'd like to start sewing again
 my goodness
 sure
 all things being equal yes
 i have friends that pay about nine hundred dollars for a town house in
 those people that i know
 i really like
 uh-huh
 
 uh-huh
 right
 yeah
 
 the numbers
 uh-huh
 there has been so much work done already
 right
 why don't you start
 uh-huh
 okay
 let's see
 yeah
 when did you first come to texas
 it makes it so much lighter
 uh-huh
 i'm doing fine
 yes
 everybody should be able to have surgeries that will save their lives or things that will make their life more comfortable verses than just the rich people that can afford to pay or to work for corporations that have wonderful health benefits
 my grandparents and all my relatives are from wisconsin
 my friend had a v w rabbit
 uh-huh
 
 i've heard too many people say i hate it here
  yeah
 yeah
 right
 that's true
 right
 or what you read
 it's too late then
 yeah
 is that true
 a nifty idea
 by the  campsite it's so
 no
 but we just talked a lot
 that's right
  to worry about it 
 those milk cartons take up so much room
 uh-huh
 she was in the house
 you've got to work for a living
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 do forestry work
 uh cause they clean the uh the lenses for cameras
 because they're boring
 no
 they do intimidate
 uh-huh
 you feel invigorated
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 seems that way yeah
 that's true
 yeah
 yeah
 used to go on
 well i know of number of people that are in the in the uh school district an- down in in uh san antonio
 yeah
 yeah
 sounds good
 uh-huh
 that's possible
 they
 yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 yeah
 i don't know what that is
 that's the one i was thinking of
 we wanted it to be as authentic as possible
 huh
 if you're going to go to a college where student faculty ratio is three and four hundred to one i don't think you're going to have as meaningful of a college experience as if you're down to the thirty to forty to one
 yeah
 it was interesting
 okay
 they love to play with kids
 yeah
 bye-bye
 yeah
 we managed to get to one
 uh-huh
 yes
 it
 you take a look at the output at the same time
  no 
 we are
 no
 too bad the mavericks couldn't get him
 yeah
 yes
 that is right
 we like that
 what branch were you in
 yes
 really
 it's really sad
 uh-huh
 right
 yeah
 uh-huh
 right
 do we get enough news or something like  that 
 that's right
 right
  uh-huh 
  yeah
 uh-huh
 and fievel goes west
 what
 for about four weeks
 yeah
 okay
 does he
 yeah
 yeah
 our house in castroville was the first one too
 some years back
 i don't know why
 yeah
 sure
  yeah 
 i'm just taking the other side so we'll have a discussion here
 yeah
 really
 i don't think it had to do to with woman running against man
 how has it been this week for you
 yeah
 there are some smart ones out there
 that's right
 i've never been past ohio
 and yet there's
 uh-huh
 huh-uh
 i know they asked in the topic for ideas on how to control crime
 and she'll be wearing my clothes
 uh-huh
  bye
 i don't
 that's true
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 i
 yeah
 course they keep saying the weather's going to change and we're going to have more florida type weather up here
 yeah
  uh-huh 
 management
 
 good good prices good good food there
 yeah
 indeed i found myself restricting my viewing to a couple of hours a day one in the morning and one in the evening
 uh-huh
 i hear of one every now and then
 yeah
 yes
 yeah
 yeah
 
 they're about three hours away if you go due north
 i'll fix the porch up with pumpkins for halloween and christmas
 
  have  you done anything like that
 yeah
 right
 yeah
 that's changing
 there's
 plano
 what ages are they
 yeah
 i guess that's it
 i did the dance step when i lived up in michigan
 that's right
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 where we are not allowed to
 
 it was
 yeah
  uh-huh 
 yeah
 i do that also
 the
 yes he is
 
 yeah
  yeah
 it was really nice
 yeah
 i grew up in michigan
  yeah 
 yeah
 what would we like to say
 that one
  yeah 
 uh-huh
 so you listen to kind of church music gospel
 i don't know what he's going to be in austin
 uh-huh
 yeah
 this is pretty well where l b j and audelia skillman cross
 which is i think what they also don't know
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 they have done a beautiful job
 some of them in the penal system
 right
 i read that half where she was in her later years
 didn't you
 that will go down and come up easily
  wow 
 because they're enclosed
 i don't believe in hunting
 to commute to work
 uh-huh
  uh-huh 
 me too
 that must be tough
 
 we're from the north
 i've been on a few juries
 yeah
 most of the area where we live in most of the kids have cars
 yeah
 right
 die
 i get tired of newspaper littering the garage
 
 i don't know what new york does about theirs
 yeah
 yes
 which has made us as lot more stable
 
 yeah
 right
 i don't know how else to explain it
 but uh then don't
 yeah
 i think
 uh-huh
 i was trying to get my children quiet for a minute
 yeah
 i don't think there's very much of a threat there today
 someone could be sentenced to thirty-five years
 yeah
 
 have i
 i have a younger daughter now
 it really was
 they had left her on the bus closed up all afternoon
 it's not quite that simple
 i read the wall street journal
 uh-huh
 
 we're supposed to talk about lawn and garden
 right
  down there 
 yeah
 then we decided to have kids
 that's really true
 yeah
  and  parking it and sitting inside and watching t v
 blacksburg
 he didn't apply to any school further
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 that's because he's probably doing what i do worrying about
 i think our five minutes is about up anyhow
 i've never done that one before
 yeah
 yeah
 very much
 
  yeah 
 that's right
 looking for arrowheads and
 how do you feel
 it's just like a sesame street
 i can't complain about it because i haven't used it
 yes
 
 that's your weekend
 i guess we're  the same age then
 yeah
 
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 yeah
 because i didn't take it in right away and let a whole year go by
 i really was surprised when it ended so quickly
 
 right
 that's true
 it sure is
 no
 wow
 yeah
 me too
  yeah 
 uh-huh
 do you have brothers
 that's true
 right
 so uh
  uh-huh 
 yeah

 bye-bye
 yeah
 that's really about it
   really
 she doesn't mind when we cover up her eyes
 where do you live
  
 a-
 i think they're looking after their own self preservation more than they're actually looking after the good of the country
 
 yeah
 oh
 uh-huh
 yeah
 that's right
 and so the drain on the family
 you don't see things thrown away
 yeah
 that's pretty neat

 yeah
 thanks
 yeah
 i see
 uh-huh
 that's the
 finance
 that's what you're saying
 yeah
 i don't think it's something that people really think about either
 
 it'll be comfortable
 uh-huh
 some sort of program or
 uh-huh
 they weren't like any of the mexican american or black people i had gone to school with
 uh-huh
 bye bye
 yeah
 yes
 really
 i don't know whether uh you classify the skylark and the calais as
 still need a little bit of space
 me
 that's great
 i think i look better
 i know
  which  i would like to see rather than so many kids getting out of school
 i
 they liked it
 oh
 i have never played in any tournament except just a scramble
 yeah
 yes
 uh-huh
 yeah
 we camp year round
 do you know
 exactly
 
 i like that kind of stuff
 we- because i she loves she's one of those that loves th- outside
 yeah
 
 um
 uh-huh
 let's see
 yeah
 yeah
 i don't think that many by the builder that built this house
   sure  
 uh-huh
 yes
 yeah
 the last one was back down to lubbock texas
 uh-huh
 wow
 i tried the news magazines like time newsweek u s news and world report
 people are too different
 no
 it's fun
 how long does it keep
 i can't
 i measured it one time
 which she doesn't allow them to watch the soapies
 
 uh-huh
 yeah
 i was smarter than most of the people that i was working for
 i'm a former t i-er
 yeah
 radio
 uh-huh
 yeah
 sure
 is all we paid for cars in those days
  okay 
 no
 that's frightening too
 uh-huh
  i get  through
 right
 yeah
 
 right
 sure
 right
 
 yeah
 i know
  that's 
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 right
 but uh
 about the last thing i did
 
 we live out in the country
 instead of
 yeah
 sure
 you essentially need to have someone taking care of the person full-time
 yeah
 you did it manually
 it really would
 for the dorm
 yeah
 hundred miles due east of here
 has affected you personally
 isn't it amazing that somebody can write that many books
 it seems like you could see it through about three layers of paint
 yeah
 have you been down there
 i read usually that kind of stuff
 it's just
 yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
  nobody talks about it 
 yeah
 where are you from in california
 no
 that's real important to little kids
 yeah
 i had to cut some of the sides down
 uh-huh
 where do you work
 they're real good
 yeah
 it's very pleasant
 
 and they take their girls
 it can get very expensive
 yeah
  something new 
 right
 
 uh-huh
 and i said no somebody
 was it hard when you first came
 uh-huh
 it has taken on a more profound
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 upstate new york
 that's right
 huh-uh
 
 yeah
 i don't recall that they have any female anchors
 to the heat
 yes
 uh-huh
 to be able to use it or a day during the week or something
 right
 i have got to hit it
 uh-huh
 you know what i mean
 really
  i know how that goes 
 yeah
 nowadays with the way the income tax i think housing is strictly to itemize
 are you a t i
 no
 some danielle steel
 how far west have you been
 i don't think so
 yeah
 exactly
 it's a big problem
 uh-huh
 i was a photographer before
 wow
 yeah
 yeah
  you've got to
 yeah
 
  because we're  both originally from this part of the country
 speaking of that i think terminator two is supposed to be out
 you
 uh-huh
 
 uh-huh
 something sweet
 i never made one for myself though
 yeah
 
 yeah
 here we go
 come in handy
 congress woman
 yeah
 uh-huh
 
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 
 it's one of the few times i wanted more news than
  huh 
 right
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 i am
 don't answer your phone hello
 i guess
 i hope you know more about it than i do
 uh-huh
 first thing i did was turn the tv on
 uh-huh
 hey listen if i had my way i wouldn't pay my taxes
 uh-huh
 yeah
 oh
 this is betty
 is it
 it's taken a long time to break away
 he had to redo that too
 they are in there but they are real spooky
 i think that's difficult on them
 uh-huh
 yeah
 right
  i
 oh
 oh
 how about you
 yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 i don't even know who won the pennant last year
 
 uh-huh
 what do you do there
 do you wish you
 yeah
 yeah
 no
 i don't even know the name of the river there
 
 that is such a nice thing
 there's nothing wrong with that
 bring it home and
 within our family we have said
 
 you do
 as well as a lot of the explosives we were running into
 i check the scores the next morning
 yeah 
 uh-huh
 and and for campaign that's it
 right
 uh-huh
 i can't think of what school he went to
 it's just when you
 i guess that's when it was
 you never think about that do you
 uh-huh
 i think if i had to come home and then go somewhere i'd never make it
 kind of like the cowboys
 are you familiar with it
 sure
 uh-huh
 i tend to eat expensive food
 they're cute
 big boom
 it's very sophisticated
 uh-huh
  yeah 
 i used to watch
 yeah
  yeah 
 that's neat isn't it
  yep 
  uh-huh 
 oh
 and uh it it was prev- she she did pretty well
 i mean you know if i was setting up a daycare there would be so many needs you would have to customize your service to
 yeah
 uh-huh
 lot of places have tho-
 yeah
 they'd be ready to vote 
 why not
 you need metal instead of plastic
 yeah
 yes
 the school thing might be changing
 oh okay
 i guess i'm the one just supporting most of the others
 i wish i did
 yeah
 getting to see the same women every morning
 yeah
 uh-huh
 called gondolas
 there's less of a sense of privacy
 yeah
 yeah
 we could not find anything that had any kind of redeeming value in it
 i would say no
 right
 yeah
 public school
 right
 yet your absolutely right
 right
  good talking to you 
 it's
 yeah
 i don't know
 uh-huh
  stuff up 
 it was kind of sad
 yeah
 yeah
 
 no
 uh-huh
 there okay
 i think that it's time that we concentrate more on what's going on within our own borders than what's going on in the middle east
 yeah
 yeah
 it was it was the funniest thing
 are you a bible fan too
 that would be my answer of an easy way to get these guys out of there for twenty years
 what's amazing is some of them have been on death row for a number of years
 i've never
 kind of cuts your possibilities for the flower beds
 yeah
 yeah
 i can't remember exactly what it was
  uh-huh 
 
 they're really trying to get you into that situation because they know they've really got you then
 uh-huh
 yeah
 those are fascinating to me
 
 it doesn't
 it's just
 yeah
 yeah
  yeah 
 she never really had a chance to work
 i enjoy them to a degree
 yes
 if him and his wife weren't getting along
 uh-huh
 
 i know
 i guess i take it for granted kind of because i just
 they're testing that
 
 right
 yeah
 uh-huh
 bye
 oh
  it  is obvious
 uh our children are both uh basically adults
 right
     shock you
 that's their marketing
 uh-huh
 
 there's a couple now that i tend to want to watch
 uh-huh
 yeah
 that is right
 really
 right
 years ago it would have been fine
 it's free
 right
 he's a very considerate person
 yeah
 right
  is so much more serious then when we  were younger
 yes
 behind us
 oh
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 okay
 worked at a camp there
 okay
 okay
 those are real
 no
 the snow up here is really kind of starting to melt now
 right
 in fact it puts it out on tuesdays and thursdays
 you have a bonus
 yeah
 uh-huh
 do you
 tends to tends to strap only the legitimate people
 uh-huh
 all right
 i guess that would be good
 yeah
 yeah
 you can make laws against corruption
 uh-huh
 hi
 yeah
 you look very odd in the water
 yeah
 they keep on dying
 when i married i thought i'd be married the rest of my life
 
 right
 i think it would be that
 they are my favorite team too
 yeah
 sure
 he ended up with about three sets of tools in order to work on that fool thing
 gosh
 yeah
 hi
 for like groceries we say about this much per week
 my parents live in boston
 really
 uh-huh
 if i ever decide to tune it in again
 
 very much so
 they never
 so i'll be faced with having to return that product and uh hoping that uh you know that they will accept it
  yeah 
 no
  uh-huh 
 right
 not personally
  that is good 
 it's not going to be wholesale because of the cost
 that they make
 that's another one of my favorites
 
 no
 uh-huh
 bagels and lox
 uh-huh
 where they have to be working all the time
  uh-huh
 right
 uh-huh
  yeah
 that's   what i'm  saying
 right
   had-  
 i think you know i think in a lot of ways the law is good because it tries to to protect you know the people who are in the states
 that would be fun
 uh-huh
 we just recently moved to texas
 they never had some of the more fun classes i guess  
 yeah
 right
  yeah 
 uh-huh
 have to agree with you
 it is
 yeah
  uh-huh 
 they're even dark
 
 uh-huh

 yeah
 yeah
 really 
 they have some nice stuff down there
 we are seeing that here as well
  uh-huh

 uh-huh
 it's got three bedrooms going along one side and the living room and kitchen on the other
 i knit sometimes
 it's just hard to make yourself go
 
 about the weather
 yes
  uh-huh 
 there's no
 yeah
 uh buicks and chevrolets
 exactly
 do you have any other further comments
 what i find is that they're highly structured highly organized almost too rigid for the children if you bring a child in at a certain time
 do you hate your mother
 nothing seems quite as good
  yeah
 bye-bye
 here name is lori bird
 i think tha- mile a minute
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 i do plan my clothes a week in advance
 i just still have need for the four bedrooms just having company from time to time
 for each hole they win they get the money for it
 i don't know
 yeah
 
 yeah
 the the competition i- in a lot of ways is is wonderful just because you can choose your doctor
  yeah 
 uh-huh
 i have
 it's just like you say

 right
 uh-huh
 yeah
 what kind of things have you read

 what that's exactly what's happening in my family
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
 not really
 keep forgetting how big states are out there sometimes
 yeah
 yes
 uh-huh
 it is
 yes
 that's true
 uh-huh
 i grew up on him
 oh
 i've enjoyed it
 if he's got a knife or whatever that can throw it at you
 sometimes i come home from work
 yes
 it certainly is frightening
 uh-huh
 gosh
 yeah
 i'm real jealous when i hear that somebody has a grandma around because we don't
  girls  were there in the morning
 me too
 we haven't had to look very carefully for child care
  uh-huh 
 vociferously
 yep
 wow
 right
  that  do
 oh
 they just moved on
 yeah
 i didn't much care  for the first one
 we're talking about capital punishment
 and spare the economy
 i guess we should talk about giving advice though
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
  really don't  need to
 it's eight and a quarter i think
  yeah 
  no 
 everybody was watching c n n
 yeah
 yeah
 no
 sure
 yeah
 uh-huh
 yeah
 i've just received some
 where do you live
 it just goes straight in there
 that was the one place where i was also able to do weight training
 mostly oldsmobiles
 you know how that is
 i'm not that up on the policy of ways
 no matter where you were you stopped and sat down and watched it
 where you from 
 yeah
 there's nothing in it you don't know
 they get loans and grants and scholarships and stuff like that
 no
 yeah
 are you from boston
 yeah
 if you give up then you can come live in our country
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 why didn't it work last time
  yeah
 she would go her way
 we just try not to pay any more in than we have to
 and mostly just movies when there's a good movie on
 in what way
  when you have  fish au gratin
 bye
 i have
 i think it was romain drive or romain street or something there in los angeles
 uh-huh
  because  you can't wear them here
 yeah
 uh-huh
 you do not have to give a telephone number
 yeah
 throw them in the back
 they're real fat little white things
 yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 right
 i presume that i do
 i think that's a nice gesture on the kuwaiti government part to do that
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 i
 i know it
 right
 we've never really been rained on the few times we've gone
 uh-huh
 call them the new orleans ain'ts any more
 uh-huh
 high
 
 it puts   a whole in your money bag
 really
 
 yeah
 yeah
 what about you
 i was so irritated
 and we read in the newspaper southern part of texas i guess flooded out
 our son-in-law is from panama
 exactly
 exactly
 i just had a baby
 i think it's a hundred years
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 i had my school do it
 right
 i didn't say that
 i'm satisfied with the vacation
 i can't hear them
 our last daughter she did not want to go to school
 absolutely
  yeah 
 my husband is a hunter fisherman outdoorsman marlboro type person who had to have a sporting dog
 yeah
 right
 yeah
 right
 uh-huh
  you do it 
 i certainly don't remember my parents running me here and there and supporting me in all these things
 i'm willing to pay for that for my children
 yeah
 there's nowhere that you can go that you would have to be afraid
 yeah
 yeah
 
 certainly
  what does he charge me 
 type of thing
 i would think so if you only have one bathroom for three bedrooms
 yeah
 great nancy
 i don't know what my kids see any more
 uh-huh
 i saw that
 uh-huh
 okay
 but i do know of a way to get around the computer generated calls
 right
 i know what you mean
 i don't think there's been a magazine as they used to be even good housekeeping i don't
 
 yeah
 uh-huh
  right 
 his medical through his company
 i can't remember what the name of them   are either
 that sucks
 uh-huh
 she doesn't believe in the woman working unless she has to
 i didn't happen to see that
 oh uh
 
 yeah
 i know
 right
 i
 at no charge for a whole year that you will use it
 
 and my husband is a little bit of a male chauvinist
 i know there's not any food that you can get
 one of my favorite movies it's not one that i haven't seen
 yeah
 that's the word float
  yeah 
 uh-huh
 yeah
 i had one
 what's your view
 how far can you go with that one
 they've got a lot of special needs
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 sure
 it must be in
 i'm originally from oklahoma
  yeah
 uh-huh
 yes
 yeah
 i think we have too
 
  is that right 
 we do as a matter of fact
 you bet
 yeah
 uh-huh
 i am not a member of the national rifle association
 no
 they're twins born on the bicentennial
 it's a pretty nice neighborhood
 my husband would like to live there
 uh-huh
  uh-huh 
 roast marshmallows
 me too
 that's a good feeling
 uh-huh
 my children i have five children
 yeah
  because  i know she's going to have to face that
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 okay
 what color is your dog
  yeah 
 right
 you just felt gee if i weren't here
 
 i think we're lucky to have as good a coverage as we have i really do
 uh-huh
 one of these days we'll get down there although
 yes
 yeah
 we got that
 oh
 they ought to make them very reasonably  do something  outrageous to them
 he had a blue one before
 yeah
 yeah
 nice talking to you linda
 i know
 now i know another reason why i'm not going to get a c d player for a while
 yeah
 bye-bye
 that's true
 i think you could recover from a pistol but not from a shotgun
 i work for the government in washington
  uh-huh 
 wow
 you just
 that's a good size fish
 
 uh-huh
 yeah
 every year
 i'm fascinated by that
 most of the time
 and one thing she's trying to instill in kids um besides just reading and writing are just some the golden rules
 can you tell much difference between the local radio t v stations
 where'd you get the car
  his life  isn't worth very much then
 which most of them probably aren't
 uh-huh
 it's like they were using them as friends when we were having the conflict
 what's that
 yeah
 yeah
 okay
 i don't know
 sure
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
 knowing
 no
 let's see
 that's right
 i hate the eight and a half percent sales tax
  deed  for deed that
 they really ought to change the name i think in indianapolis
 they are
 that's one of the worst
 just more facts would be nice
 yeah
 i don't think they can
  uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 right
  right 
 i didn't like the way it ended though
 
 right
 sure
 uh-huh
 
 uh-huh
 yeah
 i think  that's  generally speaking pretty true
 although it is not killing that many people now it still has the opportunity to get out of control and become a huge problem
 who's going to come and build me a fence too
 oh
 i would say about ten or fifteen years ago i
 yeah
 yeah
 okay
 have you read that
 i think so too
 really
 i went to europe nineteen seventy-three
 yeah

 uh-huh
 and and tell your wife i hope we i get her again sometime too
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 yeah
 that's about it
 i don't think i've read it
 yeah
 sometimes i think they carry it a little bit too far
 that's the kind of things  that throw you off
 i'm supposed to ask you how do you make use of your credit cards
 right
 uh-huh
 they're always wanting to go on a diet or something
 i'm glad that you're in the business
 yes
 i don't think it would
 i think most people are aware at least now common knowledge is that
 the
 yeah
 have you heard of that
 okay
 i
 right
 but we have been looking at these red chevro-
 
 how can you afford all of this
 the bedrooms are a little bit small except the master bedroom's a little bigger
 yes
 i have no idea
 
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 that's true
 uh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 do you have that where you live
 right
 uh-huh
  uh-huh 
 right
 it was supposed to be two dollars an hour for two kids
 it was just crazy enough for th-
 huh-uh
 that's
 
 we're hoping it takes off again
 it does
 you are talking about p o w or missing in actions
 yeah
 several people were supposed to bring
 it must be a somewhat different environment from a regular college
 right
 uh-huh
 what part of the country are you from
 yeah
 yeah

 i will not read my lips or whatever
 
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
 right

 right
 they actually show you what duckwork and things
 just never given back
 someone came home
 uh-huh
 right
 what is the woodward book you are referring to
 french horn is absolutely wonderful instrument
 it seems like we are doing it here forever
  a six  person jury could have decided either way of course
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 now i mean now there's i heard that they were going to start calling on saturdays or some-
 we go in
 anyone that would use chemical weapons to fight his own people
 yeah
 yeah
 all over the place
 banking
 yeah
 don't get a lot of particulates
 they go to jail
 
 i know
 that's a long time
 
 huh-uh
  uh-huh 
 for me
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
 we live in a little small town
 no
 the ninety-eight
 uh-huh
 yes
 uh-huh
 that's right
 you think you're getting your money's worth
 you all don't have any other children around there
 right
 uh-huh
 i had
 that's right
 
 uh-huh
  
  you get to 
 they need money so much because they're constantly having to  run 
  oh
 because it looked so formidable

 uh-huh
 two years

 yeah
 
 yeah
 uh-huh
 i had to put my bifocals on to see it
 that's one of those few that i do watch when the television is on
  huh 
 we do oil well services
 yeah
 right
 yes
 it's  
 yeah
 my job kind of hinders me from exercising
 good
 are you a player
 have you ever been to biffin's
 that's true
 we're getting to where
 yeah
 
 it was aerobics and lifting weights three nights a week
 me too
  bye bye 
  yeah 
 let me turn off my stereo here
 yeah
 that's neat
 yeah that's true
 uh-huh
 it really does
 and they can show you the records they've gotten all their maintenance on schedule and everything like that
  yes 
 uh-huh
 right
 
 that's another bias
 
 they been trying these people now for twenty-two years ever since i was a child
 
 it doesn't pay well
 especially as rainy as it's been in the last couple of years
 bye-bye
 uh-huh
 of course my family and i
 it's going to look like
 some of my suits i haven't put on for
 i think i will enjoy cooking more when i am not working when i do not get home until five-thirty or six and i have to cook and clean up
 right
  yeah 
 yes
 that might help a little bit especially in some places
 no
  yeah 
 i get a kick out of that
 i
 
 
 uh-huh
 huh-uh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 
 as a matter of fact i prefer public television
  yeah
 actually seventeen now
 uh-huh
 hi cynthia
 few women in the class
 then a then a doctor type job
 yeah
 that's true
 uh-huh
 
 let somebody get something out of it
 i'm a government employee
 i took  a lot of my 
 
 i like to watch rock and roll videos and any kind of  videos 
 they were floating around
 uh-huh
 boy what a help that is
  and  training
 yeah
 no
 no
 that's true
 everybody's spayed
  that is neat 
 uh-huh
 oh
 that
  you  should just put down the basics and put n a where you don't want to answer
 that's true
 very much
 
 yes
 that they that they like pick on th- the advanced students and pay more attention to them
 right
 i'm living in that dorm
 yeah
 sure
 up on blocks
 yeah
 i miss it
 even the religious organizations
 all local
 yeah
 yeah
 i don't think i'd go to work without a bulletproof vest on myself  
 a lot of things
 you actually have to go up there
 yeah
 uh-huh
 bye-bye
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 yeah
 he does it every day like a ritual
 yeah
 huh
 uh-huh
 which is most unfortunate because we all lose out
 
 yeah
 of course
 uh-huh
 it was like we can't take it back
 we just couldn't
 yeah
 sure
 it gives it a little tang
  if it 
 yeah
 i think that was probably the last movie i've seen too
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 more than just seriously
 uh-huh
 atlanta and dallas are almost identical in every way weather and everything
 did i reach the dallas area
 okay
 to look through my things and not trust me
 uh-huh
 as far as brokers all i get calls from brokers in new york
 
 just to imagine that one day they're just going to turn around and someone is going to say we don't like you and start attacking again
 
 no
 
 i like that
 and for three months
 he's going to be working for chevron
 
 yeah
 i know i have to do more aerobics
 everybody
 okay
 
 right
 yeah
 have you seen the debit cards where they actually debit your account when you
 nope
  right 
 uh-huh
 right
 i think maybe more information should be given out about it
  and watch it on  monday night
 good
 i agree
 i know
 we have blueberries blackberries
 in fact this morning i was almost late for work because i'm almost at the end of this book
 not really because i'm listed in the phone book
 yeah
 right
 basically
 yeah
 we play r b i baseball on nintendo
 what was wrong with her was she not attractive enough did she not take good enough care of her man to keep his interest
 have you
 we have a separate area for the garden
 i'm a
 okay
  uh-huh 
 oh
 it carried over
  it's like  nothing to them
 yeah
 yeah
  i have a younger brother like that
  i  could possibly do it
 did someone just come up with this design
 when the
 good buddies
  uh-huh 
 either
 my son's in a performance tonight
 right
 uh-huh
 i'm saying that's how it was perceived
 which is not always true
 oh
 uh-huh
 in fact a lot of people will ride outside in the snow
 right
 that's the way
 yeah
 and the interest to the children
 uh-huh
 
 and then come home and get back into regular clothes again
 uh-huh
 yeah
 we had to call the insurance company
 no
 another problem is you're going to keep the smarter people in the system too long paying the wages they do
 right
 yeah
 no
 married
 yeah
 this was in louisiana
 i'm that way about a lot of different shows
 i didn't know we had one either
 yes
 
 yeah
 oh yes
 okay this person is taking drugs
 yeah
 what area of lakes do you like
 what are some of your favorite foods
  uh-huh 
 uh-huh
  uh-huh 
 as a matter of fact i can tell you something about that
 what i have always identified is i am basically good with money
  right 
  the thing
 uh-huh
 as we visited we were involved every weekend in just helping them redo this and refinish that
 uh-huh
 we'll start them inside
 yeah
 i'm still a full size person
 uh-huh
 oh
 yeah
 right
 uh-huh
 
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh

 uh-huh
 
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 right
  yeah  
 yes
 yeah
 yeah
 
 uh-huh
 gorgeous leaves and trees and all the lakes and the mountains and things
  but there's so many more people 
 i just finished james michener's texas book
 
 we wound up selling the house
 right
 you wonder about that sometimes
 uh-huh
 i think that was good
 i like the old-timey ones
  uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 really
 i'm sure that's true
 yeah
 i wonder
  it's like
  yeah
 i'm trying to get out
 i'm from new jersey originally
 
 and they would buy a plot of land and contractors and builders
 
 isn't that terrible
 yeah
 and so
 uh-huh
  that  would make me happy though
 yeah
 okay
 yeah
 yeah
  uh-huh 
  okay
 yeah
 i know
 yeah
 they're putting in fifty sixty hours a week

  i think that's true
 i thought that was just great

 uh-huh
 i know that both of mine have probably learned quite a bit from there
 yeah
 eighty-six
 you only have to check in with the office once or twice a week
 how old is she
 that's why
 yeah
 
 right
 or
 i think that's just part of their overall educational process is to get out and see and do things
 yeah
 really
 that is true
 i think the greed of the eighties got
 uh-huh
 it's making me hungry for them
 oh
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 they're hos-
 yes
 i think they're wonderful
 it does every
 
 pardon me

 right
 uh-huh

 or for those people in the tollbooth
 uh-huh
 that's a deterrent
 come about this time of year i am kind of ready for it to start getting spring
 absolutely
 yeah
 yeah
 just stinks
 i don't think it's the basic
 yeah
 wow
 how weird
 of just putting everything on there day after day after day
 
 that they
  no
 it's really good public relations for small schools
  she was alone with them 
 
 that makes me feel a little better
 there sure are
 uh-huh
 i really
 uh-huh
 
 yeah

 yeah
 that is about it
 yeah
 oh

 deal where a doctor was going to be sued for malpractice on the death on an infant
 that's right
 they're really good cars
 yeah
 i don't know
 uh-huh
  no 
 yeah
 but it's you know it's under so much control
 there's no doubt about it 
 of everything that i did i guess i enjoyed probably wallpapering the most
 i agree
 yeah
 do you know who chuck mangione is
 did they know that all along
 that was so cool
 me too on gun control
 oh
 then things improved right
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 the police don't catch them
 yeah
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 
 wow
 i hope you didn't have a big vacuum cleaner
 you think about aids research
 not a seventies baby
 uh-huh
 yeah i agree
 i didn't give away the whole thing
 me too
 huh-uh
 control is something that i wouldn't want the federal government to have
 gosh horrible stuff like that
 then you'll never leave
 was for tuna fish
 yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 yeah
 they portray things on t v obviously that they never would have years ago
  huh 
 yeah
 the first year i had to tell the kids not to pick them when they were red because they were supposed to be blackberries
 right
 uh-huh
 yeah
 especially the last few years
 goodness
 right
 uh-huh
 yeah
 they're cooperative rather than competitive
 yeah
 there was one guy that we tested for preemployment for drugs who absolutely swore up and down that it showed that he was using amphetamines
 kind
 yeah
 in our case it's like when you hire on they'll test you
 huh
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 yeah
 they know everything
 you've never seen the great american desert
 
 what have you seen
 bye
 all right

 i just kind of
 no
 you probably can't afford to eat if you have more than  two of them 
 
 uh-huh
 my husband is a counselor
 bye-bye
 uh-huh
 yeah
 conserve this do that
 i know it's going to be a slow change
 didn't do any damage to it
 uh-huh
 it doesn't get any better
 yeah
 yeah
 you know what day lilies are
 it's just i haven't had the time to go to the movies lately
 uh-huh
 what i'm right now
 uh-huh
 right
 yeah
 yeah
 i would think it

 no
 oh
 what kind of hobbies do you have lori
 oh
 i don't know

 yeah
 
 yeah
 i actually went to the university of texas at one time thinking that i would c- be a musician
 it's almost impossible  everything has sugar in it 
 right
 we just   did that too
 i can't think of the scripture
 uh-huh
 right
 
  uh-huh 
 you can look at it as though they are saying it's not true
 fast
 judith krantz
 i talked to a guy on the phone on this the other day
 put it on the lease
 yeah
 i'm out with my family we've gone shopping
 uh-huh
 i had six years of college
 uh-huh

 that's true
 that's right
 we didn't
 uh-huh
 yeah
 he was a doctor still
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 huh-uh
 you're kind of roughing it
  right 
 i don't know how to make it better for them

 i'm going to have to leave those details like what would you do about
 i don't know
 right
 oh
 huh-uh
 oh
 i can listen to any music i want to
 yeah
 eating all that hot food
 uh-huh
 afterwards and things
 if i can just nuke it i would do it
 sure
  yeah 
 it is temporary
 uh-huh
 i know dupont and dow and several other chemical companies are working uh feverishly to try to come up with a substitute for fluorocarbons
 
 right
   you must pay for   
 since kareem's retired
 it's one of the problems
 their baby
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 i seem to remember those shows being on in the afternoon
 yeah
 i think the lakes are probably different in michigan than they are in texas
 uh-huh
 it is a bulb
 the younger generation gets away with hell
 yeah
  that's right 
 you're the opposite of me
 
 you could still kind of go sledding and such out there
 do you live at all close to each other
 i don't know
 yeah
 i always worry about my teenage daughters going to some party
 right
 sure
 we won't go through that again
 i've heard so many people talk about that area
 and i'll drive it until it no longer is reliable
 yeah
 you're right
 my mother was real heavy into crafts
 uh-huh
 yeah
 no
  uh-huh
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 what they
 uh-huh
 it's not
 have to be prepared to water constantly during the summer
  uh-huh

 okay
 uh-huh
 right
 uh-huh

 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 
  those are  yeah
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh

 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 you sure do
 you too
 i'll say that is
 i don't know
 yeah
 there would be  much more of that
 have you ever been drug tested

 okay
 things are not so good in texas job wise
 there's so many capabilities out there
 i think everybody does
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 that's right
 richardson area
 okay
   of
 uh-huh
 i know so many of my friends i went to school with who are having babies right now
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
 i love them

 where did you go
 right
 
 uh-huh
 everybody ought to do their own share
 there's a lot of people that are on death row
 i haven't here lately
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 but i absolutely loved that automobile
 
 they said at the bottom of the s a t scores of graduating college seniors are usually those people that go into education
 bye-bye
 it seems like one way or the other we're going to end up paying for it
 uh-huh
 right
 those flowers remember those little ones you gave me
 yeah
 because i would read that every day because you would find ten minutes here that you do not have anything to do
  try to do it early in the mornings 
 uh-huh
 jeez
 we both do
 my husband took the kids to see that one
 they could do very well
 yeah
 no
 thank you
 yep
 yeah
 it's a thrill when you get a big fish though isn't it
 yeah
   oh  
 obviously not of the original time schedule
 my wife and i were both only children
 and uh uh so i i got back
 it is
 yeah
 uh-huh
 they're finding a way to tax you every time you turn around
 i jump out of the swimming pool
 right
 do you
 
 not like texas where everything comes to a stand still
 yes
 i don't think so
 the kinds of programs that these students need
 uh-huh
 yes
 
 yeah
 yeah
 
 we kind of tended to eat out a bit more than we should have
 of course we have several plants here
 yeah
 as far as   child abuse is these days you never know
 sure
 uh-huh
 people even wanting to play on their team
 uh-huh
 
 i wanted to see that program

 uh-huh
 yes
 hello
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 it's exciting
 why do you do this
 what did we lose
 they just get bugs in them
 i hate shoes
 
 uh-huh
 doesn't seem like it work to take it away when we're using it
 and what have you and giving you traction
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 i don't know what
 since i am a law-abiding citizen and i have never had a felony if i wanted to buy one i don't think there should be that big of a restriction on it
 yeah
 and we had two children
 yeah
 uh-huh
 no
 
 yeah
 uh-huh
 i don't know
 wow
 thanks
 of course thinks i'm crazy which i may be too

 when they're skiing they're fearless
 i think i have gone home maybe once or twice slightly sore
 yeah
 right
 yeah
 
  no
 right
 yeah
 no
 uh-huh
 not too challenging to the brain
 yeah
 nobody told me that it was all fake
 that was
 do you think the verdict should be completely unanimous by the jury
 that part i don't care about
 the other thing he does that my husband a real stickler about is we don't collect our grass clippings
 uh-huh
 right
 a lot of women like that
 uh-huh
 sure
 right
 i found out my grandmother was one of a twin
 that's what we had looked for was our main concern was a big living room
  uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 i work at t i
 is it three or five
 the what
 yeah
 obstinate
 yeah
 i just can't get over this
 they'll ask you whether you want bags or paper or plastic
 i know what you're saying there
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 i don't either
 uh-huh
 okay
 unjudgmental
 uh-huh
 they just made them look fancy
 where did you go
 yeah
 yeah
 i think they should
 we usually have some of our coldest weather toward the uh end of january
 yeah
 right
 i'm originally from new york
 exactly
 yeah
 the girl next to me saw it
  yeah
 we talked about that one too
 yep
 yeah
 oh
 us for our tennis lessons
  right 
  yeah
 it must be the marketing pressures
 my roommate only gets paid once a month
 oh
 i forgot about that
 yeah
 yeah
 
 oh
 uh-huh
 we have some people that have done their lawns
 right
  uh-huh 
 i just can't imagine how people did it before
 
  makes you sick doesn't it
 okay
 we're down here at the bible belt aren't we
 uh-huh
 i pay for my own life insurance
 right
 that's for sure
 yeah
 right
 i
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 yes
 yes
 about how much do they charge to do something like that
 uh-huh
 i rented a lot of videos
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 i didn't even date a guy that had a car until i was in college
 sure
 uh-huh
 did they give you a number to call
 we don't need to back talk
 we sent them to camp
 i know what you're saying
 well i think part of the problem is the election goes on way too long
 yeah
 right
 you mic it to see if it's accurate
 she just has been
 they're just delicious
 my husband is
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 yeah
 you can just go ahead and get that taken care of
 no

 they have to be subjected to all of the arab bombings
 okay
 yeah
 yeah
  yeah

 uh-huh
 that's
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
 maybe so

 tobogganing
 for everybody
 uh-huh
 the the students have a little too much uh too much leeway

 with the plastic
 yeah
  uh-huh 
 right
 i heard that the other day on the radio
 yeah
 not let them go and get out of it
 i only took lessons for golf when i was in college

 it's because they can't read
 yeah
 yes 
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
