it's you're you're taking words and developing a picture in your mind
so i mean
it's it's excellent
i i'm we haven't got children yet
but i hope to uh set an example for ours that you know that reading is can it can be your best friend
i mean even if you haven't got a a f- a human friend around you can pi- pick up a book and and
well i guess i'd better close now so i can
or are you a teacher
well i i was
but uh so yeah
we're we think books are important around here
well you have a good day
um how do you feel about um the way the u s has reacted in the middle east
well i was it was favorable
i i just i think the sanctions would have worked
but it would of taken longer
and uh now with all this stuff coming out with woodward's book and everything
uh and then i saw a nightline program last night about all the funding of hussein's uh back as early as nineteen eighty-six
so uh been a different turn
and then i don't think we projected what was going to happen after the war
well it just came out i guess yesterday
and it's uh it says big story in the paper about it today bush trying to comment on it that colin powell was against the uh uh an early uh
and so it seems like there's you know always some body digging things like that
but i'm not for sure we know exactly what what all happened in that situation
so we were so uh fast to get over the vietnam whatever the vietnam syndrome is that now we've tied ourselves up there in the middle east for a long period of time
i was i was very against our involvement so quickly
i just think i think if we had been very i mean if we had that good of a correlation through the united nations then they could have uh they could have made sanctions work i'm pretty sure
we are i think you know
in in we've just misread almost everything in that we always seem to be getting in bad with the wrong fellow for the next next tenure for the next thing down the road
and uh then we can and we don't tend to read israel correctly
so uh i don't know
it's uh not going to be anything we're going to get out of very soon
but uh being a historian it's you know you read all that clear back at least to the turn of the century with all the mess after the first world war
and we just we're still i i you're absolutely right
we just if we do find so-called experts in any area of the world we don't listen to them
um i don't know
be be interesting to keep watching i guess
but i'm just afraid it's going it's going
and i'm not sure we're sensitive to to other cultures
we're i happen to teach at a college with a tremendous number of international students
and and cultural diversity is just something we really don't understand
and it needs to be uh taught from the earliest grades
with our school systems in such disarray i don't know if that it doesn't look terribly hopeful
but i'm not sure it's something you can teach
well you can at least uh
give them the awareness of the different cultures and uh you know have all sorts of um at least you know let them know what that that other people do things differently than than than maybe in their own neighborhood
so and when when when those people are around
and you can get them to meet
and we're all pretty much alike
but it's uh it's something as you know as i said won't go away
so it will be a good topic for me in the class for along time
because i teach history
and um what about the whole situation with the refugees the kurds
well i would just think if bush was so successful in lining up the correlation to prosecute a war then he should be equally successful in getting that same correlation to push the united nations to uh uh somehow persuade those nations to give the kurds a homeland
but what about the palestinians
well that's the same thing
they uh they haven't been waiting quite as long even though they've been waiting since forty-eight
uh that that becomes a different matter simply because your dealing with israel
and they seem to be more intractable than ever
uh that shamir can't can't retain his leadership if he if he backs down the slightest bit
so uh i just don't see us i don't think there's anybody of of major stature on the scene of like the great statesman of the past
or at least we thought they were
well do you think the u s should even be involved i mean as the world leader in the sense trying to resolve these issues
or should we have just stayed out of it
well i wish we could stay out of it
but the oil is not going to allow us to
but i'm not for sure that we're not destined at least for the foreseeable future as long as we can keep our head our own head above water to be the world leader
so i bush is probably if he can keep that correlation together especially the french and the british and the germans and be sure that the japanese can kick in some of their money
uh uh cold selves
and i wouldn't have necessarily fought for the kuwaitis
they uh they're nobody likes them in that part of the world
but uh it's just such a volatile area
i mean there's just no stability period
but in a sense i don't know that i would say it's good
in a sense i'm glad that saudi wasn't more changed by by the situation
i mean we really don't i mean i don't think it's our world to westernize the whole world
so the fact that the saudi could just sort of pull back and uh remain you know culturally sort of clean is interesting
i it's not our uh role to make everybody like us
but it's just uh for those who have may have wanted to travel in that part of the world that are up in the age i am it's going to eliminate that for awhile
well you know i mean i actually lived in beirut from sixty-eight to eighty-four
oh did you
and so i mean it's been dangerous for sometime
well i i haven't been to beirut
but i've heard what a wonderful city that
it's just totally gone to uh
well see that's it
it depends on whether one talks physical or or sort of cultural
culturally i mean it's obviously changed a lot
because it's more of a survival city
but the buildings are still intact and still beautiful you know you know
and there's garbage when i left
but i mean it's just a different cultural aspect
i mean the trucks don't come daily
and you really don't want the garbage in your house
so and i mean i traveled in the area too
and um so that many of the countries turkey and syria are the same as they were for traveling
i've been to north africa a lot but not um
it was i never could get a visa
so even before so even when things were good in the middle east americans weren't really given visas to go into baghdad
and um but it's it's a very beautiful part very interesting historically of course which was my interest art history
well i think we've done them a good job today then
so uh he was checking to see if i was going to stay in because i've been so busy with this presidential search
and um you know have a good business trip
and you continue
i i think the republicans have taxed us just as much as the democrats
and i don't think there's a change between one party than the other
uh i think we get a lot back
but not as much as we should
uh i guess what i feel about it is that it's so mismanaged that it there's got to be something
when when we pay so much for the for the debt instead of using the money for where it ought to go it it's just it's ridiculous
what kills me is when they had a chance to to uh put into ac- action the the g- the glen- rub-
the gramm the gramm rudman act
what is it uh the act where they had to cut everything across the board they kept doing they kept putting off doing that
well i think they spend too much
they they spend too much on themselves too
the the a lot of the the taxes gets back to the members of the congress and everything all running for twenty years rather than
well things like mailings
they don't they don't try to uh to conserve
and of course here at home we end up conserving and conserving
and i mean when i don't have money i don't buy something
i think uh it is the congress and them just don't have any interest in saving us money uh
and i don't know quite how to do it
but i think we need to have the one line uh uh veto so that they don't have to spend so much time doing everything
you know and if it's not so what
maybe it was uh connecticut
one of the small states up there where he had a bill through for another uh a drug agency that would be located there
and he was the only one that wanted it
and he was going to build it in his home town
and they were going to hire a lot of people
and it was ridiculous you know the whole thing
this is that's right
and and you know they asked him about it
but do you know that the drug agency doesn't want this
and they do things that are you know just like the uh
and the trouble is you don't you have so little input about it
you don't know enough to know what what to do about some of this stuff
but they do what they they want to do with it
the other thing about is i think uh limiting their time in office would be good
i i just can't believe there aren't other people out there that could do just as well as what we've got
we we have said that i've said it several times on different subjects about the government that two yea- two terms is enough for all of them
uh whether you're mayor all the way up city council the works i think certainly president that uh two terms is plenty
and then we get these professionals out of there
and they have to learn how to earn a living again themselves you know rather than living off of us
well that's right
i think uh people in general
the the the idea of what you need to to exist is so outrageous that it's not hardly
you know it starts at the courts
it starts everywhere until we can't we've just lost control of of any kind of perspective about what is acceptable and what is not acceptable you know
well it's so much money
and you can't even add it up you know
you can't even
our national debt in the trillions of dollars you know
i mean it jus- and and you just
the other thing is it's it's all very well to give money to help people other people
and i think we need to do that
but there are they need to put more limits on them
they they've given that away for fifty years
i i you know i think that's probably un- unless we can afford it
you know i don't really mind helping people
but you you need to get rid of this thing that's that's just uh eating us up you know and get things on a on an even
if it were if it were a family we'd be up before the the magistrate
but the government does it
and it's all right
i i know we're taxed to death on every every thing
but uh they don't even talk about that
they don't even consider it like you saying to cut something back you know
they are at least doing something now with the the military you know
but of course now you know t i
you know that's hurting us but although
but t i has gotten a lot of good contracts from the war and everything else
and if they'll get a lot of programs in the future because of their exotic uh weapon systems
but uh that's the only good that i've seen congress do you know and everybody and all the congressmen and the president and everybody uh
and we're all going to have to do it
i it just isn't fair though that when this happens in some places it needs to all come off everywhere
that's why i thought well you know this is the time
they need to put that into act- into action and show they mean business that they've got to cut they've got to cut costs
well not the only but uh
i think the now i i don't understand the present school thing
but uh i have two daughters
and one's about to be in high school
but uh i think that paying for school
and so i don't mind paying for school taxes even though my kids will be out of it you know
but um you know it you just feel like it's out of control
and that and so then it just aggravates you you know
oh i agree with you
i i think that's a wide open subject what you said
i think the people will here shortly uh
well i think that's right
if they don't do if they don't if they don't pull it in and start doing something i think they're really going to have to i think
i think the next time we have an election we need to try to get some of the ones that have been there forever out too that what they did last election
and uh ninety some odd percent of the same old boys got back in you know
so we need to try to get people to two terms so they respect our wishes you know
that's what they're called but they don't
may may may maybe we can change and get us rid of some of those guys that are in there guys and gals whatever they are
there a lot of lot of places where it's worse than it is here
but still you don't want it to get that bad good heavens
we need to get try to get hold of it and and have it be things be honest
and i guess in the fact i don't really mind paying taxes
but i would just like to know that they're not being foolishly spent that they're doing something that's positive for for somebody
i don't really feel like uh i don't really feel like i use taxes very much
that's you're right
i use them in the in roads and lot of things
well i think one of the good ones in the metroplex uh in the last say twenty-five years or so maybe longer they've built all these dams
you know the corps of engineers have uh soon as they finish a lake they'll go at get another one
and that we haven't had we've had droughts here in long summers we've had good water supply
and that's due to the corps of engineers building looking years ahead and building all these reservoirs for us you know
the state actually did some good good work on that in that a couple of years ago
uh sam johnson came out and talked to us about that about what they had done
and they they really had done some good some good work
there are a lot of p- places where they're in real trouble
and and i think it would be easy enough to be in trouble here too if they don't take if they don't take that early stand
and they need to start another one
the growth is fast enough so that they can't afford to just dawdle and wait until something til they need them
well it's good to talk to you
oh about nine
i just just a housewife
oh well great
i i just kind of i i kind of watch them on the news
and that's about it
uh the michael jordan's on chicago bulls isn't he
what did he get hurt last night
because uh i saw just a little bit of the game today
and he was out there playing
although uh i what i saw was at the end of the first quarter
i think he only had like eightch- eight points at the end of the first quarter
so i don't know
but i don't know who won
and uh i don't know
who do you normally pull for the the mavericks or
i kind of feel like the about the mavericks the way i do about the cowboys now
uh just all this roy tarpley stuff
and and uh what is it
their you know he got he's in trouble again down in houston
and and uh they said the other night his contract is so big that if anything happens to him you know if they don't trade him they'll have to pay him off you know
so they're rather have him except that he gets in trouble all the time and falls off the wagon and and and have some chance of him playing you know earning his money
because that's just dollars right out of the franchise
now i uh i i've always been pulling for the lakers for a long time
not just not just because they always win
but uh when they had uh akeem anybody who was old as that playing that well you know i just kind of had to go with them
now they kind of got caught up with a lot of the other players and uh course uh all the people that follow the lakers and everything out there in in california
uh and it also helps when they were winning
well they play better as a team than anybody else seems like
i was uh i always wondered that you know
i i will take a look at the individual score you know in the individual stance in the n b a and you know they they have in the paper you know like fifteen different categories
and they'll have like a individuals uh they'll have the the highest scorer the top rebounders uh assists foul shooting percentages and all that
and you go down through
and virtually every one of the categories there isn't uh a laker in the top ten
usually hardly any any anybody in the top twenty except for like magic and uh yet the lakers continue to win
so you're right
i think they do really play much better as a team than they do uh uh each one you know individually at their spot
year in and year out it's not like they have you know
a lot of teams will will will win in the playoffs
and then the next year they'll be all they'll be too busy doing their endorsements and stuff to to concentrate on the game
well i understand that uh
i guess boston's really uh giving uh
are aren't they playing detroit
and i think they're really giving them a run for their money
he his back is bad all the time now i think
they play two or three times a week like you know
and then they go on road trips
and they do the same thing
and and then they and then they stay out for two or three weeks at a time
so it really gets you know
i mean they're sleeping in different bed every night
and and i imagine that really helps his back
he said he said the other night on the news that he hadn't done any extra shooting for six weeks
so you know and he's the one that's always winning the uh the the outside the three point shot
and he does that every year
matter of fact i watched him uh on t v you know sink i don't know a
jeez it was like uh uh thirty five baskets in thirty seconds or something like that from three point range
just uh just just playing horse and stuff like that
because it's it kind of a violent game
and they d-
and they don't wear any pads
some of those guys got pretty funny looking uh eye wear
they have to wear goggles because they get hit in the in the face with elbows all the time
well it's h- it's i was looking in the paper for something on it
and here's the top n b a draft prospects
and uh i mean they're all the size of football players you know except they're just taller
several years ago when i was up in uh cleveland i was staying at the marriott
and the cavaliers were playing somebody
i think it was like utah or somebody like that
and uh i was down by the pool
and there was all these guys standing around about chest deep in water
now i wear uh contacts
and i i had my glasses on
and i went down there and and just jumped into the water where they were
and it went right up over my head
and i came up spittering and sputtering for air
and they were all the basketball players there to play the cavaliers they were all like uh like six eight and uh you know six ten
and they were standing in water that was like six foot
and it was uh it was funny i tell you
i saw i saw a guy
but he got on the elevator
and he had his swimsuit on
and uh he was just skin and bones you know
it looked like something out of africa and uh
and uh he says yeah
he says i weigh about uh uh two hundred and forty pounds but he says it's not much when you stretch it over seven foot one
so you're right
those guys really you know the the big ones
but uh he's got to be way up there
well here's a here's a guy from l s u stanley roberts
and he weighs two hundred and eighty pounds
god that's a that's a lot
that's a lot of a lot of guy coming down on you
who's who's supposed to have the the uh the best uh draft picks
here it says uh it says
the under- this is for underclassmen for june twenty-six and uh i guess i guess they don't they have they they uh have a lottery on it
and that's how they take them in order
it must not be according to their how they did during the year
i used to go down to reunion arena uh
went down there a couple years on the day of the draft and that was really pretty interesting
they usually have uh uh you know a video uh highlights of the season you know and basically kind of walks you through what happened to the mavs and who they traded for and how they did and a lot of good footage both the good and the bad i i don't know
i haven't i didn't go down there last year
but uh it it was only like a couple dollars to get in
and it was really kind of interesting
but uh so who do you thinks going to win the playoffs
chicago uh and let's see uh golden state and the lakers and chicago and philadelphia
and then the uh
philadelphia was uh favored by one point over chicago and the lakers one point over golden state and detroit by five over uh boston
i think boston boston will win
now i i'd like to see them back up there again
they really uh they really gave some some really good years of uh uh of enjoyment and fun and everything
well i don't know
i i haven't really gone to a lot of games live
but boy i'd sure like to
um do you have any advice for college
i'm i'm i'm full of advice
i'm fairly full of it of it myself
uh the main point that i have about choosing where you want to go to school is that def- you have to early on define what it is you want to do or at least what area you want to be in
uh i had the unpleasant experience of going through several schools that were very specialized
uh undergraduate schools before i found a a good school that was more general uh to give me time to make up my mind
oh that's interesting
i went to a a liberal arts school actually at first
and you weren't really even um
and then you you know you had i think you had to pick it by by by the end of the second you had to pick some sort of major
but until then they didn't sort of force you
they they sort of forced you to run around taking classes in everything until then certain requirements
so that so that you had to sort of get a general feel for everything
so it wasn't that specialized
i'm a great co- proponent of liberal arts education
uh being an engineer now i believe in it even more strongly than i did before
i was just on a committee recently actually sponsored by uh the american association for the advancement of science trying to sort of you know where where they were just trying to figure out how to fit science and liberal arts together you know because there are people who are getting just wonderful science educations and not getting enough liberal arts
well thus far it's working to my advantage
uh the great gap historically has with engineers has been while they may have all this technical information they have no way of imparting it to except to another engineer
and i have the ability to listen to them and then translate that into something that nonengineers can understand
well that must be helpful
well i figure that that that's probably the thing i would most tell any parent you know to tell their kids i think probably
and save specialization i guess for graduate school unless they're sure they want early on they want to do something like engineering or something
or they can
even at that i have a son that who's only nine at the moment
but i see him very rapidly becoming the engineering personality
and uh if he decides to pursue that i'm going to insist that he spend two years at a liberal arts college before i'll even let him go to an engineering college
but but that's a good idea
well where i am right now
actually i'm at the university of rochester
and that's a pretty good engineering school i think
i think we do some they have pretty good engineering here
they also have pre- a fairly large liberal arts college as well a sort of a separate you know arts and sciences college
um and i believe the engineers are sort of required to take classes in in everything
and i know people i do uh i do work in language processing
and and and at least one person who's in my field started off as an engineer started off as an elec- elec- an electrical engineer student and then switched over at some point into language processing because he found that he enjoyed it more
so they do force them
oh i agree
uh i have the experience uh
uh the typical land grant university
anyway while it has both engineering and liberal arts the engineering students tend to cluster together
you know they're in classes together even when they're outside of the engineering department
and they don't learn the communications
they don't learn the thought processes of other fields of of endeavor
it's you know it that's kind of like if i were king for a day and got to and got to make one rule
you you don't need any philosophy at all in school
or or or or some other thought provoking area you know
we had uh when i went to undergraduate we had uh
don't know if you know of it or not uh
we had uh uh a requirement freshman year of just humanities
then you were given a choice of um you know
there were ten or twelve or whatever fift- or fifteen different courses that you could take
but they all centered they all came out of philosophy english and literature departments
and they were they were they were a set of assigned readings everybody had to read you know for
so the first year humanities courses everyone had to read the iliad an and so forth
and what they did do was they all approached it from from very different
so that you could have one class in the philosophy of something that the philosophy of greek mythology or something that actually approached this or um one literature you know or a a literature course or just all sorts of different perspectives on it
and people got to choo- pick and choose
but but by the end everyone had a good sample of of of sort of how to think about these things nonscientifically you know
and uh and that sort of forced them
but i believe that that that you one of the one of the best things to do at least for me in school was was i was sort of forced to take lots of different kinds of courses
um i was forced to take i think you know some sort of art history course
and we all grumbled about it at first
but then afterward we all wound up taking extra art history classes because it just seemed like something something we didn't totally know nothing about but just enjoyed very much doing
yes i re-
and something i would never would have done if if i wasn't forced to take it
i remember that experience that and uh extra music classes
and that and that really is something that that i notice
like i talk to a lot of my friends at school that are more specialized
and they don't have that
they just you know they went in and took their courses that they were expected to take
and that was all
well that will continue to grow even as you go beyond graduate school
i'm i'm i'm hoping i'm hoping
have have you gone straight through
i i graduated um college in eighty-seven
and i just went straight through
um i'm finishing up next year
i've been trying actually in graduate school i've been trying to do the same thing take courses out- completely outside my area
and i'm finding in graduate school it's a lot harder because uh i just don't have the time any more to sort of sit in a course that i'm not getting graded for
so i have to try and go myself
and i went for like two or three weeks and realized not enough time for the work unfortunately
so i'm just wind up spending a lot of time doing that instead
uh what else
i i think i
well let me let me encourage you to stop and experience life along the way
i i first enrolled in college in nineteen sixty-six
uh six years and a and a war later uh i got a degree an undergraduate degree
and then fifteen years after that i got the first of a set of master's degrees
and four years after that i got another master's degree
um you had real world experience in the middle there
and that helped you think
or that was
it it certainly makes acceptance of different ideas a lot easier
um i have i have sort of some
and so i sort of hinge halfway out in the real world
and i getting you know real world
especially she works in uh uh she works in the she works for a temporary agency ac-
and i never would have had
i never would have had any i've i've learned much just sort of by watching her and her and her business as well
so i i can i can see where that might be a
well vicarious learning is a wonderful thing
but experience is a wonderful
well i'll i'll take that i'll take that and think that through a little bit uh
my wife a- as i may have mentioned just finished a doctorate a couple of years ago
an- and she pursued her education along the lines that i did with lots of break in between
and she feels reasonably comfortable teaching now
well i take it since you selected this topic that you have children
but i have nine younger brothers and sisters
and um they're past this they've been latchkey children for a while
and they're almost where i can start saying they're you know young adults
so i don't have to worry about child care too much anymore
um we're supposed to discuss what criteria we would ask
i would assume it's you know if you were looking for a day-care center or something like that
well if i were look-
or probably even baby-sitters would be the same thing
um i think my my top priority would be that it would be someone who would be responsible and someone that would actually like children
and i would want to know if they've had any past experience with children
and i think that varies
um you know it's it's once they get to a certain age it's almost more important that it's someone that can entertain your child as opposed to someone who's you know really really qualified per se
um with a with a baby definitely have to be someone who knows how to handle a baby and would know how to respond to an emergency
well um i did a lot of baby-sitting when i was younger
and i did most of my baby-sitting when i was between the ages of thirteen and sixteen
but um the only thing people ever asked me
well of course they knew i came from a family with younger kids
but they really didn't ask me if i was used to children or not
you know and um i was pretty surprised because if i had a child and someone you know i would want to know i personally would ask for people that that person has baby-sit for before
well i my experience i baby-sat a lot also at when i grew up
and um coming from you know that background and the background as a parent now i think the reason that people don't ask a whole lot of questions is a a lot of times baby-sitters
it's you get somebody where you kind of know the family already
and that gives you so much basic knowledge that you don't ask a whole lot of questions
becaus- because i had three younger brothers and sisters myself
so they they thought okay
she knows how to how to treat children
well see when um i first got my mai- my first baby-sitting job was pretty strange
um this lady saw us at church
and she was a you- you know she was a younger lady
and that was it
and um she knew that i was one of the oldest girls in my family
so she just asked my mom if i could baby-sit
you know she really didn't know my name or anything you know
you know and she had two children
so um she pretty much you know just assumed that i would know you know how to handle them
so i wa- you know i enjoy kids
and i get along with them very well
so there's no problem
but uh with today's world and the kids today uh there's no way i can't say that i would just ask someone you know that i didn't know like that to baby-sit
oh i agree with you
but there again she you know she knew knew of your family
and she and she met in a safe setting such as church
so she was going on those two instincts
and i was very very protective on who baby-sat my children
oh i would be too
and and in i- it really shocked me
because just about six months ago someone came to my front door rang the doorbell
and the daughter was oh about a second grader
and she was actively looking for people who would baby-sit her child
and i thought well she doesn't know me or my children from anything
and it was i was almost more reluctant of letting my older children go baby-sit for her because i didn't know her
so i mean people are so different
oh i know
um well i real- i obviously you've never had to look for a day care or anything
well i did i did have um my my child uh in a day care for just a short time a- when my oldest was about two and a half and i worked just a part-time job
and uh in in those situations um what i did is i'd i went in
and you know i made a few phone calls
um that was a concern with me
um you know c- you you learn a lot by going in there
and they e- they explain to you you know what their day consists of and what their general rules are
and um that's you know that's as much as i know
you probably could get really good feedback from a lot of other working mothers you know that have done this over and over again
or what was it
um i think lots of people i i think i went by location for one thing
i think you start out with the criteria of you know do i know of anything
or do i know anyone who has their child in a day care
there is i would say most people would probably go by word of mouth
and then you know i mean even at that you have to consider the logistics of it
you know i mean you're not going to take your child south of town if you work north
yo- even if that's the best one in the whole wide world
so there there are just so many considerations
then again did um money come into play with it at all
oh money is always a factor in my life
i've never you know i've never had the luxury of not having that be a factor um even in something as important as day care
i know if i didn't have that stipulation i would have done things differently you know
um montessori school would be something that i would have pursued
but that's always a little bit more expensive than what i could look at
um and i was very very fortunate in that i didn't have to do that on a full-time basis
so and and then when you get you know when you get into the full-time basis day care
oh where you from tina
oh garland texas
oh my lands
probably most people you talk to do huh
now i don't have anybody that works for t i
but uh my son works for a computer company the national institute of s- s- something
so i guess we're supposed to talk about foods today
uh foods like you would for a dinner party or something like that
well i don't know
and i don't think they ate all that much different
well uh the thing that i found interesting
my husband and i lived up in washington state for awhile and up there of course they ate a lot of sea food
and down here sea food is pretty expensive because
and it's not as good as if it's fresh
and and uh and but here we eat a lot of like mexican foods
but it just
well they probably were trying to do the best they could
like chicken fried steak
up there uh it was hardly ever heard of
and up there hardly anyone drank ice tea
well they do in the summertime
but when when we have a dinner party around here i think a lot of the time a mexican menu is something real popular
i know that um i do a lot of planning with our church
and a lot of the times when we get together well everybody will bring a mexican dish
or and italian food is real big too
well i don't know
we we really uh use most anything
i uh i think like parties and that though are
well like we had a dinner party here here not too long ago with a mystery dinner party
your uh bread family and your
ham and bake potatoes uh
uh something from each each area that you're supposed to choose from
and uh we we we ourselves are into the wok cooking
we've really been enjoying those uh meals
well that's good
i i love that kind of cooking
my uh unfortunately i am married to a man and have two children that eat about four things
well all our family is is gone
it it's much different
well my husband didn't like that
so we us kids
and we ate that when he he wasn't going to be home for supper
well that's pretty much what we do
but they like uh spaghetti
you know that's one meal
and the whole family eats
but uh there are several things that
well as a matter of fact i keep chicken nuggets handy all the time because
oh those always go good
and uh they are real easy to cook
that way whatever meat we have if they don't like it well
and my girls don't like beef
that's good the way way the things are going
it could be bec- they don't
but it takes more chewing
and it is easier to chew
so they're not too much into beef
but at least we keep our chicken nuggets handy for them
but we we don't a whole lot
well most of the entertaining we do is church associated
but we do get together for wh- fellowships at our church
and my husband and i do a lot of the planning in that
well that's good
and it's fun to uh
and our homemakers meet at the church also
that's what we do mostly most of the time for that
so you don't really include any certain food groups
you uh like best
but it doesn't happen very often
and you can you can
oh those are fun
but it's the only time tha- i can remember that
i it might have been the main dish that hardly anyone showed up with
you know each like uh a an appetizer
and we had tons of desserts and tons of appetizers
and but when we came to the main main dish plate
there was only like two or three
well not really
and uh were kind of angry with whoever it was
and you know they know better
either either go ahead and fix your dish
or call someone that can
well that sounds neat
i can't uh believe you're so far away
but you sound so close
but i'm up at my daughter's
uh you know
we were just about we were getting ready to go swimming
and we're waiting on my sister
well we probably have we talked long enough
so i'll let
so i've enjoyed talking to you
oh same here
uh well let's see
i mean that sounds like an army
and i have only got two
and they are one
well any number is nice let me tell you
well i kind of decided that single single children that that that's not parenting
well do not tell that to all my friends
but sometimes you can hurt them by having too much quality time too
quality time with them you know outside of the work day
and when i take care of some people's kids
when they when they have teachers' holidays
and you can spot them
and you take one that's used to being uh busy being having something to do all the time it makes a big difference
uh keeps you busy
you did all five of yours complete college
she's uh but she's married now
well how did you go about selecting a college then
well we did not do it right all the time
and i do not always think you should try to make them stay closer to home
i think the main thing is to uh right now i think the main thing is to look at what they are interested in uh and take what they are interested in
and then then start looking for schools
do you think that what they say that they are interested in is at eighteen is going to be what they are ultimately ultimately graduating at
but mike our oldest boy i think he would have
he wanted to go to embrey rey- riddle
and we talked him into going local here first
and he only went a few months and then transferred to pittsburgh
he went to aeronautical uh oh just learning to work on engines and that
uh it has to do with airplanes and everything which is what his whole life is
and i really wish we would have let him go where he wanted to go originally
and he would probably be flying is what he would be doing
uh but but right now of course he's he's working for pratt and whitney in connecticut
and they build and rebuild non jet engines
how about the other four other three who went
uh the other ones uh the second one she chose we let her go where she wanted to uh
but she went to erie to gannan university uh or gannan college
uh she went there two years
and it was more expensive
and she soon realized you know
even though she did not like clarion she came back and finished at clarion because it uh saved her quite a bit of money
and she got really the same basic education that she wanted
and our other two boys they went to clarion also and uh did very well there
and they have all really got uh they have all really got really good jobs
i mean had they did they have an idea that they were definitely going to go to college and
she said i i always thought she would change her mind
but she did not
and there's nothing wrong with that you know if
but uh it it does make a difference in your pa- wage income
because if they get an education and are willing to go where the jobs are they can make a you know a much better income
like my kids they are all making more than my husband was making when he retired from the state
you know that boggles
i went uh four years to undergrad at university of nebraska at lincoln
and there really there really was not a choice
i mean the finances uh dictated that you had to go there
but i was well you know
you know one of the rhodes scholars kids
and i just knew that the finances you know would not support it
to go anyplace else i think that i would definitely you know have gone
now when i finished there then i got a scholarship to go the harvard university in boston
and that was uh i think that was probably one of the best things that had ever happened
i mean i was
taken out of my element you know the homogeny midwest
looked differently sounded differently you know
and i think it was probably one of the best things that ever happened to me
now my kids i keep saying that uh you know i would like them to go to the best school that they possibly could
and i do not know you know what the realities you know is going to look like you know
uh but i really think it's important
see that's the way we are
and it does make a difference
i they say you should not look at the expense of the college when you are looking
because they say that a lot of times you get more help
and so in the long run if it's really what they want you know they are better off
uh we we did all we could
but they pretty much had to borrow a lot of their money to go
they suggested some sort of a recipe uh for uh
did you have anything in mind that uh you'd like to share
well i uh just had a christmas around the world party the other night and had some hors d'oeuvres
and i fixed uh a crab meat spread that is real good and real easy
it's uh it's like uh eight ounces of cream cheese softened
and you mix it with one tablespoon onion juice and one tablespoon lemon juice one tablespoon worcester sauce and mix it and spread it out onto a plate
and then you take and uh
and that always goes over real well
and it's real easy
i don't think uh
well it doesn't make quite as much as you think
and how much crab meat did you use
and drain it real good
one one can of flake
have you ever used the uh imitation yet
i used it uh last christmastime
uh what did i put it in
there's like a little tidbit with the sauce to dip it into and stuff
and then i have it here on hand for about a week
and then all of a sudden it dawned on me
and then i found out
and they said it is a fish product
so therefore you really don't have a very long life you know once you buy it
i thought so you know they should put some directions on some of these new things they're making that you really don't know what the shelf life is
i had bought a cheesecake uh
and they very nicely put onto the box that it may be re frozen which i felt was real nice
oh that's a good idea
it uh was uh lawry's i believe or lawler's
and i got it
and they're very good cheesecakes
oh that sounds good because that's great
and they have and they have the little papers between them
oh hey that sounds
and i think they're what about nine dollars and something
and it's something good to have on hand too
so you can uh
and then you can re freeze
and i thaw it
and then you can re freeze it
it was they're very good very good
and that's the one thing that i hate to make is desserts
oh do you
and that's my favorite
and i really don't care for desserts that well other than one piece of it
oh i love to eat it
but i don't like to make it
and you have to rack your brain
and time i don't have anymore
that's the that's the thing i hate most about entertaining is thinking of what i'm going to serve
i i said i can make it no time
and then we just uh built a new home
and i have one of these kitchens that's the center of the house and so no matter where they're at your company can see you cooking
but uh what i have learned in the uh ten months we've lived here is it that when i entertain i have to have my foods all prepared and in the oven with all the
because with the open area you don't want someone from your dining room seeing your mess like you said
that's that's right
so you have to have the picturesque kitchen you know right out of the magazine
well i like to have mine all done anyway because then i want to i want to party too
and you know the funny thing is now that i have a large kitchen with a big island and that i still have people trying to come you know
and i said out
and it it has worked out
but at our point of life we know many of the people we're entertaining uh well enough that they know you know it's very much at home type situation
well a lot of our entertaining anymore with the couples again that we've known a long time like you they uh we all bring things
and it sure makes it a whole lot easier
well we even have a better one
well i'm not a big exerciser
but i kind of had to start after i had my baby because i wanted to lose that extra weight
and so basically at this point i'm i'm a real walker
i don't do that oh i guess i'll call it that fancy type walking where they kind of move their hips you know and keep their arms up
i mostly just take a a walk around the block or with my baby
oh that's good
or you know and i have to do that at least once a day if it if it's going to make any effect on since i have to eat the same as i did before
and how old is your baby
she just uh well she was premature
so she's about nine months now though
well i walk two and a half to three miles every night
oh that's great
my husband and i were on nutrisystem about eighteen months ago and he lost sixty-two pounds and i lost twenty-one
oh my goodness
and we walk our dog every night and go up around the elementary school
and uh except if it's raining or real cold which it hasn't been we try to get out uh every every night
and he plays racquetball twice a week
but i'm not into that
so i think the walking is enough to help us stay in shape and toned
well i think that is just wonderful
now as far as i'm concerned i have several other children
and so uh i think at this point to fit it into to other things it's kind of a task
you know uh it's not to where i'm just so freed up that i i just go oh this is wonderful
and a lot of times tonight we won't finish with the football game till around nine thirty
so we will just go out after that
so my kids luckily are old enough i can leave them at home alone while i go out and walk
now does your husband usually go with you then
oh see now that's really nice
and and he's not really into it
so i have to
and his doctor said he needed to lose weight and exercise
so once he got motivated now he's ready to walk every night
and our dog has lost a little weight
so he gets excited when he sees us put on our our shoes our walking shoes
and and you know i think this after you've done it a certain amount of time it kind of does get to be a routine
like when i first started it you know that was the hardest thing was to get ready and get out there
but now if i haven't done it in a day or two or something i really notice that i haven't done it in a
you know and i like the time because my kids sometimes they come with me
and sometimes they don't
and when they don't i i really notice you know how fun it can be when they come
so uh i like to have somebody come with me
uh i know most of enough of the people that if anything ever happened i could go to a home around this block area
so it it's not real dangerous
but still i don't like to go alone
you know it's nice to have another person there
and sometimes it's my kids
well i think that's great
i and well sometimes when i i take my kids to the playground that's the only other exercise i i really think i do
uh i found real quick that wasn't for me
and it just wore me out
and i got to the point i dreaded going in
and it doesn't cost anything
and it gives me time to think
so i think not only does it help my body
but i think it helps my mind too
so i like that
well i think that's great
well that's what i do for
well i don't know about you
but i was really enjoying the cool snap last couple of weeks
and i'm ready for it to come back
oh you like the rain do you
well not the rain so much as the cool the other mornings when it was like sixty-five when we woke up and sixty-six
and today i know when i got up that the temperature said more like close seventy-nine or eighty so i'm kind of ready for the pumpkin weather
oh are you
well i have a friend who's the same way
and anything below sixty she's just not happy but i i think what i would miss is the change of seasons and all because i know in plano we really don't have as many seasons as uh
and they have more of the four seasons
and i'm from utah
so i i like
oh you're used to that too
well i usually like it about sweater weather
and the problem here in plano is it doesn't last very long
and then you get a couple of weeks of that indian summer
and then it's cold and i wish it were several months of that
the thing the other thing is the i don't like the rain either
well i don't either unless it's like uh
some of my favorite's like a friday night when it rains
and you really didn't have anywhere to go
and it's sleeping time
but if you have to get up and get out in it i don't like it either
and so it always makes their games be postponed forever and ever and ever on on and on
well sure it does
and also the evenings are going to be getting uh darker sooner becau- as it gets cooler
but i did a walk last night
and it seemed like it was a little bit hot still
well i agree absolutely
and you know it's all relative
because i was from west texas
and it was very dry
and so i thought dallas was awful
and i still think so
but then this summer we went to orlando for a week
and it was so humid there that your um all your windows were fr- were wet every morning
and when we got back to dallas it seemed really dry
but i agree with you
oh is that right
well i guess i can't say that it i don't like the rain completely
and and so it really helps our garden
and you know even i don't know if that's because plants are just that way
and they like rain
or it seems they thrive when it rains
so uh but i i am ready for a little bit of the cooler weather and not so much in the nineties but something like
i guess my my best would be probably sixty-eight when you wake up or sixty-six and then probably seventy-five during the day
well i like seventies i like seventies okay
are you do you like the heat in the summer then when it gets up in the nineties and hundreds
oh i don't like nineties
you can give me seventies and you can give me eighties and i'm okay
well i do too
but when it gets too hot then it's that i don't like that i stay in the house because it's just it's just too hot
i do too and that was one thing about the year around school that originally we had been sort of negative on it
but then we started thinking especially in plano the weather
um i've i've thought about that too
and um when we take our vacations we we do take them in august sometimes so that we can be away from here
when it gets way too hot and we've been here for several years
and we've been here years when it's been hundreds
in fact this morning when they were talking about uh harold taft they were talking about how this has been one of the milder of the summers and milder fall
and you can tell when they talk about beautiful weather some mornings when we're it'll be too cold
and they'll say
well those are the ones that like the cold weather
he he always did such a good job i thought
it was it was really a shame
anyway um i guess it's
oh is that right
yeah you don't have to wait for them to say cut off your time
well then have a good day
and i hope you enjoy the weather this week
uh- well about nursing homes
and and older people
uh my husband has a grandmother that lives with his mother and they're just really close here
and his mother has bad health too
and so i go over sometimes in the day when he's at work
and i um help with her and bathe her and feed her
and uh and i that's hard to be a caretaker i really believe
oh it's very difficult
uh i- she has alzheimer's and does not remember uh a lot if anything
and so she asks the same questions over and over again which is not un- you know unrealistic
um and so you just have to try and be patient and answer them again or just answer another question
uh i uh
and just bring the kids in the family
and just come over and and visit grandma because she gets very disoriented
uh my see my father is ninety-two
oh i think that's wonderful
and still uh he and mother still live at the house and drive and and do the whole thing
but you know if something would uh whenever something happens to one of them then
i i just know that too many horror stories about nursing homes
and i could i i know i know stories for sure that they just they they just well they can't take the proper care of them
and uh it's it's tragic that you know when people live so long that they uh don't have a pla- really don't have a place to go
uh i think it's wonderful these these places that aren't nursing homes necessarily
but they can go and reside there like little apartments
and i like that idea if they can handle it themselves
but uh i think it would be nice
but my dad's the type he wouldn't want to spend the money on anything
so uh i mean he's from that old depression era
and uh you know it's oh it's just blissfull that they're both
i would imagine that i'll uh if something happens i'll move one of them or bot- you know in in with me
but i know a lot of people have said that and then find out how tough it is
and but i think you'd have to really
they also wanted us to talk about you'd have to really check on the uh on this homes
but i just don't know how much you can see when you go for a
and so many people when they put people in the nurses home they never see them
i've talked to many uh owners of places and say that nobody even
maybe maybe christmas
you know um i i think nursing homes are are um some are good i have to say that
but for the most part i truly believe that the parents would be better if they were with the children
oh i do too
or if i- if they could be real real nearby where they could see them everyday or so
uh because i know governor richards is really upset about what she's finding in the nursing ho- homes uh regulation in texas
so maybe we'll get it improved
you know it's i think it's very difficult in the first place to make that choice to have them go there
oh it's tough i'm sure
and then if you find out that they are not having good care you know i'm sure that it is just you know you'd pull them out of there so fast
and uh and yet if you didn't feel like you could be a good caretaker i don't uh
and it's one that needs a great deal of thought
and especially if you're not a person that is like a medical person maybe or something that the person needs medical treatment
now i know a friend of mine who had a father uh she brought to her home uh to live there
but he needed the medical treatment
and she had a nursing person come in like three times a week to to help him out
and that might be a partial solution
but um i personally am for the trying it at home caretaker part before i think i'd ever
and uh it's good to hear from you
have you faced uh elderly care yet uh nursing home care for any of your parents
uh in fact tonight i had the dinner with uh my three brothers and our wives
and we were talking uh
and uh we had a review today
and a few things we had to do that
and it's not
but i guess we all do
i think sooner or later uh
and they were to the point that they only lived both of them about six weeks once they got in
and it's absolutely i believe that was one of the hardest things i ever did
i that it just you know it's absolutely devastating
uh we've you know we've looked around
and my wife has looked at extensively at all the ones in the area
and the one she is in now uh there's a lot of drawbacks a lot of things we don't like
but again it's no different than every one
and you know the cost of it the three thousand dollars a month when you think about it for what you're paying a hospital for almost the same well even not as much care
uh there well there's a little bit of difference in in the two between my mother and my mother-in-law
and uh theirs both ran
oh i think my mother-in-law's was like fifteen hundred
and my mother's was two thousand
then this has been five years ago
and uh uh one of the things that you know i had discovered is that if they knew that i came in there at all different hours they got much better care than if
and they knew
and if i'd pop in unexpectedly i discovered you know they did a little bit they did better
you know uh-huh
and you know a couple of times with my mother-in-law i would catch something not being taken care of
and you know would have to rate
so i got to where i knew then when my mother was in that you know not to go the same time all the time
and when i was looking for the nursing homes another thing that i learned uh
and for some reason i just went back and on my own went around the different floors
and i saw areas that they had not shown me
well i'll be darned
and they did not come across as well as you know what they had originally shown me
so uh we did not put her in that one
we put her in another one that i i went a couple of times when they weren't expecting me and saw and you know was much uh better pleased with the situation
you you know this is the whole point
i know my mother's in now in a unit that's mainly alzheimer's and uh we're convinced that she probably would be better off in a geriatric
uh the fact that these people are
but they're they're it's reminds me too much of an asylum type s- situation
and it's very very
well who knows
they call it uh dementia
and uh we don't know
i i mean she does not know us anymore and whether it's alzheimer's or what it is nobody really knows
but it's basically the same
and her health is not that bad
although she has gone down downhill drastically since this this last
well she had been in a retirement community
and somewhere in the back of her mind she had it that she would live with her children
well she we we just did not have the capabilities to to take care of her
and uh but she she has gone down steadily since she has been in
and she's been in the nursing home now for
and that she could she could handle a hospital
and we says you know mom if you you know if you get a you get better you've got to have the care the doctor insisted on it you know if you get better that you could come out
well one of the cars i'm thinking about buying next is uh a nice safe small car
but um uh the reason being is we just purchased a van a little while ago because we have a big family
and we use that to get back and forth and haul kids around and so forth
and we have another four door car that i drive to work
and i think it'd be more economical if i were able to a smaller car and uh wouldn't be wouldn't cost much with gas
what what are you looking at
well i'm really not looking at anything for a while
but you know when you're driving down the road you see all these pretty new ones that are out
and you think oh well maybe maybe i would like a new car
but i think i'll be driving mine about two or three more years anyway
well the cost of new cars recently are extremely outrageous for the
i sure do like the looks of that new mit- mitsubishi diamante
but um i uh you know the the costs of a new car and those new models are extremely out of our price range right now
the last one i bought i bought a uh
well it's a it's a town car
but it was a demo returned and i got it with like you know i think it was like fourteen thousand miles on it and nearly ten thousand dollars of- less than what the list price was
so i was really pleased to find that
and i then i bought it for cheaper
i was looking at a honda accord a brand new one and i bought this uh the the lincoln town car for just a little less money than what i was going to buy the new honda accord
well you get a much bigger better comfortable ride
and the thing about it is they give you that ten uh that hundred thousand mi- mile five year warranty where it only costs you twenty-five dollars to have anything repaired
well that's fantastic
so uh i have really been impressed
to find another one that i can afford you know
but i have loved this car better than anything i've ever driven because you can go on the road and get there
and you're not even tired
very comfortable smooth ride huh
and it gets like twenty-six miles to the gallon on the road
oh it does
that's that's unbelievable for that size of car
i they kept telling me that
and i thought they're crazy
so the week after i got it well actually before i signed the papers on it i took it over to boozier city and it did it
but it's uh
that kind of gas mileage uh we're we're kind of hoping for on our van
well that's kind of what we've always been told you know they'll do
and then we hope for it
and it never happens but it really it does get good gas mileage
well that's excellent
most of the time when i don't go anywhere i can drive it for like three weeks from to and from work you know and then fill it up
do you uh do does it uh need a lot of repairs
i've taken it in twice for like just really minor things
and it cost me the twenty-five dollars
the uh really something really silly when we first got it
they have all these lights in the car and it has this fancy little light that gives you a reading light for the passengers in the back seat and we couldn't get the light to turn off
and we kept trying you know
and we went out to dinner with some friends
and it stayed on all night you know just shining right down on them you know and we couldn't get it to turn off
and the next day my husband goes out there
and he tries to get it off
we turn the knob you know in the front that's supposed to turn the lights on and off
and we turned everything we could
and he took it in
and they said you know you just have to press the switch
and i can't get the light off
so they took it in and charged us the twenty-five dollars
and they called and told us though that all you have to do is turn the off switch
and they showed us where the switch was
they charged you twenty-five dollars just to tell you that huh
they they thought there was really something wrong with it when he told them he had already done the switch
oh so they probably went through the
but he hadn't he hadn't done the right one
and it's right on the arm rest in the back and we didn't know it was there
and the guy hit it with his arm when he got in the car
but we've had just uh
and uh it's been in two maybe three times
but it's just been real minor things
well i think that uh you have an excellent deal then
and the the company is able probably to offer that kind of warranty on the car because they know it's so well built that they don't expect any kind of major repairs whereas with an awful lot of other lower quality cars you would be getting repairs after repair after repair and those companies wouldn't be able to afford that for that kind of extended warranty or warranty at all
but it's really it's been an enjoyable car
like i say i'll probably never be able to have another one because i think we bought it for about sixteen thousand you know and i said i'll never find another one for that price
and they keep going up
so i'll have to enjoy it
well i guess i stand on uh on probably ten for no uh restrictions
i uh recently just moved to texas from uh south dakota and nebraska
and i realize that probably way back when when the constitution was written it probably regarded uh more uh of a national defense uh than anything else
but uh on the other hand too uh people then uh needed to use firearms for um survival in terms of uh food and uh i was raised uh you know hunting all the time
i lived on the farm and uh you know enjoy hunting
and i guess i have uh some problems with uh being restricted to um owning a gun for you know hunting purposes mainly
and um it scares me a little bit to think that they would begin restricting gun control to the point where um eventually we may not be able to have that right any more
i can i can understand that
and of course being oklahoman and texan uh
and i used to things in my father and my husband having guns and all
and i i did used to be all in favor of it
but it's all of a sudden it's starting to get really scary with these gangs
but because i know that's not going to happen then i have to probably right up there about an eight
it uh moving to this area of course it happens everywhere
but uh i guess we're pretty naive coming from small towns uh in the midwest and then uh moving to a larger city where there are drive-by shootings
and uh there seems like killing for no reason at all
well it just seems like in the past three or four years it has just gotten so much worse than it was
there's always been a certain amount of crime in your you know your urban areas
and i know we lived in chicago for seven years
and of course it was definitely there
so when we first moved here it wasn't as bad as this
it's you know it's just getting all of a sudden so much worse
i don't know whether it's due to the drugs and the uh drug kings that are here and jamaican drug kings coming in
and yet i hate the government constantly telling me what i can do and what i can't do
and that's basically what the gun control would end up being
i i think so
and and there's always the uh the uh the old uh saying that keeps coming up that if a person wants a gun bad enough they'll they'll get one
and uh and then uh
well it's very true
it's not the law abiding citizen that you know is is dangerous with the gun
and i said i think the only way i would be in big favor of gun control is if they could absolutely guarantee that nobody would have them
and i think that would almost have to go with armies too
i mean they'd have to be almost world-wide which we know would never ever happen
because even if you said okay
you know armed forces could have them
and uh and you know uh i suppose uh years ago way back when uh when uh they had the revolutionary war and people decided that they uh were fed up with the government uh
and if they didn't have a way to uh to fight back
uh what about uh what do you think of this this uh law that they're putting into effect that you have to wait x number of days before you can uh carry the gun or buy you know actually purchase the gun
well you know they introduced some gun control back when i was a teenager i believe in terms of uh every gun you ha- bought had to be licensed i believe
and uh you know that didn't bother me uh too much
and so i guess it depends um if there are some statistics that show that uh that people uh commit crimes on the spur of the moment
uh i guess our topic is about movies and uh what is coincidence
and we went to the movies that past weekend
oh so did i
oh i heard that was excellent
uh i wanted to see that
i was deciding between that and uh my girl
and uh my boyfriend and i went to see my girl
oh how was that
oh it was excellent
i heard that's a movie that uh you really can't take children
uh i heard the opposite that uh you should take children to see it
uh i don't know though
i i've heard that and then what you just told me
because uh the little boy dies
but uh his it kind of shows how his uh best friend this little girl deals with his death and how i think maybe how children should deal with death
but it was really good
well cape fear was was more suspenseful
so that that's that's a real good movie to see
i heard it was uh sort of like uh not uh too violent
but it was kind of like uh gross kind of like uh silence of the lambs like
and it uh it was kind of
but it's not it's not as bad as silence of the lambs
but uh it's just as suspenseful i think
and it it was a real good movie
and then we saw beauty and the beast
oh i've seen uh
so and then oh boy it's been it's been so long since we've been to the movies
but i we've rented some videos
and i think the last one i rented was uh mortal thoughts with demi moore
oh i i didn't see that
and uh that that that's okay
oh and uh what about bob
that that was cute
and uh uh i guess that's about it
so do you go to the movies often
i i hadn't been to the movies for a really long time since last weekend
but uh there's been movies out that i've been wanting to see
i just you know don't get a chance to get out and see them
well we have two little kids
so it's hard for us to get out and go to the movies
and we try and do
and i don't i don't know about the last movie i've seen on t v that was real good uh
oh i watched that movie with uh
that uh her sister got killed
and he had murdered her
that was that was pretty good
oh valerie bertinelli
i saw that one uh two part series
and i heard it was a true story
and and then i saw that other movie about uh mother daught- mother wife murderer
oh uh with uh judith light
that was was really good
boy we have
i like uh the true stories
and it's hard to believe that you know this really happened
but and we don't really
d- do you all have do you all still have drive-ins up there
um well we may have just a couple over here
i i believe that uh the american public and i as an individual and private citizen have a right to to bear arms and to have a gun as long as i uh am responsible with it and protect the safety and welfare of my kids
and and so that they're not playing with it and so that they can't hurt themselves or anyone else playing with it
i think that education with a gun is is critical and important
uh however i do believe that uh guns ought to be maintained and and controlled that you can't go out and just buy one off the corner and do whatever you want with it because people that are angry or have concerns or want to seek vengeance right away have easy access to guns
and in the heat of the moment they can go and do some damage that can hurt themselves and other people
so on a scale of one to ten i i think i would rate myself as a in the six or seven or eight
but i think that there ought to be some control
but i still think that uh individuals have a right
well so let me make sure
so you think that uh maybe a five day waiting period for handguns or that stuff would be legitimate
well i don't know if a five day waiting period would be legitimate
uh that uh that might cool down some tempers
i think a a one day would be sufficient
and if you see an awful lot of exhibits and things and if you would like to purchase a gun if that five day waiting period were in effect you wouldn't be able to purchase one at that gun show
uh you just you would be able to buy it
but they'd just have to mail it to you i suppose huh
well i don't think you can mail thing guns through the mail
i think that's a against the law ever since kennedy was assassinated
so how do you feel about guns
and i think that's the problem that we need to address is why these people want to kill other people rather than the instrument they particularly used in the assault whether you know
well do you think that there will continue to always be crazies
then uh how do you propose that we prohibit those types of individuals from gaining access to guns
well we have some laws on the books that uh don't allow convicted felons to purchase guns if i understand correctly
and uh i would agree
a a short waiting period would be appropriate to uh take care of the heat of the moment type things
but uh i think banning semiautomatic twenty-two rifles is a a bit on the extreme side
and a total ban on guns would just leave guns in the hands of criminals who don't care what the rules are anyway
do you uh do you feel there is a need in the world today to have a an automatic handgun
o- or you could do it just for fun you know kind of like a game
well i think that the the police uh or law enforcement have a need because of the tight quarters they might find themselves
but the public i don't know
uh but i think a person needs a way of defending themselves
and just he took care of it
and he uh saved himself in the in the in the process also
so how is work going
they that's uh that's prohibited where we work
although down here in texas uh you do have a right to to wear and carry arms with you at all times
that's still that's still you can still do that down here
can they be is it concealed
or does it have to
oh you can't
has to be in sight so that uh you know that you're not uh a menace or a problem to individuals
and should we go ahead and and keep exploring
or should we call a halt to it
now i think what we made a major wrong turn when we went into the uh to the current generation of space craft the reusable ones like they are now because they have not proven as reliable as they should have
and i think some of the earlier approaches were much more uh much better in many ways
however uh you know we've gained an awful lot from the space program all the way from remote monitoring to teflon to uh some new space age materials plastics and all that
so i think it's been a good investment
uh somebody was telling me the return was about twenty-five or thirty dollars for every dollar spent which is amazing for any governmental financed program
i think though that now that we're finally starting to get over the fears and the uh oh i don't know the guilt that we had out of uh challenger
but i i don't know
and you know you know and i'm in favor of you know getting closer to seeing certain things
but i'd like to see them also go you know go back up there see you know what they can do see about setting a space station up
and i don't think we should stop
and i don't think we should cut the money
well where do you think we ought to go with it
you talking about uh uh a fully manned space station that we'll keep up there
i would like i'd like to see that
i'd like for us to really find out more about the actual universe and get up there and see what's going on even if you know there's no life up there or anything you know
but who knows
and i would like to see them do something like that
i i hate to see them just you know keep getting diverted off to spying on other nations and putting up defense things
and i think they i think they lose sight of of probably what they're supposed to be doing
well i think about half the nations now are are military related are they not
it seems like it's that high a percentage
you know let's go back to our original thing with you know our experiments and all the you know our actual exploring of space and and all that
and you know with with russia uh seemingly not going to be as big a threat
well it can't afford to
huh-uh you know
have you gone out to uh fort worth to see the space soviet space exhibit
we it's only going to be there a couple of more weeks
we went uh
we took our grandsons and went uh the weekend before last
and it is marvelous
i mean it's really neat how they they have done it
and they have a uh scaled down model showing how they you know fuel it or you know how they uh oh the fuel trucks and things run out there to it and how they uh
all the things that are against the actual space mission uh space ship you know how they fall away from it
and the loading of it and then it's actually you know
well maybe i need to run out there this weekend
it's it's well worth the time and effort
we went uh early on sunday
we got out there about uh ten ten thirty
now do you have to have tickets ahead
and if you have children if you go to mcdonald's you co- they have coupons or did have
now they may be through with them now
but uh buy one adult
and one child gets in free
um i think both of my kids are too old for that they're both uh
well i had grandchildren
because their dad was at work
and uh but and the boys loved it you know
and i felt the uh six year old would you know that he'd be kind of bored
but he wasn't
even the three year old enjoyed it because they had one had one of those moon vehicles and had it so it looked like it was on the moon and showed it moving around and stuff
so it was really neat
well see that's something else
the russians have had space stations manned stat- space stations for years now
you know they had the merv and see we've yet to keep anyone up over over a week or ten days
well in going through it i got the impression that actually they were farther ahead
they're talking about uh
well actually probably any government
so uh so what do you what do you think in the short term we should be doing to to improve it
well i saw a program on uh recently
and and it said every time they cut you know like fifty-five million dollars on a certain thing then they brag about how much money they cut
and then they go and spend that money somewhere else and that's why the budget is never balanced
and they spend it somewhere else or they you know they pad out their staff or you know spend it in bounced checks at the
i'm getting pretty kind of disgusted with the uh uh you know the fact that they're counting a reduced deficit as being some big step
i mean first of all we were we've already hit the largest deficit this proposed budget has the largest deficit ever
and two a deficit is i mean the deficit is only uh is is as far from a balanced budget
you you're still not you're still not you're still overspending
i mean it's just the amount that you're overspending
and this is
it seems like like the goal is to reduce the deficit to some you know still outrageous amount um
i i i think in the long term something is going to have to be done with uh sort of the the uh
well i mean it seems to be kind of inherent in the political process right that you've got uh people you know trying to
and uh there isn't any sort of overall accountability
and and uh i don't know
i i suppose that that that the only kind of solution ultimately that we're going to have is is is exposure and information
and i don't know that in general the american people are that interested you know to listen to to as much uh uh you know
i mean you're going to have to know what people are doing and uh you know and how and how how partisan and how
and then we can throw in some highway bill
or you can throw
and uh it's a pretty vicious uh vicious cycle
well i think they should they should limit the senate to one term one six year term
i uh my my dad was always a pro- proponent of that
he uh he felt that that would get people involved who were who were interested in being public servants as opposed to personal servants
and and don't let them come back
and and uh keep congress to um two terms of two years a piece and then it'll be overturning
and they won't have the same people there all the time and then all the special interest groups will have to renegotiate all of their their payoffs and kickbacks
and that'll keep them busy enough so that they won't have as much influence
because that's one of the things one of the biggest things is that uh the fact that they're always trying to lean somebody toward one way or another whether it's the oil companies or the automotive companies and like the air bag thing
the air bag came out what twenty years ago
and only now they're getting that put in cars
and the oil companies are really aren't responsible you know
and then the government doesn't jump on them hard enough to make them do anything
i think i think that that's probably right
because in terms of long term you just got to get people um
i mean uh at one point at least on a local level um going into politics is you know what you're doing is is really trying to serve the community right
i mean you don't expect to make any money out of it
you know maybe you gain a little bit of local fame
but but it's uh you put in a lot of work in exchange for that
and i don't have the feeling that national level politicians are are at all like that
and uh you know i think that that that the problem with having you know junior people coming in all the time is that you end up kind of wasting a lot of time with uh you know with in- inept politicians or people who don't know how to deal with it
but on the other hand maybe that's
um we have small children two and four and so we our dining is very limited
oh we're past that now
um we're more
like um you know like wyatt's cafeteria
oh is that right
and the kids just love everything that's there
so we're pretty fortunate
kind of um buffet style uh
that's that's good
so you can go in and go out
and the food's already served
and you don't have to wait
and it's already in front of them when you sit down
and things like um souper salads you know
it's again it's buffet
and it's already prepared
and just things any any eating area that you just don't have to wait an extreme amount of time
we got we got three kids too
and when the kids are small if you going to wait you don't go out
and it was terrible
we we waited almost
and you had
and it was we were ready to go home
and you had the kids with you
and they waited forty-five minutes
so we we we rarely go eat in those kind of eating uh situations any more
but we do love to eat out
and um and we do it as often as we can
and and times that we do have baby-sitters we we try and catch um some things that we normally wouldn't do you know
where where do you like to go when you got a baby-sitter
oh um let me see uh for new year's we went to eat at uncle julio's
it's um on on walnut and greenville
what what are they what kind of
um basically mexican food
and it's supposed to be very similar to um uh
it's a um it's a mexican restaurant off of central
well there's a zillion of them
but i've heard about it
but the original was on northwest highway uh just the other west of loop twelve
if you like mexican stuff it's it's a good place
we like um seafood also
you you ever been to vincent's
you ever been tried a place called louisiana purchase
well this is in plano
but it's on uh parker and central expressway and it's it's ca-
if you like it kind of hot that that is good food
we've been to um chefalia's
like around i think it's a little past or it's right before midway or it's right at midway
and um excellent food
and we've we've been going to all sorts of weird type places with it
what what is that
well you get uh one free
and you you you pay for one now and type thing
we've been to from barbecue to
uh that is if you like continental stuff that is really nice
talk talk your husband into taking you there some night
i mean it's not a cheap place
but uh it's very nice
and where is that
uh it's on campbell it it's north of campbell but uh off central uh oh it used to be a northern telecom building in the ba- in the ground floor
but it it's a big tall it's the tallest building on the west side northwest side of campbell and just before you get to campbell and it's in the lower floor
but it's really a nice restaurant if you like continental stuff
and tell him to take you there for your anniversary
and then they got a place where you can dance you know and all that kind of stuff
well my birthday's coming up
now there's if you like cont-
i i like continental stuff myself
but i like that
and that's down in the the stoneleigh hotel now
and that is really super kind of stuff too take if you like continental at all that kind of stuff either one of those two you go through a hundred bucks without half trying
but it it's it's nice really nice place
oh you don't have to spend that much
so how do you use your credit cards
oh we use them for
paying our gas and for paying uh just about anything because um we don't like to pay for our checks
so we use it quite a bit but we we pay off every month though
so we never have to pay interest
and we always we never get the the credit cards if there's a monthly or a yearly charge
so we never have to pay anything extra
i won't use one that i have to pay an annual fee you know and um i'm uh like you i i use it well to buy my gas with
my sh- my shell credit card i use that
and then like my emporium card and uh weinstocks card i use that
but i'm like you
see well you i don't do it either
you know it's just really weird
but i i don't carry a lot of cash with me because i'm always afraid that someone's going to steal my purse
i mean it's a rare day when i even have seventy-five cents in my purse
you know enough for a phone call
and that's about all
but uh other than that that's the that's the way i use them
i know some people that uses them so bad that every one of them that they've got they c- they can't charge any more
and i think that's terrible
because it's really it helps your if you have good credit you know it helps you in the long run when you want to go make a bigger purchase or something
because if anything ever happens that you do need to you know you have excellent credit
why it really does help
and i think it's more convenient too in a lot of cases
like whenever we go on trips we always you know use our our visa or our mastercard or whatever
and then um you know we really don't have to pay for it out of our own pockets until about a month later and so it helps us gain interest in the bank that when we do it
we come out a lit- even a little bit ahead because we've been able to use whatever first off and then pay for it later
well i think it's better to use credit cards too like i say because yo- there's so many people around any more that's watching what you're doing and if you pull a wad of money out of your pocket they're going to hit you over the head
it just uh you know it just seems like they're somebody's always watching
so i just don't i don't carry money
i'd just soon use my credit cards and just pay them off you know
and also if you if someone did happen to steal your credit card my husband was saying that if you know you notice it within i think it's twenty-four hours you can report it in
and i he said the most you'd ever have to pay is fifty dollars for them to cancel you know whatever payments you had
and if whoever tried to uh you know credit it to the hilt you'd only have to pay fifty dollars of it
and then you know you can have your card back with pretty good rating you know because you can pay fifty dollars but not you know maybe five thousand or whatever
and you know some of those stores don't even seem to check your signature or anything you know
but i notice that some of them don't even look you know
they just slide it in there and pass it back to you you know
so i don't think that's right
i think they should check it to make sure that the signature at least matches you know
i mean it's just a precaution for everybody
well let's see
oh i also use like to use discover when i can because they give you some money back every year
i don't i don't uh
that that's that sears discovery card
now i don't have that one you know
well we just started doing that
and you know what
it comes in handy for when you're buying things like um tickets for the train or um airplanes because they'll give you some money back you know
and it's only a little bit
but i mean it's still something
we got two fifty last year and so it's you know it helps out here and there
oh you mean uh for for your using your credit card you get like a rebate or something
they give you i think they start giving you like a half a percent back which doesn't sound like a thing
but when you you know when you add up everything you've you've charged up on the discover card for a year and they give you a half percent of that
and that adds up to you know two fifty or something
oh i see
and so that's what
and i know we're going to get back more this year because they you know we spent a little bit more probably
um i see
and they do it for how long you've been a member i think too and they increase the percentage a little bit
do you exercise uh during the day time or go to a gym or anything
i i used to go to a gym um last summer
but then i started school again
so it's um so i don't exercise as much as i'd like
but i i do enjoy um going to a gym and working out
or just like i do sit ups sometimes before i go to bed or when i wake up
and i ride a exercise bike a lot
well i try to do it at night before i go to bed
um it's really weird
because i'll get down on the floor
and i'll holler and tell my cat nikki
and she can be upstairs in the bedroom
and i don't know
you know pretty soon here she comes
so i lay out there in the living room floor and do my exercises you know
uh i had a problem with my back
so when i went to physical therapy they gave me some exercises for my back
so i just try to keep that up because it seems like if i don't then then my back gives me a problem again
so i try to do it every night
oh that's good
it seems like it's you know
i can tell when i do it and when i don't do it you know
so you know it's got to be good for you
but um a long time ago i belonged to a gym but uh now i notice that this in this small city that i live in they do have a a gym that just opened up here about a month ago
so i was kind of thinking about joining it
but i haven't even gone down there and talked to them yet
but uh it does really make you feel good
and i like to bicycle too
so that gives you you know lots of exercise
i um bike in the summer
and um we go on a like fifty to a hundred miles every sunday
oh my goodness
otherwise you wouldn't be able to go very far huh
but i'm not that energetic
well like i say i just do it at night you know
do you like you try try to get my stomach muscles toned up
you know because boy they seem like they really get out of shape
and once you get out of shape it's hard to get back into shape you know
so i've just been doing it i try to do it every night you know
like i say you just i'd rather do that than watch television anyhow you know
so it's just kind of nice and especially when i have my cat that comes down and joins me
you know so well i guess that's about all i can tell you about my exercising
but i don't
so i don't go swimming
um i don't swim much neither
but they do say that swimming is really really good for you you know for every part of your body
so i wished i i wished i did know how to do that
if they had a pool here in patterson i'd probably you know put my bathing suit on and go down there
but they don't have a pool in this small city either
so well listen then
do you uh do any woodworking
and i really love it um
oh um what do you do
i do it for a hobby and i have my own equipment
and i have a jig saw and a scroll saw and uh in the process of getting a router and so i like to cut out my wood and then tole paint on the items that i cut out
well i'm not the one that cuts them out
my husband cuts them out but uh he likes using the little band saws and jig saws more than the stroll saw because the stroll saw is is a lot slower and then uh he's got a router
but now he wants a plunge router
but anyhow he cuts them out
and then i i took a tole painting class to learn how to paint them right you know
and what we want to do is you know make them and then maybe take them to these craft shows or flea market things and s- and see if we can sell some of them
but uh i really like it so far
oh that is fun
and then my neighbor had a little doll made out of wood so i took a pattern off of that
and then it's just a wooden doll with a painted face and then you you make the dress for it
and you drill holes around the top of the head
and you you stick in uh like rope and tie ribbons around it
it looked really cute you know
so i've got a couple of those started
and then uh but as far as wood work that's all we've been doing right now
oh that is that sounds really fun
well they have a really fancy boutique out here in ogden utah and i just got back from that today
so if you could get your projects into boutiques oh they are wonderful
you just they buy them from you
or you just given them to them on consignment or something
like that boutique um they take oh what was it twenty percent of the sell price
um i see
you would put your sell price uh and then they would take twenty percent off of that at the counter
and so then at the end of the boutique which usually runs for a week then they give you what you earned
so you have to decide what your price is going to be and then up it twenty percent so you can get what you need out of it
so if the customers are willing to pay it then you get a profit
oh these little things are so cute though you know
i i have seen those
i went through some of the books down here at the craft shop you know and uh there's a lots of little things you can get to cut out
oh that's what i want is a shop smith
we well gene's got one of those too
oh does he
oh that's my ultimate dream
oh you're lucky
well uh he's retired now and uh i'm kind of semi retired
so i'm drawing my pension from them
but i'm still looking for a part time job you know
but uh he has all day long that he can you know work on this stuff and do do cut outs like that
and he's got a lot a lot of tools
oh how nice
it's just it's just getting started you know
but um these little wooden things they seem to sell really good
um i know a lot of people that have gotten them you know
my next door neighbor every time she sees something she thinks it's so cute she wants to buy it you know
so i'm just hoping that you know that we can get some cut out and painted you know before summer starts because we don't want to have garage sales or anything like that in the winter time you know
well how is the market for things like that in california
it seems it seems like they go real good you know
i mean the country anyhow out here and i live out in the valley and country seems to be the in thing out here you know
so anything that looks like it might be country is what they want you know
they just snap it right up huh
and uh this little rabbit that i made in uh tole painting class you know is like a welcome
it's got a it's going to have little wooden hearts holding it in its hands and then welcome written on those little wooden hearts
and i think large corporations can give better benefits than small corporations because right now i'm working for a very small corporation where the owner is right there
and uh there is a lot of profit that's coming in
but when it comes to uh small corporations they seem to pocket it a little bit quick quickly or whatever or however you want to say it
and uh the benefits aren't as great when i worked for a big corporation because the big corporations seem to look at its employees and say okay
you have uh better vacation plans uh
you have just in general maternity leave plans tha- that kind of thing
big corporations are able to do that versus small corporations uh you know
so i've worked for both big and small
so i've had a chance to kind of take a look at uh the pros and cons of both
well i've worked for uh well i worked for h and r block here in massachusetts for awhile
and the only
they even hate to give out unemployment at the end of tax season because they you know they're fairly even though they're a large scale company they're very the offices the individual offices are very small and now i work for the framingham
and uh we have much better benefits you know in the system
uh let me see we have a profit sharing plan to a degree
that's pretty good for you know being a a school district type program
and we have the eye glasses the health care and the whole kit and caboodle because what they did is they threw all the town employees in together
like the small corporation that i work for there's no pension plan there's no type of uh savings of any sort that the company will reimburse you for
i think you're allowed so many times uh i think two or three days a w- a year
it's not accumulative type of sick leave uh you know things like that
so i've been looking at big corporations and saying the big corporation that i've worked for in the past had the pension plans had the big health health care uh
and you didn't have to pay in as much as if you go to a a very small place
uh they don't have as good as insurance packages as big corporations
my father's retired from the town of framingham and he said that they haven't gotten a a cost of living raise in over five years
and he said that's the only thing that really stinks as far as being retired
and but i hear that bill is in the senate right now
and it's hopefully will go through
but uh you know i think the schools are at where the schools isn't just the school system and not just the teachers
they took in the whole town plus all you know
uh we have the teachers union which helps out a lot
but the town of framingham pays the benefits
oh that's pretty good
and that's all the town workers water and sewer and where it's a very large town
it's actually should be a city
but they kept it a town
uh where it's extremely large they were able to offer a little bit more which was really great because we don't have to pay a mayor
and that's true
i mean yo- i- it does end up being quite a bit when you have to hire somebody for that position sure
because of most of our you know the town employees as far as uh electoral positions are part-time
so it works out good
well that's it you know
and and i've kind of looked around uh at that uh too
because uh salary wise i don't think i'm making as much with a big corporation because i think when you look at big corps or large
i'm talking like hugh companies like three m uh i'm uh honeywell uh texas instruments
and it's like come on you know
and and of course when it's a small corporation it also wants to expand
so that money is spent
but uh when it comes to telling kids that they have to do uh two or three years of service into some kind of community i don't know if that's appropriate for a government to suggest that and say you know you have to do two years of community service before you can be a citizen
or you know in the aspect that we're telling kids that this is what is suggested for you to do
and uh i as far as a high school course i could see it as uh maybe a social uh sociology course to where a student would get credits if they were to be involved with some kind of community type of program
but to tell them that they had to do two years thereafter post high school of community service i i'm not quite sure if that's appropriate for anybody to be telling somebody they have to do
um well that's a good idea to have it as a study program for school where it be more on a voluntary basis as opposed to uh mandatory
uh i don't think
you know i- it they should have they should have the same rights as anyone else you know
it shouldn't be uh anything shouldn't be mandatory other than i guess like uh when you come to paying taxes or something like that
uh or if it's beneficial in some kind of way then maybe uh people be more eager
i have thought about this on many times when you get these uh young troubled teenagers that uh don't have like the perspective of uh uh of the community a sense of community or perhaps the sense that they may have problems
but there are other people out in the community that may have problems
then i can see it as like maybe a probationary type of thing
if they were you know th- abusive
or if uh they destroyed some property around the uh area then they would have to do uh to restore it and perhaps uh work uh for the community to beautify it or whatever
but i could see that working in
and that's i think they have done that
and judges have said well you know this is what you're going to get for
so i could see that as something that might occur in the court system for those that are troubled
uh that's a good idea
uh i think they should have more programs like that
and i think uh us being taxpayers we pay for uh people that's in jail or in trouble anyway
so they should be programs set up by the government that could utilize those forms in different areas
and i i agree wholeheartedly
but uh the thing is is that's not enough of that kind of stuff going on uh because like you say is a lot of crimes and stuff or misdemeanors so why have someone in year- jail for a year or two for a misdemeanor
and sometimes you know putting them in jail doesn't really help because there's nothing in there that would reb- rehabilitate re- rehabilitate
and there's a lot of anger sure you know especially if they haven't went through treatment
and they dealt with other people in the uh system of prisons which uh you you always deal with somebody that's a little bit worse than yourself
i would say the crimes would probably be you know
so you're dealing with people uh that may uh be an influence later on
and uh an issue of anger would be is that i went to prison for a year or two
but i didn't get any rehabilitation or uh you know but then again those that have physically assaulted somebody uh that's extremely tough to put them into some kind of program out in the community if they're of a violent sort and to say
uh i don't know about you
but uh i work outside the home
and uh in fact
and i work different shifts so are pretty much a later shift to where i don't have i don't have the family time
uh when my husband gets home it's usually he's home with my daughter alone
and then a couple of hours later i'm home
uh i don't know
and uh it seems that business wise uh in the business community or your employers seem to be taking more and more time away from the family
so you know if you do have any time it's kind of like on a rush cycle that you have to get so many other things done uh ju- just to maintain your home and maintain the things outside your home and then plus try to have that relationship with your children
and it it's sometimes a very it it's a very hard juggling act
and you know i look at my daughter
and she's now uh four going to be four
and i keep saying oh jeez i don't have that much time with her
and she's growing fast
and uh i stay home
and uh i know that it it must be really challenging to uh try to juggle a job and and also your children
because i know my husband if i were gone as much as he is we wouldn't have the influence on them that i would want to put on them
and i also notice that the children that come over here to play that go to daycare every day they don't like to be around adults
and they're the very same age as my children
and i'm finding as i volunteer up at the school i just being uh
i'm not educated at all in uh really detecting this
but i can talk to the teacher and tell them on a pretty good basis after i've worked up at the school for a couple of weeks which kids go to daycare and which kids stay home
and you can just tell in their personalities and how they respond to the adults that uh the ones that are are home and the ones even that are at home that are getting the love and attention that they need
they're they are more use to being with their own age kids they're not use to being with adults and to responding to adults
uh i think the trend in the united states
i feel really bad that it's turned so much to where the children are uh
in fact uh i spent the first three years at home with my daughter
so i i guess i felt fairly fortunate that i was able to do that
and i did notice the difference between those of infants being placed in daycare
and i thought to myself how can a mother place her child at the age of six weeks or four weeks or two weeks or three weeks
and you know it's our society saying yes
this uh you need this job
because uh if you look all over in the other countries like europe and that uh their standards of living are a lot less than what ours are
and that's part of it too
but uh like my husband was saying maybe some of the problems we brought on to ourselves is that these women back in the nineteen fifties uh were staying at home with their kids and then made the decision well jeez you know i'll go out and get a part-time job
and then financially they got themselves into well i'll have the boat
and it's nice
and really women past generation women have done it to women of this day and age too uh
because it is now our financial situations are as it almost takes two people to bring in an income to support a family now
and uh it cost us a lot of financial problems doing it
and pretty soon you know you're at the limit where you've got to say okay you've sacrificed for you know so many years at home
and you're not getting any further you know along and you have to make that decision to go back to work part-time or go back to work full-time
and you have to make that decision
and it's a tough one
i think one of the things that people look at too though is uh spen- how they spend their time with their children i think with working moms if you can get them ma- the bosses to give you almost like a rotation like they're going to do with year-round school where you work
so what do you think about it
um i like the idea of nursing homes as a as a growing choi- the choices you have in nursing homes now whereas used to you used to have only you put you know
when when people got to the point where they were debilitated and couldn't take care of themselves and there was no other choice
you know maybe you lived too far away to care for them
or your daily job or whatever prevented it
but um i like the choices you have now where they can go into an apartment type setting and have some basically have a independent life-style but assisted care
and then if things deteriorate they can go to a second level which is you know like where they prepare their meals for them and and they still live somewhat independently
but they have people checking on them and making sure they have hot meals
and then where the same community a lot of times will also have the third level which is full care you know where some people can't where they're in a wheelchair or where they're in a bed
and they can't get around
but then they have full care
but i really like those those options now
and and i think about it more often because my husband's parents are they're very active right now
but they're seventy-five and and seventy-two
so that comes up somewhat more often in my thoughts as i see these things because of their age
um it's it's funny
because um i know people at that are in all three and people that work you know
i know someone that w- works in all three different stages like you said
and i have known you know people close to me that have been in all three
and i have seen them like go from where they're in an apartment building
they we call it um
well we have high rises
and it's just for elderly people you know
or most of most of one of their spouses has already passed away
and it's really nice for them because then they're with people their own age and people that have gone through things exactly what they have gone through
and it's it's really nice to go and see them you know where they can still get around and everything
and they still you know do their own thing
but it's it's really nice to see them because
i mean sometimes
like i had a great aunt
she lived with us for um three months and because she's starting to get alzheimer's disease
and i know i have a bunch of younger brothers and sisters
and i know it was hard for me as well as it was for them to to actually sit down because she doesn't like doing things that the younger kids like doing
so it's really nice to see that
that's some of the things i would find important before i i would look into that for a person is is is like you're saying a good mix of people who have the same interests
and uh and the programs
here they have different uh besides just different levels within the same program they have different types of programs
i this this one area is a bit more expensive
and the people who probably are living there have had more money in their life
but but things that people where they have similar interests
and the programs that they have where where some of them will have dances once a week and some of them sponsor different crafts
and they go to the arboretum to see things
and they make sure that if they want to go to church there's a bus there
and it'll or you know or someone will transport them to a specific church even though it's you know maybe it's thirty minutes away
because it's a big you know dallas area is a big metropolitan area
but a lot of these places have have churches or have have individual transportation
that's that's something i'd look for something that would make me happy personally if i had to live there
because i don't think a lot of people really even in the nice ones and even in the ones where they can live fairly independently they really don't necessarily like it because they're not in their own home
so i think those kinds of things to make it more homelike and to make it more um enjoyable for them that'd that'd be one thing i'd look for along with the uh health care aspects to make sure they had you know that it was clean and that they had good doctors and nurses
um i'm in college
and i'm i'm only twenty-one
but we had a spee- i had a speech class last semester
and there was a girl in my class who did a speech on home care of the elderly
and i was so surprised to hear how many people
like whenever they're in you know the older people they're like um fastened to their beds so they can't get out just because they you know they wander the halls
and they get the wrong medicine just because you know the the aides or whoever just give them the wrong medicine
and so many of them you know are
and it was it was awful to hear what you know what some of these people really went through
and i forget the percentage of people that you know that she had said
and this was i mean she did research on it and everything
that's one of the things that that we don't think about as we get older and the the money that it now requires to uh be in one of these places
or if their children you know passed away before they did they can be in some places that are you know that that are not good
or they they have very minimum minimal care
and the the care that they are getting the people who are giving it are pro- are paid at a minimum wage
and they just do- they don't care as much
and and like you said they're trying to make it the caretakers in some cases are trying to make easy on themselves to the point where they're putting people in bed or overmedicating them so they'll stay in one spot and not do anything
that certainly would be something to to watch for
because you've got with some of them being some of these places can even be two and three thousand dollars a month to stay in
and some- and sometimes they share a room
and it's just a little cubbyhole
and they share it with another person
and they're still paying that much
it it it just sometimes it just seems ridiculous
you've got to really strike a balance in what kind of care what kind of level of care you need and then what you can unfortunately what you can afford at the same time
um i've been lucky
well my mom's um parents they're both in their in their uh eighties
and i was just home for spring break
and my grandma said something to me about she goes well maybe we'll just sell the house
and i was like no
well like there are other communities too that aren't necessarily a nursing home
i had an aunt who lived in a small town in texas that um was in a
it was a it was a housing division
and it was um supplemented
their they were most of them were on social security
and they got some kind of supplemental aid besides from the state government
but it was this little bitty one bedroom house
but it was a separate house
and they had a living room and a bedroom and a kitchen
so they still had they had and they had people who came in who um supervised th- all these houses
were like fifteen or twenty of them all right together kind of like on one block
and they had a a supervisory um
it sounds like uh an apartment or som-
it was it was more like um a headquarters or something anyway where they they staffed it three shifts a day so that someone if they needed someone they could ring
and and someone
and that and they always cooked
then they had they had the choice you know
they had their own possessions still in there to some ex- you know some of them
and they could make their own breakfast if they wanted to and their own dinner
and they always had somebody come in for lunch
but they had people who did you know they didn't have to mess with the yard
and they had a maid that uh uh service that came in and cleaned everybody's house
so they didn't have to worry about that
and it was really a nice it was really a nice compromise especially because she felt like she was still living in her own house
and she still had her own couch and her own bed
and it it really helped a lot
and she was a lot more comfortable
and she didn't resent
see now we've run into a lot of problems where our relatives were
well i've lived here for thirty years
and we've built this and this is our home
and we have nothing else to show for our lives
and we don't want to leave
uh we've run into a lot of that
that's that's why this
she was she felt that way too
but when it helped that she got to still be in a house and still have some of her own stuff
and i guess that that
so it's probably not widely available
that's what like
well um now i know we have an ol-
but it's basically a nursing home too
but everyone has basically their own room
and they're allow- you know th-
but if someone would come to get them you know they're allowed to leave with them
and there's a staff there that makes supper for them
and each person has a chore
like maybe wednesday night it's george's turn to set all the tables
and it's really nice because that keeps them going too rather than just sitting around
and i know um our youth group goes over
and we play bingo with them and you know like stuff like that
an even even if it's just a little bit
so it's it's more like living with a big in a big house where it's your turn to to set the table like you're saying or whatever instead of being waited on hand and foot all the time
but i think before i-
i don't think y- i don't think it's right to just put someone in it
and that's when it's important to really check out the medical aspects of it when you're when you're in something like that
that they'll get the kind of medical care they want without or they need
without doing something to make this you know to keep like you're saying to keep them still to make the staff happy
um but anyway so so as far as
w- we really we don't want to get in the habit of watching a lot of t v because we both were raised you know that way you know where our parents sort of stuck us in front of a t v to be the baby-sitter
and we just don't want that
we want more communication and interaction you know amongst us as a family
and we both like sports
so we figured well what what better way to get out and you know be together as a family and also you know have it be good for you
and plus we like we both like to cook
so you know that's something we spend time together too is you know cooking and uh preparing meals and stuff
so uh but as far as that
well see i'm the third oldest of twelve children
oh my gosh
so like i said i
and i'm only twenty-one
so there's nine that are younger than me
and like i sa- i don't have any children
and i'm getting married in october
and we haven't discussed this at all
but um now i've noticed that like while i'm at college and when i go home my bro- you know my
and um like when when like when i do go home they enjoy just laying around me you know
like if we do watch t v at night they just like enjoy just like laying on top of me or something
but um as far as that goes like we play games
i play like old maid and fish with them
and w- we play board games
and when it's ni-
like i'm from pennsylvania
so when it's nice out we go outside
and we like to play like kick ball and softball and stuff
and in the summer everyone is like i think there's like seven of us still at home
and all seven are in a sport
like also the girls are in softball
and the boys are in baseball
so all summer we live on hamburgers and hot dogs and sports
that's it you know
well do you do you
so you go if you're if you're not doing any kind of sport thing you go to one of your sisters' or brothers' sporting events
and sort of like be there with them
well that's that's good too i mean as far as entering
i mean you're you're participating
but you're not you know
i mean at least you're encouraging them on and stuff
because um even if our kids you know get into sports that we're really not interested in i don't i want them you know to know that we're still there so to speak as a family
well it's funny because um well my mom and dad both were kind of athletic
but although you know it wasn't them playing i notice like whenever i was playing softball and such my mom and dad got into it more than i did
i mean they'd be in the audience screaming and yelling you know
a lot of times the parents get into it just as much as as the kids
and i found like a lot of times like when we went on to tournaments and stuff it was really funny because the crowds would like get into argu- you know get into fights who can scream louder and you know everything
so it's really pretty funny to see my parents get into it
and they're not really even participating
well that that would be fun
boy so you you have a lot of experience as far as you know different ways a family can interact and and do things together
so if you're not
i mean did like some people go to their rooms and
the the one down thing about having that many people in our family is you real- we really don't have any privacy when we're at home because you couldn't possibly have a house with twelve bedrooms
but um like i say you know i'm twenty i'll be twenty-two next month
and i'm closer to the younger kids than i am the ones my own age
and that's i think
that's because we- the ones that are older all have their own little thing to do
and the younger kids are at home
and i like to spend time with them
i don't i don't you know
but when you were growing up and they weren't and the younger ones weren't around what did you do
oh i see
but now that they've all sort of moved off
now that we're getting older people are get- you know each one of us are going our own direction
so do you think even
i mean what did you do when you were younger
and um we you know we had blocks and stuff
like in the winter when it wa-
we couldn't go outside because of the snow and stuff we uh
and we would like do just even stupid things
like we try hurtling our couches and stuff you know and
to see who could jump over you know
and like hide and seek
well we have a a bigger house than a lot you know
so we could like play hide and go seek in our house and even stuff like that
so you you had a lot of games and things you played even when you were kids with the ones that you
well see they're um we're all like we're all pretty close together
like m- my sister that's closest to me we're only fourteen months apart
so there was always there was never just one alone you know
no not real spread in age
so we were all pretty close where we we always had a buddy to play with
is that is that pretty common up there uh in
i don't meet i mean i don't speak with many people that come from families that large any more
i mean my my husband's mother came from a family of thirteen
but i mean that's his mother you know
and and their catholic
and i mean that's
well that's it then i think
probably maybe that that
but i mean do you see yourself having thirteen kids or twelve kids
but see um when i was younger i used to say that i would like to have five
well i've even cut that down now
and um but to me five wasn't even a lot because i was just so used to twelve
it's so it would be really hard now to have twelve children
i would think for your parents it would be it would still be hard even nowadays i mean just to raise twelve kids
well well okay well like my oldest brother he's he's twenty-four
and he put himself through college
and um there's a sister older than me
but she works you know
and i think she even gives mom and dad a little bit you know of rent money
and i'm putting myself through college
and like i'm getting married in october
and my fianc3e and i are paying for most of the wedding
and then then my brother right behind me he moved out
and he has an apartment
and he works
and then the next one down is in the marines
and he's out of the house
so it's kind of like they don't you know
well sometimes i think maybe the larger families create more independence in the children though you know
i i think they do
i mean you don't expect anything because there is not enough to go around for everybody so you you kind of have your own independence on going out and getting it yourself
like uh well i find it a lot when i'm up here at college because i've always had a bank account
i've always had my own checking account since i was in like tenth grade
you know i would work in the summer
and there's a lot of kids up here that would have no idea how to even do a checkbook or you know
to to manage money
like my roommate's
know you know how to get how to even go about getting money
you know how to get a job or you know just what you know what when you get a job what your responsibility is
and see and then my mom and dad like whenever like we would go out and we would get a summer job
and then we would start blowing money
and my mom said well that's stupid for you to be blowing money
so then we when we all graduated from hi- college from high school
we're still like i'm still covered under my mom and dad's life insurance because i'm still in school
but i have my own policy too
so i had a poli-
you know my mom and dad got it set up you know you know helped me to get it and everything
and i have my own policy
and then i pay for my own life insurance too
and then and then like my mom and dad because there's so many of us and because of the way the laws are you know now if we want to drive we have to pay for our own insurance on our cars
because my mom said that's silly to let one of the older one's drive it
if we were in a wreck you know you can be sued for anything now
and she said that's really not fair to the younger kids
and then they can take everything away from my mom and dad
and the little kids would have nothing
and i i agree with her
you know i just i don't know
so if you know if we want to drive we pay our own insurance
so really i think sometimes there's an advantage
i mean sometimes it's good to have a bigger family because it does make you more independent
it makes you know that you can't take anything for granted that when you get something you're lucky to get it so to speak you know
so um i don't know
but now it it is hard i can imagine on your parents you know
so you watch david letterman
well see our favorite t v show
i i i live in a dorm and our favorite t v show is cheers
well we try
like here they show it like every day
and then like on thursdays is the night where the new ones come on
oh that's cool
but we watch it like every day
but i like late night we don't watch uh
and then they show the twilight zone at one thirty
and so we just stay and watch that
i used i used to live in the house that the guy owned
it was really it was really oh well it was all full with uh shelves everywhere
and we didn't have enough books to fill it up
but but uh so what what do you like why do you like david letterman
oh he just like totally sarcastic and hilarious
and i don't know
so and he's got curly hair
and so do i
oh do you watch saturday night live
and so do i
uh i don't know
and this guy asked me to dance
and he goes do you want to dance
he goes oh oh i'm sorry
so but okay so d- wait
with the uh
but i didn't see the rest of it
oh you missed wayne's world
so uh let's see
uh see like all we do here is like every time we walk in the room we turn on the t v because we don't want to do anything like study or anything
so all the all we do is turn
like like when i was in high school i used to do like my homework in front of the t v set
uh kind of annoying
but that's cool
kind of annoying to like in front of t v like trying to do homework you know
trying to write an essay you start talking about you know
well i like i i just i just bogused on all my homework
so it really didn't matter
and i did that all through college
and it worked
so uh let's see
like the news we don't watch
i watched through the war you know
i mean it was like i haven't i seen this episode before you know
but i mean if you watch it for like five minutes then it repeats everything over and over and over
it's like oh man
and and in north c-
see the the thing is like here they just they just give you like local news okay
like a house burned down in this little town
and were here
and i go so what happened worldwide you know
it's like you know even though two hundred and fifty thousand people died somewhere else they're not going to tell you you know
they're going to spend more time on doing a a thing on a on a cross guard who's a hundred and five years old
than they are on anything else you know
so but uh let's see
oh we watch like for example uh
uh i haven't seen it in years
but i used to
well i used to hate star trek
i thought i thought
like when it like when i was like in high school and junior high school i used to hate it but then we started watching it
and and like the new ones are pretty cool because because they got like uh like special like especially things that like fuck with your mind
because what happened is like they have this hologram right
and you can program
and everything looks real
and you can touch everything and stuff
but it's only a program
and it's really great because sometimes it's like the hologram makes up all these things
and uh i mean sometimes it sometimes it's funny
but uh you know
and then and then we watch football
but football kind of after a while
we got we got two teams of the a c c going there
but i mean the i mean there's nothing to do
like for example yesterday uh they go s- some girl goes do you dares want to go to a picnic right
we're just you know it's like we just woke up
we had a hangover and everything you know
and so we just woke up
and uh we're watching t v
and i go no
today we're just going to dedicate ourself to watching golf and bowling you know
and everybody it was like oh god do you guys really watch that
you know i was
like a whole golf tournament it's
like for example baseball
oh me too
somebody told me like that like you can watch baseball
and the actual play time that there is is five minutes
because by the play time is when the person when the pitcher pitches the ball and it goes to the catcher or when the when the pitcher pitches and it's hit
and that's like you know five seconds for the whole play and that's it
i mean maybe a home run could last a little bit longer because the guy has to run around all the bases you know
but i mean it's it's like that
i mean it's was it's just
but when i went home that's all like they had on t v so i tu- i watched entire games of baseball
and they're going oh my god
and t v in argentina's really bad
so so why from argentina why'd you come over here
uh because uh i wanted to go to school here
oh that's cool
they have better computer science up here than they than they do down there
so and i also uh my father works for i b m
and we came up here
we well we came to the united states in nineteen seventy-six seventy-seven and uh we lived here for about seven years
and so then i said i'm going to move back up there to go to college
so he goes but do it fast
so i did my undergraduate in two years
so but it's a it's just you know
oh well we've been talking for five minutes
and uh well tell your dad that now he owes you five bucks
well um i we just recently graduated from rice university
and uh we were going through a lot of job interviews and things
and some of the things that were important to me uh when my husband was looking for his job was um hours you know
so i was you know didn't want him to have a job that would make him kind of be on call all the time and have to go in at any time and you know even on the weekends and um and things
so that was important to me and also insurance for the fa- our family because we'd like to be able to take care of our medical needs and not be thinking so much about whether or not you can afford it
um you know we have that that aetna that's what we the insurance that we have right now
when we were in colorado they had um a different type of h m o there that i really liked a lot
it was um not that kind of h m o where you have to go to their their sort of like clinics you know but this
but it was with a certain list of of doctors that you know participated in the h m o
well that's nice
and um you know then you only had to pay the
for us it was a five dollar co-payment every time you went to the doctor and uh three dollars for the prescriptions
and uh i especially liked the prescription especially since my children tend to have ear infections all the time
that those prescriptions can be very expensive
oh i know
we just you know are like fifty dollars for this series of antibiotics and things
oh i know
especially if you get what is it seclor
and we um we were interested in having dental insurance too
because um having been in school we kind of put things off and only went in when we knew there was a problem somewhere and stuff
and we wanted to be able to go in and have our teeth cleaned and just checked all over
do do you have the basic plan or do you have the the other one
we have um you know
we're at aetna with an uh ex-
we have like the medi- the dental insurance is separate
the one that's like you get additional
and for most things it tends to cover it
we don't too many major um expenses at this point
but we have been able to find do- dentists that will accept pretty much whatever the basic plan pays
a couple of times we've had to pay oh i don't know three to five dollars but that's not that bad
and let's see
besides insurance other things that we looked at um
well my husband does not like to commute very far
and and we don't like him to be you know having to drive an hour to work or something
so we kind of looked for where where the uh his office would be located
and well he's at you know he's at the one that's at um seventy-five at uh six thirty-five and so we by living in plano we're just about fifteen minutes away
oh that's not bad
um especially when they finish all the construction out here and we didn't want him to let you know to
like we had some job offers in the new york area
and we thought well you know he would be really commuting and not only is it you know trouble to have to drive but it takes time away
and um so that was something that was important to us
and because like i say we kind of felt deprived that he had been in school and been away from us for so long
that we were anxious to do everything we could to have you know made us be more together
and and what other
well those are some of the things that are very important to us too
um we we'd like you know other benefits that are provided um
the athletic facilities that you some- sometimes take advantage of i think that's that's pretty nice
but i have to say that since we've come here we haven't done it too much though
we haven't enrolled in too many of the classes or or any of that
but that's that's a nice benefit to have
um also what um opportunities there would be for advancement i think we looked at besides just you know what salary you would be having now
but when when could uh your salary increase um is there was there somewhere to go
that's that's one of i think the hard things right now
i mean they're going through some tough times to say the least
uh one of the drawbacks i think of working for a big company is often times you do have to follow pretty rigid um
um if if an employee is especially exemplary i think it's often
in a smaller company it's a little bit easier for them to say hey you know this person did a wonderful job give him a big bonus kind of thing
that's one of the things that that happens when someone when you're dealing with a large company
but we also were interested in um you know being sure that he felt like he liked the people that he would be working with and that there would be some opportunity for friendships that way so that you would feel happy going to work every day and rather than thinking oh i really i can't stand these people
but so that's something that was important to him in thinking he could work under
oh just since last summer
well i was going to say
or we may be having to drive to plano
we i think one of the most deciding factors of why we chose um this area is that um my husband was raised in irving and so he we have a lot of family here his side of the family
i mean it's not that far but people would ha-
and although we had really good friends and we had church and school support and things um we were anxious to move close to family members just because we wanted our children to know their grandparents and things like that
so that really made a big difference i think in why we chose t i and chose to move this way
and it's really hard
and um they were the only grandchildren
and so our our families are are really far away
and we went downtown and
oh that's nice
i think it it made her trip a little bit nicer
and it is i think it is important to you know want to be close to your family
and it's it's hard
i mean just for us to snatch a half hour like that is a special occasion for us
it's nice it's nice that you can have your family close like that
i mean i wanted to be close to family but i also thought it would be harder to be close to family
and i think that you know we're really satisfied with that choice
and we you know kind of felt like um it was worth it to us
well i my children just ran out the door so i need to go check on them
well i've really enjoyed the conversation
well i have too
and uh nice to have met you
and you have a good day
oh i think i think that a woman's role has come a long way
we have gone more into the business aspect of like i say of i don't know working more
and we i think we've even gone into more the labor aspect of it also
with the pay and everything you know
i feel that uh we've missed as far as the top jobs go
you know the higher echelon
because if you look at most corporations there isn't a woman you know that's on the board of directors or that type of thing
you know that they are not in the home by choice anymore
it's mostly you know
you know it's gotten to be a two income family to just survive today between taxes and the cost of living
and i don't think raises have kept up with you know a lot of the stuff you know as far as your medical insurance and just groceries and gasoline and all you know
so i think that we did come a long way in the sense that we are allowed to vote in you know like you say we're out in the labor force but i think we've lost something too
and well there is twelve kids in my family
so my mom never could really work you know because she was kind of pregnant from day one
but uh she uh she doesn't believe in
and you know there's a lot of truth to that
then you know a career is a smart choice
and i think it's great but if you you have a family i think you owe the family a responsibility
and to have children and just get a day care or someone to take care of it and not really have the bonding process that takes place with babies and stuff you know i i think that the mother and the child lose
and i think that's why there is so many problems you know with kids today
because they don't have the family roots anymore
you know i'm not saying that that it's totally gone but it's nothing like what it used to be
you know in that sense
and also like my mom my mom thinks
i mean she's kind of right with it
you know like for for the men that don't have jobs
if you know she feels if there is women out there just because they want to do it she said you know they could stay at home
that's what i'm saying you know
that there are ways to prevent families you know
like basically there's contraceptives and all kinds of ways to prevent pregnancies
do you think that uh
that's that's the freedom of choice
and i agree with that
because anyone who has children that doesn't really want them isn't going to be a good parent
well i shouldn't say they are not going to be a good parent
like they won't have that
or they won't be as good as they could be
it's not like something that they really wanted
like i had three children
and i mean i i wanted every one of them
and i worked third shift for a good part of my life just so i would be home with them
you know i had to work but i tried to make it as painless as possible
and one saturday morning we were all sitting at the breakfast table
and the kids were talking daddy this daddy that daddy this daddy that
and i was sitting there
and it was because i had worked for about nine months
and when they were coming home i was going to work
and i wasn't there at supper time or bed time
or they couldn't tell me what went on at school because they would be coming in the door
so we were
and that's why i said that's it
i either have to quit or you know try something else
so i went on third shift
and i worked that shift for eleven years
you know and i feel that's very important
and it's too bad because mothers miss out on so much too
so i mean in the sense that we've come a long way
but we've sacrificed a lot to get there
i i agree
and uh i really think that if uh like after the second world war when women went to work in factories and all that that was like out of necessity because the men weren't here anymore
but then it got to be a point where they got some independence
and they just enjoyed the income the extra
and i notice today kids you know
like we had apartments before we had homes
and we had to walk before we had a car
and now kids at sixteen years old they have their birthday
oh i know
and to me it's like we've lost our values in this country
and i i'm not trying to be uh you know a prude or old fashioned or anything but i i don't think if you unless you earn something and you've worked for it and you have a sense of pride about it
because while i did this in you know no one gave it to me
and you will prize that possession
and it's just like college too
see now my parents there is no way they could afford to send twelve kids to college
and so far there is only two of us that have gone
and my older brother has paid his entire way
and i'm on my
and i'll you know i'll graduate
and i paid my entire way
and that's the way it'll go down the line
and like i don't have a car because i'm paying for college
and if i want a car
and i think that's right
but i'll bet your values are a lot higher you know and your self esteem and the the way you uh you know think about things is probably a lot more common sense than these kids that don't have that responsibility
like i've had my you know
like i know kids up here that have their own cars
and money is just given to them
like they still get their allowance
well i have held a summer job you know since i you know i was in the eleventh grade
and i have had to take care of my own money
i have my own checking account
and i know a lot of kids that don't even know
i mean i tell them i pay for my own life insurance and their mouths just drop to the floor you know
well if they do they don't know it you know
and that's what i say you'll you'll be so much better off for it as you get older
because you know a lot of kids resent things that parents tell them and stuff
but it's because you've been there
oh i know
and no one can tell anyone anything you know you are going to find out for yourself
but i mean i don't think you should just not listen to advice even if you don't take it just listen
you know there is no harm in that whereas sometimes you can't even get that from a kid you know
but really uh
what do you feel the changes in the future like with the abortions and that type of thing women in politics and president someday maybe
because i think contraceptives are going to be more popular
i mean i realize that they are popular now
but i think i really think people are going to start using more contraceptives
and with the abortion i don't think there is going to be as many abortions but i don't know what women will do when they get into politics you know about abortion
well i still think people have a choice
you know if you can live with it and it's you know your conscience is clear then i mean all of us are going to answer to it one day maybe
i mean no one has said for sure you know
i i do
and we we are not supposed to you know say that that's okay but i really feel that it's freedom of choice
because i mean you as an individual what you do that to me is your business
and different circumstances call for different things
well i haven't uh you know
when the war was on i watched c n n and uh nightline pretty regularly and read the paper and all
but when uh
lately like the last week or two i guess with easter
and spring break with the kids i um i hadn't been thinking much about the middle east and what's going on over there
well uh just really the last couple of days since this uh the u n debate or whatever you want to call it that uh voted on whether there was going to be a cease fire
i guess you know the thing really isn't over
they uh they had uh kind of uh i don't know if you call it standout or whatever
but anyway they stopped and waited to see if iraq would accept a permanent cease fire situation though
as i understand it from the iraqi point of view this current cease fire thing that the u n uh had set up you know the iraqis are probably not going to go for at all
so i guess from what i understand the thing could just it could just they could take off at any moment without uh you know
well i um
when the when the crisis began last august i began to think well i i couldn't remember things that i had studied in the past in school and all
so i got out like my encyclopedias and tried to read about the history
and it was really what i felt was kind of cynical
why they expect it's going to start this week you know
and it just it's just not people
and it's not uh you know
and they fight with each other
and they have such hatred for uh israel
the uh the thing that's kind of interesting about this
and uh he came within a quarter of an inch of going uh to saudi
he ended up in korea instead and because of the way they split a transportation group out in lubbock
so he ended up going to korea
and his buddies ended up going to saudi
well he's still in korea and his buddies home now
he he almost wishes that that he could have gone home
and got it over with
well i just
and um with
and that i'm afraid that we would have to stay
the thing uh the other thing too when this all started if you you know if you did much reading on the thing you know kuwait the country of kuwait was just you know somebody's
you go back to world war i when the uh ottoman empire broke up and the british and the french and the yeah the british and the french mostly decided to carve up that part of the world and call part of it persia and part of it iraq and part of it something else you know
and they they split things along um geographical lines but they didn't take any kind of consideration into uh social or cultural things at all
so the country of of kuwait really doesn't make just a whole lot of sense except that it is an excepted place you know it's like any other country you know
well iraq has had uh designs on that place since nineteen twenty-two
so you know it wasn't like something that just suddenly popped up
and it's just that this was an excuse you know to make some noise
now something that i
now now we are a uh a legitimate player
in the game over there you know
but uh we are now a legitimate player in the in the in the game because we came in with a certain amount of force and we you know we defeated
you know iran couldn't do it in seven years
and we went in and did in seven days what iran couldn't do in seven years you know
so that kind of ups our stock in there just a little bit
so now what they're saying is that well since we won whatever we say goes because it's uh a kind of a might make strike sort of attitude about it
and you know we've got the power
because they'd go in and they'd win something
and then and then they could call the shots for the you know period of time until the next strong man came up and you know and caused problems
well i just uh
and i just would prefer that i mean sometimes we've said let's keep we're not interested in what other countries do
and then other times we jump in and do things
and while i'm glad that they
it was important de- demilitarize that area because of all the build up armaments
i hope we don't try to keep uh in there and try to keep our fingers in the pot and try to
because we just don't want to send our people there and make them stay
that's that's the uh that's that's the big thing you know
we still got a little bit of the old you know vietnam um problem you know in the back of our minds
we we got this
we're we're used to wars where you can get in do the job and get out
vietnam we never did get out you know never did get the job done because they were too ham strung
uh this thing
they they gave the guys uh the power and the material and the told them to go do it and they did it you know
the the big fuss that we're going to see now for the next few weeks i would think is uh you know the uh the business with the uh the shiites of all people you know in the southern part of the country and also the kurds
because these people evidently are you know being killed off by the thousands
and whether the the united nations
but whether the united nations comes around and says hey wait a minute we know this thing isn't uh all that much over we've got to go back in there and and be sure that this large population isn't just wiped out
which is seems to be exactly what's happening right at the moment
but um you know
well i don't think there's much hope for
there there never will be
i mean uh uh the only way that you're going to have peace over there if if we determine that we want to go in and wipe out every last one of them
you know until we make a decision to do that there won't be peace but i don't think we want to make that decision either
so that's that's a little rough you know
we're not we're not quite up to that sort of thing
well i guess i better go
oh well that's that's fun
well i enjoyed the topic
i uh i like i love to do uh all kinds of crafts and sewing
i i find that's my one release
um i like to do like physical things like sports
um i really enjoy softball
and my favorite is volleyball
and but i'm at school
i'm in you know
i li- i live up at the college
so sometimes it's hard for me to do that
so i just like sometimes
i go to my room and i like walk in turn the radio on or you know just kind of like veg out or something
well i have two small kids
and so i i don't have you know much time to to go places and play sports you know
so i'm uh i just love to sew
and uh you know i ma- i make a lot of my christmas presents
and i love to do all kinds of crafts and stuff like that
i like to do that stuff but when i'm in like when i'm at school i don't have time to do it or even time to learn how to do it
but now you know i don't have a whole lot of time now but i have more time than i did
and a lot of my sewing i kind of do out of necessity you know
you know i've got two kids to put clothes on
like um we- i have i come from a family of twelve children
and when i'm up here i really miss my younger brothers and sisters
so you know that's that's a change because there's nine of them that are younger than me
i'll call ho- like when i know my mom and dad aren't home i'll call home just to talk to my little brothers and sisters
i i really miss them a lot
so i don't
i just uh have you know one brother and he's married
and you know they have a couple kids
so i you know i don't have uh you know i don't get on the phone too much
you know i enjoy going places with my kids
and i do like sports but i'm you know i don't have a lot of time for them
well i'm not much of a basketball fan either
i enjoy playing volleyball but i you know i i don't have a lot of time to do it
and then i you know used to play it a lot when i was in school
but now that i'm married and stuff i you know i've like i'm really bad
i'm the you know i'm the opposing teams best player so so to speak
i enjoy um you know just
i you know i have varied interests and stuff
um not that i like reading but i do do a lot of reading while i'm here at school
uh i love to read but i you know i don't have a lot of time to read an
you know what reading i do i kind of do because it's you know it's the necessary stuff
as far as fun reading you know i maybe get to read the sunday paper but that's about it you know
i yeah i remember in college i did a lot of reading most of it text books
you know keeping busy with everything else going on
so but yeah
i i like to do uh
i've made stuffed cows you know dress you know dolls
you know you make clothes for them and everything like that
they those have been real popular with my family
and so i do things like that you know
but you know i don't have enough time to do it to really you know take orders on it
you know it's like i can only do it when i have time
do you um
i i have a co- several of those that i've made like as wedding gifts you know
i made them out of all lace and and satin you know and made them as wedding gifts and stuff like that
and just little things you know
i i didn't have a lot of
when i was in college i did you know
i did sewing for other people when i had time you know
but that's about all the sewing i did
i never had time for you know to sew myself a new dress or anything like that
so but yeah
and that's about it
well i guess maybe we've co- covered the topic pretty good
i'm not too much uh you know
mine are just mostly you know things i just do out of necessity
well it's been nice talking to you
i'm a college student so if i do any garden work it's only when i go home in the summer
oh where do you go to college
well do you you know do you do gardening at home
well we have a large family
oh my goodness
so like almost all our vegetables and everything is from the garden
so we have a pretty good size garden
well i guess you glad you got to go to college so you'd get some rest
like my mom likes flowers so we have a lot of flowers too
well i don't have as many now
and i had a whole bunch
but now i work and i live in the city so that sort a kind of hung it up
i have a few flowers but most of mine are like in barrels and things like that
and this year i decided that
well my husband made a little garden out there with some tomatoes and stuff in it
but i decided that i don't like grass
i don't like to have to have to pull grass so i decided
and mine looks real good
you know i've seen a lot of people that do that
i've seen you know like elderly people that really can't get out too much sometimes
it's just like uh a high rise for elderly people
and you know she does her own thing and everything
but she has
and she has a tomato plant year round
because she you know
they keep it warm with for all the older people
and she keeps it year round
i could probably plant one and bring it in and just like i bring my plants in every year
well i got a patio
and i tried to talk my husband into just buying a whole bunch of pots
and planting them all in it you know because that's favorite thing is tomatoes to grow
and so um but he said no
he was going to plant in the earth you know like he always has
because he's always had a garden out in the country
and i think he kind of misses it a little bit you know since we moved to the city
but um i went ahead and planted one and mine looks better than his
and then i like um
are they well
do they just come out in the morning then go but we call them morning glories up here
they look like a a well they really look like an orchid when they come out
but they only bloom for one day
and then the next morning as soon as the sun hits it it open- it starts opening up
and then when it gets dark it closes
and that's it
and then it's done completely done
but um they look like orchids is what they look like
but they look like different color ones
like i have uh yellow ones
and i have red ones
and i have purple ones
and then they have like you know the real velvety looking stuff inside it looks just like orchids in different colors
oh really pretty
they are they're beautiful
uh i have a friend when i lived out in the country
and she had belonged to this kind of society that like every year you know or every so many months they would send you different bulbs that they came out with
and i mean they were real expensive
they were like well
the most expensive one that she gave me a bulb for was like thirty-two fifty for one bulb
oh my gosh
so what she would do is she would plant them and they multiplied
so the next year when she you know weeded them out so they wouldn't be as thick then she'd give me some of the bulbs
and i mean i have some of the most beautiful day lilies that you've ever seen
so when we decided to move it was really funny because like i said i had a whole bunch of different kinds of things
and i kept saying well i want to take a few of these and i want to take these and i want to take these
and we had a tree that was like seventeen foot tall or something like that that he said no no i am not taking the tree
you know i mean every time we went outside he'd look at something that was humongous you know
but the last day he said can't we leave the grass
and i said yeah
but i brought
and you know i brought i brought as much as i could bring without you know really tearing up their place
but just like um you know
the people that bought ours bought the place but um i knew that they would you know
if i left like one bulb of each one of them by this year they'd have ten bulbs of each one of them
so it wasn't like it was going to be this big raw place or something you know
but i just couldn't see it you know going off and leaving everything like that
because this house i really liked it and everything but the yard was a lot to be desired
oh there was nothing
i mean and it is ugly
i even tried making it look nicer you know
and it was so ugly
oh it did not help let me tell you
so really the plants that i brought over and put out here are just about all
i don't do any of the mowing or you know edging and all that my husband does all that stuff
but that's because i'm allergic to the grass
oh that'd be awful
because then it doesn't make me ill
and um well even up here at school you know it gets hot and we have the windows open
well they mow the grass up here sometimes six o'clock in the morning
and just to smell the grass it's just
i used to until it i got so allergic to it
i don't know if it's all well
but it's not as bad here
like saint augustine i think is what we have
and it's not as bad as it was when we were out in the country
but out in the country i mean
oh my gosh
so um i get shots for it now too
but one good thing about it see i don't have to mow the grass
i mean that's really nice
or do you like to plant in it
well the first thing we always plant is tomatoes every year
and then we plant cucumbers
sometimes when my dad has like
because he said the vines are just so
it must be the uh
but then there'll be like maybe two years in a row that we can't get anything
now that's i mean that's something that grows like a weed here
i mean it grows like a weed
we have to allow extra room for those because you know i mean extra space
because they take up a lot
but i mean we usually get
i mean just pulling them as fast as you can
but we tried it too where you run it up a fence and um we had some weird cucumbers because they grew inside the fence
i mean like the little thing would be half on one side and half on the other
oh my gosh
i mean it was
but they're so heavy you know
but i mean cucumbers here grow like crazy
well see tomatoes grow like crazy at our house
like we have a section of tomatoes
and we put the tomatoes there every year in the same section
and i swear we get tomatoes six rows up
now if we have any like the birds will pick or something you know
and some of the seeds drop
i know we do that too you know
and at the first year
because i was from the city when we got married
and the first year that we planted i couldn't figure out i mean the
well the first year after i mean we planted them
but the first year you know after we'd had a crop all these little things like
we had cucumbers coming up you know in the middle of our okra
and i thought how did this get here i know i didn't put that seed there
and it was weird but the birds had you know evidently just deposited them for us
well sometimes too when we take out our garbage
and we usually you know we just dump it in the middle of the garden you know after your garden's basically done and we're finding out
like we have peach trees in the middle of our garden now because we took peach seeds and dump them there whenever the garden
oh what did you get
what what convinced you to get that one
well a friend of my father's and he'd driven it all over the country and it runs great
it's like it has a hundred and fifty-three thousand
and it's still running real well
we have uh right now we have two cars uh
i have my husband and myself and we have two sons who are drivers and one of which is a um an eighty-eight plymouth voyager van
and then we have um
about a year ago we picked up a second hand uh uh audi and uh that was a ca- you know a sedan
and uh we got that
and someone came into his lane and hit him
and fortunately he was able to
i mean he was checked out of the hospital was out of the hospital by that night but the car was completely totalled and mike and they had been my two sons had been a passenger in a car about a year and a half before that which was hit by another car
so i mean i got i was getting really nervous
so i finally said we i want a really solid car
so we found the audi second hand
i guess right now my criteria for cars is uh of being solid able to take an impact
but the things that i would want
uh our our
i think the brakes on the plymouth van is just are terrible
and i don't go all that fast but the uh it it just doesn't hold
so i i definitely want to get anti lock brakes
so i don't know
do you have any particular things that that are priorities on your list
i didn't really need power windows but it has power you know windows and steering and air conditioning
and and uh
it has a stereo and a cassette player and um he's told me it gets forty-two miles to the gallon
uh we we get about our the van gets on highways can get about twenty-eight
um but it does not uh
i mean i if i'm on a highway and i can get twenty twenty-one miles per gallon i consider that luck- i'm lucky
maybe maybe sometimes i've gotten twenty-two
it comes out around the eighteen or nineteen local driving and that's a to me is a real drawback
i wish i would you know i could settle for twenty-eight
but uh the uh the frills on that car are nice but they're not necessary for me except air conditioning
in this area uh in washington d c area it gets hot and humid
uh so air conditioning is def- uh definitely a necessity for us through two or three months in the summer
um but i uh i i don't need uh you know
but or you know if you want to have open windows to be able to op-
but you know i've lived all these years without them
uh one of the things that we have uh we've liked when we gotten a new car and this this used car has it is a sun roof and those are really nice in good weather
so so i guess if we get a new car it definitely would have to have an- anti lock brakes
i'd love to get an air bag and a sun roof and uh just so it'd be a good solid car
i guess that those are m- my major criteria
everything else is you know a luxury
so uh if you were to buy a new car now a brand new car what would you look for
um like you said anti-lock brakes and air bag
and uh i'd i'd really like to have a car that's dependable that that you drive you know like a
it's it's funny um uh that you use
but once you get if you once you get something fancy you get stuck somewhere off of the main area you can be really
and the parts i know the audi parts are terribly expensive
i mean it jus-
but i would love i wish an american an american that you know engineering would make something as solid as a german car
you know we certainly have the technology
but it's amazing
i mean everything is more solid in it
you don't feel you've got any of the flabby plastic and i know
and i i and i'm willing to give up a little bit in the mileage for a solid car
but do you need air conditioning down there
we really do because even today it's supposed to get up into the nineties
oh we've had eleven days in a row over ninety
and enjoy enjoy your car
i can't think of anything you know
i have i have one
and it's a real pet peeve of mine
it seems i i do work during the day
and when i'm home uh you know i'm either cooking or running doing
things or uh laundry or stuff
and i hate when the phone rings and it turns out to be a telephone salesman
and it's real
number one i really feel that that's my private you know my own home
and i ha-
and if i want something i will get it
and i will never i never buy anything from a telephone
oh i wouldn't
so i really feel that it is a real invasion they're invading my time and my space by you know interfering in whatever i'm doing
um it's a little bit like junk mail but except you can't you know ignore it uh quite as easily
and i i try to be polite
but at the same point
well i just say thank you very much for calling but i'm not interested
and then i hang up before they can say anything
and it works very well
because you don't hear you know how
but i just feel that's my big thing on the invasion of my thing on invasion of privacy
and um i have uh i sort of have a sort like
i wish that there were a way that you could um get your tele- you know submit your telephone number to the phone company and have a penalty for anyone who calls you to sell things
well how do you get your name off the junk mailing list
uh you you you you do that by uh um
i mean you can't do it for any compan-
you know but you can then send it
and they can pro-
that company is not allowed to sent it you any junk mail
oh i didn't even know that
you have to go to the post office and ask them for the form that you fill out to not to get you know junk mail from specific companies
and i wish there were something like that where you can call the telephone company and you could say that uh have your na- your number put in a registry
and then anyone making these calls have to check that registry for that area and could not should and is not allowed under penalty of you know being reported or something to call you
so that would be one way of doing it
but one of my pet peeves you came up with the telephone is when you have an answering machine and they hang up before they leave a message
i think that is so stupid you know
oh i'm guilty of that sometimes
because i've called and there really wasn't any significant message
and i and i wasn't going to be available to be called back
and it was sort of like oh the hell
i'm not going to spend the time giving leaving a message
and uh i'll call later
the other thing that um that there is recourse to and that's another thing is when you you use your credit card and then they ask for a telephone number
well leg- legally now they're not allowed
and i don't really like announcing in public you know when you're sitting there
my telephone and i don't like the wa- way telephone numbers can be used
but it turned out it had to have been my husband's office phone number
and uh we were able we weren't actually able to trace it but we were able to to discard the charges
um but it was
i i realize that this is your identification
but i worked with someone that got hold of his
and you know i don't i don't like i don't g- ever get anything over the phone because i don't want to give my social security number out
well you should never give the social security number
uh if sometimes if you charge
and then you know because they pick them up at the box office we'll call
but um that's the only thing i would ever have ever used it for the phone
and that was because i initiated it
uh and occasionally i do order things from catalogs over the phone
but again it's i initiate it not the company
if you're buying something in a store and they as- and you pay for it by charge and they ask you for your telephone number you do not have to give it
that is one that's a law that went into effect i don't know a year or two ago
oh i never even knew that
and uh you can just say i'm sorry that yo- uh i'm not required to give that by law
and then they won't
but uh the credit card company you know accepts the charges
i mean it-
well is there any
so wha- in this
like pet peeves that you have that don't necessarily invade your privacy
um well this would this is limited to the privacy issue the invasion of privacy
and i guess uh that was my that's probably my biggest one in terms of invasion of privacy for people outside the family of course
i've got little pet peeves you know with my family
i guess that just comes with the uh with the territory with a family that
can't think of any that would invade my privacy you know
nothing that you felt that you know
i you know othe-
i i really can't say anything that would really bother me
so many things i think over the years have been um accepted i mean when you uh that are no longer done
i mean i can remember when i was very young much younger and i applied for a job
they said well d- aren't you planning to have children
well i mean that's none of their business
and but of course now by law they can't ask that
so i mean there has been i think a lot to done to protect privacy
you know like aids and all that stuff
you know with se- you know your sex you know
they've gotten a lot with uh
i think it's for the better of like i-
you mean like for working and stuff
i don't because i think whenever and something like that
you know i think it's more safety than anything else
i sometimes feel th- you know sometimes individual rights including the right to privacy have to be sacrificed for a greater benefit
because i know
you know for example airline pilots
i mean i do want my pilot to be sober
because i know
and i know
that um i've covered for people that came in drunk you know on the late shift or something
and it and it's dangerous
i kind of do their work for them because they make it more hazardous than what it is without them you know
i feel you know i think some of the people that oppose you know mandatory drug testing for certain areas say well it's not
so uh let's see wh- what was the topic
advice for people taking for parents uh help their kids through college
oh did you
huh uh would you i mean if you had children would you want them to go to a certain place
um i would want them to make that decision
and i would you know
uh i pretty much made my decision on my own and my b- older brother likewise
and uh you know we we were both pretty much happy with what we did
so i think i would not push them towards any one place
i i just finished college a couple years ago
and i uh you know
but uh you know i went to a college that was fairly local
and i feel like my education you know
but you know i know
some people are real adamant about you know going to a certain school or whatever
i guess it a lot of it would depend on maybe what your major was or something
and then you know find a school that's good for that
well i picked it for a couple of reasons it was only about an hour and ten minutes away from home
so you lived there at school then
uh another reason was uh i paid for my entire education
you know and uh clarion was oh it was roughly around six thousand a year
and that was for tuition
and now i did not go out a lot
and i did not order out a lot
and i you know i did not spend money on myself
but uh then again i was there for school
uh and then another reason was i was not sure you know
and i knew that clarion was known you know for two things
so that's what i ended up going for is for business
so uh are you working somewhere then
so i am not looking around here
oh i see
oh are you
oh i see
so does he work for a company down there
oh i see
oh the big company
i i have been working for t i for about twelve years i guess
but i am not originally i am originally from illinois but you know i have gone to college i guess a few different places
but i think you know mo- for the most part you know the teachers have been pretty good and i have got out of it what i have what i have put into it
so but you know i think i think that's most of it personally
but that's why i you know with my kids i think that you know i am just going to encourage them to go
and i am going to try to help them financially
but uh i think you know financially i am
and i will say here's what you have got
you can either you know go a couple of years locally and you know then if you want to move off to a more expensive school then we might be able to handle it but
otherwise you can just go for four years you know somewhere and i will try to try to help you but uh i do not know you know the financial end of it like you said
of course t i paid for a lot of the tuition and books and stuff but uh it still was a challenge to do
and uh so i think you know financially that's that's one of the big aspects
you know you
or whether your parents are you know
well did you uh since you were paid for school yourself do you think you had a different outlook on it like your grades and things like that
because i felt it was mine and i could do with it what i wanted
i think if my parents would have paid for it they would have been on me you know
uh they pretty much got to the point
well well you know you are at that age
and you are going to have to decide what you want to do
it's not ours you know
and then lets me go
and i mean i did not do poorly
but uh you know i i mean i worked
i did not you know
it was just harder you know
i was used to being you know on top
and when i started there it was like you are mediocre
well see i think you know
and and i guess it depends on the way you are raised too
but if you if you grow to expect that you know
you kind of go there as sort of a vacation you know
and you know they were not they did not take it very serious
'cause i did not start to college until you know
but uh you know so i think that helped me be real serious about it
and i i ended up graduating with like a three point six
so i you know
and that was hard cause i had two kids
and you know a family and everything else
so i had a lot of different hats to wear all at the same time
see well i screwed myself up also
and my parents never pushed me until my dad just said what are you going to do
and i said well i am going to go because i have not whipping butter the rest of my life you know
so i went and i just took business
well being as i was paying for it myself you know i just kept
you do not get into your major until like your second or third year
and i am going into my third year
and i decided well i do not want to do accounting anymore
right and i thought oh my god i am paying for this myself
so i switched to finance
and i liked it better
and i pulled myself from a two oh to a two five you know
in my last year my senior year
but i would have really liked to go on uh secondary ed with math education
but it was just the fact i was paying for it myself
well m- my wife was sort of in the same situation
she was she went to school to be a teacher just because she did not really know what else to go
and she did not realize until she got to be a senior and was doing her student teaching that she did not like it
but you know by then she had practically got her degree
so you know
i think if uh i would have went with the math i think i would have done a lot better because i was more interested
and that's what i i knew that's what i wanted
but uh i think a lot of kids that hold off a year or two
oh my gosh
i think i think you are right
i'm in an area where um we can uh enjoy it year round
so i've actually been uh uh been out within the past couple of weeks
well actually i've done both kinds uh i'm originally from the state of virginia and uh lived near near virginia beach where we could uh surf cast and uh catch a lot of things in the ocean there
did you ev- did you ever do the james river
and the trout fishing is supposed to be legendary
the trout fishing is really uh beautiful
as i say the the streams are oh eight ten fifteen feet wide and so forth
and uh you you stand on the edge and you you cast out and you you work uh from your feet most of the time and then there are there are a few lakes of course close
what do you like brookies or uh rainbows
well tell you the truth i'm i'm not uh not picky
whatever the fish is the specialist in that area i uh i enjoy fishing for it
and i try to
i haven't fished in several years i'll have to admit but when i do fish i do contact uh some of the local specialists so that i can then find out the uh the type of lures that they use and where they fish and any unique uh techniques that would help you
we we fly fish
but right now it's uh uh bass and striped bass is the only thing that i go for down in dal- in uh texas
oh that's a pretty big fish
they're they've uh
and they're pretty exciting when they're when they're running
it's a salt water fish in fresh water uh environment
well our our streams here are replanted with fish about every year so that well they they they uh they have a pretty good idea of of uh what the number of fish are in these various locations
and and they have
and this is of course x number of weeks or months before fishing season opens
april to sep- october or something like that
uh what's a license cost
well as i say it's been several years
but the licenses weren't that expensive
and i have oh probably a half a dozen different kinds of uh fishing poles and and fly rods and so forth
and and i had been so busy in my work in these last few years that i haven't had time to fish
but i'm going to be retiring at the end of december
and i i hope uh the next fishing season that i can sort of get back in and uh enjoy that
that that was a really enjoyable uh thing for me to do
well i have all sons so i think i'm probably going to be fishing for a long time
huh i just have one son and he he lives out of the state now rather in the eastern corner of it
so i don't think he has time to fish either
and i'm passing it on to my children
oh is that right
oh my goodness
well i i the disease i caught was simply because uh i i was in the norfolk portsmouth area
and people there
there's there's so much water around that you you're either boating or you're fishing and uh i fairly enjoyed at that time
i have a small aluminum boat here that uh
when i go on one of the large lakes that we have here that i enjoy fishing for for trout from that
uh uh i don't i don't know about the lakes in central pennsylvania
there's um there're two different size lakes about well five six miles from state college
now these aren't huge lakes from your point of view but they are probably fifteen twenty acres maybe which which here is a lot of water
do do you have a home or apartment
we have a small backyard and small front yard but uh uh i do basically like the shrubbery and the planting and the weeding
and he mows the lawn because the lawn mower is too heavy
but uh it doesn't take us that long because our our yard is so small
but uh i try and do as much you know flowering as i can and that kind of stuff
well that's nice
but it it takes about an hour with the two of us working to you know do the bushes and all of that sort of thing
uh the worst part is controlling the weeds
which i hate because we don't like to use a lot of the chemicals and because like we have a dog and and you know he's going to be out in the yard and who knows who he eats out there
but we try not to use them but we end up using some anyway
well if they if they go up
like one year we did the edge of the house all the way up on the roof
and i i went up on the roof once and i'll never do it again
so this year he got lazy so i said fine
and that's about it
but we have a nice tree in the front
and uh we have people that an association that comes and mows everybody's front yard and uh they keep hitting it the tree with the lawn mower
you know every time you do that it uh kind of kills the tree for a while
and so that's kind of stunt its growth for just a while until we get it back going again
and we started mowing our own lawn because they were doing that
and so anyways i have a nice full tree now
and and we put we fill it with lights and that kind of thing
and they would uh they also edged
when they would edge in into the shrubbery
oh gosh it was getting really bad
but you still have to pay for it though even though they're not going to do it
because it's an association fee
oh is it real expensive
yes it's like seventy a month
oh my goodness
and i don't like
i i just get really upset every time i make that check out
well do do they do other things for you all
they take care of the uh landscape
because we live in a cul-de-sac
and there is a island in the middle so they care of that
and there is a pool and they take care of the pool and and there is a pond
and uh so you're basically paying oh
and the sprinkler system that
and uh certain sharing areas have sprinkler systems
and and so that way if someone moves out the entire neighborhood is mowed and watered and that kind of thing you know
but you knew when you moved in you'd have to pay that didn't you
well it it it went up what we pay
and that's the bad thing
because we just can't afford it anymore
so uh but they're
they take care of basically the front yards and unless you don't want them to do it
now do at a
o- only in like in the common areas and in the island
but they don't do it in your yard
so there is like no restriction on what types of bushes you can have or anything like that
so we've added bushes and and shrubbery too
i i ripped most of them out and put them somewhere in the back
and put new ones out front
but that was a lot of work
and then then we put in a sprinkler system
oh it took so long
because you know there is so many people that broke either their water main or their gas main doing it
but it works great now that we've got it
well we needed to because we're having some foundation trouble
you know you have to keep the the area moist around the house or it makes it worse
so we had an incentive there to do that
well uh a friend of mine actually works for mcdonald douglas in the uh in the space station program
so i get to find out a lot of information about what's going on there
and it sure sounds like that's going to be a really viable program if it continues to be funded at current levels
uh they're they're going to be doing a lot of interesting things
uh i think one of the big things he's involved with is the micro gravity payloads
and that has a direct impact on a lot of things that we really can't do down here on earth including uh some new pharmaceutical techniques
oh you're kidding
so you know there's there's a big opportunity for us to explore uh what sorts of things you can do in a zero gravity environment
so i suspect that we'll see a lot of gains from that
oh that's good because sometimes i wonder you know being a uh lay person out there of not uh knowing e- exactly what's going on in space whether you know they're going ahead and doing things and whether or not
being you know
to me all this uh space exploration that we've done thus far has told us that there's no other place like earth that uh we can't live on mars
i mean this is the the place that we have to live
i mean there's uh no other resource for us to to look at other than here
so it's kind of like to me
and what you know
and let's forget about the space program or whatever
because we're always curious
and we always need to know more things
but uh to me it's kind of like let's try and clean up the air that we have here
mainly because uh
i mean this is it
i mean if we would have uh if we would have went into space and found mars a livable uh planet we probably would have
and uh you know who would have cared about earth
it would have been another planet to kind of take over and uh continue on
so you know and that
when i look at the space program itself i think of it you know as being in terms of it's it's interesting to learn but it's also it's it brings down the fact that this earth is it
it's it for us you know what i mean
uh unless technology makes the decision that we are all going to live in space or whatever
but i would love to uh go into the space shuttle some day and uh just see uh you know the earth and the different planets and things like that
i i think it would be very interesting to do but whether it would be feasible to do i don't know
and uh you know perhaps we can find better techniques for doing things that uh we'd normally do down here that are damaging to the environment
that's true you know
and i i think of uh
uh there's uh you know they're trying to look at how things effect everything in trying to create you know an environment where they have an ocean and they have the lakes and then they have the desert part of it
and then they have an area that's more uh you know full of uh vegetation tropicals that kind of thing to kind of look at things and say you know the environment wise this is where we're living
but what what effects it
and how can we improve it and things like that
and i i think in space uh
i don't know how many people could live up in space uh for any length of time
i mean just the way that we're affected by when it's cloudy out
and it's cloudy for days
and we don't see the sun
and the people their moods are extreme you know
and this is how i see people reacting
you know when is the sun going to come out
so i wonder how you know somebody living up in space is going to be able to tolerate never seeing the sun
uh and never seeing uh you know light bright days you know
well do you have any uh television programs that you watch regularly
oh this is kind of tough
i don't too often watch you know shows that are on on a regular bases
and i don't really like some of them to tell you the truth
i mean i don't thing they have any redeeming value
but uh oh i watch things like uh sixty minutes
like on thursday nights at nine o'clock when i get home from aerobics i will watch uh knots landing
oh you will
just something like that for you know uh end of the evening type of thing
but uh how about you
well i watch um
and sometimes i will watch um like the cable news network evening news program
i i like that
i i watch that a couple of times a week um
it comes on like at nine o'clock
and i really don't have any like situation comedies that i watch regularly
i i have seen that um murphy brown that comes on
and it's kind of cute
and but i don't
but there's a couple of those i've seen once in a while
uh i can't think of the name of the one that has the uh military uh fellow
i mean he's playing a military part
i haven't i have seen it i think maybe once
you know it wa- it was on one time when i saw it
and you know it it's pretty cute
well i um i
so in the morning they will like to watch like um eureka's castle it's called
but i don't watch any daytime t v at all
i guess uh there's some uh things on channel thirteen that i watch pretty regularly
on saturdays they have uh a variety of things uh
and a lot of times i record it and watch it some other time
they have programs on uh house repairs and
and um they have a calligraphy show
and i do calligraphy so i watch that
oh that's nice
and um they have a lot of cooking shows
and oh you know i'll just short of have it on sometimes to just sort of pick up little tidbits from those
i don't sit and watch them but but i enjoy some of it and especially if i'm uh cooking on a saturday evening or something
and one of those is on it kind of inspires me
i notice that um since we moved here that we we did get the cable t v
and when the newspaper comes out on sunday i sometimes read through the movies that will be listed
and i record some
and then uh we have just totally cut down
and we never go to like a video tape rental anymore because there's always plenty of things that we can record and then and watch and then record over it something else
and so that's been really nice because if you decide one evening you would like to stay home and have a quiet evening and watch a movie then you have two or three saved
than you know other kinds of things
well that's probably what i watch most frequently besides like news programs is the movies
and they have a couple of channels that are like nostalgic older movies
i i like those old ones
and so we we have really enjoyed that
and it's really nice not to be running out
and it's so convenient at home
and you can do it anytime y- you take the notion
and so i have really enjoyed that
but but there are
like they want to see a particular program and they are either home watching it or definitely recording it
i mean if i miss something big deal
well and things are repeated
so often that you know if if i have seen just a program once chances are it'll be that exact same show
but uh t v is something that we try an- to not um deliberately try not to get hung up on it
and we don't want our kids to to grow up thinking that that's what you do with your
so it's a little bit something that we try doing
and there's there's a lot of good children's programs that you could watch they could watch several hours every day
and you could say oh that's a good program for them because it's educational
but still you want them to go out and do other things
well we probably exhausted that huh
i i like that
and um i guess it's time to go
uh the economy
our soldiers going over uh
is that is that what
um well i think it's caused a lot of you know big difference between when people had gone to war before
like compared to vietnam
i mean i know that there was so much more support for the soldiers going over
and even people that didn't agree with the war still seem to be able to separate that
you know and support the soldiers
i know that uh i've heard people say that you know when people that went to world war two
but then in vietnam that was totally different you know
if you've served in desert storm you probably would be a a good candidate
it would be like a bonus for your
e- exactly exactly
oh torn apart
we had people down the street that the guy was in the reserves and he was just about ready to go and they have a just had a new baby
and uh they would have she would have had to go back to work
i think she said their income would have dropped by like two thirds
that's also a good reason why it it
or good that it ended as soon as it did
i think the biggest change that we've seen um in in my life or whatever lately is the economy
and things are so tight
and like my husband hasn't gotten a raise in two years
and it seems like everything is raising every- everything that can be cigarettes
not that i smoke but cigarettes um uh stamps
i mean it seems like ever-
you know and they just raised the minimum wage today
but that's not like you know
so that's the hardest thing for us
and um we've been trying to kind of maintain traditional lifestyle in the sense of meaning home
and i'm trying to stay home as long as i can
but you know every week
because i could go out and be making money
you know so that's a big uh stress i think
you know for the social changes in our family
i don't i don't have any children or anything right now
i'm uh i work as a news reporter in waco
i got to see a lot of not firsthand
people were coming to me to ask me you know what's going on you know like i knew
so i got to hear a lot of what the people thought about you know changes in in the war and everything
so that was pretty interesting
what other social changes in the past ten years oh
because i know you know i i really get pressure from because i have a career also
and i get a lot of pressure from people that you know my colleagues
why am i staying home you know
so that's kind of a difference for us
i think there's more pressure to um not necessarily a negative thing but on my husband to be more involved with the family
he's gotten a lot uh you know
but in terms of his amount of hours at work nothing on that has lightened up
so it's now he has the pressure too of being superdad and supercareer
and even you know i think a lot of the movies we see now kind of kind of play a good part in our changes
because you see that they have the three men and a baby type movies
and i think you know that
and then you have the women uh detectives now and you know different roles
and so we probably want to do that even more now
you know since the women's movement in the wh- seventies
and you know we've come a long way but i think it's still a still have a good ways to go
i i know that um i grew up in chicago in the sixties
and was part
and i think there's a lot of um kind of myths that we've come a long way just in terms of our society
and you know i think there's so much prejudice still there
and it's kind of more covert now
you know well i believe in this or i believe in that
and now you know i think there's still tremendous amount of prejudice
but people think oh we're in the nineties we're beyond all that you know
i mean like i say we've come a long way but we have i mean twice as far to go
and i don't think a lot of people you know realize a lot the plight of a lot of people
you know and you may be in good standing and everything may look hunky-dory to you
exactly that you don't even
and that you don't even see or know about
oh oh yeah
you know because wh- when i was growing up in chicago um we were in a real ethnic neighborhood
and there were people from all first generation chinese german you know all different nationalities
and now we're kind of like in lewisville miss white little suburbia
i mean i don't even know anybody that
you know from any place other than texas hardly
i grew up in in brooklyn new york
and so i was just i was just surrounded you know by black people
because i'm black
and so you know i lived that's where i lived
and so now i i feel lucky actually because i've almost lived around everyone
i've i went to u t to college
and so they you know they have a lot of different people go there
and so i feel really enriched in that a lot of people don't get to see
you know some people have lived in lewisville all their life you know
and so they don't get to see
and they they think the whole world
and i was ours was uh international co- you know co-ed dorm
and there were twelve hundred students
and once we came here it was like
because it really is exciting
one guy practically roasted a goat in his in his dorm
oh my god
but um you know
well there's so many people who have never you know even gotten to do that
so that's great
my sister was telling me she met a gi- she's going to the university of pennsylvania in in philadelphia
and uh she just met a girl from um i think barbados or jamaica or something
and i mean this girl she had like two outfits that she would just wear all the time
she got some kind of money from her government like five hundred dollars
so my sister had to take her shopping and you know show her what to wear show her how to match up colors
you know to go and and just witness you know this girl just coming to america type thing you know
of the change i think that i've seen probably you know in the past twenty years or whatever is now kids have to have so much
i mean i even get caught up in it with our kids
i mean people ha- you know think they're kids have to have five
the latest cereal about you know th-
when i first moved here i was only thirteen but everyone had a car in school you know
and i couldn't and i just couldn't belie- you know
i was from new york and so you know we road the bus
and if you had a ca-
and if you had a car y- there was nowhere to park it anyway
or you know it's just
but then we came here and they had parking lots in the schools
and i couldn't understand it
you know all the kids had cars
and they you know have to have a car
so that was
so you can afford to pay the insurance
well it's good it's good talking to you
well we haven't really heard that much in the news lately about uh u s involvement in latin america since uh all this middle east crisis began
so i haven't really paid that much attention like since back in august when all of the news and all of the media began to focus in on uh iraq
and the so the last thing that i remember hearing that much about is the iran contra scandal that happened in the reagan presidency
but uh historically we've always uh almost been like a big brother to in and to the latin american area and uh almost used them
i i i feel
uh i think something will have to be done down there very soon about uh about mexico and and uh some of the other areas
but but with the persian gulf as you said it's just uh been very quiet
i i keep pretty close tabs on the paper
and you don't hardly see a
well the only uh references that i have seen lately has been uh in part of
and and they made references to in the past how we have given arms to uh nicaragua and to other places in latin america and that those might turn around and haunt us someday
i mean not not to this large scale as iraq
whenever we give arms to people a- as we did and as we sold arms to
and then uh and then it turn around and
i i agree we're the largest munitions producer in the world
and so uh there's a lot of money to be made there
and it's uh be very difficult to to cut it back to a a level where it should be
and and uh it will come back to haunt us
and i know when i spent
the time that i've studied in mexico uh se- spanish was one of my majors in college that uh there was a kind of a lot of resentment there towards america
about uh like you say using them yo-
our interest there is you know what profit we could make off of any kind of relationship with them
and that we weren't normally very interested in them
and they have
in other in most latin american countries they there are a lot of the kind of problems that we've fought for in other countries you know
that they have corruption
and and they don't have uh
i mean there's just very few really modern cities
and the probably the bigge- biggest problem down there is that's where the that's the drug entry points
and their economy is
of s- several of the countries
especially columbia is so built on the on t- on the drugs that uh our our little war on drugs has really been laughable
it's just a you know such a small amount
and it doe-
it uh cuts off just a trickle
and uh if if we can't get a handle on that through some through some uh method i don't know where whe-
well that's right
because that's just so much of the way that they make their money
and so many communities have uh have to have that for farming
and they don't look at it so much as you know
and as long as we're the largest uh consumer then uh
if we can cut back the usage then uh maybe it will have to go someplace else
and i think it's really very sad that north of the border you know the united states and canada is so different
from the s- from south america
there's really a disparity between the uh what a e- i would call civilization of the countries you know
and uh there has to be resentment built up
and that's where uh leaders can use uh use that whenever the opportune moment arises
it's really kind of sad and
that we would go all the way to iraq and that we would be very concerned with the situation between jerusalem and uh israel and the middle east arab countries and and when we have when we have a lot of problems r- r- right in our own back door
that's been uh that's been the way it's always been
so i guess we've kind of neglected latin america
well that's really sad
well i guess then i will go
well thank you
well i uh
and so i haven't been listing
i i used to just listen to the rock stations but um
i don't really know what too many of the most popular songs are unless you know they're in the the news or something
but um so i tend to listen to some of the older songs that were popular back when i was paying attention
and then i like some classical music and some of the pieces that have been around a while
um i listen i listen to a wide variety of music
uh every now and then country and western
um i'll listen to some of the rock stations
i also like the uh the the classic rock stations
um some of the some of the rock stations now are the i guess the top forty stations or whatever
and it gets kind of old
and they play the same songs over and over
and i just get kind of tired of all that
so lots of times
i'll just play cassettes instead of listening to the radio actually
but uh most of my cassettes
i guess i don't i don't like hard rock
um i have some some rock and some jazz and a couple maybe one or two country and western some uh oh i can't believe i can't think of his name um garth brooks
and um but it's mainly it's mainly just the the light rock type stuff
i never really listened to it because i you know i prefer to have more i guess an established pattern of music to listen to
but and i
but i you know
and and uh they try to tend to try to do outdo each other with raciness i think
and so i you know i'm not attracted to that at all
but um it made a big difference in my life not to have a radio that was easy access
and so now that i do have one i just don't automatically turn it on unless there's something i'm particularly listening to
but you know if you go two or three years without having that
what i got the most exposure to it really changed my life-style and kept me from just having a you know easy access to current music
and so i did like i say tend to go back to albums and cassettes and things that i had already had purchased
but we don't have a c d yet do you
because i have so many albums and cassettes i feel like gosh i'm going to have to go out and buy a c d player and then start collecting c d
and it just
i i kind of decided to wait until it it was around a while
and they were really really expensive
and then now you can get one for two or three dollars
and i can do without it for a while
and also they get better quality w-
and they learn to have more features and things and
without and making them less expensive
so we're kind of waiting to like uh now you know
and the price of cassettes has gone down because c d are so popular
and a c d is a lot more expensive than a cassette ever was too
well i can't imagine um
you can't record on them and so they won't be as functional as like a cassette player where if you heard something you could record it
you know uh if you have i guess if you wanted to record something to play out in your car or something
so c d won't be nearly as handy
see i've got a on my stereo i've got a a uh turntable and then i've got a dual cassette
so i can record off other cassettes
but i never realized you couldn't record onto c-
because i haven't really looked into it very much
and i've never really looked at one very closely
but that that would be inconvenient because i have a cassette player in my car
now i guess you know one of these days when i get a new car maybe i guess all of them will probably have c d players by then
but uh i'm not planning on doing that for a while
i'm going to stick with the cassettes and and uh you know until until they
now my sister my younger sister has a she does have a c d player that she got for christmas
and she's got the the cassette so she can record off cassettes onto c d i mean i'm sorry o- other way around
well that's good
so i can record some things from her and you know get cassettes and record off other ones or off the radio if i want to
but but uh i just haven't gone to c d yet
why we haven't either
but we you know we like the the idea of having great extra quality you know
but but i'm satisfied to just have what i've been used to not have to think about the great financial
but i know one thing that has colored my music choice is when we had children um i really started to think about what kind of television programs i was watching
because um you know i just didn't want them to be exposed to a lot of things
and a lot of the lot of the songs have some lyrics that um i just wasn't pleased with
and they get worse and worse too
and so i really think we've tried to tone down our taste there to make uh you know our children not be exposed to so many ne- negative things so early in life
well that's amazing how i used to when i was in college i used to have the stereo on all the time or i had on m t v or something
but ever since i've been out of college i guess over the last several years i listen to the stereo less and less
now i i will turn on
i'll turn that on while i'm in the shower and while i'm getting ready because there's really not much else i can do and it's kind of boring standing there putting on makeup so i'll turn the radio on
and and then i listen to it when i'm in the car driving to work because again there's you know there's nothing else going on
but other than that i've i really don't i don't listen to the radio or even to my albums or cassettes or anything very often anymore
and put it on the on the turntable
i just don't don't bother to do it very much anymore
i i know my husband he um plays an instrument
and he played in the band when he was in college and in high school and so he has a lot of all different kinds of music
and he goes out of his way to play marching band music
or like you say jazz or classical to the children to to give them some exposure to different kinds of music
and i think that's really good because they're learning to like all different kinds
it's like a small a really small not a tuba but i th-
but it's kind of like a small small tuba but it's not the kind that sits up on your shoulder
but it's a cross between a tuba and and an and you know a horn
and but he has some real fond memories of marching band and concert band type activities
and he thinks that would be good for the kids
oh i'm sure it is
and so i was i was a real good piano player
but then i got interested in a lot of other things
and i got real involved in many things
and and now i don't have a piano in my apartment or anything
and i took guitar lessons i think for one or two years
and uh that was about the same time i was taking piano
and then i got too busy in high school
i've been uh
uh she had a hard time getting a few folks uh
i thought well every all these t i have gone home uh
well uh i guess
i i i do it a lot
uh so and my father and brother were in it
and and my brother's still in it
and i had periods when i didn't do anything
but in the last ten years i've uh my car doesn't go to a shop you know
there's hardly anything that other than putting tires on that i'll do
and uh uh i do essentially do it all
i don't know uh uh if there's anything specific
in fact i could advise people uh
but i do it for fun really and to save money
and i guess that's diversion
uh i i've i've tried a few groups uh you know where you
like i think sears is probably the best place because
but what i heard them tell other people was always right
you know when i sat there i you know i dropped my car off for tires or something like that
and so i respect
but they didn't do a great job of changing my transmission uh oil last time
and when when i did it the next time i realized the filter was loose and everything
and i didn't like it
so i'm just doing it all myself
that's that's the aggravating thing
i i try to do as much as i can
i uh i grew up on farm so i've got that uh you know take care of yourself attitude
and uh oh i've done i've done various things
i've got an i've got an eighty-three t bird
and i've i've changed out uh heater core and
uh oh timing belts and things like that
um i guess the last thing i took to anybody to have done was on my wife's car um when we went in for inspection
it didn't it didn't quite pass
so we had to have uh
that's uh that's a mustang with a two barrel carburetor on it
and they had to do some adjustments on that and of course it had never been adjusted so they had to pull it off and pull all the plugs out to get to it
well you like fords apparently huh
i've uh i'm kind of stuck on them right now i guess
but uh yeah
we ran into some problems with uh having them to work on that carburetor
i mean they get they got everything tuned up right you know
we got i got it home
and uh and they had left the uh oil f- uh cap off and it was rubbing on a belt
and it rubbed a notch in that
li- little things like that that really start to aggravate you
that that's a lot of the reason i do my own stuff
i won- always wonder when you have little things like that happen why even here at t i why we don't inspect i'm in facilities why we don't inspect areas and and guarantee it so to speak uh
we always fix things and rep- put things in and walk away
and and s- thing like that with a car
there ought to be an insp- inspector or quality insurance guy after after an oil change you know
just in case uh they didn't put the oil in or whatever
i i always wonder about that when when someone does repairs or little things like that uh
any anything that gets that that's in a gets to be an an assembly line type operation
you're you're always risking that
if there's too many people that get their hands on one little project you know that things they're you get y- you miss that overlap sometimes
and and they miss things
i've i've had a hard time finding anybody i can trust
like like you say it it well transmissions and things like that
i'm obviously i'm not going to i'm not going to tear apart a automatic transmission and try rebuild it
but uh i- it it's it's real stressful to try to find anybody that i think's going to do me right
and and uh you know have an idea of what's going on
you need to really uh
i i do uh a lot of the simple things
i i think i do most of the things better than the average person
you you have fords and i i uh i have three chevys which i worked my way into having the same engine
and i'm i'm
s- sold on small block chevy v-eights
and i i bought one car new
and i almost accidentally got the next car although i was kind of looking for it when i got a u- a used car with the same engine
well then the nex- the truck i got next i definitely looked for the same engine
so i buy filters you know three or four at a time
and essentially the engines are different
and the par- the carburetors is the same
th- the course is two are eighties and one eighty-six you know
so you can learn a lot that way
there's no way i could i could fix every car in the world you know
the biggest you know that's the three biggest things to me you know
if you don't have the the special tools or
well any more
the the testers that you know
so obviously if it starts my car starts missing or something like that th- it's almost impossible to track that down any more without a diagnostics
but at the tools and the space to do it that that can be a big problem if it's if it's under carriage or something like that
but then it's experience
you know you can you can look through a a chilton's book or something like and get an idea of how to go about it
but you better figure on multiplying that time out about by at least by five or so
ju- just just by not knowing you know how to get to that that one bolt or that one screw or whatever to get things apart
that was that was the biggest thing when i did uh the heater core in my t bird
and and the only reason i did it
the the only ones i've ever heard good good things about are are the old lincolns and cadillacs where they had the little door underneath the hood
but but uh i i had i had taken this in to have it done originally
oh it it was it was tremend-
well it was about seven hours labor
so it it was going to run about four hundred dollars or so
and they looked it over and they they they thought they could patch it up a little bit you know and what not
this is your little water uh heater in there for the uh
and it was it was leaking inside the car
so uh they they did a little patch on it
and it l- it held for about four to six months
and i finally went back in and started looking at it myself
and i- it's a matter of tearing all the dash out and all that kind of stuff
it was not uh it was not a seven hour labor job for me
i i took one off my little buick i had
and i pretty much took it loose on the inside
but it came out from the you know underneath the hood
this this was
the only thing that sticks in inside the engine compartment on this are the two uh hose fittings
i i've never heard a good story about uh
course i broke mine you know
so i'm always very careful when i change hoses on it
i when i take those hoses i cut them off very gingerly
because if you sp- you know pull on that
and i've always done that as a kid you know just yanked on it
and they must have been stronger and heavier copper at the time
but i broke one on my on my buick
and i always remembered it was my own fault
and i thought well i'm going to t- going to carefully take those hoses off
well that that's what ended up being the real problem on this was the uh i- the the pipe wasn't busted
and it had it had broken loose enough to where if it got hot
it it spread out
and just normal driving didn't do it
but if if if it was an especially hot day the pressure would get high enough and it would start blowing the water out inside
but uh i i couldn't eve- even
a week's a week's time is is worth
uh chevy uh it was a caprice air conditioning stopped
i i just heard it
and i went out there for five minutes
and i just pushed on the wires
and sure enough just pure dumb luck that the connection over by
and so sometimes you have dumb luck
i i was you know
you could have taken something like that and thought well the compressor's not working or it would have taken me all day probably if i didn't do that but sometimes you have some dumb luck if you have a little curiosity and you have enough knowledge to check things out
i know i feel bad for people who just when anything goes wrong a fuse you know they just have to take it
and i know that's tough if you don't uh at least give it a shot
and my my one daughter was fairly interested
and i really haven't gotten around to
i learned because i i just uh learned you know
and i'm going to do that
i i told my daughters in college this year i said this summer we're definitely going to spend a little more time on the car
i said so you can learn the basics you know
and and not only from a from an economic standpoint just just pure safety you know
if you can if she can get yourself out of a bad situation without having to to go to a phone booth and stand around and wait
it it it can it can save a lot of time and trouble
there's one expression i don't like
but go ahead
i i would like to talk about uh maybe college basketball
i'd like to see it turned back to like the southwest conference down here
since we're supposed to talk about specific teams i would like to see them turned back to where the college player plays for four years and then they're not they're not semi-pro and just go on and are stolen by the n- the the league you know in three years
plus i'd like to see them to be true athletes where they're they're taking a regular college course
you know i'd like to see
i you know
since you're being you can talk for hours go ahead
you you if you like sports go right ahead with this one
um well i know like what you just said um
purdue had to had to uh
their best player this year you know averaged twenty points a game they had to make him sit the bench and actually kicked him off the team because um his uh grades even though they passed big ten standings and they passed you know n c double a they weren't they did not pass um purdue requirements
that's surprising that they that they have better requirements
so he was treated like all the rest of students you know
and so um their very best player
they probably lost over half their games because you know by twenty points which is what he averaged um
and so you know he had to sit you know
and then they've got three players top you know recruiting class this year that
they're going to have to be well
the the prep school they go to before they can play because they aren't smart enough
you know it's just sad
because i mean purdue even though they're one of the few schools that really uh stress academics they're suffering you know
oh i i agree
i think that that there's a lot of inconsistencies when some conference uh players come from outside of texas you know and play us here
uh they're obviously practicing sixty hours a week you know
and there's no consistency
seems to me that like purdue when they're trying
he should be playing they all should be playing another team that that has about twenty hours to practice a week
but there are teams that practice sixty hours a
week they're not going to class at all
i mean that's that's what i mean by semi-pro
and i think they ought to get rid of that
i mean he was uh he didn't go to class and so they just said you know you can't make the grades
well i'm all for i'm all for the oh
baseball has a uh a uh minor league system
and i think that the football and basketball they asked us to talk about basketball should you know let let them go have a semi-pro team
but i think i'd like to see college athletes
i i don't i don't like the pros at all
uh they're high scoring
there's no defense it seems like
and they just kind of score a hundred twenty five points you know hundred twenty-two you know
and i don't really get much out of that
it is fun to watch some real disciplined teams play in in college
and i saw princeton i think it was or harvard play this year
they're like all white
and their starting guard had s a t scores of fifteen hundred
and it was so funny to watch them play against the other teams
because it was like they played so much smarter and more disciplined
but i don't know
their style of play was so much different from from the teams that just run and gun
but that's so much fun to watch because they're they're pure amateurs you know and there's no money involved
and i'd like to see athletes uh or fellow students like myself you know to play the game
i i in fact i like amateur sports
i don't think that college football or basketball should have to be semi-pro you know
everybody should play you know
i'm kind of racist i guess when i say i like to see the white guys do well you know
well again i'd just like to see the true athlete the true student athlete
play basketball you know
i don't like to see the ones that aren't have no intention of going to class uh
texas is is usually not the best team you know
because the other teams are i'm sure practice a lot more
and s m u down here in footballs and trying to get back uh to having true student athletes
and and that's what i think is a lot of fun
there's just so much pressure on the schools i think to win though you know
and you know it's like if they don't win they don't get any money so and the school suffers which is kind of bad
but that's just how it always is
i always thought that col- university was for an education and then sports of course is part of the education
i don't know why the don't keep fencing and all that you know
and and they seem to be
well that's not
and i i i just think that amateur sports should stay in universities
it just seems so sad to have to only rely on you know college football
is that all they're going to have to make money you know
but i didn't think that was the objective to make money
but it seems like it is
huh it really is
you're you're a t i up in sherman
oh very good
uh certainly high school football and college football
but again high school football is just so much fun to watch
because uh you know not everybody plays of course but they're still
and it's still
and there's absolutely no money involved whatsoever
and you know they're going to class you know
it it's it's real amateur sports
you heard of have you heard of damon bailey
well last year when he was in high school they drew a crowd of like forty-one thousand for the state finals when he played
i never been in a bask- football game in high school that had that many
so that's i mean that's pretty big
like he's from indiana
and he plays for indiana now
and indiana him to be a lot bigger than pro basketball up there
you know the high school games i mean that seems to be the big attraction and college
well my office mate here earl he he goes to all the maverick games
and he loves that
he he would be
this is a great question for him uh
like he's got
and he goes to a lot of the maverick games and everything
but i i i can't get interested at all
i i listen to him
and occasionally i'll watch them on channel eleven
i can't uh
of uh pro anyway
because they they start
and then the last what five minutes they decide who's going to be the winner i guess
mavericks had oh two players this year that they got rid of last year
and they both left this past year
and both of them were on playoff teams uh
so they benefitted tremendously by leaving the mavericks
and sam perkins here he's one guy i did follow
and he was
he never quite achieved the you know the super stardom that he had in in college
but uh basketball they have a nice
well what kind of garden do you have
well we've tried having
and i'm from chicago
and the way that uh bugs and weeds grow down here is very different
and we have tried several years in a row
and we've given up between the fire ants the pill bugs the weeds the drought and a hundred and ten degree heat all summer
and we just kind of uh decided to go with a few flowers and give up on the vegetable garden
you know so we have really been frustrated by our gardening attempts here
and uh if you really water a lot you can do it
but you know when you have to pay for water it really gets to be an annoyance to have to water constantly
so right now we're just
we we just try to maintain the
that's the extent of our um contributing to our food supply
but that's nice to have
so what do you do up there
well um actually
and um the the peonies have been out for now about three weeks and the roses have been blooming for two weeks
and the grass is uh this lush green
and of course i've got lots of weeds in mine because
but um you know i just keep looking at
and i say jeez you know this is the first year it's been so perfect
but and my garden you know
oh boy that sounds wonderful
you know i'm g- i'm going gee this can't you know
and you'd have to
well that's it
last year i think it was you know my peonies were were budding in january
and you know there was no way that was going to make it
and sure enough you know we d- had really mild weather until i think it was may or something and then you know everything just got hit hard
so but yeah
it it's interesting
and i enjoy gardening
my husband does that thank goodness because i that's not a pleasure for me
and i just
i don't know whether it's little old ladies living there or what but you could just tell that they had a love uh a love affair with their gardens with beautiful wild flowers
i love the host of colors that just keep coming all you know year long
and that's one thing that impressed me so much is no matter what size yard somebody had they had a beautiful garden in it
you know it could be
so i do admire that but i haven't really put uh too much energy into it
oh they help you
so that has put a crimp in my every activity other than diapers and laundry i'll tell you
oh but that's nice you know
i mean the peach tree is is a start
it's it's been wonderful to have the peaches
and we we ha- we have still have to spray some
but we don't have to just asphyxiate ourself with the poison which is good
um we've tried them
but again it's just like the sun scorch
i mean it's just
you really really
and um that's really what makes the most sense
because you don't have to use so much water
and it really does the job
but it's just amazing how hot and dry and for how long it gets out here
and if you're not really committed to it
i mean me i'm you know i'm real committed to it for about a week and then i forget about it for a week
and then i go oh yeah i need to do something
so maybe when i get older
well i would a- assume too
i mean you've got three or four months you're talking about
we don't have really a spring or a fall and it just uh immediately heats up
so that's one thing i miss about living up north as i remember um you know the long springs and long falls and the cooler weather
we always had gardens when i was uh living in chicago
got my stepfather to put in uh a waterfall and a little pond in one corner
i mean that was like the most energy invested in anything in the whole time i ever knew him
so i don't know what that says about it all
oh but she used to love to do stuff like that
but maybe when the boys get a little older we'll do some more planting
because they like to see things grow
and so i think it would be fun for them
well it sounds like you you've got your hands full
but it's not off the list
well it's very therapeutic
i planted bulbs last uh fall on the side guard and when i went out there in the spring
and the first day they came out the little one went and pulled all the flowers off
and the flower petals were scattered all over the walk
i mean i guess i could be thankful for that
oh well good luck to you
have you ever uh organized a family reunion
but we are we have one uh we are going to have one on memorial day i guess
they have had one the last two years we go out to the my dad's farm and uh and you know it is just a picnic and spend the night
oh about ten
oh it is not that big
uh we have had sort of weekends like that too
but i never thought of it really as a reunion
i sort of think of a reunion with my uh all the extended family
and some is in new york and north carolina
and it gets
it is kind of hard to get ev- get everybody organized
uh is there someone
my my uh dad has a house out there anyway
and there is there is uh
he keeps a s- uh food out there
so so he does not live there though
it is it is it is like a country country home
it sounds nice uh
uh uh all my grandparents are dead so uh there is there are not you know
and and uh then an uncle is dead
so the the big family is a lot smaller that it used to be
we are in we are all uh
like they live up in sherman
uh all of his children live in the dallas area too
and that is about it
but uh you know we have uh well
and uh i was going to live in france for a year
and so my parents invited
but uh we all got together for just a party
and that was kind of fun
it was on uh new year's day
so it was almost a celebration of the new year too at the same time
but uh but who was it
and you know everybody flew in from all over the place for the weekend
and it really sounded like it was fun
but i am not quite sure what i would do
i think it would be fun to like rent a big mansion or house someplace
so that would be kind of fun
but at least that way it is at nobody's house so nobody one no one person is responsible for everything
and they do not have to clean up afterwards
but uh do you have horses or anything at your dad's farm
i am i am sorry
does does your dad have horses there
he does not really have any any uh uh domestic livestock anyway
but he leased uh to his neighbor for the cattle to feed on
so he really does use it as a vacation home
it is not like a farm that he has somebody else run for him or something like that
he has a garden and uh a lot of fruit trees and blueberry bushes and things
well that sounds nice
and then there is wild blackberries there too
i used to we used to go pick wild blackberries at my friend's property
but we never got enough
but i never had enough to really make you know more than a jar or something
so it was not so worth it
it is kind of they're kind of off and on it seems like
it is uh it is uh eighty acres
well that is pretty big
you know here it would be a huge
and most of it you know
and uh because that is where the ponds are and where everybody fishes
my uncle uh put some bass in uh his pond a few years ago
well he put some crappie too
but the bass
we have a little pond at our at his vacation home too
i mean really little
and they were having problems with too many goldfish because we had put some goldfish in
and there were too many little goldfish
and so the big ones never got bigger
and uh somebody suggested to get a bass
and so they went fishing and caught a bass near some place and put it in there and never saw it again
so we do not know whether it is living
oh it is probably in there just burping goldfish
because we started
and we started with i think ten or twenty little feeder fish that i picked up for a dollar you know
ma- no matter how many it was for a dollar
and and some of them are probably eight inches long
but he wants your really big ones you know the ones that get to be like a foot and a half long
there is a uh
you might put some like some yellow catfish in there
but they get huge
and uh they routinely use them for bait for uh goldfish for bait for yellow catfish
well we would want to put some small ones in so they do not eat the big guys the goldfish too
but catfish do i think
well we could try it
because he was trying to catch them you know using little uh
there's little uh nets you can use to catch fish to use as feeder fish and things like that
and it was really funny
because uh one time he left the net in the pond
and he like would put some tuna fish or things in the middle of it to attract the fish
and uh he left it in the middle of the pond
and that night he came out and the trap was gone
and it was a raccoon that had taken it
so it was really funny
and you could see that you know
you could see where the trap the trap was dragged and things like that
they feed the catfish like uh every couple of weeks
and uh and sometimes that is the best time to catch them
because they will just they will just come after anything then
and you could catch a couple anyway during that time
uh mixed purina uh
it is uh cat food uh catfish food
and it is especially made for catfish
well i do not know how much different it is from dog food but you know
it is uh it looks like purina high pro
and it is the best time to take pictures
because they come up to the top and you can see their whiskers come through the water
the ca- the big catfish just kind of vacuum the top of the water
i have never seen catfish you know except in fi-
i think i have seen once or twice in like the museum
but i have never seen them
well they are really funny fish
when you catch them they make a kind of a a burping growling sound at you
and they try to hit you with their tails
oh well the channel catfish get up to uh
okay but how long in feet
that that is only about three and a half feet long
uh from the time
they they stay slender until they get to be uh eighteen inches long and then they start to widen out
uh my daughter we were up there one time and my daughter was fishing
and i think that was when she was three
and she caught a catfish by accident
and she said here and she handed me her rod and reel
and it swimmed wherever it wanted to
but all righty
enjoy your uh weekend
uh well i work with computers just like your son and i actually do research in speech recognition part of the reason i'm participating in the project is to see how the stuff goes
but um i was working
well actually i haven't worked for any large companies per se uh recently
but hopefully the job that i will have will have lots of benefits namely lots of vacations not real good salary but lots of vacations
well the one john works for seems to have a l- you know good benefits
and the pay is decent
well actually where
one of the companies i was working for actually had very good health care benefits which these days i think are really important because health care is so ridiculously expensive
because we're we're paying our own insurance right now
but and i'm
we actually had a little baby so i'm taking a little bit of a time off from work
i had i had a granddaughter
and so one thing that i'm very concerned with now is first of all health benefits
because it's more important with a family and you know our doctor's vi- routine doctor's visits covered
my health insurance only covers um the emergency care
but i don't
that that helps some
but it's for each event
that's pretty har- that's pretty high
that's that's right
but you know so it covers the emergency things but it doesn't cover if you get sick it doesn't cover doctor's visits things like that
and five hundred dollars is a lot to come up with for each person to be able to start using your major medical too
now she she
course we live in a a rural sort of setting and where she works she has no benefits at all
and her wage is not not very good
but it's it's the type of area we live in
and probably the medical care is less expensive too
well she has to pay for it herself you know they have to pay for their own insurance
so i think that in general the doctor's fees are probably lower there
and so the insurance would cost lower
uh well from what i've seen
well i know that friends of mine had a baby up in boston and their costs were about fifty percent of what it cost to have it in manhattan
and they were at one of the better hospitals you know and you know good doctors in boston
and i was at one of the big hospitals in new york
but that's a huge difference just between you know and it's two big cities that i think of as somewhat comparable
so i was pretty shocked at that
but the other thing that i'm really concerned about
and most companies don't have
some are starting to have is day care because it would be really nice to be able to have you know someone that could watch my daughter at work
and i'd go to work
and if she were sick i could go down and see her if she needs to be fed whatever
and it would be much more convenient
they have to take their two children to day care you know
and uh it it's
i really don't you know
getting them there and then and going to work and then picking them up and
and and your hours are
and that to me well that you know
i suppose i should be concerned with life insurance and uh retirement plans
oh i don't know
i think those benefits you mentioned sometimes they're even more important than you- the wage itself
if you can get those benefits even uh
they they come out to much a much better benefit than than an increase in your wage a lot of times
because you're you know
certainly something like day care at the work place would make life so much simpler that it's worth paying you know having a lower salary
you know everything else being equal
because your life would be so much easier
and there's a question of quality of life also
uh well and if it was there you would really have a little more uh knowledge on what's going on probably you know with your child
and you you you don't feel like you're a half hour away if she something happened
but unfortunately there aren't
my daughter one daughter works for m c i
and they don't they where she works they don't have anything like that
because pittsburgh's a big enough city too
but you know i wouldn't be surprised if thing's like that didn't happen more in smaller communities before they happen in bigger ones
because many times small companies offer better benefits in terms of quality of life than larger companies
like uh one company had proposed to me that i could come back to work after having the baby um any where between ten and forty hours a week
and um call my own days call my own hours
oh so they were very flexible and that that would be great
and if you get two weeks off you get two weeks off and you're not allowed two weeks and one day
so it all depends on what your position is there too
well that's true in any any company i think
i've i've never well i can't say i've never
i've maybe worked five years out of our married life out of the ho- you know out of the home but uh the rest of the time i've been an
was that when you were um well
and you have to take care of any benefits you want yourself
and the same thing
my husband is unfortunately being paid as a consultant and we tried to argue that he should get more salary for that than what he is
and um they they they
and they they refuse to give him more salary
because they say they can't pay more than this and that and they're not allowed to pay him more than what his previous salary was and things like that and you know times are rough now
so it's new
it's harder to get the uh you know increases and things but um
a consultant really is should be more knowledgeable than everybody else
well he's been doing a long term
and he's really sort of a temporary employee at a place
and they they pay him as a consultant but he doesn't get any health benefits
he doesn't get well we don't care about retirement benefits
he doesn't get um vacation benefits
and he does a lot of things that get factored into somebody else's salary
so really his salary should be you know twenty percent or thirty percent higher just based on that not including the fact that you know it's a less long term commitment for the company and all that sort of stuff
and they'll do it
oh are you
oh i see
well that's neat
i'm a contract person at t i in fact involved with uh data switchboard and uh do you work for t i
so i've worked for them for several years like twelve now i guess
oh you sound very young
but uh well have you seen any movies recently
uh i'm trying to think
oh did you
we saw uh dances with wolves and uh have you seen that one
i have have a hard time with movies that are real long
well so oddly enough i do too
well i've heard a lot of good things about it
but we both just thoroughly you know enjoyed it just really liked it and uh i'm trying to think
we went to see a uh a real funny one
uh we my wife and i went and saw a couple of funny ones
oh we have not seen that
we saw the naked gun two and a half and that was that was pretty funny
and then we saw
oh i haven't seen that one
it's oh i can't think of what that was called
but uh so you know through the summer
he likes to rent them and so we watch a lot of them you know at home as they come out
i really i enjoyed that movie
now i i was real disappointed i'm a real big patrick swayze fan and uh i was really disappointed in it
i don't think it was as funny as what i was an- anticipating
and i guess i was expecting it to be kind of funny and uh and it wasn't you know at all
it was it was
uh van damme
we just got through watching one with uh uh is it claude van damme yeah and uh enjoyed it
it was a uh of course one of the typical you know kicking fighting lots of blood
and and we enjoyed that
and uh the uh uh the one with jody foster did you see it
oh silence of the lambs
that was one that that stayed with me you know for a month
i kept thinking about it you know
well it's amazing
but really i mean when you stop and think about it anthony perkins didn't have that big a role in the movie and yet it was his character that was so intriguing
oh it was excellent
and and of course he's such a uh very good actor anyway and i think he made the movie
i really did you know jody foster was good too but i think i think anthony perkins was the one that that really made the movie
it uh well
but i thought she was good in that
well i agr-
well i haven't been
i'm i saw her in the keys
and i thought that was a pretty good movie
but i thought she
now i didn't see that one
that was that was pretty interesting movie
and uh but you know i i did
and it it didn't scare me all that much you know
and i i don't like to go to movies to be scared
that's not why i go so
and that one was
and that one very definitely kept you on the edge of the seats
in fact i want to uh rent it when it comes out for my husband to see
oh he didn't see it
because he didn't he won't go see that
no i went with uh our daughter and uh so you know saw it with her and uh enjoyed it
oh i've seen it you know
and then we've rented it several times and we just love it
in fact we have a ten year old grandson that
it's pretty it's pretty cute
i guess you know as far as comedies go probably my favorite is young frankenstein
my husband liked that uh he's a big gene wilder fan
well gene wilder doesn't do that much for me
but i'm a big uh mel brooks fan all his movies i really really
uh i have seen it advertised
oh is that the one with that's he's starring in
that came out like early in the summer or something like that
oh blazing saddles
and uh did you see that one that he made years and years ago about the uh the sheriff blazing saddles
oh that's my husband's all time favorite i think
i like i like that one too but i thought young frankenstein was better
that that was just you know had all kinds of things throughout the whole movie
and uh um i'm trying to think
because we saw another one that we thought was really good early this summer that was a suspenseful movie
because it you know it's
um for myself i'm personally against it
but we seem to have a duality of in this country where most states in theory have it but but but do not use it
well i'm for it
i think there are certain crimes that definitely uh call for it
i i feel like that child molestation and murder
i i don't feel like they're a benefit to society in any way
and of course texas has it but they very seldom you know put it into effect
so instead all of our prisons are full of people on you know a lot of people on death row
uh texas uses it as about as much as any other state
well uh yeah which is not very often
um here in maryland to the capital punishment law
people are sometimes sentenced to capital punishment but no one no one has actually has the sentence carried out
uh i'd certainly
or affair number uh in fact i think that it it affected the sentence though capital punishment is available
the sentence of life without possibility of parole uh has become a common one and is being being used much more
uh i don't know the exact numbers
but but yes
i know that we have you know
really in fact they're they're releasing people uh that are in there for you know not major crimes but uh robberies and assault and things like that
and because they don't have room which then they're coming back on the streets and of course doing it again
and um you know so we're having problems in in that way
and i know that there are some cases that uh you know capital punishment does not fit the crime
and there are extenuating circumstances on certain types um but i have to say that i'm honestly for it uh almost that eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
you're you're certainly in the majority uh at least in this country
uh we are i guess the only one of the major western nations currently with capital punishment
i know they use it very um
um there are many reasons for it
but they they certainly have lower crime rates and lower murder rates
you wonder what their you know how they manage to do that
well in part it's uh it's the nature of societies perhaps more homogenous society in many cases uh
arguably is because of of uh of uh welfare state benefits
though i tend to be we tend to be skeptical
well england has uh don't they have a large fairly large welfare
oh there's no question that that they that uh you know they have you know all kinds of cradle to grave uh programs welfare programs providing for everyone some way
i i i
oh i i don't know
but we have a lot of welfare programs
and if both do and they tend to have less crime you wonder if that has anything to do with it then
you know or is it
in our society people are brought up over here thinking that you know everybody owes them something
um i think i think that idea is even even more common in western europe
oh do you
well that's interesting
i would not have i would not have said that
i'm not that familiar you know
and i'm not that familiar with that
all i know is that for instance we were in germany in uh
well we subscribe to people magazine and to time
and of course i like the people magazine because it's gossipy and it's fast reading
and uh the time of course is uh you know more newsworthy
and uh it has more world affair type things of course
and then i will purchase a good housekeeping occasionally especially around the holiday time because of recipes and ideas and and things like that and uh do you subscribe to any magazines
i well i have in a whi- for a while i haven't gotten any because i just find that i'm not reading what i'm getting because uh i have so much going on in my life
so i found that i was wasting my money as much as i enjoy them uh when i do subscribe
i i've gotten in the past the parents magazine and uh the housekeeping magazine uh
my children our children are grown and uh i'm letting their mother read on the grandchildren
well i found that after a couple of years of having a parents magazine it was getting repetitious
so i kind of canceled it anyway for that reason
uh the housekeeping magazines i do like because they like you say they have nice uh recipes in them and ideas but uh lately they've just been piling up on me
so i figured it wasn't uh something i needed at this point in time
well do you think that people subscribe to magazines as much as they used to
i i well
now he's the type who will get the uh inc magazine and money magazine and all the financial type magazines
now my husband does that
and you know and of course uh naturally wall street journal you know and or sports illustrated
but i don't know
i know a few people leafing through them at the store but you just don't hear people talk about them
and i know years ago when uh my children were young and stuff i just loved ladies home journal mccall's good housekeeping
and i took them all and uh then oh i don't know what
in the seventies maybe late seventies they changed their format and i haven't
and some of those have had what what i consider or what
i get the idea that they are maybe the the more pricier type magazines as far as women's magazines
they seem just to be so chocked full of of ads
oh they are
my sister uh takes uh town and country and vogue and she sends them to me
and there's really nothing in them but advertisements for very expensive clothes very expensive jewelry things that the average middle class citizen is not going to be purchasing
what i do is i flip through them and and pitch them then you know
they're not something i you know take any length of time over
i have discovered that you know with my available time i would rather actually read a book than a magazine
yes and uh
well now i have certainly stopped subscribing as much as i used to
you know they get tons of magazines it seems they're always getting something in the mail
and and uh so between reading to them and uh reading the newspaper
and then i have a book that i'm occasionally reading when i get a chance
but i just don't get a chance for those uh newsy magazines the ones that are full of ads
i i read them when i'm at a doctor's office or you know waiting on something like that
as i said i i subscribe to uh to people and to time
and uh and i will go through the time but usually not cover to cover you know
i like reading uh you know the passage of people or something you know
and uh but i do like the people magazine
it it reminds me of the old time movie magazines when i was young and uh that's one and you know i really like that
it's quick reading you know
and sometimes after i've worked all day and have things to do at night i just i want fluff
it uh you know it's it's much more relaxing
so well it seems like we both kind of agree on the subject of magazines yeah
and uh so uh i think that probably i will end the call
um i very seldom read a newspaper
mainly um if i'm really wanting an in-depth thing i'll watch c n n
and i find it one of the best
and uh otherwise it's just one of the regular uh channels eight or five
and uh where do you get yours
uh mostly from t v too
um we do take the dallas morning news
and uh once in a while i'll sit down and read
but not very often do i read the whole thing
well i take the dallas morning news
and and my husband uh he reads it cover to cover
and uh if he thinks there's something that i need to know about he'll say you know here you need to read this
and uh i don't know
i kind of quit reading it oh i don't know several years ago when the kids were teenagers
and if i wanted to read i wanted to read something light and relaxing and and uh things like that
and so i coul-
and it got so depressing
if there's something you know that i want to know more about or som-
uh but i find that i do better with oh remembering it and everything if i watch uh the t v you know
and and they kind of capsize it and everything
and i think sometimes it's you know maybe a little biased you know i-
you don't you get the sensationalism as opposed to just pure facts
i wanted a little more detail like you know
and i guess you just you know you you just want to know
and with interest you know i found some people that were members of our church which was different
and that made you even feel a little more kin to
well you know of the same same type of church that we belong to
oh the same type of church
so that made it a little more and that they were from utah also
so that was interesting
but i enjoy the news
i i think our seven year old even e- once in a while will sit down and watch it with us
i used to uh
or i didn't used to
but uh when my grandchildren had uh have stayed over before and even maybe when our kids were younger one of the channels used to give brief inserts of news at a child's level
and i thought that was very interesting
and i thought that was very important for kids
like they brought down something that had happened like if there was something going on uh in the war they would bring it down to a child's level in words you know that they could understand what was going on
and uh i noticed that my grandchildren seemed to kind of enjoy that
and uh he would particularly enjoy this
and uh i thought i think that's really interesting
actually i even understood it better
i i have kind of a blas3e attitude about uh news and news reporting which is is not good yo- you know
oh do you have a certain station you like to watch when you watch it
um channel five for some reason has always been
i i don't know
i don't i don't know
and i thought it was very interesting uh
channel nine watching it when the murders were in killeen and and going on
and you know they have that hour that nine to ten of an evening
and so we had the t v on
and we were trying to catch all of it
and they were showing some
and i was watching
and then we switched over to channel eight
and the difference in coverage was unbelievable
i can understand why channel eleven is uh you know why they're kind of behind
but channel eleven
that is if you if you want to go to bed
it's nice to to to watch that early news sometimes
but the coverage wasn't near as good as when we you know switched over to channel eight
and they didn't e-
would you uh like to begin or would you like me to start
uh oh i can start
i i think one of the the biggest uh improvements in women is that finally you're starting to see them get into uh management and you're seeing them uh get uh elected to uh
uh not near enough
you're not seeing you know
and i have a sister that's an attorney in oklahoma city
and i know the company that she was with uh
the women didn't h- have near the positions the levels that the men attorneys had
and were not uh given the same respect
i i think you do see more and more women out there in politics too as mayors or uh you know in in helping to maybe uh get some legislation passed to to have women have more rights
i think still even with that whole um thing with judge thomas and and uh you you still felt like the woman was the one that you would maybe discredit first before the man
or something the way they had the trial
and uh i just think that it's it's still going to take another generation or so before before the women really could really feel that they're really equal in the business world and that they work just as hard or harder
uh but it's still uh
going from from homemakers into uh corporate leaders is still a big step
i also think that uh uh women as homemakers are beginning to get more respect than they used to be
and it was it was then it was almost like a put down particularly particularly even by women in the work force
but i think now i think people are realizing that the roles women play in the home are very very important
and it's getting the respect and which is about time
i think also people are having children at a older age so it's maybe like uh you know
and then you maybe work for a few years
and then you have your first child
and uh you know you you know both sides of the coin
and and then uh maybe people that are just working and think oh you just stay at home
but then when they're in their thirties and have their first and second kid it's like they lose it
well you know
and and to those that have never worked and had you know and have stayed home with the kids kind of does your heart good
because i know i stayed home with mine and didn't start working until mine were in high school
and uh so you know it it kind of does me good
i think also one of the things that that's really tremendous and it doesn't necessarily have to do with women but the fact that the fathers are so involved with families
which again i think it helps a woman's role
and my oldest is eleven
and i've pretty much been home uh since brian was born
and uh just recently i went back to work uh last school semester to tutor uh high school age students with learning disabilities
and i was just out of the house two days a week but i thought wow this is really hard
and it was only two days
and i was home before three
but getting the baby to day care getting the kids off to school i still did everything i always do you know
my husband still got up and went to work but uh it it
well i had to
so i had my grandchildren for four days during uh football soccer season and so i would work
but i would have to get them picked
and and these women that are waiting until they're in their late thirties or early forties to have their first children i think are absolutely crazy
well i i know a lot of people
and that's not considered really young these days
that's almost you know but uh i have friends that that have kids just starting kindergarten
and they're they're forty years old
and and then like maybe a two year old at home
and i think boy i i'm i'm in my thirt-
oh did you get to go to hawaii
we went uh six months after we were married
and we just went to uh two islands
and then we also hit maui
and then of course uh uh the big one
with uh the big one i thought was very commercialized
but the other two were just lovely
it was quiet and restful and and so beautiful
oh it was rainy
but you know we don't like to spend the money to go over there and sit on the beach anyway
well it wasn't real rainy
we had s- a few showers but uh nothing that really got in the way with anything and just very brief ones
and and when uh
now we went to nassau
and my husband liked it better than he did hawaii
you know he didn't like oahu at all
he thought he thought honolulu was just horrible
that was wonderful and we both enjoyed it very much
you know i've been to nassau too
and uh to tell you the truth i i think i'd rather just go to the island
uh our son and daughter-in-law
and i know they didn't like it
now we have several friends that uh have been on and just love them
but james and i like
oh did you
i went with my sister just uh a couple years ago
and and we both the first night just had to leave dinner
but and then after that it was it got better
but we just
it was a four day and we were both ready to get off the boat
well i think if we ever go it will only be for a three day
now we've been real lucky
oh have you
we went the first time we went to london europe and touched a little bit of scotland
and second time we went to munich germany and were there a week and loved
and we were there in the fall before the snows you know started
and it was wonderful
it uh it was just it was marvelous
and we would love to go back there
and we'd love to go back to london
uh just ten months
oh ten months
and i would like to
and uh she would like to go to spain
and uh i would like to go to ireland
now now i don't know if i'd like to go there just from the the problems
well the there is uh-huh
is is a little scary
but i would still like to see it
i'd like to see uh
and course there is a lot of places in the united states i still want to come you know go to
now have you been to yellowstone
we i was there as a child and then we we went to california and came back through yellowstone with our kids
and they loved it
i was in utah in salt lake city when i was a uh youngster
so uh you know i've touched on that
now i'm just about oh a half hour uh north of salt lake
so uh it's at my husband works in salt lake
so we're real close
now that's a pretty city
we we like it
well we kind of like it
well do you like to camp those kind of trips
and uh but now
oh you like the motels
oh oh well
we have we've gone past the camping stage
oh did you
and we did a lot of camping out there in the smokeys
and it was beautiful
and our kids loved it and everything
and then we moved to uh
and camping is not near as much fun
and uh so and then the kids were getting older and and were involved in activities so the camping sort of went by the wayside
and uh although our son loves to fish
and uh and our daughter and her husband are talking now about starting camping with their boys now that they have gotten older
so i've been concerned about crime lately
uh it's really scary to listen to the news every night and uh-huh
well i i think we have a neighborhood watch
but uh i haven't heard any more since
so i don't really know
but as far as personally doing something no
and so we've been trying to install some uh outside lights
and we put up a fence in the backyard
mostly you know not so much thinking that we would deter someone to break in but that our children would be safe playing in the yard
and i guess most of the crime that i'm concerned about generally is against my kids
oh i'm sure it is
to let them go play with someone and because of what you hear about people getting picked up and everything
and so i have to spend a good deal of time watching them
we did install a a
and that was mainly it was so when we pulled up the light would come on
but also we have a boat back there and we have neighborhood kids that like to get into mischief
so we thought with that light you know it would maybe keep them from doing something
i don't believe there's been you know much trouble in our neighborhood
but it but it does seem there that there is a lot more here in plano of uh just bored teenagers
and and that's pretty much what it is is you know kids that are bored like you say
and they don't uh
and course you know
because you don't know if it's someone their teenagers know who and or is it just random crime
but uh we've been real lucky that no one in my family with the anywhere that they live has had been a victim of you know a serious crime
but uh it's really scary to know that you can live a normal life and try to be a good citizen but it doesn't mean you'll be safe
and but i guess i take a lot of uh little bit of uh
and uh there's not so much of it completely innocent victims compared to
but it is scary
i'm originally from chicago but i've been in this area in the lewisville area for uh let's see about twenty-three years
so has it been getting worse that you noticed or about the same
and uh like i say
now i don't think necessarily in this area here but just dallas in general
i think back of when i was uh younger and in my party days some of the things i did you know i wouldn't be caught dead like being out that late at night
well i noticed that uh that uh when
we we moved here from houston not too long ago
and so of course we were interested in schools and uh but the schools in houston all have big tall fences around them
and they're not really very safe and so it's been interesting to come to the plano area where the schools don't have fences at all
and in houston that there was the mentality that they weren't safe at school
and so that's been something that's been good for the you know in this area that you feel like uh you know there's not going to be too many knifings or shootings
but anyway well i guess i won't take up more of your ti-
well i am new to texas
so i don't even know what the law is
and we've you know done away with our quote fair share number
oh that's right
um you know different things
it's certain crimes uh capital crimes murder of course uh rape
it seems to be a disproportionate number of blacks you know that get into the system
the one thing that i think is really sad about it as i recall from the articles that i've read is that if if people who have been there
and they want
i mean they're anxious for someone to be killed
maybe it just depends on you know how closely the crime you know
you know i don't know
or a person personally
i think i would be you know
i guess really if i had to say yes or no i guess i would say you know that i am in certain cases in favor of the death penalty
i don't know how we'd ever find out you know really whether it is or not
well there is so many chances for appeal that it kee-
i just think um
somehow i hoped that as a people we could be better than than um expecting
someone is calling for someone else to be killed you know
i suspect i would be uh you know a lot more favor of it if you know one of my children were you know brutally killed or something like that
like i say i think it depends on how personally affected you know you might be by it
and there really are criminals that are hard-core and
tha- that's right
oh i don't know
it's not not to me personally
i mean i do go to church and things
but like you say if it hit you personally
closer at home you would feel feel differently
that's a it's a tough tough question
but i think the u s is one of the few countries that still do
i think there was only like six or eight countries in the world that have capital punishment still
a lot of them had to have el- elected not to do so
now i don't know what they do in place of it
you know maybe it's life in prisonment or you know something
i don- i don't know how they handle it
bu- i was surprised to learn that so few countries have capital punishment
well and it doesn't seem like very many people uh are really i mean
but there's not very many people that actually um do get killed
so it seems like a of people live there
and then through appeals
because i know they do frequently
i mean they cover cover it pretty heavily on television and the newspaper
so that delays it for a few years just right off the bat
there's there's a lot of you know last minute uh
so is it uh
that's that's fairly recent i don't know how recent but fairly recent in the state of texas
before that it was uh death by electrocution
wh- which seems so awful
so it's a little bit more humane
if you if you had to chose i guess i would i am sure i would take the lethal injection
it's a it's a tough question
i guess if i had to say yes or no i would say you know yes
i i would have to lean toward capital punishment you know for certain crimes
well do you think that we do it because we want it to deter crime
or it's not because we don't want to pay for inmates to stay in prison
we hope that it will be you know some sort of determ- deterrent or you know an eye for an eye type thing or something like that
some of the crimes are just so brutal and so you know useless
um well um and i notice that the crime rate was up in the dallas area
it's it's kind of been scary
and and you're hoping there is something that will cut down on that
you hate to have the dubious honor of being you know so high in the in statistics
but i you know
so have we been very very fortunate
and so we don't
and how they would expect
i mean you you hear of people who have um committed crimes and then they get out of jail and they go and they do the same thing again
and you wonder why they can't just stop it
so maybe you would
but still i would hate to be on the jury that sentenced someone
so would i
i fortunately i have never been in that circumstance
i hope i never am like like everybody else
i know when um
we just we moved here uh i from the i got a summons jury summons
just like constantly it seemed like
but fortunately i had small children
and i didn't have to go
and it's not that
i mean i think everyone should have to serve on the jury
it's it's a big responsibility
and i would hate to have to hear any kind of case
well anyway i sure have enjoyed uh talking to you about this although it has been difficult
it is it's a tough subject
i'd hate to decide it but i guess uh guess it's important
that we decide as a people what what we're going to do
anyway well you have a good day
well thank you
well patricia i was just about to get on my tread mill
and then i remembered that i didn't make a call last night
and i thought i'd make one tonight
well i have an exercise bicycle in my bedroom but it usually's holding clothes
and sometimes she just flops them all over the seat
well that's not why i got it
but i was doing that on the exercise bike
well i do that too
and my legs you know
and those are going away
so that's real good
uh this one yeah
well i hope so
well you can believe that anyway right
my husband bought it because we we'd never get out and go walking or anything
and we go to the lake
and we ski and swim in the summer
but besides that
well in bad weather you know well you'd have to do something inside
uh my husband was just running out the door
so i decided to do it
uh what subjects have you talked about
well that's interesting
oh my goodness
and she was
well that could that would have been interesting
and then one night i talked to these two guys no one night i talked to one guy
and then a couple of weeks later i talked to the guy's roommate in virginia about different things
well that's neat
did you feel uh rewarded while you were doing it
well how'd you find out about it
oh i don't know
i i presume
and they must have been asking
and she saw it on the computer screen and they made copies of it
oh so they wanted any anybody
well that's interesting
and i couldn't understand
i thought it was an advertisement and they just were also called t i you know
well if you work for t i you're supposed to get a prize is what i heard
and if you don't work for them you're supposed to get cash
but then on the letter it says cash or prize
well the prizes are pretty nice
and depending on how many calls i think three was the minimum
but it went up to i don't know nine or ten
how many calls have you ma- had
well it sounds like a lot
and some of the prizes are pretty nice
well like what
oh i wish i had that booklet here
oh i think i do
um well they have some watches that look really nice
but seems like too nice a prize for nine just nine calls isn't it
you will receive in the mail a numbered certificate for your calls and and explanation how to redeem
and this only goes up to f
so i thought that was somewhere around nine
but anyway it's got these beautiful watches on it
it has a uh clock radio that also plays c- uh you know tapes
then it's got oh some binoculars and some pretty brass lamps
got some oh a food processor
so it's not all stuff that t i makes
i haven't seen anything in here that t i makes the mister coffee the double mister coffee you know the two
oh and there's a phone in here that's hilarious
and then there's an attache case and cordless telephone
and then there's a card table doesn't have any chairs just a card table oh some more jewelry suitcases
and have you seen those univ- anniversary lamps where the little balls go around
and i can't think
and um well it's got a lot i mean pages and pages
here's where here's a calculator but it's not even made by t i
i believe it came in his uh his mail
here's a camera and a dustbuster and some tools someone a lot of tools a man might like you know
so you're bound to find something you want
and uh here's more jewelry
and oh there's even pictures and little porcelain things to put on a coffee table
oh here's some brass animals brass candlesticks
so i'm sure you'd find something
well you know
well do you know you have a ten limit a ten minute time limit
well that's okay
and then they come on and tell you and they tell you got five seconds to say good-bye
let's see oh
and i never would go
so i sit and study
and i have really ballooned up since then
and so he's says i ought to join one of those that makes you go
well the first one i joined they went out of business
and they transferred it to another one that was really far away
and we were going to do it
well then forget that
and then the second time i was going to do it at richland college
and we'd end up just smoking cigarettes and riding around like we couldn't find the place
so my husband's just discouraged me on those things
well if you if you can make yourself do the tread mill i mean gosh that's a good workout
and i got one of those jane fonda workout tapes that i dubbed from a friend
so i don't have a have a baby anymore
well i've got a step-daughter
so there's where the money goes
well me i'm going and my daughter janet in austin
so i'll probably have to sell the prize i get
and what are you doing
well i'm um going to be certified as an english teacher teach english as a second language
see i didn't have to take any other exit test because i've been teaching for quite a while
but i've heard they're terrible
and they really don't help you a whole lot
now see i went to e t
and i took one course through t w u
and she's the only one that lives near by
oh well that will be nice though
so the rest live in
and couple lives in pittsburg
and one lives near d c
but still sort of up in that general area of the country so you can probably see them sometimes
and the ones in pittsburg of course we see more often
well uh what kind of recycling do you have in your area
well they've been trying different things
one one of the biggest problems seems to be we don't they don't have anyplace to put some of the things that need recycled
right now we've recycled glass for ye- be- years because we have a glass industry in our community
so glass has been recycled for a long time
uh we have a cycling area set up here at our house
the boy scouts have and they've done that for years
uh the stores are recycling their plastic bags now
and they have bins to collect those
uh the aluminum cans
they try to do the uh newspapers
and uh they had to close their area down because they couldn't sell it
and that didn't work
but but somebody told me that they were charging as much for it as they did for straw
you know because the farmers would buy the straw if it's a you know similar price
and let's see
uh mainly the glass the aluminum the plastics
well it sounds like they're doing quite a bit
well we're working hard on it because we're fighting also in our area a large hazardous waste incinerator which we do not want built
and uh we would like industry to do more before they build these big huge incinerators
and uh we we just feel they should they should offer industry some incentives to do more reducing of their waste products and reusing
because some of those companies that are doing it have save money eventually
but once they get established then it's a money saving thing
well our company does some things all of which i couldn't even tell you about
and what is t i
uh texas instruments
my my son works for
excuse me go ahead
well i i was just curious as how you got hooked up with this this speech type of thing
well my son works in uh for the federal government
he's he works in a computer laboratory
and uh it was through him that that uh
well here at work um each one of us has two trash baskets in our office
and one of those is designed for any kind of paper products that um they want to use you know for recycling
uh maybe you could tell me what is the difference between office paper waste and just like newspapers
well i guess i don't know specifically except that uh for the paper that they want to recycle they do not want any newspaper um and things like candy wrappers or uh that type of thing
um they don't want lunch sacks or brown envelopes uh phone books
so there are you know a lot of kinds of things that they don't want but then any kind of computer paper letters uh booklets
um and it doesn't all have to be like white
and and uh even some of those can have plastic tabs on them
so it's it's hard to kind of figure out you know which things are the right ones
i mean i i'll frequently have to look at the list
but um they do that
and then we use uh different chemicals and things
and i know that
i i don't know all the details
but they're really on top of that
and there probably some other things that i don't about because we're a real large company
and i just don't have contact with them
but in our uh city
well i live in a suburb of dallas and they have initiated a newspaper recycling whereby they pick it up from your alley uh one day a week and all you have to do is bundle it
uh all around dallas there are a lot of recycling centers where you can take things sometimes for money um but most of those are real far away from like where i live at any rate
well it would be inconvenient to in other words to
and um it's just you know hasn't been very practical to get into a lot of those things
if they would make it something where they you know would pick it up at the curb or at least make it you know down the street and at the corner
type of thing uh
um our grocery store like yours will take the uh plastic bags
and they'll also take the the paper bags back
but um uh you mentioned the uh glass type of stuff
the reason i ask you about that is years ago and it it changed names somewhere along the line but um my dad used to work for knox glass in
oh well knox is just over the hill here
they they no longer are you know active
and but he worked for them for like thirty-one years
oh for heaven's sake
and he used to travel up there to knox quite a bit
and and i even did once when i was a child
oh for heaven's sake
you know so
well we only live probably about fifteen twenty miles from knox
and they had had some pictures and things in there of knox
but uh i guess that's about it you know as far as what goes on that i know about
and they are more concerned
and we're just we're just real concerned about this incinerator because we really they want to put it right in uh in between two of our main water sheds that feed the clarion ri- river
and uh we we just we just don't want it anyplace
we feel that we that they should give businesses more incentives to do more recycling and more reduction and and more reuse and all those things that could be done
we we just don't think we don't think some of the politicians are really interested in our best interests
and uh it's it's been a real struggle and a hardship for a lot of people in our area that we've have you know have been fighting against this thing in trying to have things changed
to make them more more right
well i think probably more people you know would participate if they just made it a little easier
and like you say make it um better for companies to do these things
just to deal with trash you know
we're we're going to pay for that that whether we pay industry or
we we've already paid industry for like these super fund that's cleaning up
we pay all help to pay to have them haul it away from their place
and where they put it now they found it's not a safe place
and now they have to clean those up
and it's our money that's cleaning this
and now they want to put it in
and that will make another hazardous dump and eventually they'll have to do something with that
so why not pay industry
and reduce it you know and and not have as much of it
we don't we don't need three quarters of
but they think and probably they're right people buy it easier
and i know people would be willing to do more like saving their newspapers and that if they had a place to take them
guess our city you know in picking them up must take them somewhere else
but i don't that it's a big money
uh i've originated only a a few
but i've received quite a few
i uh i only started doing it after uh i started getting calls and said oh heck
so i started about a month ago
this is getting close to twenty here which is i think is about all uh our little gift book goes up to
but i don't really know
i'm i'm medical
uh you pushed the record button
i i'm benefits
uh well i'll tell you
and uh it's hard to beat any of the benefits that or salaries either
course there's a few things that uh i think i could do better if i was sitting up in the c e o's seat
but uh i think jerry's doing a pretty good job as it goes
it's kind of like uh
the ones uh that i think are the highest and important to me uh i hope i never have to use them really per se although i've used medical a little bit that well that one certainly is high
i i worry that it's weakening rather than strengthening
so i like to reverse that trend and say i'd like to get those to strengthen you know
then sal- sal- salary continuance i've never used that one
but that's kind of like an insurance thing
well uh like i say i worked for several different companies
and there's nothing to compare with uh t i here
now i really got caught up back in eighty-five
i wasn't with g s i but i was connected with uh uh oil uh
but i say i wasn't connected with g s i
and i got caught up in a layoff
now uh course you get six months uh unemployment from the state but what t i did for us is is uh i've never heard of it before they fixed us up with an office with uh telephones access to long-distance uh computers a secretary to take messages for us or type uh letters
uh they had out of town newspapers
and outside consultants
did they have an outside consultant like a
they did have uh seminars every once in a while
uh course that was not uh restricted just to just us
but the most important thing was that uh they had made up the difference between uh unemployment pay and seventy-five percent of my net pay
and they then
so uh i was able to uh not just exist
i mean i i lived just as comfortably as i did before i was laid off
they seem to be do- doing a good job of that
and our organization built builds those facilities over in park central now
and i guess they've been using them for six months now
and i've known several engineers that got laid off
and they said
the much they learn over there you know after they've been laid off uh
he he just learned like you
well this was not a learning thing by any means
it was just a uh
well he said he learned so much
he thought he thought he had a ph d in how to get a job after he was
for for several months
well course i went through this uh what about five years ago
and i guess it may be one of the best uh that anyone's doing
well that's one of those little uh uh little extras that you don't see in the uh the the the handbook you know
well now i have uh uh
and of course i've been looking into it but uh since i'm only a yellow badger
what do you think of a pension that goes from one company to the other like an account like a four o one account
i i've been thinking about that for years uh
that's what i'm saying that that pensions
you see just like you were you're saying you've only got uh so many years
and then just add the money together like you do with a four o one account you know
uh it's your account period
that that sounds like a hell of an idea
i i'm saying that's the question
and i'm saying that pensions say in the year two thousand or more when social security goes away which it probably will
so you work for a company seven years
well what would be the difference between that and social security
uh well social security's going to go to way i think
and you can or you can invest your own money
and it's not paid for by the current
you know they may rebel and you won't have any social security where if your money was in your account i mean you can never lose it
you don't have to depend on anybody to be putting that money in for you you know
i mean i
i i like the idea
course that's that's some- something like an i r a
and instead of having a a socialized pension it just would be really money that you and your company
but i i can see where they'd need to do something on that because the statistics are
you don't work for a company twenty years through no fault of your own you know
and y- y-
that that's what i've done
i i've bounced around
but not not quite that often
but uh yeah
i've only got uh i've got i guess fourteen now here at t i
and i hope to make twenty-five which
i mean you know they lay me off
so you have a pension
but then you'd have to try to get a pension in another one
again knock wood that uh i haven't used it
i mean i
but i'm not
well knock wood
and well i i have the uh the h o m a
and i like that uh a lot better than aetna
i again i just
and every time i needed it it it it's uh you know
fallen right in line for the the minor things
well doesn't it work you don't see uh uh anything until you spend the minimum
but the dental is right away
well now i have the same dental you have
now see i don't have a deductible
well drugs are okay
now i'm on that uh plan where i take blood pressure medicine
if you take an allergy medicine so anything you need a prescription for for more than six months you get it for used to be six bucks
oh that one i haven't heard about
that's a typical that's a typical one that's in there
fact you may be able to take care take advantage of that
it's through baxter labs uh
do you do you buy your pills one at a time
well tur- turn in your forms
and uh they're twelve dollars
or whatever whatever the the amount is uh
but it's a lot cheaper
allergy medicine's really uh expensive
and that blood pressure medicine is fairly expensive
and maybe maybe i'll tell you go something you didn't know about in benefits
you know it's a very common thing
we discussed uh uh medical and dental
but again a hope i never use that one
i don't know what else you know
you say say you get another week and
i'm well i only got fourteen years
so i'll get another week when i hit fifteen
so that's that's fair
i mean it's reasonable
but uh you know
well i'm uh i'm here
and i don't think i'll ever see a a silver badge
i won't i won't be around that long
well the way things go i think i'm going to have to work till i'm seventy-five whether i quit and uh uh or when i retire get a part-time job
so what do you think of our trial system
huh i don't really know what to think about it
but i do know that they're not you know
i have noticed that that that kind of stuff does seem to happen quite a bit um
i don't i don't i don't even know what to do about that sort of thing
but i think trial by jury is it's a lot better than leaving it up to one person
they said i think the tape said something about changing uh changing it such that the
or leaving sentencing up to the judge only
we- just just sentencing not the trial itself
um because i think that th- that that judges are probably more informed as to what is
the general public doesn't know that if i- if they're sentenced to life that they won't serve life
so he'll be able to give them the maximum sentence in some cases there
because i didn't hear them say that
they give that as as an example of something that that might happen ye-
but i think if the entire trial was left to one person
but uh i don't know
pe- too many people can take vendettas out on people
or just you know
there are two people who say well he just looks guilty um
but that's true
that's actually that's a wonderful way to get off jury duty you know
someone says to you you know
when they ask you if you uh if you want to be on you know
they quickly let you off jury duty i hear um
because they they know that you're biased
that that that that that's that's the way it works there um
anyway i think that probably for for having it
what about you know about being unanimous
i mean that's sort of a strange case because i wonder what happens when eleven people thinks someone's guilty and one person doesn't
one person thinks that that they're not guilty
and they can't decide for hours unless they convince that one person you know
well then they consider it a hung jury i g- i think
and then they uh have a retrial
i think they either have a retrial eventually or or they call it a mistrial or something
so i don't know much about that
i just know that um
'cause sometimes i think about it actually
i think well what if i were that one person and i was completely convinced that that that that this person wasn't guilty you know
well you don't have to be really convinced that he's guilty
it's just if they can't prove he's guilty
but i mean what if eleven other people are saying one thing you know and you're you're the one person saying the other thing
you know would you give in
i wonder about those things you know or even if it's you know
i i guess if they were to say well it doesn't have to be unanimous
what's the cut off number seven five you know six six
you know how do you decide
is it you know
but but um
well you've seen like these t v movies
but one thing that i thought was pretty weird is how somebody can't be trialed tried tri- uh excuse me twice for the same crime
i've never quite understood that um
well i just think it's it's weird because i've saw well of course soap operas
this one guy had uh framed himself to make it
but then he set it up where it looked like somebody was trying to frame him
and he was on trial for it
and then you know it came out that he was being framed
so then he was found not guilty
and then th-
and he couldn't be tried again
and they can't do anything about it
i wonder if if maybe you know
i i i don't i don't i don't know the law on that
but if they have new evidence can they can they retry
or can they you know bring you back
you know i saw it on l a law too
oh actually that's true
so i wond- and then i wonder why that you know
there there must be some sort of deep seeded reason for that
yo- you know something like something like well you can't be tried for the same trial because that would bias the the the the jury or something
or you know
and i'm sure that you know it's the lawyers
uh after the uh defendant defending oh the defendant's lawyer and the prosecuting attorney
i'm sure the prosecuting attorney could make a real good case if he you know knew all the details of the defendant's you know case
in in of the defense
well well there's also the issue of for instance you can't um you can't very often you can't um
when someone is is on trial for something you can't bring up prior convictions
like if they're on tr- uh trial for rape you can't have any you can't bring up the sexual assaults and stuff or whatever
i mean if this man is is accused of raping someone then i think that something like sex you know the fact that he se- sexually assaulted someone is a crucial bit of evidence
and i i i
but they're not allowed to do that
i i often
i never understand you know
havin- again having
i'm sure there are some deep seated reasons you know to
i mean often times i wonder about rules like this
and i'm sure that that that there are some reasons for good
well that one does seem that one does seem out of it though because it's it we- you're allowed to show their character
and if it shows that their character's you know
th- that lea- led to that
i mean that's what i think
but i don't um but i don't quite understand
we- you'll help out a little bit
a lot uh a lot of the politics will pass laws and stuff that the um general public wants
so they'll be revoted and all that
well that's that's that that's very true
but then again oft- often times they don't as well
often times they don't uh
they just go you know
you've got people like who are who are you know lame lame ducks
and they sort of don't care about anything and just want to go ahead an
so well oh i talked about this the other day
they won't say yes and they won't say no to just certain issues just because they don't know what the public wants or the public's split on it
i mean that that
but i have had that discussion before as well
i i wonder about the po- politics of it all
because most of it is politics
well even in the courts yo- well well they're all appointed
that's even another issue you know
should should should judges be appointed you know
and or or um often times i look at friends
we had uh a serial killer around here who killed eleven women
now was that the um uh green oh i don't know some guy that was attacking women jogging
ch- oh and and choking them
uh his name is arthur
well did they have a t v movie about him
but i'm sure they will
um because he was he was on some sort of news special though
he was he was uh he killed
'cause he was just on trial like maybe a year ago
well well how was he killing the women
um he was strangling some of them
because he was he was
actually this is a very sad case
he was in prison for um sexually assaulting two children
see that's what i mean
and then they're able to do it again
and then and then he wa- he wasn't allowed back in the town where he had done this
so he came to our he came to rochester instead
and they they they realized later he he had killed about between eleven and twelve women at least
way up north here huh
well uh i'm originally from kentucky
still way up north sort of um
i i'm i was up north too
but uh that's one of the reasons i think judges should be the ones to sentence people
because they do know you know
this this this man was sentenced to i think like three life times
but he was you know it was just horrible
because um his his his trial was you know was it wa- it was televised and this and that
and what they were pleading was um they were pleading insanity
i mean it's clear to me the man is insane
well of course
and and he should be just locked up for life
but they just need to do something with him
i mean i don't know what you do with them at that point if you're that crazy
but what what struck me is you know they had a psychiatrist testifying for hours and hours
and by the end i realized that maybe it would have been better if they had it wouldn't have been a jury of his peers but if they had a jury of psychiatrists instead
i mean i don't think it's feasible
but it would be an interesting thought if you're
well it's supposed to be a jury of your peers
they couldn't have a a bunch of psychotics up there
but give them a bunch of psychotics but at least have a have a have a bunch of psychiatrists
you know just to look at him and decide from then
i mean they would
what what major changes have affected your life
well i think that uh women women working is the one that really affects me most strongly right now
well women in general and and also myself
but um it used to not really make a difference to me um
or at least i didn't think so
but my mother worked
and i kind of now wish that that she hadn't
that um that she had um stayed home
and right now i'm kind of stuck because i'd like to have children
but i'm not ready to do that because when i do have children i want to stay home
so i'm having to uh try to figure out a way to be able to do that
and in in our society right now that's really something that's that's um not respected
and it's not it's not um it's not easy to do at all
i mean there's a great deal of sacrifice that has to be made on the part of a family if the if the wife is going to actually be a mother
because that relates to the thing that that strikes me the most
and i'm sure you've you've labelled the cause because what strikes me the most in the changes in society is the way kids behave
i think that that they have to be related
and you know i mean i was thinking it just you know
my complaint would would be um that i think that you know the kids in the neighborhood run wild
and they they destroy property
and they you know steal each other's toys and stuff
and there's just no respect for for people or property
and i guess you know when you stop to think of it these kids have probably been deprived of a lot of attention that they've needed all their lives
i know that in in you know in sweden what they have there it's really their medical plan but it also deals with this subject because if a woman uh is working and i think even if she's not and has a child the government subsidizes her to stay home and raise the child
but for how many years
i don't i don't know
until it um
oh that's great
and i think that that's a real a much much more viable solution really
and so i was able to just go to a class and teach when my son was little
and so i'd be gone you know an hour and fifteen minutes or something at a stretch
and then yeah
and you know nobody seemed to have a big problem with that
so that's an interesting issue though
oh there's been so many
actually another one that i a question i would have is
i guess i'm being you know beyond the age of thinking of this this problem
but i think you put your finger on it when you said that they're not respected if they don't work because it seems to me that a lot of people i know women i know are doing very menial jobs in a certain sense certainly financially and i mean when i see the amount of clothes that they buy and and how much it costs them to buy fast food on the way home i'm sure that they're not making quote making money for the family on this and and probably you're right
i mean you know when i think of this one friend who makes probably twenty thousand dollars a year and i'm sure she spends at least that in clothes plus you know fast food every day and out to lunch every day
if she sat down and looked at it she'd be like god what am i doing this for you know
and i mean you know even though they don't have children they they have relatives
and you know the husband would certainly like a lot more attention
and and she wouldn't have to hire somebody to clean the house and do the gardening
and so i i guess you're right
oh that's true
um uh some people now it seems like are turning back toward actually trying to find out what they're in it for instead of just um
it it's it
you know it's just a place to go to visit uh to wear your nice clothes and and to sit around and talk
but um i think a lot of people are really you know searching now to find find out who they are and who god is and what all that really means now
so that might be a positive change in society
oh it's it's um it's beginning i think
uh but among you know people i know i don't see a great you know
there are those people who have have had serious questions all along and you know are sort of pursuing it but um the churches here are growing leaps and bounds
and i thought it was more because of the the very transient nature of the area and that people were going basically just as you said as a social to meet people and that
but um it's hard to judge
and there are a lot of things changing i suppose
just you know the whole the whole environment i find um sort of you know
i wonder with with all our chemicals and and that and and the foods we eat
and you know young people that i know are getting very serious diseases
well i guess that's always happened
well it's just
it's maybe it's more unusual now when you know somebody quite young gets certain kinds of cancer
and in the past maybe the same percentage got them
but we didn't know it
or i don't know
well i guess we've sort of run dry a little bit
well do you watch much t v
well i watch in the evening with my kids
uh my children like to watch sesame street
but that is not my favorite programs
oh well we have only get two channels
but i am not crazy about t v much
well it kind of is an idiot box
now sesame street is a good program because uh
and i will let him watch that every once in a while
and he has learned to count to twenty from that
there are shows th- that i like
uh i like good family shows
uh i let my kids watch things like little house on the prairie
and the cosby show is uh is uh kind of unrealistic as a family unless you live in upper class and have money
i think that sometimes the things they show on there though uh
the problems that their kids get into are are good to uh show that they do have problems anyway
but they also have a lot easier time disciplining their kids than real people do
i mean like i said real life is not that easy
and uh i watch a show that i like i- for entertainment
uh it is called the quantum leap
oh i love quantum leap
i i like uh how the how he has to help with the people that he that he becomes
uh because it is not a show that he just becomes these people and then he lives there for a while and then he is gone
and still my little boy he watches videotapes
he won't um
but it is a not really a good baby sitter
and he is four years old
and he just does not like to go out there by himself
and i will let him watch the t v when i am wanting to get my house work done
but other than that i do not like him glued to the t v all the time
well i do not think it is it is healthy all the time either
uh and my kids like to to go play with their friends
and so i guess i do not mind too much when they do watch a little bit
and there are shows that i really put my foot down on
well we made the mis-
and that is one of the worst oh
i do not let him watch it anymore because the the pieces like especially where they kill somebody it is just not good
i mean it is just real violent
and it is like they show bloody
you know things
and they show it in slow motion
and and everything like that
and before in a western or something in the in the olden days
and they were gone
and and it was not uh
not like today uh
today it is it is really graphic
oh that is a fun show
it is it is cute
oh i really like that one
and they have got the he man uh
well uh i think uh
oh well it sounds like we have the same tapes for our kids anyway
language and violence and sexual y- you know
i i get kind of uh saying i am sorry kids this is
and i i think it is important that i see what they are watching
they do have like those parental control things on the uh remote controls you know where you can block out what channels you do not want them to watch
oh i do not know because i do not have that
well my my uh stepfather and them have my stepfather my father-in-law and them have that
and uh they do not have any kids
but they was told how to use that
but still when the kids get older they learn how to break through that parental control
oh do they
so it is it is i am hoping that he will grow up not really caring much for those movies because now we have got a lot of western tapes
well i think that is a good show too
and like the man from snowy river we have oh
and he also likes star trek
now star trek is good movies good shows
the uh series
uh i think not even the old one but the new one too
and my little girl has mister spock's ears
oh that is not a problem anyway
but it is fun
uh now i like uh everything mi- oh
not michael douglas um oh
the the man right now who is having uh who has done uh bonanza and then he did little house on the prairie
oh michael landon
oh now there
but i loved little house on the prairie especially when melissa gilbert grew up
so it is you know
and i liked that show because it it portrayed i thought really well uh pioneer kind of days
that is about the only uh show i have seen where every time they sit down at the table they pray before they eat
and i thought that was real neat
but i do not
and his parents are there
they have it like before one of the church things uh you know church that comes on
and it is a just this little dot
and he will go out and get himself into trouble and come home
and the parents will tell him that there is a verse in the bible that will help him with that
oh i have not seen that
well it is
but we will miss every once in a while
and i will let kyle watch that
and he just
well i even like jot
i mean i
well let us see
uh it is twelve or ten down here
well i will look and and see
oh well this is of the mornings
uh around nine or ten i think
it is before one of the i think it is before the first baptist in sherman airs
uh comes on before
well we'll look
and his name is jot
and then he has got a friend named cat
and i think the dog is the only one that is not a a dot
and like i say they they teach him stuff from the bible
and i think it is just a real cute show
i am trying to get my little boy into reading uh like church books and things
we have got like noah's ark and oh lord is my shep-
he is he is getting to where he likes them
we got him a little jesus doll uh about a year ago
and he has always kept that
well i really like
and that is a uh
like a a song
but they're uh worship through music kind of things
but they are up to date uh
and some of them are like uh videos like music videos that go along with the songs about church and jesus
and and i
so it's a a christian songs
oh that sounds fun
and uh i really like that
uh i turn that on on sunday mornings
and i do not you know
and so my kids do not uh have an
and uh to uh
uh we have not camped in any of those places
but we used to go to tyler state park and uh daingerfield
and in texas that is where we camp basically uh
and it has some really wonderful uh sights that are in the wooded areas
uh the facilities are quite nice
and our children liked liked it quite well
uh the kids are well they are quite a bit younger than
and you know they
and uh it was just it was just a really nice place to camp
uh now daingerfield is
i think that's a little bit mor- more east further east and and maybe south if i am remembering where that is
at any rate it was it was very nice as well
but tyler we sort of got spoiled with i think
but uh we had lived in michigan before we came here and uh had done a lot of camping in michigan
and then also we had done some camping in colorado in the mountains
so uh my parents were real avid campers
and my husband's parents were really avid campers as well
so i guess we just kind of came by it naturally
and how many does it sleep uh comfortably
well there well supposedly
but th- they
well sort of early on especially as our children got a little bit bigger uh we invested in some stacking uh cots you know that were like bunk bunk beds
but they were cots fold up cots
that really gave us a lot more space um floor space and
uh gave us a place to stack things during the day
so that was real nice
but uh we uh
like my in-laws also had a camper or uh a pop up tent you know one of those trailer tops
and those are really nice too
a little more uh luxurious so to speak
di- do they have a kitchen in them
in fact it even had had a little refrigerator uh and the whole business
and you did not have to to be hauling things out of your the trunk of you car
and that was nice
so uh do you have plans for for any other camping trips in the near future
uh maybe uh maybe back to caddo or
uh purdis creek
or i like bob sandlin too
and there is uh not really camping
and sometime i like to go to eisenhower up on lake texoma
but we drove through it just one time when we were in that area
and it's real lovely
so it's it's really quite pretty
uh are you um
oh do you have a favorite among all those that you have been to
oh fr- from those three
just just uh from when i have been an adult i like caddo the best
uh is it true that caddo lake is the only natural lake in the state of texas
i i would
and i would love to see what it looks like
it's not it's not very deep
and they did build a dam on it
but it was there before they built the dam
oh i see
huh well that might be some place where my husband and i can go
um our children are both grown
and and so it's just pretty much the two of us who do things
and so uh we thought we might take some weekend trips and maybe that would be a good place to to go to and see what it looks like
and i i don't know
probably spring is probably the busiest time anywhere in texas
especially with uh uh
and um have uh some happy camping trips
uh well right now we have one dog inside
but i mean she's an indoor dog
and how long have you had them
the dog is probably about about thirteen fourteen years old
and the cats are they might be as old
well that's interesting because we have a simi-
but we do have a dog
and she is going to be thirteen this summer
oh is that right
um she's um a mix of cockapoo cock- cocker spaniel and poodle
oh that's what ours is
oh well ours is black
and she's um been she's been a really a really good companion for me
she's like a little shadow you know kind of
and and um she's slowing down considerably
well that's to be expected at
but um she's been a good dog to have
and i don't know
well everybody always says no more
but i i think animals are really important in the family
um did you get yours as a pet for your chil-
oh well i was wondering if you got your dog originally as a pet for them or just because you'd had dogs before
well we have had we had had a a dog before
and uh this one we bought by accident
a farmer called us and wanted us to call the animal shelter to co- or the dog catcher or somebody to come and get this puppy that
and i said gee she sounds like a cute little dog
so that's how we got her
so that often happens that way
well we had um intentionally um planned to get a dog
we had just moved into this house and um decided to wait about a year and then went then we went out then and found one
and um she was so cute because
i mean they were all over the place
and she was real docile and
and i thought
what was funny was that um our daughter must have been
and um she just loved this little dog
but i think she loved her too much because the dog has never been real comfortable with her
our son on the other hand who was about eleven at the time was um not very interested in pets
but as it turned out he and this dog have gotten to be really good pals
oh for heaven's sake
so you just never know how that works out
but they say it's real important for children to have pets because uh
nobody is going to you know reprimand them or
and the nursing homes now they're finding that it's real important to take a pet into a nursing home
i have been i have been reading and seeing about that on television
our one our one nursing home in has one
he he kind of has free run of the place and there is some- or somebody takes care of him
but he goes out people
and real nice dog uh
it's funny how um how pets can kind of um oh take on a certain status in certain areas
i mean um that made me think of uh when our daughter was looking at colleges we visited a campus in um saint louis
um there were several dogs on the campus
but they didn't appear to belong to anyone
i'm sure someone you know fed them
but um our guide that day said that the la- one woman many many years ago had given a huge sum of money to to the university on the condition that there be um dogs just kind of left to roam aro- around the campus
that's that's kind of great
and it kind of made it seem more homey too
but um th-
and it just you know kind of goes along with what you were saying
about the dog having sort of free run of the the nursing home
so um but uh i
in all our years of marriage um
and it's been uh sort of a a change for my husband because as a a a boy growing up his father had dogs
but they were always hunting dogs
and so they were never allowed in the house you know
so having a pet was a little bit different for him
well we've had a lot of different pets
we had the kids had rabbits for pets
and we also raised them for food
and we've had it we've had a skunk for a pet
oh my golly
but like she uh
uh you can't you could never call her and she would come to you
and uh their eyesight they can't see very far either
be- before we got her everybody said oh they're just like a cat you know
and uh they're not
i mean they use the litter box
that's that's really something
um how long did you have that
oh my how how long
and finally my children are the ones who said mom you've put up with that skunk long enough
and i don't think she was there a week till the men moved her buil- built her a pen outside
oh my gosh
and i thought i put up with that all those years
and this is what it took finally
we've had we've had cats
we had we had two siamese cats
uh one of them ran off
or he i guess it was a male he ran off twice
and the second time he never came back
and we would see him uh several miles from our house
and he got huge down there
but he he never came back
that's in- that's interesting
i i wouldn't picture a siamese as being an outdoor cat
well he wasn't a whole lot
but uh he did go out sometimes
and uh they ma-
the the cats
and the vet had told us they get strange
and their cat was not a friendly cat
it was it was not a good
it was just did get strange
so that that was right
and since they've moved to where they are they let the cat out
and it has improved the personality
american- americans like me
and whether i night uh uh not
i think that we're paying too much taxes um that including taxes in general or income tax
and um the other thing was do we get what we pay for
i mean what what is our what is our opinion on that
so are you prepared to talk
oh i guess so
well i can just tell you a little bit about taxes in texas
i don't know of any other state um does not have a a state income tax right
so we don't have a state income tax
but we certainly make up for it in other ways here
um for instance the local um sales tax is eight and a quarter percent
uh we have a six percent sales tax
and you have state income tax also
well it's been
people here have just have this um
and it's starting to show um in a lot of ways as far as things that are just totally under funded
and and i don't know if texas is ever going to be able to to um totally avoid having an income tax or not
i think eventually they're going to have to do it but um do you think you pay too much there
or how do you feel about that
oh really interesting
um the taxes
but uh oh i don't know uh
we don't have uh tax on clothes do you
i know new york also has a sales tax on clothes and i know a lot of kids like going to college with me that lived in new york or out of state and a lot of them would buy their clothes in pennsylvania just for the simple sake of not paying that
um we don't have tax on groceries for instance uh
well we don't have it necessarily on food
but then there's other things that they nail you for it like health and beauty products you know
i should i should have um delineated
it's the food the consumable food parts that you know we don't have to pay tax on
and you really have to watch your your um bill
sometimes i think um it's real interesting to look to see how many things that i buy in a grocery store which are not really edible groceries
and that's when it really starts to add on
and um so um that's that is sort of a help
but um i don't know
it's just eight and a quarter just seems like an awfully lot of of tax on uh any sale as far as i'm concerned um
it's real interesting this last um tax season
and the last tax season i had a just a part time job helping out in a tax office
and the woman that owned the office was saying she'd had this business for oh probably seventeen or eighteen years
and she was saying as the years have gone on there are fewer and fewer things that people can uh take off of their income tax
and you know if you're not a home owner or if you haven't sold property or uh have something major like that it's hardly you know it's just not much else you can do
and she said it's really taken the fun out of doing taxes for people for her because she used to be real creative about helping them find ways of
you know accumulating receipts
can't do oh really can't do it any more
well i i i also was a student
i just graduated in may and um i graduated with a finance degree
but that was the big joke the accountants or the people who found ways to cheat on your income tax
how interesting oh gosh
well you are you are the same age as my daughter because she just graduated from college this year too
um nevertheless i am a student and poor
so it's uh um you know it's been
i guess as far as people like uh our family we can feel like sometimes we pay more than our share as middle class people with americans with um college age students you know
and and i there just i don't know
i i realize you know that we have uh graduated tax brackets
but i think they should still go back
and instead of putting the burden more on the middle class i think the burden should be put more on the wealthy
because it seems like they still come out okay um you know
yeah you know they always have the argument well you know well who's to say we don't work harder to get that you know
and the ones that get the most pay do the least work
that the higher they get the you know
it seems like um they must feel like they're paid for all of the years of experience or um or something or just the title sometimes um
and it it doesn't seem fair
and i i know a lot of people do make money um you know in in good investments and things like that
but i think that's a lot of luck and a lot of gambling and not a not a whole lot of work
and i don't like that part of the finance you know whatsoever
but like what i was saying about the social security that's real you know
it never bothered me until we started talking about it in my classes and then the more i think about it the more i think i'm paying in to something that i
granted you know i'm paying for my grandparents but i'm never going to see that
or what's left is not going to be worth anything you know in terms of how
i put in much more than that you know
i haven't heard much in recent years um about social security
i mean for a while there not too long ago they were they were saying that the whole system was going to be bankrupt you know before very long because so much was going out for programs that were it wa- that originally it was never intended to be used for
or you know programs just weren't in existence and then um i
but if you have talked about that in your classes you know in the last few years i'm sure that you have heard
well um i don't know
but i guess you know
you got to look to what they put you know you have decent roads at least
you have to appreciate yeah what what you do get for them sometimes and um i guess it's it's worse you know
i'd rather be able to control my money as much as i do with what's left over taxes than to live in oh england or um some countries where so much of it is socialized that you don't see any of that money at all and so you know i guess it's all relative
instead of thinking how much you know that i'm paying out i like to just look at it and say oh well everyone else is doing it too you know
and i live in the dallas texas area where there's a lot of pollution
and i'm up in wisconsin uh my name is terry and uh in the small town we don't
but uh we're not that far from the city where there's tons of pollution
and um oh
before moving to wisconsin lived across from where they were um gravel pits and also where they were making tar
and so we would occasionally if the wind was blowing the right direction would get the smell of tar
and it would uh
so and it was like miles away
but just the idea of having that come across the way it did in the wind kind of made you know that there was a lot of pollution
and that was just one small corporation that was doing the pollution of that
but also um where we also lived too it was very close to a highway
so got a lot of fumes from uh trucks and cars
and you would literally see the pollution on your furniture
i mean it was on your tables
and it was dirty um type of dust
i mean it wasn't the typical dust that you get way out in the country um for
i live in a small um town now quite a ways from the twin cities about an hour away
and i may dust once a week
and that's all it needs versus every day when i lived in the city so
huh i'd never thought about that being a cause
it it comes right on through through the screens
the only way that you could actually live in the in the city is to close your windows and have an air cleaner system right in your home that would take the air from the outside and clean the air before it would get into the house and so it was quite a dirty city
um if you were well protected by trees which catch a lot of the pollution then you're fine
but most of the time in the city you have lots of high rises you have lots of other things that are not catching the pollution
and it's just going for miles and miles and miles
and it's landing somewhere with the wind
and i live in a suburb that doesn't have much vegetation trees it was all cotton fields
so we don't have that advantage
and ours i think is primarily cars where we don't carpool like we should an airport
i'm nineteen floors up and i look out toward d f w international
and there's just an awful brown haze all the time and i can imagine it's even worse for people living over near the airport
i mean our air quality um in the twin cities is a lot better than what we've heard about california and maybe in the other areas
but um they were always talking about the air quality of today is this you know the ozone or whatever
and it's kind of scary because the air is something we take for granted and many people are too busy getting to work not thinking about okay i could have carpooled with a friend
even my husband was uh talking to some of the guys at work
now he's uh fifteen miles away from work
but he was talking wouldn't it be nice to carpool
and the guy says well it's too close
it wouldn't pay and so
ex- exactly and so my husband says well that's fine you know
it would save quite a bit on the wear and tear on cars and you know the gas
or if they do they they drive with one little buddy uh
at least it's with one person but most of the time people are saying forget it
it's too much involvement but yet
but we're paying for it
and i think of my daughter
and i'm sure you think of your children
and you kind of say to yourself what kind of future will they have when they think back and say well my parents did have the choice to kind of make a difference and maybe people are trying
but they have to change attitudes
and it seems to me that it's already so evident with our children having a lot more respiratory infections than we had growing up you can really see it
i i had a chance to go to bolivia a couple years ago
and of course there's no industry very little trash
they they don't even have that much that they burn because they consume everything down to the thread
and it amazed me
i i just had totally forgotten how
and i sell family products
so i i don't really i don't really dress up a whole lot
well i i work uh
and i do contract work
and so and i work with another c p a who just started his own practice and i work with him a couple days a week and so when i go to his office or to other clients' offices then i'll dress up but otherwise it's great being at home in jeans or shorts or whatever
so that that makes it pretty nice
it's kind of weird because before i used to work you know full time
and and uh it seemed like i was wearing a suit every day just about
well you'd have to dress differently when you're working every day i think
and so it's uh
so it's it's it's very nice
well my my dress up
so what i wear depends on the weather
uh so i really i know a lot of the avon representatives are portrayed as being very dressed up
but i mostly dress i try to dress nice but for convenience because when the weather's bad when i go into the home i take off my shoes
and i don't too often take off my coat even
so uh i really don't have to dress up like y- you would like if you're in an office or something
well i imagine that where you live uh you're in warm clothing quite a bit of the year
uh well not actually because we really only have maybe three four months of i'd say warm weather
oh is that right
and the rest is uh gets into the cooler weather
so i don't know
so you all are waiting for that
but for now but for now we have a lot of ice and snow in the wintertime and uh cold weather
now my daughter works all the time
so she dresses
i think you know you have to spend more money on your clothing and that because you do have to have the appearance a good appearance to do a good job where you work
well down here it's sunny most of the time
and uh usually warm
i mean we had a few cool days uh this month
but not anything i'm sure compared to what you've had so far
so i mean people are still wearing shorts
and and uh usually around halloween it starts getting cooler
so you start you know breaking out a coat at that time
but that that lasts you know for a few months
did you find you wore uh slacks when you were working full time
or did you did they wear more dresses and skirts
it was i think it was one of those things where it's not like someone came out and said you can't wear them
it was one of those understood things that you just you know either wore you know a dress or
not even a dressy slack a dressy suit slack suit even if it's all
not not with what i did uh
sometimes like the secretaries might but even then you didn't see them wearing slacks too much
and i really you know
and and i wouldn't have mind- minded you know wearing those especially when it gets pretty cold
but i didn't know if the trend changes you know if uh
you know i think it's one of those things where it's not viewed upon as being professional
look more like a woman huh
and it's the men that make the rules
uh well then you you you know why they make them then
we usually you know
skirt and skirt and blouse or suit or dress is what you see down here
so it's nice with me working at home because i can wear pants
no no one can see me unless i'm you know g-
but yet you need to keep up an appearance for your husband too though at home
because that's i i believe
but i'm not going to put a skirt on just for him
oh you don't think you will huh
well you'll be excused because considering everything
but i i look at homemaking as a job also
uh being a homemaker
and i i think sometimes we lose sight
uh by the fact that we don't sometimes watch our dress
what do you do there in lubbock as far as uh recycling is concerned
well you know they actually started
and i assumed it was t i wide uh
they they started putting out at least recycling bins for the paper uh i've you know
either computer paper or different types of paper
but i i guess i need to put it on paper and turn it in
wha- what would be more efficient about it
well the way they have you know they have boxes located at certain areas throughout a module or down the hall
or a lot of people aren't going to get up walk out of their offices and go there
you know where i use to work we had what we called tree boxes
and they were recycled cardboard
and you set it by your desk and you know as you got rid of a piece of paper you stuck it in there
and when it filled up you called you know facilities whoever to come pick it up
and they brought you another box
so not only is it you know
i think more people would take advantage of it and use it uh
i think you save a lot of the cleaning service's time and effort and money that we are paying for them to to empty the trash cans and combine it and bundle it and things like that now when it could all be done in one step kind of type thing
i i i uh was going to say cause i know i have right here a trash can for trash and a trash can for for paper on it you know
and uh if if i have a if i i printed up something that i don't need it just chunk it in the in the paper
but somebody still has to collect all that and bundle it together
and whereas if you had a box that pretty soon it got full you close the box it's already bundled it's already done for you
so you're saving a lot of time and effort
so uh what else do they do in the dallas area
well uh as far as t i is concerned i'm not sure
uh and i have heard you know uh in residential situations
and i have heard in residential situations uh like in plano uh that they are doing uh stuff like having recycle picked up where uh the city uh i guess the sanitation department uh as part of their responsibility picks up uh the recycled items as well you know the plastics and the paper
and uh the only responsibility of the of the patron is to separate them
and then the the
uh i guess the department takes them and and does what they do with them
and it doesn't cost the patron anything
doesn't really cost the uh department
they don't pay they don't pay for the recycled items
i i've been wanting to put like two of three bins like right out my garage door where you know from the kitchen where you know you can throw cans in one or the glass in the other
or the the even uh
but that's kind of what i want to set up so because we do go through aluminum cans you know
well wh- what kind of services do you have there in lubbock as far as
uh where can you take your recycle items
i i lived in abilene for a uh
it was so hard to uh
you know if you you wanted to recycle you newspapers it was impossible
you know we can take oil like car oil recycled oil to
they have uh uh dump areas like at the fire departments throughout town
uh i don't know that they yet have the facilities here to do the tin cans
uh i think they can do the plastics like the liter bottles things like that
uh but i i don't know
well that's good
you know of of the waste
and you know i i like to see you know
you drive through burger king now and the bags are recycled paper and you know so you know i feel like people are more aware of it or becoming more aware of it
you know maybe it's making an impact
do you tend to buy more recycled items that if something uh the pack says recycled and something else doesn't
i'm not as good about searching something out like that but if i am there and the choice is there i would probably take the recycled product
so you know that's just where i probably need to be a little more responsible citizen wise you know looking or searching those out because you figure if we as the citizens do that then the manufactures and producers will start packaging it that way
so uh you know they are getting away from the styrofoam
well discussing air pollution today i guess
um uh well give me your first impressions
uh i don't know
um i think industries and companies provide a lot of it and with uh i guess with the oil burning over in kuwait and stuff that would have a lot of air pollution in it
uh puts a whole
but uh that stuff going on over there
what what uh what part of pennsylvania are you in
um i'm north of pittsburgh
so it's it's amazing too you know with that with the oil wells burning over there that's the exact same stuff that's coming out of cars every day just in uh just in a little different grade i guess
but uh in dallas we've got we've just uh brought in a whole new set of requirements on inspections and things like that for cars because uh people just don't use mass transit and stuff in dallas
and you see an awful lot of uh one person vehicles on the road on during rush hours
um you know there's uh there's a lot of industry around
but uh it's not it's
um we have a couple we have like a steel mill and a couple refineries and stuff
and i know there's a lot of air pollution going in there
and like they they get fined whenever they do the air pollution but the fine is nothing you know
like like two hours of output or something like that
i a uh i grew up in south dakota
so i was never
um there were always e p a people and what not were always telling us that uh farm chemicals and what not were destroying our water system and all that but we just we just never saw the results
there was there was dust in the air during planting seasons and what not
but that that was all we ever saw
and then five years ago i moved to dallas
and i suddenly started to understand what burning eyes and all that stuff is about that i'd always heard about
it uh it's it gets it's real depressing
in the morning sometime you can tell if it's a good day or a bad day by uh how far out from downtown uh you can be on the road and still not see it
oh my god
i mean it's not
i don't think dallas is considered uh a real bad place for air pollution
but you you can tell you can tell the differences in the days when it's when the haze is kind of yellowish gray instead of just being a a foggy misty color and uh it it's a little it's a little disappointing sometimes you start to realize what you're breathing
but i don't know what they can do to really prevent it you know
what you know
i mean they fine the industries
but you know that doesn't seem to stop them there i don't know what else they can do
it it's that there really isn't a whole lot
it's one of those uh
um but i also believe that the earth is a kind of a self-regulating system
and uh it will clean itself up eventually
the whole idea is not to not to push the limit too hard i guess let the you know let the natural natural systems take care of the problem as much as possible
i just don't understand you know what else anyone can do about it
you know it's i mean it it should probably be a big issue you know because it's it's doing a lot of damage
it's something you know
and it's one of those things
it it's so hard to measure what what the damage is it's kind of like oh
i guess it's kind of like kind of like cigarette smoking you know
it it could go on for years and years until they start to see some results and people can actually actually say yeah it's it's it's doing doing some damage and something's got to be done
um there's you know there's a lot of things like that
you can uh you can pound on something for a long time before it finally breaks
but until it breaks you don't really know that there you were doing anything to it
well i really don't know
well that's that's
i think we both agree it's it's one of those deals that uh
i just think there's a lot of other problems right now and uh we've done a lot to take care of it
i mean you know and um i i know where you know where a couple of the mills that have
i know they put things on their stacks you know to filter the smoke and do all kinds of things
but i mean every now and then it breaks you know
and and you just have smoke going out into the air for a day or two until you can get it fixed
and so so you know it's something we we have tried to help
oh there's no doubt about it
i don't know if you ever happened to see some of the like twenty twenty and what not about rumania and east germany when they first got pictures out of there about how some of their systems had been running for twenty and thirty years and uh you know they had absolutely no regulations no controls whatsoever
and they had destroyed entire forests and what not just because the air was so polluted
that's that's the kind of things that uh you don't see in this country
and that's that's why i think that you know it's
but uh i think it's all relative to the to the time and place
and i think right now it's it's pretty much under control
well you bet
well amy it's been uh kind of overcast today and cloudy
and i was really worried about it raining because it has there's been some dark clouds
and it's been um
and you can't put it on if it's suppose to rain within forty-eight hours
and so i keep hearing the forecast it's going to rain it's going to rain it's going to rain
but it really hasn't rained
several times in the last couple of weeks it has looked rainy that day and not not done anything
and we have a lot of trees in our yard
and i probably
and so if it's an overcast day then the weather is pretty blah
i have two ki- preschoolers a three year old and a two year old
and if it's not nice and they can't go out it's really the pits
oh i bet
but i appreciate it
that makes a big difference but i uh
and i'm working on a carnival that's going to be in a couple of weeks for our school
and i'm thinking that this has been
and it's been kind of scary
it's kind of been sc- cloudy every day
i thought well i'm just not anxious to have worry about the weather
well my three and half year old he really wants
i mean all winter long
so i'm hoping you know that
it just seems like the weather around here goes so quickly from being winter to you know muggy and hot
and it's just you never really have like nice cool sixty-five or seventy degree weather with sunshine you know
and i miss the seasons that you know that we used to get up there that you just don't have down here
well i know in um
and we always had pretty nice four seasons
and and you know ex-
but uh i like that
and we moved here from houston in in uh july
and everyone kept saying oh you're going up north it's not going to be so hot
oh really yeah
oh it was extremely hot
well the air conditioning was broke
the stress and the heat the record heat
and you know i was worried about every time we came to an intersection
i know my husband doesn't have air conditioning in his car and he when he comes home from work you know during the summer he's just wa- he feels like he's burning like he's been baking for an hour
oh i know
but but i uh understand that this is kind of typical for this time of year that rainy season
i hate having to water so much around here you know
we never used to have to water our lawns you know in chicago it was always enough rain here and there so here if you don't water it just looks awful
i just hate to spend the money just going down the drain and watering grass you know
that is that is awful and it it takes time
and the the kids they
and they want to go out and run in it and get all muddy
so you're going do i want a di- a green lawn or a muddy feet
so that adds to it you know traipse in and out with whatever the weather is like out there
well i don't know
the nice thing i'm looking forward to is uh not having a hurricane season
we always had uh big concern about hurricanes
and they're close enough to the coast
and you know you had to have a supply like uh emergency supply on hand all the time during the hurricane season
and and it was pretty spooky
because you always have to think you know what's the weather doing
and do we have enough you know um
really every time i store batteries i wind up going to use them and they're dead
well now this is a little bit of relief although they still have warnings all the time around here for you know tornado season hurricanes and stuff
well i yeah i don't really like tornadoes either
but uh at least there isn't
we fe- i feel like i got rid of something
well i've been worried about mostly with having
i mean i have to keep the sun screen on them just constantly when they go outside because they say it's just so dangerous for little ones to get a bad sunburn so
and it is
and i just i can't believe the the record temperatures that have were here last summer that
oh it was just unbelievably hot
and i can't stand to be outside at all when it's like that
i just don't even want to go out you know of the house to get the mail even
we had our air conditioning broke break last
and we had to call somebody out to fix it because i couldn't take it more than a few hours without it on
oh i know
well that would
but i guess um
and but it is
i hate having to leave the house clo- you know closed up all the time
and get some fresh air in the house
and it feels good
but but i guess
well have you been here during the real heavy heavy rains
i mean i can't remember what time of year
no but i remember
now that sounds awful
now i have seen those
it's you know has it like from one foot to four foot
and i thought i would never buy a house with a flood gauge down the street
talk about asking for trouble huh
well i've got some kids out on the trampoline i need to go look and see what they're doing
well have a good day
well you too
so what is your latest experience with painting
and my father would be painting and i'd ask him if i could
so we didn't have to do any painting
and the condominium we moved in before my husband went over and painted
the experience that i've had is that um
and he said oh it's going to be just about four hours
and he said well all i got done was the taping around
it it looks so easy just slapping paint on
i had an addition put on and um we and i decided
because i put these beautiful french doors in and so i decided okay i'll just you know have them paint this little room you know a little ten by ten dining area
he said well i'll be done this afternoon you know and pretty soon before you know it you know he's run into so many problems
and it's just
but um it just took him so much longer
and and he was there to paint the french doors also
um and if you've ever painted french doors which my husband just finally said he wasn't going to do
um then then just
we we got this painter
and i just called him because i got a little ad out of the you know the adcose or whatever in the mail and uh you know just got this painter person over here
and he said yeah i can finish it in a day
oh i know
and i go what makes you a professional
but he just kept painting on those french doors you know
and each little
so he had to redo them like three times
and so it's just been painting yeah
i mean hire a professional
but that doesn't guarantee anything
and it really
he it was like
but one had more blue to it
oh and that can make a difference
i mean and they bring the uh you know little samples and you've got like maybe five hundred
well that's an exaggeration
but there are just so many tints upon tints upon tints
and you don't know what you to want to
and by the time it's on i i
selected a what i thought was white
and it was like you said you know it was blue blue cast to it
and it looked awful on
so that was the next problem
and it was a major project getting the money together
but you know we worked something out because he was kind of apologetic that it took so long
well i don't recall my parents having that much trouble
i mean you know they painted our rooms all the time
we just had brick on like as accent on a certain area of our home
and so he had to paint the outside all the time
but to us you know
we're going oh we're so glad we have a brick home all we have is like trim around the windows or something
so we haven't gotten to the point where we're
you just you just get in there and do it yourself
you know we've done that the whole time we were in school like
so i i want to get to the point where i could feel like i could just hire someone
well it's it's not that easy
it's like it's uh
i don't even know if i you know i would not even recommend this person again to anybody
i i don't know if you get into the mind set where you just say well i'll accept something or you just really have to get on their back i mean
about things and and working with what they say are professional painters
i tell you what the fumes that the the paint gives off makes you wonder what these people do any-
i mean the fumes are amazing
and i i don't think i could stay sane
and working with all that
so i mean i know it's not lead based any more paints
and they have to live with that every day in in their clothes and everything
oh it does
and that was not something that we had to pay for
so they sent their painters in to to repaint a corner of the ceiling and then you know repaint the whole ceiling
and i think it's because they you know they were accustomed to working in that
but i couldn't imagine that they came in and painted it the whole ceiling you know just within a couple of hours
well maybe there are some professionals out there
really it does
uh for all that
well um i hope you have a nice day today
and you take care
i guess it's ge- getting to be lunch time
well a lot of women are knowl- as knowledge about football as i am
well i can understand that
i you know i kind of like the cowboys too
i i always enjoy watching the stal- the dallas and pittsburgh together
well actually it's probably closer to fort worth
but it's it's in the same area
he bought uh bought a big horse farm out in a little town called roanoke texas
but he pops up on the dallas scene quite often
he's such a motivator he
primarily you know with the quarterbacks
i wished i wished they could work something
well what about the houston oilers
uh houston has had some wonderful talent you know down through the years
and in the earlier years they really had some super teams
and warren moon
is is proving himself quite well right now
he's one of the few uh black quarterbacks that there are
but he's no longer with the team
i hope they they do better
but uh i think they still have a little i think they're still such a a young team i think they still have a little bit to go before they reach the potential
or if they even reach that potential again you know they may never reach that again
well that's a tough
oh i don't know
but basically everyone that was on the team then is gone now
but then he he just left
of course they had so many you know nice uh choices because their record was so lousy the last few years
you know quite a few of the
the guys they pick you know m- may never play a game
you jus- never know
it's it's a gamble
they may get hurt or not be able to participate at that level if you know
well who would you say is your favorite player or has ever been your favorite player
as far as you know dedication
of course there have been some other great ones too dick butkis and bradshaw you know
but if i had to pick one i would probably pick sam huff as a matter of fact
oh you know that's really funny um
well i i come from a large family
and the- there's quite a few boys
so that's kind of how i got in with the football
either watch that or watch nothing
and um at one time i could name all the players on the steelers you know
and but even when bradshaw was playing i i don't know i i didn't particularly care for him
of course the- a quarterback has a big ego
they really d- they have to have
they always think they can win you know which is the way it should be
i mean they were good
but i you know you couldn't deny that
but i didn't i thought you know well i just didn't really care for either one of them
and uh stallworth and swan
i i i like not just with the pittsburgh i like watching on saturday afternoons when they'll have like the plays or the the best plays from you know from the week or something
then i like watching their bloopers too you know
some of them a a bit embarrassing
well they make mistakes too i guess
you know especially i would say the receivers
it's it must just take a hundred percent concentration i guess because they know they're going to get hit
it's just a matter of how hard you know or where
well what did you think of um a couple years ago for the bears the refrigerator
i i'm knowing what you know
of course mike ditka was in dallas for years and years as coach is knowing his or you know knowing of his temperament i'm just surprised he ever you know kept the guy around
he's such a he's about a half hot head anyway such a temper
oh you know and to me he does um oh he's just so big and fat
i don't know you know
probably the guy is you know probably physically strong
i you know
but i guess it's just like you say a mass that nobody can seem t- to get out of the way
as far as him scoring touch downs you know i think that was kind of weird
dallas has a guy uh his name is nate newton
now he has a real weight problem too
but he manages to still keep playing
they they weigh him several times a year just to make sure he's not you know completely out of control
but i guess most every team has so- has someone like that
there's there are some really big guys playing in football
i guess you have to to you know to stay in the game i guess
um now who
i mean other than dallas would you say that you have uh a favorite quarterback
i mean the quarterback's seem to get most of the the attention you know
well you'd have to uh or i would have to say you know someone like montana i guess who's done so well for so many years
i re- i i enjoy watching him play
but he's still performing
and like you say warren moon's an excellent
but he's very exciting to watch
i i i enjoy watching him also
what about uh marino
i'd i never was you know too a whole lot of a big fan you know
because he he well wa- he was the youngest quarterback there was wasn't he
but he's a very young fellow
of course a quarterback can look so good if he's got a lot if he's got a good supporting cast you know
uh i didn't i don't know
i i just think you know marino will get better
and uh his team's not as good as what it was when he went to the super bowl
but they all do i guess
it's it's cyclical i guess
and with age comes
oh yes very much so
that that forces a lot of the guys to get out of the game
and they're so young
but they're retired you know
and their so young still
i read some time well not too long ago that the average uh professional career only lasts seven years
so that's when you think about it that's really not a very long time of course
but then you think about how many have been in there longer than that
but if the average is seven years that means a lot of guys don't make it seven years you know
a lot of them would have to get out like in just a couple
holy smokes i didn't
that's that's a pretty short career on average
of course they play their you know cards right and do some good investments
but a lot of them don't unfortunately
um what do you think of the uh l a raiders
used to the the oakland
they they're always branded you know as a bunch of outlaws
if their if their you know arrest record won't let abl- won't let them play anywhere else they seem to go to they seem to go to the raiders
but that just may be you know perceived
you know perception
al davis is he's a kind of strange character strange strange looking guy
they keeping talk about you know going
well uh anyways i'm not exactly sure
i i wasn't really uh paying attention as to what particular uh parts of capital punishment we're supposed to talk about
but it was uh basically what's your views on whether you thought there was certain cases that should be used that sort of thing
and uh i don't know
i've i've always thought that any uh crime that uh that uh intentionally where someone goes out and premeditatively takes another life would be the ones where i think that capital punishment would be necessary to keep that person from perhaps uh doing it again and even more so to get people on the outside who are professionals to realize that you know there's a a very steep penalty to uh be paid when that's done
and uh yeah
uh i believe in it too
and we're not supposed to
but uh i feel that it
you know on the premeditated murders i feel if you're you know i mean if it's beyond a doubt that you did it you know i would say go ahead and execute that person as well
but it's the cases you know like sometimes you you know you hear of people that they say they went to jail falsely you know
well you know you you got you got that point well h- you know what what if a mistake is made and you put someone you know to death that really didn't do it
but i would say that you know for that many people to all of them agree that you did it and it was premeditated it would be kind of hard for you know
if if the evidence wasn't overwhelming right
so uh i
well i think that should be likewise decided by the jury you know because i don't know i think a jury would be less likely to just send a man to death just for any reason
uh i'm not sure about pennsylvania whether we have it or not
but it's you know it's not very often
i think maybe last year was the first time in like eighteen years or something like that that anyone anyone from pennsylvania had gotten it
florida and louisiana i think and uh some of the
course they have such a crime problem because they have such a un- unemployment rate
uh you know
so then people you know tend towards crime
and then they
but it's funny that uh
i mean like you know like i said i think last year was the first time in like eighteen years for pennsylvania
but for some reason i think that you know it was something like that
and it surprised
and even florida i know they have it
and you don't really hear about it real often how many people
well in florida seems like uh two or three times a year
but you you think that
i mean if you think of how many premeditated murders are committed
you know compared to that and to how many people are being sent that doesn't seem like very many
course they have a requirement that uh that every single appeal must be permitted
so of course the the attorneys
you know even if the case is open and closed
they go all the way up to the supreme court you know
but they have to have every single appeal made open to them
and you know it's sort of strange because it almost
some of these guys are really uh you know violent son of sam killers and stuff like that you know
i mean they
and then they get out
everyone knows they're going get not going to get out
and they do it again you know
i don't i don't e- e- i don't
i mean if it's beyond a doubt that someone did premeditate someone a murder then i think you know that they should likewise you know someone should take their life also
but uh but are are you would you draw the line there with just the premeditated murder
uh a lot of the the the other violent crimes i don't really feel that strongly about
although you know stiffer sentences and lessening the effects of parole
i mean these guys are certainly not going to uh be
i mean they're getting into drugs and fights and all that stuff in prison
i think that's its only purpose is is you know to reduce uh the violence in the prisons so people behave themselves a little bit better if they think they're going to get off early off earlier
but some of these guys just don't care
and so uh
um that's possible i guess
i don't know uh
um so where do you live in pennsylvania
well i live in butler
but i'm at c- i'm at college
because uh you know
that's uh sort of interesting to get opinions as to where different parts of the country are because the more grass root country uh parts of the country tend to to support capital punishment where the places that are you know less in contact with crime you know the the more more urban i mean less
well see i'm i'm in kind i'm in kind
and that would be pushing it
so i mean this is definitely a college town
uh we're about two hours north of pittsburgh if that would help you out any uh
oh i've never heard of polk
it's uh an old uh university that turned into a place for the mentally retarded uh
oh i never heard of that
very old uh historical place there
uh so i
most of the kids here i you know
like you know just from dorm mates and stuff they'll say that they don't believe in it
but then after i would say my point of view then they'll say well yeah
you know da- you know
in that case maybe you know
you know i think people can be persuaded one way or another
i've never seriously ran into someone i mean like other than my priest you know who definitely says you can't take a you know you can't take anyone's life
uh anyone that is like so against it that you couldn't persuade them in any instance
well it it you know
you get certain circumstances where you hear about these people that have you know stolen kids and you know
done terrible things to them and killed them and you know that sort of thing
like i don't want that person sharing the earth with me you know
i mean that is just terrible
and uh you know we had a case like that here
and on the other hand you know people are saying that because the he knows because the criminals know that the uh penalties can be very severe
there's less criminals that are you know turning themselves in or you know pleading or whatever because they know that the judge you know if they find them guilty is you know has the the opportunity to sentence them you know for for the death sentence
but you know i look at that and say well they should have thought about that beforehand
well i'm just saying that that that's what the the client lawyers are saying
they're saying that you know you know more of my clients would have pleaded guilty if they would have gotten a light sentence instead of possibly having to to to get a death sentence because you can't plea bargain what the sentence is going to be
you can plea bargain what you're guilty of but you know
that's something you know
so i don't think that they deserve anything less
i don't i don't know
and so we have to go through a trial then to prove the person's guilty
and that costs money yeah
and perhaps we can
and perhaps we can't
and so the guy might get off
there's always a few of those people that are you know lost their head or whatever
anyways but uh yeah
and and the guy like i said he just uh said that he took her
but he won't admit that she died or whatever
and he won't say where the body is because he knows the penalty's very s- s- you know mandatory life sentences for murder
uh well i read everything uh i guess uh
uh well i like all kinds uh
in fact i was just reading uh a magazine now an automobile magazine
uh i like historical uh books time magazine newspaper how how to do it type things uh uh
oh the novels yeah
i am not into soap soaps and all that stuff
i am uh not into novels at all really oth- other than historical things
uh uh i am kind of a a chore person
i am again i am a fix it person
i i would read all those kinds of things
figures what like those uh magazines you get through the mail
and i read the engineering magazines
and uh well i am reading historical uh not a novel but historical book now about the uh russia before uh the czar not before the czar during the czar's time and what it was like and everything
what about like those time books that they put out about uh uh oh ancient discoveries
you know th-
how they found out like that uh ancient man per- performed uh brain surgery successfully
and stuff like that
oh you mean the ancient astronauts things
i i did not
some of that is uh
it is very interesting without question
i i do not really know that they have the answers in those books
th- they make conclusions in them that may or may not be true
but they are very interesting
th- that they have
but i am a superficial buff
i like i like it if it is fun
well i am kind of a hobbyist
so i i read all those things that uh
and being an engineer all those books that would bore everybody else you know how to do things
when she ever there is something i say well have you read the directions
i say well engineers we we are the few people in the world that read the directions yeah
uh we have got a book that says uh how do they do that
and it answers everything
well not everything
but a lot of silly little questions
those are oh interesting
oh you like science things
uh i have not gotten them in a long time
what is that uh one that is on t v
that book uh national geographic is really a fascinating book uh
uh if you ever get those
well that do not
but i have not gotten them in years uh
th- they were kind of expensive
they have wonderful pi- photographs and just amazing photographs that they have done
and she would have to come home at night cut out different
but she would have to cut out different colors
and that is the best book to go through those national geographic
they they they uh
and they are great
the photographers just got fantastic pictures in those things uh
oh now i do like national geographic and stuff because i like i said i like reading about i don't know animals
and the sloth it fascinates me
and it is just weird
you know i have not uh
or was it any
well we can talk about anything we want
uh i i glance at all newspapers
i do like uh
since the re- since the economy is doing so bad i never have read the uh uh financial pages more often than now you know and trying to analyze and look for some good news in in there you know uh
well for me there is no imme-
well wh- you know
but like i said i do not keep up on all that
well i have only been more interested because of things are doing so bad and everything
i thought well uh see if there is anything in there that uh uh would be s- positive you know
you always look for things with with this terrible recession that we are in uh
it is uh
hopefully uh we will recover here uh
i know i heard bush say that you know we are either bottoming out or seem to be
but that is bush saying that
and he he
i do not really know if uh any one person knows uh
uh what some of the problems are
uh but there there are some there are some interesting things in the paper really
well i like ann landers
but mainly i am a front page person
wi- with the so much uh
but with a family and everything there is just so much going on that i uh actually i am more of a r-
but uh it is easier to do when i do some chores
well i know at t i they have most of the stuff on the printout don't they i mean on the computer where you can read the daily news
every time i come in uh i will punch up
but they call it t news and all that
and i i do get uh
even the the last page is uh is sport uh listings and and different things uh and world news
you know about
you can read it in one minute you know
it is it is it is uh interesting uh with the computer to read the computer news and
i i guess that is a tha- that is a source of reading
i hadn't thought about that in that respect uh
well it just encouraged me to read it
it it does have a good uh simple uh you know
again you can read it in uh in a lot less than ten minutes
you can you can page through it in
i i skip over some of that
uh it is
well see that is me with the newspaper
uh i read it so less
and i watch so little t v i did not even know what the deal was with this uh oh
and he is tycoon or something
oh yeah uh
i did not even know i still do not know what the whole deal was with that
well i guess because he was so rich you know
when you are that rich uh you always get into the paper whatever if you have a family problem whatever
well he had a young girlfriend
he was he is well into his forties
and i guess he got a young girlfriend who uh
and and then every every time you take
you you are that rich you just get uh in that uh in the news immed- immediately you know
uh which is tough
and uh his business is going down the tubes so bad you know
he was uh uh essentially like you said a tycoon
uh donald trump and had it all
and then he is now uh essentially bankrupt you know
and so uh h-
who knows uh
but uh he was kind of an arro- arrogant guy
so i think the newsmen uh enjoyed uh writing about him on his way down you know
and his wife was very uh uh seemed to be very smart and actually running some of his business
it was uh she was actually somewhat of a business partner of his uh did very well
ivana trump uh
they have been on all the news and everything in the in the papers and uh uh on barbara walters and everything else
but i have got three kids
so it is hard to watch t v
uh uh i know what you mean really
well anyway i have enjoyed talking to you
well uh hang in there
and good luck with those kids
and have a good holiday
basically uh my husband and myself use the credit cards in regards to major purchases
but other than that it's not something that we use a lot of
uh we may have only two or three versus uh i know a lot of people have up to a half a dozen or uh up to a dozen credit cards
but uh ours are just major credit cards that we have and uh use uh use only when
is that like visa and and mastercard
sears is pretty major with us simply because we do uh
and they're real good with their appliance and stuff like that
but uh we try to avoid them with a passion because of the percent of interest rate
but if it's uh any large purchases uh you've got to kind of think about uh how much you're going to put down as far as uh payments on it so that you're not getting eighteen percent or twenty percent interest taken off
my my husband and i do basically the same thing
but we we end up sneaking a few in there that surprise us
but we do it mainly for you know the cash flow
what is that oh float
and i often will keep tra- track of what i've charged and sometimes deduct it from my checkbook already
so you know
and sometimes just
and keep a list and make sure i
especially around birthdays you know
if we go out to a restaurant oh just to float it
or i don't know
my husband has a a
or if it's a business transaction a lot of times that's important too to keep a better receipt of it
or anytime like a plane ticket or you know
but the float for more than a hundred dollars seems real nice for that that thirty
and we have you know haven't used that one too much
it's kind of fun uh
and you always get these preapproved uh credit card things coming through uh
so let's send you another credit card
or it's preapproved for
you're such a a wonderful person
that's that's to entice you to get more credit cards
and so you know we always laugh about that because it's quite a bit
i mean you know you always constantly getting those preapproved stuff
do you have uh an annual fee on yours
uh ours is through a bank yeah
and it just a
i i can't see paying an annual fee for it
i mean i almost
oh you're already paying them uh if you're if you don't pay it off within that month interest anyway
well it sounds like i'm being paged otherwise
well one thing
i i guess both of us are very much aware of the equality
uh it seems like women are uh just starting to really get some kind of equality not only in uh jobs but in the home where husbands are starting to help out a lot more than they ever did
uh it's not uncommon to see men doing dishes making supper or taking care of the kids
or som- uh
the generation of my parents and my great grandmother which uh they did everything
and they took care of the family
you know i think that's changed just in the last generation
but my husband is wonderful
i mean it it doesn't uh doesn't bother him at all to do the dishes
it doesn't bother h- him at all to do the laundry verses uh men from way back
well if you did that you were henpecked or whatever
and it's it's hard enough to be a woman out there trying to do everything uh you know and then kind of real light pay
so it's it's kind of a uh neat thing to see as far as equality in the households
and i think that's even going to get better even you know
it will be uh
or it doesn't matter if you want to be a nurse
it doesn't matter if you want to be uh the president
or it doesn't matter if you want to be a lawyer or a doctor
so i have always instilled into her
and i think mothers um are doing a really good job in raising their daughters to say hey you don't have to stay with nursing
as long as you uh go to school for it and get the education
well i feel like um to an extent that is really important you know that that um it is important for women who need to work uh or are in a position that they want to that they can do that
um but i also think it is important for them to be with the children
you know there's a certain part of me
i i think there there are some things that women just are designed to do better than men
and there are some things that men are designed to do better than women
you know that's not uh
well emotionally i think uh
women do a little bit uh
i i think that's the gap is coming closer a- as um what i've learned in uh just just being out there
and they get together
and they talk about issues of marriage talk about manhood talk about what they didn't have with their fathers
it may be in the future that men you know some men may be better parent or mothers than mothers themselves
um i i know of some mothers that i i guess i'd rather be with the father because the father is maybe more understanding more um low key more apt to be a better father than some mothers that i have seen that have been raised you know to develop whatever skills that they have
and some of the men are developing uh very good too
it may come down to where it's it's individual basis where everybody is treated an as individual
i will go out and make the uh take care of the uh money making
and it it wouldn't matter if it's a woman or a man saying that
one of the frustrations that i have with the way things have developed is that and for some it's not a problem but there's more and more it's difficult for a family to make a living on one income
but you make sacrifices
you know and and it's um
kind of like what uh my husband and myself are doing right now
we have a uh four bedroom split brick home in in richardson actually
and uh we bought it back in about nineteen seventy-three
so we've seen it go up in value wise real well
and it's probably typical of your neighborhood
it it looks like all the others
i'm in plano just you know north of where you live
and uh we live near coit and legacy in a relatively new development that just has gone in about two years ago
oh i know where that is yeah
so my home is typical
it's a a brick home
and it's typical of t- of the other homes in our neighborhood too
you're in the the styles that they have started building in the last couple years with the real high ceilings
thou- those are lovely
the the one thing we did do instead of having a twenty foot living room ceiling
and we just couldn't stand the wasted space
so we had them
and then we had them level off our living room and dining room ceiling to um nine feet so we could get bedrooms above
so that way we we sort of have the entryway that looks typical of the area
but we don't have so much wasted space
and we could get more bedrooms per square foot that way
have you um found in talking to your neighbors that your utilities are quite a bit higher with those high ceilings
well i would expect so
well how many bedrooms do you have in your home
i have uh a master bedroom and a den on the main floor
and then upstairs i have three bedrooms
and i have
and i work in my home
oh how nice huh
so it's not really a bedroom
and it and it's the size of a three car garage
so that's where i work
and we just absolutely
well it sounds like a real nice one
we're we're really proud of it
uh detroit this last time
oh we love it
and i would imagine that you have found that the homes down here are uh a much better value down here
and they're much
now that's interesting
up north they just kind of throw them together because we had homes built in in detroit also
and they just didn't care
if the trim work didn't line up it's just that's just what you get
that's interesting because i've heard so many people down here say that they don't feel like the quality of the homes you know are that good down here
and uh so that's interesting
well the carpenter and painter and you know everybody the marble man were just there in the house everyday when we would come to check on it as it was being built
and they'd say just look at this
and you know
well that's good
and it really made a difference
well i know as i as i said our house is about seventeen years old
and uh we've been very pleased with it
and uh you know it is with uh with the you know two children growing up and now three grandsons roaming through it
so and we like our neighborhood
has has grown
and the majority of the people you know keep up the neighborhood
and that's very important
and and as i said it it has ris- risen in value
but we bought back when housing was so low
and you know and now i- you know i-
but we're still fine
but i don't know with the e d s building and penny's and everything going in up on legacy we're hoping that brings in
we're we're just real close to to where that is
you know right now there's a lot on the market for sale because of people having lost their jobs
so that's you know that keeps prices down and value down
and i'm sure the packs uh or
but we love being where we are
well basically i am a mother of a three year old
so i kind of relate to trying to find a good day care because it's uh extremely hard thing to do to trust somebody else with your child uh trust their emotional and their safety and all the rest of that
and uh i've been pretty selective
and what i'm finding is with um day cares that are like day care centers like for instance uh learning tree or kinder care and all of that
uh like nap time or whatever time uh because of parents' hours they are differ-
and when i bring my daughter into such a system like that uh they only have one thing going on
and that's nap time
whether they came there an hour before or they came a- right during that time
and with that kind of a system my daughter just isn't likely to enjoy it if she has to good there immediately and lay down
so um home day care has been an option
and i've looked into that
the only thing is you raise the question of if it's safe uh can you trust the people you know
and you never know
i have um an ex-sister-in-law that
um currently has a child abuse case on a home baby-sitter
i mean i think center day cares there's so many people coming in and out that you're better off if you're going to put a child into that type of system for eight hours it's fine
now some children do real well that are at the age of four or five or children that have been in that kind of system for a while
but home da- home day care works well if it's an infant
if it's if it's if you want to have kind of like a family structuring where there's a home that they can be provided because i've seen things at the day care where they can't keep up with all the kids
and they're sick all the time
and they're in a in a state of flux right now changing uh e- uh changing a great deal primarily because of the economic distress
and even in that situation uh the it seems like to me from what i've read in in the history of russia and and you know different authors uh there has always been a paranoia
and and that's why they put you know that's why they put a lot of people in prison for years and years
and that's why they put a lot of people to death
but stalin was a was a classical example i guess of that paranoia because he he probably killed more russians than uh you know the russian army killed anybody else
uh they are desperate at this point in time to keep their country together
but i could not foresee them severing what they have with the u s um because they need us at this current time because of their financial situation
um from what i've been hearing is the u s uh s r has been uh almost bankrupt for years and it's people are desperate
and there might be a revolution within the people
but i don't think the u s would get involved with it because uh there's too close of ties to where i think they understand that gorbachev is trying to make a change and that we cannot run them like we run the u s and that they have to make their own independent decision
so i guess i really have no fear at all of the u s s r verses uh
you get these small little uh places like iraq and all of that that might be something that i'd be more concerned about with nuclear weapons verses uh a small uh or as big country of u s s r
i i i have no feelings that they would ever start a war with us because to them it would totally elat- you know it would totally destroy their whole country because our technology is far advanced from what theirs is at this current time
so i mean sure
but to them that would be a suicide
and the russian people are not suicidal type of people
but if you get the iraqis and iran which will do it for the country for the pleasure of you know doing whatever uh for their country they'll do it uh
you're a i think you're right
uh the russian people i think are not that much different from us
you know i think they're
that it would be the leadership that i i uh mistrust
she's on a a stool that she can get up on yeah
but anyway it was really good talking to you
and you have a good weekend
as far as uh universal health care um i guess i'm all for it
i think it's time that we start looking at uh getting into that
um health cost has continued to rise
and i think uh there's people that to me it's the fundamental uh
uh it doesn't matter if you have money or no mone- or all the money in the world um
um i think if uh they looked at it as a way of business helping out financially for universal health care and uh individuals um helping out in some sort of way whether it be taxes or some how
but uh the expenses right now for health care um are just unreal
well they really are even for even when you're not talking about surgery
we've we've got four children
and you know in the past month
and your constantly
and it just can devastate your budget
i i know that um uh i know a little bit about the uh european uh universal health care
and there's some pros and cons
but uh sometimes health care uh when you get into a universal system lacks in uh what would be considered uh
um over like in poland uh where my father-in-law lived for years there their health care system is um
because no financial gains are available for doctors
uh they may just go into being a doctor just clearly just to be a doctor for the full reason
but most people that go in to being a physician here in the u s do it for financial gain
they say well jeez if i get into this area of dermatology i don't have to do this
and i can you know
or plastic surgery
or uh if i become a uh heart specialist i'm going to make this kind of money uh
and there's you know financial gains toward that
and in a universal system i don't think there is a financial gain for the doctors
the quality i think goes down uh-huh when you have a universal system
um the only way they could do that is by having a real good quality check um and also offering some kind of
because i think uh all physicians well anybody um likes the ability to kind of uh get themselves financially uh situated
uh i guess that's the whole u s concept is to come here and
and i don't know if you can have that with a universal system
maybe you know there's a way of working that out
but i know that in poland in particular the doctors just go to do their job and that's it
there's no uh
and that's sad because if that's the case if doctors aren't going in to be doctors to help people then maybe they shouldn't be in that area anyway
but that might be one way of weeding out those that are greedy for the money and those that really want to help mankind
but i i think we have to head toward that way
well we're going to have to do something because there's just too many people in the country that are uninsured and and you know you cannot
i mean it's just
i mean and you're sixty some or fifty some years old you try try to find insurance
i mean y- you're uninsurable
and i know people that are paying two hundred three hundred dollars a month for insurance
and how they can do it i have no idea
um i know working for small corporations
and health insurance um myself um it would cost for a family
and this was back three four years ago to put my entire family up
and this was working for like a med center uh health plan
um it was like eighty dollars out of my paycheck
and i mean we that is we pay that instead of a car payment
i mean i'm driving a piece of junk
well we do the same
i mean it's
i think uh people are changing their viewpoints of you know
and uh and that's why uh if they don't go to a universal system something is going to happen
we're going to have uh a larger amount of people dying
well what uh what do you all do for camping
well we don't do so much now
but when uh i was uh a child we went regular old camping tents and and everything like that
and then with our children we did uh we had a pop up tent camper
and we used that to go camping
we uh years ago we lived in oklahoma
and we went to uh lake ardmore i mean lake murray all the time
but when we did it with our children we lived in uh tennessee
and we went up to the smokeys which was just absolutely fantastic
oh i bet it was
and along the uh
and uh i think it was called uh uh white cloud or white mountain
well now did you all sleep in sleeping bags
and did it get real cold at night
but the uh camper had uh beds in it you know when we had that one
and uh so we just you know we had our bedding
and uh that got kind of rough sometimes
well we only did that once
now since we've been married we just go uh we go real often to colorado to the mountains
oh do you
but we'll stay in cabins
and you know call that going camping
but we're really not
but the one time that i did go camping when i was about i guess sixteen or seventeen with my family
and went back seventeen miles back in the back where you couldn't even get a forest ranger if you tried and to the the tent for a week
and at night it was so cold you thought you'd never feel your
and the smell
and the stars were just five feet above you
you know they were just right there
oh just beautiful
and it was the most bonding most wonderful time
but about the fourth day i thought if i don't get a hot tub and shave my legs i'm going to die
and i had
so when we can go to a cabin as long as we've got running water i'm a little bit better off
but yeah my husband and i his he says his idea now of roughing it is the regency hyatt
and i i agree with him
our children are are grown
well that's true
but i know that we liked it when our kids were teenagers because we got away from the t v and the phone
and we got just strictly by ourselves
well that that's
and you know and we could
and they can't believe that they could survive it
oh i know
and then once they're there they they think it's kind of cool
oh they just you know they just thoroughly enjoy it you know
or enjoyed it
and we hike we would hike all day
mom did the whole uh pork and beans and you know the slice the potatoes and fry them outside and all the little stuff that we just were so amazed that she knew how to do
you know couldn't believe
like i i know that you know breakfast we would you know we'd have these big breakfasts cooked over this little coleman stove
and it would just absolutely taste wonderful
and and daddy would always try to prove he could catch fish for breakfast so we usually had a bite apiece
oh my goodness
but i know that we you know as a teenager growing up and going to lake murray there would be oh maybe twenty twenty-five of us because it would be all of my mother's family you know and all my cousins
well now is that hot camping
is that where you're you're hot like on a beach
i mean is that
because a lot of our friends will
we were in the we were in the woods you know
well a lot of our friends in east will go to east texas in the summer and camp
and i'm thinking how could you stand it you know
well we didn't notice it back then
but that was back before air-conditioning was so p- you know prevalent and all
and uh you know it it always rained on us
but i like that
and see especially in the tent every afternoon it would rain and you would get your book and just kind of cuddle up
and i thought that was fun
well i don't know
i remember one time uh some cousins were in a tent
and it was married cousins
and they they had the tent
and this you know s- frog strangler that we used to call them
it was like kind of like a little little uh gully or trench or something
and the water rushed down
and they said they looked down and there went bud's boots
and you know
there went several things floating down this water you know
you know it was it was more fun
you know and as i said it just rained
and then my folks had a cabin at one time at lake tenkiller
and we went up there
but it was never quite the same thing
in fact the the more urban we get with the television and the cabin and the whole bit it loses it's flavor
it really does uh
well i've i've gotten in the mood to go now
and i know if i go home and say oh let's go camping my husband says you're crazy
well listen i enjoyed talking with you
well that is like my favorite hobby
and i have been all over europe and a lot of the united states and hawaii
uh what what has been your favorite trip do you think
uh i guess hawaii is one of my favorite places
well no that is exciting
you know i have been several times
so after the first time it is like anywhere
you know it loses that newness
and mostly i travel through germany and switzerland
and we have good friends in england
so i have been there quite a bit
and i just love it all
so how about you
well uh i have been to canada several times
but uh that is about it for me
i i am from denver and so uh growing up uh
uh my family is uh uh real into camping and four wheeling
and so uh several
i i think maybe uh four summers in a row uh we spent uh our vacation time in the summer uh four wheeling through uh
and and uh every time uh my mother had uh uh
and my mother had us uh do some studying of the the area which we going to visit
and then we had to write uh reports reports about it during during our vacation which which was really fun
we we each got to write little books
uh my fiancee is a very very good photographer
that is what she had originally gone to school to do was photography and uh i i am close to receiving my english degree uh as as well as my my graduate degree
so so i uh uh we have thought very seriously of trying to uh incorporate travel into and writing a book about uh some portion of travel uh
so we are hoping soon uh not soon maybe within the next ten years to get to to take a trip over from uh over to europe and take uh a trip from the northern portion of france uh down to the southern tip of spain uh
it is kind of a backward s shape uh trail that the pilgrims use to take uh in in uh back in the medieval times uh to see the relics uh in uh southern spain and in italy
and so we would like to take pictures of the gothic and romanesque monasteries and uh just take that journey all the way down and then right a book about it
it would be uh it it is our big dream
well it would be a lot fun
you know there is good and there is bad
and my experience in italy was not my favorite for sure
oh su- uh
well i flew into milan
my daughter is uh a twirling champion and she had to perform over there and in turin
and so we had to fly into milan
and we got on the subway after so much trouble because the italians even if they speak english they do not want to let you know and they gave us all the wrong directions and there were just two of us
we sat there uh
we followed these kids with uh gym bags
and we figured that must be the sports arena and we lucked out
and then when we needed to go to the bathroom there was nothing but a whole in the ground
i mean it was so it was kind of a nightmare
and i guess all of italy is not like that
but where we were it certainly was
and the hotel that we stayed in
and it was beautiful
but it was very far away on a bus
and you always have a fun experience
so it is great you know
i wonder have you ever been to a uh a small town uh
well it is actually about thirty minutes from salisbury
it is called uh bemerton
uh uh the reason i am curious i uh
the other place i would like to visit uh
i guess you heard our conv- our topic for today was clothing
well uh uh about the same i dress for school
i uh i am a graduate student
uh uh uh although i do uh a lot of
and so i do a lot of clinical work
and when i do clinic work then i have to uh uh look my best
i am in the i am uh manufactures rep sales organization
and my office is a small office
and i am very casual and wear slacks and sports shirt and things like that but then when i travel it is a little different situation
uh suits and sports coat tie and the whole bit
uh uh do you find that uh on the average do people give uh more credibility or less credibility to a professional uh to professionally dressed individual
i think in today's society uh there is more credibility to be quite honest i will always remember
my first job years ago uh thirty years ago twenty-nine years ago in fact was selling agricultural fertilizer
i worked for the uh smith douglas division of borden chemical
and i sold uh you know manure
and uh i would go out and call on farmers
and i would always try to look my best wearing sport coats and things like that
but i was calling on guys that wore bib overalls
and so one day i got up and thought well i will just go casual and you know that i called on a guy wearing exactly that bib overalls
and he sort of told me that he expected me to be professional and he sort of expected me to dress as a professional so uh it was sort of
so i sort uh been aware of my dress ever since then and try to look my best
but here again i dress casual quite a bit
if i call on just uh a normal little dealer of mine i might be casual
so it depends
uh so you don't uh
uh probably no
because uh today i believe you can get away with
but then it depends on who you are calling on
you like your minister standing up in front of you with no tie you just uh he would be missing something
so it's its' just different
uh un- un- un- unfortunately
i am uh like a catholic
and the people that go to my church you know
but yet the way i was raised
and like as a youngster i use to always dress up all the time
i'm i am uh i go to the church of christ
and uh and sometimes that really disappoints me uh in uh
you know people just don't have that
and they are afraid to go to church or afraid to go simply because they don't have the clothes to wear
so i understand what you are saying there and it's it's a very good point
but you shouldn't what's the old saying you shouldn't judge a book by its cover
and uh evaluation of an individual course all of it depends on the type of job responsibility you have
but uh you certainly should not judge a book by its cover and uh or evaluate a person by that
and that's it
and uh what did you do about your last auto repair
oh and might you say what kind of cars you have and so forth
well larry my last one unfortunately was a an expensive one because i had a brand new lincoln town car
and and a couple of ladies ran a stop light
but we they didn't run it
and she hit me and did about eleven thousand dollars worth of damage to my car
well that's still not enough for a total is it
so it wasn't enough to total it
but that's my that's been my most uh expensive repair probably in the last year with the except of just service work because i buy a new car every two years
oh and do you buy one every two years
well i travel a lot
so you know uh this last one i leased
so i don't know
and i leased it on a twenty-four month program
but i'll probably go back to buying them because i don't care to lease them
or just are there normal safety belts in it that you had
but no sir
didn't go off uh
and and the street lights
but you were hit in the side weren't you
you you may you may need to be hit from something the leaning towards the forward to activate it
it was uh uh
my doors were okay front and back but it did uh right eleven thousand dollars in damage
so i'm going to get
well i'm relatively fortunate about that
uh here we somehow don't have many people run into us although at the beginning of each school season uh students move into town who are from big cities
and they sort of drive kind of wild for about two three weeks then they finally settle down and
and now that takes the strain out off of everyone that uh is driving a vehicle
and i find that the most of the repairs i have to do here is body damage due to the salt that we have to put on the road to uh take care of us in the winter time
uh i have a sixty-nine cougar and a seventy-seven pontiac so forth
and i have to
and i drive a honda most of the time
and once in a while we have to replace some of the plates in the bottom of it because it's rusted away
and we had the same thing up there continuously salting the roads for snow
well i just i di- i had this cougar totally uh the body of it totally rebuilt uh to get some of the rusts that were in the fenders uh done and then it all repainted
and so i put the cover over it then to keep the ice and snow off
but anyhow uh now are you going to buy this next car
or you going rent it lease it again
i'm going to i'm going to buy it larry
and i'm going to i'm going to be you know driving a car for longer
so i usually drive a car for three years
and and anyway and so but last couple of cars i've only driven for two years
and so i'd leased this one for two years
so i'll probably go back and buy one
and uh this next car will probably be my retirement car
well that's an awfully big one that uh that one that you had that lincoln uh
well no sir
not really uh no problem at all
we have uh two toyotas in the family one nissan
and then we have the lincoln
no problem there at all as fin- as far as finding parking places
it's it's convenient in that in that regard
well that certainly would be a wonderful comfortable machine to take on long trips i'm i'm very much aware of that
and i and i travel
but uh when i do take it it is very comfortable to drive
but it's very quiet and very smooth riding machine
well my wife's toyota is soon to be four years old
it only has doesn't even have thirty mil- thirty thousand miles on it
so gosh been much in such good shape that'll probably be an eight or ten year car
do you do you feel that uh
my personal perception of government and uh the way things are at this current time is that nobody can really be trusted
and i don't feel that too many of the candidates are out there to uh be self-serving to the community
i think that they have their own uh wishes to uh be in the limelight and to kind of say hey you know i'm a public official i don't have to do uh certain things
and they just stand out more involving themselves more and more with politics
but it's really
after all the things that i've seen in the last ten years about government and now the overdrafts uh of checks uh before that it was the wonderful uh escapade that they had with uh the new uh oh god chief of uh
well supreme court
i'm trying to think of his name and uh what they put uh him through in regards to
the sex sexual harassment that kind of thing and just to see our government react to that and then just little things that have added up where people have taken vacations on taxpayers' monies and things like that
i i just think it's very corrupt and
but it's always the rich person that gets into government that has the money to advertise the money to d- to do this
there's no more abe abraham lincolns out there uh that can get into government even if they were poor
so i know that's my personal viewpoint of things
doesn't wisconsin have a uh state uh medicare program or health program
now they just uh they've already put through the health bill
and it was passed
and that is going to be a heavier tax burden on
uh i don't know if that was done out of just let's be the first state to do it or if it was done really for the needs of the people
right now every little state around here is thinking about oh we need to reform the health uh system
and of course they think uh wisconsin our neigh- or minnesota our neighbor passed a state law the health bill
and it's kind of like we're the first to do it
so i don't know if it's done because we're we want to be standing out as being innovative in the health system or whether it was done for uh you know a real good purpose to help people that can't afford uh health insurance that kind of thing
well i i think the one of the biggest problems that uh we see in government today is a reflection of society in and of itself
and that is uh uh we become so debt ridden and credit oriented instead of uh cash and carry or debt free and therefore uh that puts a lot of undue pressure on municipalities state and federal governments
it it sure does
and i think it it is reflecting
like you said i think society as a whole uh you can't expect uh
when we have t v and we have things that are kind of bombarded at us for uh you know immorality and this and this and this that we can expect somebody to come off that's going to be clean totally clean
uh but down the line it does hurt
i mean when somebody's corrupt and somebody's doing something it's uh you know it does hurt t- each individual of the society when you find out that somebody's done something or the overdraft policy or you know the other things that have occurred
well what is
see the thing is is when a lot of things become acceptable practice uh it's hard to discern the bor- what has become muddy as to what is ethical and what is not ethical
and then someone blows the whistle and says oh this is not ethical and yes i did it too
well that's exactly what happens in government
oh i hear that you're doing this
but oh boy
e- exactly it's uh
there's no secrets in the government uh i don't think anymore
the mayor of dallas is uh bartlett steve bartlett
he also uh was a congressman
uh to the uh to congress
and he had been in that position for years
and uh he was elected mayor of dallas overwhelmingly
however if the vote was taken today the whole thing might change because he was part of that uh check kiting scam
i think i i don't think uh
well i just got back from taking my little girl to her brownie meeting
and then we had this whole can uh a bag filled full of cans and they've been recycling at their school
well she wanted me to just wait and let her dump them off tomorrow
but they were filled with beer cans
and i hated to take a big old sack i mean one time i mean like a lawn bag full of them
they had tickets at their school that they recycle either newspapers or cans
and i think that's all
and they're taking the money that they earn
oh that's a good idea
and they've got their bins that stay there
and they've decorated real cute you know with a bunch of big old flowers and stuff
so they're getting into it
oh that's good
um i know
and i live in a dorm
and we recycle paper
and i know that there's a glass plant up here
and they recycle glass
and you know we recycle old aluminum cans and all that kind of stuff
so in each of the dorms you have a place for that
and then when our dorm
and then we get money for that
and who decides what you do with it
we just put you know we just keep it with the dorm
and what do they do with it
well we buy things for the dorm whatever the dorm needs you know
like we have access to a microwave and an oven if we want to cook things
and then we buy like cooking equipment and stuff
or we play games like board games
you know it's just different things whatever you know
and whatever the dorm would want that's what we buy
well i graduated from college in nineteen seventy-two
and we were just um not aware that this was a problem that we ever would need to recycle
so a little different
and i wanted to do this thing that you can get through target to recycle
but my principal said since we're doing this thing called operation desert shield we're sending letters to all these servicemen and making video tapes and all that
the whole school you know
and i could do it in the center
and i just never got around to it
but it's like a club
and he had started this um save the environment club
and his mother is carrying this on
and you can get the information to set it up you know and join
oh that'd be go-
but you could start your own anyway
um i don't really know any other recycling that they do
so you're not pick- you're not having it picked up at your houses or anything
well they're doing that here too now that i think about it
and you have to pull out all the slicks
and you have to wrap them up with string
and i think that's all they're picking up
but you know like in minnesota they've got their bins where you put plastics and your bottles
oh i didn't know that
because my brother-in-law lives in minnesota
and they're are just nice plastic bins
and you fill them up and put them out with your other trash
and they pick them up
um i never heard of that
um not that i know of
and you just feed your cans slowly into the slot
and your money comes out you know every once in a while for however much poundage you've got
and if you keep feeding it until the light goes off
oh my gosh
and you get instant cash
but they had one that i was putting my stuff in
and i went to take some today
and it was gone
but i located another one today on the way to work
uh we have places where we go
and we what we do is we unload our cans
and the belt separates the aluminum ones from the steel ones because it has a magnet on it
and then they weigh uh your aluminum cans
and then you get money for your aluminum cans
but they don't give you for the other
but now they're going to start giving us money for the other ones too
but i know they're going
well they're certain places you know where down there you can take your leaded cans
but i don't know where they are
well that's all i really know about recycling
oh i know we're saving our grocery bags now
um like kroger's doing it
and i think skaggs
i've never seen any you know places that do
i know um we reuse our grocery bags now
we take them back you know and use the ones that we have
but we don't have any place that collects the grocery bags
and i don't want to go with those canvas bags right now i'm sorry
but you know they do that like
and you know they go all the time
and they had their little bags way back then and fill it up
and they had this little bitty old teeny refrigerators
well what are you going to do when you get out of college
well that's why i did what i did
and they had until the fifteenth of april to come up some formula that would be more equitable to different districts according to finances because the poor districts were getting less money so not as good an education
and now they're trying to take some money away from the richer districts like the one that i'm in in dallas and make us pay our money to the smaller ones and make it more equitable
and if they can't come up with something by the fifteenth then the state's supposed to decide the courts
but something's got to be done
and i don't know
but other than that well can you think of anything else we need to talk about
um i can't think of anything on recycling
what about people from um pennsylvania
oh i don't
probably a lot more civilized more um refined than a lot of the people would be down here
i mean you've been together a little bit longer than we have
i've never been there um
well i've never
well let's see
so she's into this
oh is it like a foreign exchange type student
up in uh t i out there
i got to uh
uh kind of neither
well i'm a i'm a democrat
so i was going to say if you're a republican boy we would really have a good time
i am division one you know
to answer that one before we get to our subject you know i always get a kick out of republicans who take credit for all the military hardware that was bought for the war and how successful it was though when it comes to the budget they say well the democrats control all the money
and they're the ones wasting all the money
and i always wondered how they can play the money either way they want you know
but anyway the subject go ahead
uh i think it's a stinking shame
i uh i don't think it's over
i think that uh so many other things have taken over uh in the media
but i think it was just plain greed
and i think it was deregulation really when they said do anything you want banks
go ahead loan your money out you know
but i believe uh more of it was just greed
but he was a small businessman
and he said that the banks were calling
and the banks were calling and just looking for people to give their money away
and uh yeah
there there should be thousands of people in jail as far as i'm concerned
you know we've watched and watched t v and seen that a lot of these people were doing things not just playing in the gray and not just reselling property at a profit but financing the same property three and four times
and the list goes on and on
well i i agree a hundred percent
you know of of just the crimes committed
and that was property
and uh they lost a lot of money there
and then some of these big these rich people started to
and he lost you know all all of his money before he died
but uh they were just buying property and buying all kinds of real estate and thinking that there was a bottomless pit
and it always would it always would increase you know
it always would uh uh be more than what you paid for it
and they just never even got conservative with our money at all
and everyone forgets that there are several of these people that are wanted by the federal government currently and are overseas where extradition is merely a funny american word
well now the reason that i said that is because i was going to blame all uh reaganomics for you know
and when you opened up the bank deregulation without any controls i thought well that was the philosophy you know
and i thought that's not going to work you know
and i knew that it wasn't going to work originally
and it hasn't worked now
in theory in theory a healthy economy has a lot of spending going on
and if people are making money people can spend money
and it'll generate taxes
i i i agree with that
but there's got to be some control
and apparently there was you know
well the problem is
and the problem with reaganomics is that the people at the top are the ones getting rich
and for what they would cost
and we weren't producing anything
and i'm sorry we don't get into a real argument over it
i know uh
and and not high quality ones at that you know
well i do have a lot of confidence in the the american people and the economy and everything else
i i feel bad when i see the inefficiency even here at t i you know
and i think that the
it it still
a lot of the workers don't understand that uh they need to put out the best that they can because it comes right back to them you know
with jap- with the japanese
and i when i
and i work with a lot of mechanics
and i just cannot understand why they're just happy to spend their time here rather than produce you know
and they think that well i'm paid anyway
so it doesn't matter you know
i i'm very tired of it all pays by the hour
uh and i'm nonexempt
what what does a nonexempt sound like
uh you're too informed
they're they're very they're very uh not interested
i'm being a yankee i guess i'm i'm letting my yankee come out you know
now maybe i'm not the uh typical nonexempt that you deal with
and uh i am degreed though nonexempt
uh well that's good
i mean that's good that you're degreed
uh uh your time will come
i i do not wish my time to come
like do you do technician work or something
i did p c protection control work for uh
oh quality okay
about ten or twelve years uh
well now is is uh really terrible
i'm uh management level uh facilities
and when the cuts came three of us got uh bounced back
and so we're just uh
i'm i'm covering uh weekends and nights now
i'm i'm one of the manager reps
and just we're essentially standby and problems uh all all nights and weekends
uh being basically an engineer and liking uh doing installation work well there's not any
i mean there is literally is no installation work going on
and and as far as our you know our conversation goes i would really be interested to know how much of t i's problems now are related to
i think that not not only t i but a lot of it when they talk about uh
and i i have to admit i'm not as informed as them
but there's something like about eighty six billion that they admit
well i always double that
i figure well if they claim that it's going to cost us eighty-six billion it's got to be twice as much because no one admits their mistakes
and so if that's true it may mean that two hundred billion dollar category that was that went down the tube somewhere
uh it really hurts me
uh one of our senior
i mean here they're not really that high
but are they pretty good up there
well we're in the metroplex here you know
they they lost several contracts
and and i don't know if you noticed yesterday you probably don't pay attention to the bell helicopter you know
they were going to have big uh award
and secorski got it which was boeing secorski this which is up in the north somewhere you know
and i don't know how
and also uh they do some of that in wichita kansas
well i i don't
t i was getting the uh electronics with bell
and so it was a double
and two that t i was doing the electronics for them
and they they advertised that that it was t i bell t i bell and then all of a sudden secorski got it yeah
i almost think there's some politics around here because the metroplex here in the dallas fort worth area the uh with t i
but general dynamics and l t v and bell have lost project after project you know
well you realize
well jean the subject is jury trials
and should the jury recommend uh sentencing
now my personal opinion
uh uh here lately it seems
well up until a few years ago i guess there just too many liberals about and permitting too many oh
they just broaden the human rights to to cover just about ev- everybody and i don't think those guilty of committing capital crimes should be permitted to go spend a few years in jail and be turned lose on parole
and therefore i think juries should be able to recommend sentencing
and it's for them to believe that somebody else could do the things that have been done
so many of us have led sheltered lives that uh when we go into a sit in on a jury
so i always assumed that that was why i was never called
well now that's possible
but uh i was called up as an alternate once
but i never made it to the jury
uh do they have such a thing now as a six man jury
and i had never heard of such thing
and i wondered if it was true
but i just wondered uh
another question was should a criminal case should the jury be unanimous on their decision
and that i wasn't sure on either whether it should be unanimous or not
but then again so many times you get one or two holdouts
and and it permits the criminal to get a retrial
that's not too bad in this sense because you might get someone in their that's a victim of circumstances i mean that's happened and giving them another trial might give them additional time to uh prove their innocence
un apparently there are
i i i
since my husband worked as a policeman i can't believe there are very many people that come to trial that have are not guilty of something some part of whatever they're accused of
i have i still have a little bit of a problem with that
uh but i would suppose there are circumstances you're in the wrong place at the right time or know the wrong person at the right time
oh that's it
and you just might resemble somebody
uh out here in texas we had a a a great miscarriage of justice
it was finally after nine years it was finally uh taken care of
a black man was accused simply because he resembled uh someone who stuc- who held up a seven eleven i think it was
and even though he had witnesses that said that uh he was at work
and he had all sorts of character witnesses and what not
well they said it w- this this happened during lunch time
and he could have disap- gotten away at lunch time and committed the robbery
but after nine years
well as a matter of fact they made a t v show about it after nine years they finally came up with evidence and proved to prove that he was innocent
oh for heaven's sake
so there's nine years of that man's life gone
now that just was not fair
we're we bend over backwards protecting the guilty people the one's that are on trial
and and we often forget about the one the injustice has been done to because i bet they still say our system is the best in the world
well it's not the uh uh it's not the best system
but it's the best one in the world
and unfortunately we just have to put up with a lot of things
and they try to solve them and everything
but uh i don't know
well i'm i'm i'm still rancled about their decision to permit burning of the flag
oh i think a lot of people are
the the the first amendment definitely says freedom of speech not freedom of action
and uh uh well that just rancles me
i swear if i ever saw somebody to uh burning a flag i'd i'd try to kill them i would
but i don't know if i'd go that far
well i happen to be a flag freak
i served i was in the service i was in korea and uh well i saw what the red in the flag represents
well i think pride in our country and our flag is so important
and uh i i feel like if they don't people don't like what our flag stands for they're welcome to go some place else
see what they
see how they'd like it under another flag
well jean we seem to be of the same opinions here
do you think that's good you know like if a jury
oh passing sentence
well uh uh yes
but i think the jury should be able to recommend
that's what i was thinking they they sometimes do
but i know i'm always hearing that uh
well the jury came in with a guilty verdict
and they recommended
and they recommend
and then the judge has the final decision on what does really happen yeah
of course now the jury may not be completely aware of all the ramifications of a sentence
well i think that's where a lot of people think boy they're getting put away for a long time
but actually their chance course when
it depends on you know what they're what they'd been guilty of and a lot of different things i guess
but too many times they they are permitted to go out on parole
and there are bad ones that do slip back out and end up hurting somebody again
well they say after three offenses its automatically life in prison
but i think they ought to make it two offenses
i always thought there was there was wrong
it seemed like there sometimes there's not a good
well here again now there is where race seems to rear its ugly head so frequently
but it's the best one we've got
so let's put up with it i guess
well it's been nice talking to you jack
and i hope you have a real good day and week
well let's hope neither one of us ever has to run into this subject we were discussing
where where are you from
um just here in dallas
oh okay because i uh i talked to a professor in uh what was it north carolina who got the the t i system
and he gave to all his students
so my daughter's even talked to
and i've talked to several people from north carolina
people from virginia and and all over yeah
and i asked him about it
and he said oh he says i think i'm the guy that actually uh gave it to all my students
so that's why so many people are from this college
you you first eve
um well the subject we're supposed to be talking about let's see is uh food
and what would you uh cook in uh uh let's see if you were giving a dinner party
and the only reason why i may know a little bit about this is that i'm planning on having a barbecue pretty soon
and to me that's the type of thing that i like to give in um uh cooking for people
and uh if he's cooking outside where it's cooler and uh you don't have to do all that much work you know you just uh slap on some food and slap on some barbecue sauce
and i i'm trying to think which is the best uh that i prefer
uh my wife uh doesn't like to have all that work on the very day that you're doing it uh
and we haven't catered out very much uh
we i always worry about the barbecue in that you have to be
uh i've made shish kabob which i like
i guess i'm thinking of the easy thing to do for for having uh uh dinner
you know the breakfasts and and the steaks uh
although i would like to experiment with uh the meals my mother made you know
and i haven't gotten around to that yet uh
well she was polish
and uh she would make very economical ra- meals
different rice and ham and things that uh
and uh i would like to try that one day
and she would make spaghetti with pork chops and and special meat balls and everything
and my wife
but dinner parties are a lot of work uh
but uh that's that's why i like the the outdoor stuff a a lot better
people can entertain themselves i think a great deal more uh when you have a barbecue especially when you have hot dogs and hamburgers and
uh you know nothing really fancy like your your shish kabobs where you have to do a whole bunch of work
well that that
shish kabob is uh just because it only takes a few minutes to cook you know
but uh so far as getting out there and and putting it on it only takes a litt- a few minutes uh
but anyway i'm i'm thinking of the easy way rather than
well i i think you do do a lot of work
even if people do bring over things you still do uh all the uh
housework and get ev- everything prepared and utensils and just just everything
uh you know my mother used to make an armenian rice dish
i'm thinking about uh special dishes
and uh yeah
it was made out of rice and consume soup uh and bacon and onions
and then you'd simmer it like all day long
oh it would
and it was just it was just wonderful
that's that's something that i would really like to uh to try and find the recipe for
but we used to have that at thanksgiving time
because you can you can put it on top of the stove and do this
and and there's so much broth and juice in there
that it has to uh soak up into the rice all day long in order for it to uh uh to come out fluffy and and nice
and that was you know
when you were talking about the the polish dishes uh some goulashes and things like that
that's uh that's what i thought about was that armenian rice dish
but it probably will never taste as good as we remembered
back as we get older you know
but we probably should try it uh to do that
the recipes are really interesting you know
and we'll probably forget all about them you know
here i am talk about trying to make everything easy you know
uh something s-
so uh i remember we were first married
and we were living in new jersey
and uh we were going over to my mother's house for christmas you know to have a meal
and we were on the way over
and she said oh i'm looking forward to a nice turkey
and because she had turkey a lot you know
and uh that was surprising in the in the east uh
we always had ham you know
and and that's one thing als-
now the hams just kind of you know go take it out of a can or uh uh a package sliced uh
the cans were cooked for hours and hours and and were just wonderful you know
i i'd like to try that too
you know what i found was at sam's uh wholesale uh stores
and uh what they have is this honey baked ham
have you seen have you had any of those
i i uh i've i know about sam's
if if you ever get a chance to buy one of those i think it was uh twenty dollars for uh i don't remember how many pounds it was
but you cook it in the bag that they send it in
and all the juices and everything are all sealed in
and i tell you what i- it's never failed to come out tender and juicy
oh i haven't heard
and just and just delicious because i normally don't like ham because it's so salty
but with this honey bake that they have that that's the only one i have been able to find there at sam's warehouse
and it slices great uh-huh
uh because we have a delivery guy that comes around that sells
uh uh i don't know uh
i see a can here or a box here of gourmet choice
uh he delivers uh
but it's a company that has uh you know a truck that comes around
and and they recently had hams
they have steaks and and uh actually pirogies and all that stuff that uh
i i wish i could tell you the name of the company
but i don't know what it is
but uh they recently had a ham that was supposed to be
it was boneless and we tried it
and it was fully cooked and everything
you know that sounds like it
but that's that's the only ham i have found that i thoroughly thoroughly enjoy
and and i keep saying this uh to to do the different things that we did
but i would like to put one in the oven you know the old fashioned way and put it in there for hours and hours and see if
because i don't think in in my married life which is uh twenty-six years now we've never done that you know
and i remember that when i was a kid uh
to have the ham cooking uh rather than that we just
ham is just something you have for breakfast occasionally you know
and that's it you know
in the old days we had hams were the meal
and i don't i don't think we
i i don't think so anymore not with more becoming more conscious of uh fat and cholesterol and and all those good things
how how have you changed your your meals now
into that uh
well my parents actually started it
and uh getting
well it it's true
i think my parents are very unusual because uh we grew up in the south where uh you have all the uh you know biscuits and gravy and oh fried foods galore
and then gradually they started switching over to uh plain rice uh no gravy
it's just it really is
they uh they're actually they actually uh uh led us through it versus uh us teaching them you know the uh the finer points
but my mother has really high cholesterol
so it was one of the reasons which started them off
and they started doing this like in the early or in about the middle seventies
well that's amazing
so it's really neat
my my wife's mother is the only grandparent left
of course i ha- i have too but not like hers
and i always get after her about salt and everything else
and she just will i mean she's going to eat the same way she ate you know
and she just tells more or less tells me to shut up you know
and uh i like to
uh it's it's not the
i listen to uh larry newarth on the weekend
and uh he talks about you know the chicken and the rice and everything else
and and uh throwing away peanut butter and all the things
you know the things not to eat you know ever
and then he's got me into making eggs without the yolk
you know try that sometime
but uh when i make scrambled eggs now talking about a recipe
say if i have four eggs not not for me
but if i'm making four eggs uh even for my daughter and i i'll take out all the yolks but one
and and it's fine
you you don't miss it uh
in fact when i when i make eggs for myself if i if i fry them throw them in there i will almost hard fry them so i can take not eat the yolk at all
and you don't really miss it
but uh you don't eat it at all you know
you get like uh a bite at at the m- most
and so uh for cholesterol i mean i'm trying that
and it has worked
i haven't gotten on the which whether yu- butter or cholest- not cholesterol margarine and all that
i don't know know whether any of that is true you know
the one thing that keeps coming to mind to me is that they're
and they keep letting out people that have you know these horrible records
so maybe we need to have more prisons or use the old army bases and make them into prisons or something
uh it's definitely a big concern
i mean every day it's you know all ar-
and there's just rapes and murders and burglaries and everything all the time
and you just can't get away from it no matter where you live
so it's pretty scary
i'm i'm from butler
and i can't say that there's too much of that there
um i know the bigger cities have problems with it
uh i really don't know what we can do about it
unless they start enforcing the uh
well even some of the sentences just seem ridiculous
i mean you hear about people you know six and seven times have committed burglaries
and they're still you know only serving six months in prison
so that's definitely something
they could have a more automatic sentence instead of having the judge having the choice of like you know from one month to ten years or something
that would be one thing that you know i think could help is having the laws be changed so that they were more stiff penalties and more automatic penalties you know for certain crimes
i i uh i don't know what they're going to do with the problem because it just keeps getting worse and worse
and one things that they're saying now
or are you in the work force
um i'm a senior at clarion university
because one of the things that i've heard so much about l- um lately is the situations on campus where crime has gone up so much
and apparently many of the especially like in date rape many of the uh you know perpetrators seem to be getting off because the universities kind of cover up
and they don't really
um i've heard of a few case up here
but i can't say that i've heard of uh you know any significant amount
uh but then again like you don't know how many girls are reporting them or not
so one thing they could do is probably support people more reporting it
but i'm sure it's still terribly traumatizing you know for people to report it
so that's probably something else they could do
and that's like as long as
it almost makes me feel in a way like making drugs legalized just to get all the money out of it and not have you know
because these kids are
and so i can go out and work at burger king you know for four dollars an hour or whatever when i can make four hundred dollars a day selling drugs
so that's certainly a big problem
uh see you see now i would say that that's a bigger problem up here than even the date rape or anything
and i'm not saying they're bad people
but i i i would say that's a bigger problem
because it ends up
even if it's just kind of like this social drug use you're still ending up supporting these big drug pin you know
huge amounts thousand and millions and millions of dollars are getting spent you know on higher and higher up
and it's definitely got to do with crime
you know you hear about people selling their babies you know to get some crack
i mean just oh
one of the things they're doing is is they're prosecuting the women who are having these kids that are addicted to crack
they said uh some of the statis- statistics show like one out of every ten babies being born in these public hospitals are
and their moms are crack users
so that's you know another way of looking at it is as the woman is being a criminal you know for doing that to her child
so i don't know who's the victim there
i mean the kids are the victim it seems like a lot of times the women are victims because they're addicted
and it's a very complicated problem
well i guess that's about all i have to say
i can't say that i i just know that it's really bad in some areas
and something's going to have to be done sooner
i don't i don't know what they can do
uh basically i'm at home
and i have two cats and my husband
i mean my husband's great
and and uh so i'm about forty and whatever
well you're you're just a youngster then
so it should be real interesting
so you think we're ready
uh you want to start off
well let's see
the changes i've seen in women's roles uh
since i am in the forty age i'm a fifties baby uh
and from my mother's generation to my generation it's just a very very wide uh it's been a big change
and i think you'll have to agree
and and since we were in uh sort of the ground level the bra burning of the sixties
and and we didn't really know what the agenda was going to be uh
and i think you know it got off to a really radical
it has a radical fringe to it that uh i've sort of backed away from
you know they come in that way
and to make a change you know you have to make a splash
but to continue in that vein i think it got a little bit warped and off the track in several areas
but i really do think that women have made a contribution uh to human beings i mean to be human and what it's like and have feelings and emotions
and it's okay
and i think uh you know on the other hand i don't know that men have changed that much
so in in contrast to the women's changes uh you know the men stay steady
and then the women change around them
but that is true
uh i think men are trying
but they don't have a national organization of men
to uh help them out
and uh what's changing them though is the economic situation
where both team it has to be a team partnership now
and they both have to work and they both have to raise the children
and and that i think has been the downfall of the last ten years
you know the me oh
the the yuppiedom
the whatever it was the you know women didn't know how to go about doing the careers
and they wanted to compete with men
and that's wrong
i think they finally discovered that they don't want to be like men men
they they hurt themselves a little bit in that way
and so that's you know
they sort of threw the thing back another you know ten years
that they've had to you know restructure
but i saw the greatest t-shirt the other day
but uh i think men and women both have valuable valuable assets to offer and you know we shouldn't
and there is great wonderment
and uh you know we should respect that in each other
and and you know just sort of all s- swooshed into one channel sort of thing
it's it's viva la difference
someone said that and i think that you can truly respect the other person
i mean you know tom is just always saying what a mystery you are you know
well that depends on what day of the month it is
but uh i don't know
in in terms of that i think we've got more of a sense of humor about each other and our roles
and but it's still a challenge being in a marriage and trying to figure out those roles
i think now when both are working they have a more ch- more of a chance of working together because they're starting out that way
well that's that's a very different way to do
you know the woman doesn't start off at home
raising the kids and goes back into her career you know
really hard because to to really to get help
uh d- you know to get the work load shared
are are you married
i we have five children
oh my goodness
uh how do you mean that
well i mean okay
well did you have boys girls
uh we have uh two girls and three boys
and our our baby girl just had a baby girl
oh how exiting
so it's been real exciting
i i tell you what
i just love the babies and and since i'm sort of in a medical situation where i can't do that it's
just the most important years of my life you know
that's that's a long eight years though
and uh so there have been major major adjustments
but that's another story
but you know my husband has really really filled in the gaps
i mean i i couldn't ask for a better life
i mean if this is the way it had to be
and and that has a lot to do with his strength and his just pitching in and and his being able to you know all all ego aside do a lot of things that really
so when i say men haven't changed i guess i should look at my own backyard sort
well probably your role
and and the way you are also has changed though
you know compared to what it would have been twenty fifty years ago
i mean boy
i mean i i would have had so
and the changes that had to take place you know
where i couldn't do a lot of things and uh just adjusting to that
that uh yeah that was a major change
but so i guess
but but but women i think are a whole you know sort of riding the course
they're they're got a little wobbly and a little shaky there
that's the only thing i worry about is the the child's love and security
i think that's being damaged uh
we're going to see a generation of kids that you know are just going to be a little bit uh
i i think uh
now some some women can can do both
but i wish they weren't so many
i i wish they weren't role models for everybody
it it really is yeah
and then when she can't you know the failure of that is
you know her life sort of falls apart
and she doesn't know who she is
so many have to work to make a go of it it seems
or they say they do anyways
and but i think ones that don't have to the
well you know i think that's that's really i think it depends on what part of the country you're in
well that could be
uh i i would almost just say that because you know down here in the south you know a woman's role is
and you know
uh oh yeah
and and i think that uh
uh you know in terms of women staying home and being appreciated for their talents uh it's just like the way it it has been for years
i mean you know since the days of the pioneers around here
and it and it's hard for her to uh you know watch her peers be appreciated i think sometimes
but then i'm not there
so i don't know that
and i have women that do both
and i see a little jealousy on the part of you know the woman what has two little boys
and and she has an au pair which is a live-in college kid working for her
and then she has her business in the back and then my other girlfriend that has you know just runs the whole household herself and just has two kids and goes crazy
and so i see i little bit of that
and i always wish there was a balance you know
with the one and and wish she could spend more time with her kids
and the other gal i wish she could just get out of dodge
but they're both
so you're right about that
that's that's where the trouble lies
some people some people can adjust and have both do both well
and others can't
how how did your daughter do it
uh well uh i have one daughter that works full-time
and they seem to do fine
she has been talk- has talked about quitting you know and staying home for a few years
but then it's real hard because she's got an excellent job
well i have a really great one that i make in the summertime because it's cool
and it's uh it's just really pretty easy
and i like that
uh the only thing you have to do is cook the rice that goes in in it
and then i you're supposed to do chicken
but i just use those little cans of chicken
and it makes it so much easier
and so you dump the rice
and then you put in fruit like pineapple and mandarin oranges and grape
but i get my kids to do that
i i don't have to do that
and um and it really
and you mix it all up with ye-
but it's so simple
and it tastes really good because it's cool in the summertime
but but it's really good
and i like that one
like uh for memorial day we had some friends over
and we just bought a brisket and marinated it overnight in one of those like adolph's meat marinate
oh that sounds good
and tha- it was real good
and then people think they're eating steak or something
i don't usually i just pass on any recipe that's got more than five or six steps to it because i just know i'll never take the time to do it
um i do that a lot
i don't like to do that i- if it's ho- real hot though
because um i don't know
i have a real thing about being hot in the in the summertime
well i think when you heat your kitchen up it really makes a big difference
and um we don't entertain that often
but when we do i'm like you i like it to be fast and easy
and something so that we can talk and not and not have to worry about being in the kitchen all the time
we don't entertain like people from work or stuff e- often
and it's usually kind of like you want to come over and they say well what can we bring
and so it's real easy because you just make one or two things
and everybody else brings something
i don't know if i could take the pressure of having to m- you know put on this really fancy dinner for someone
well you see all that on t v
and i could never be that person
it just uh i'm just not
well i'm so i'm pretty laid back
and uh you know so i don't i know a lady in a my church
and uh she like does her own bread and does her own stuff
and so when she um does food she really goes all out
and i don't know how she can do it and be calm
i i've been working
and i'm not going to work anymore
oh how exciting
so hopefully i think i'll enjoy cooking more when i don't have to work all day
and by then it's eight thirty or nine o'clock at night
well i usually start about six and an and cook and then eat at seven
i mean co- cook at five and eat at six rather
and uh my family and i we're a sit down together family
oh that's good
and i like to be able to sit down after school and have them talk with me an and my husband about what's happened
i think i that was ingrained in me during my family time at home
and uh you know we could learn to talk about things
and i think that's good
but since it's just the two of us it's
well that happens to us sometimes too
but uh sometimes if something uh is on that they want to watch i leave it on
but we eat in the kitchen
and their heads are always poking past the door
anyway food is is uh a real life-style kind of thing
and i- some people don't like to do this
but i like to co- uh cook with my kids
and if they're going to have other kids over then then they help
and we make real simple things you know those oh
i don- i don't know if you've ever made them maybe not since you don't have kids yet but those jell-o uh gelatin things you can pick up with your fingers i can't think of what they call it
oh i've seen those in the magazines
and the kids love to do that
uh finger food is is a biggie with them
and and like now one thing i wish i could find a a better way to do are celery sticks and carrot sticks because they love to do that
and it's just really hard
and if you have to work with a knife i don't like that
so that's uh
but it's a hard one to have to to prepare
but they like that with the the cool ranch dressing that goes along with that
that's good that that's a good way to get kids to eat vegetables too
my son's getting to be a a real good cook
oh wow that's great
do you cook breakfa- like you cook a breakfast every morning
uh not every morning uh
we usually have like uh cold cereal or something like that
um during the su- during wintertime when they're in school um then i try to vary it so that we only eat that like a twice a twice a week or something and then have like when it's really cold i even cook oatmeal
and the loo- they like it all right
and um then sometimes we do something
we do like eggo waffles and stuff like that
so i try to uh
and sometimes we do eggs if i get up early enough to do that
but they don't like that
oh do they get rubbery
it de- it depends
and they will be a little harder
and i don't like that
so you have to just let it cook a little bit less than what it says in if you have a microwave book
but you cook it a little bit less and then let it sit with a like a plate over the top
and let it steam
and then and then stir it up
an and that turns out okay
and it's funny 'cause if i turn them out on to a di- i- on to like a plate for them to take what they want
it's very deceiving you know 'cause if they see it with their eyes they go uh i don't like want that
and yet if they don't ever see it th- then it's like oh this tastes okay you know
so she would make these fancy casseroles and hide it in there you know
and then we'd go oh this is really good
so it's it may be an idea to think about you know cost
trying to find a jury so you can get a jury as far as uh they may say they're not biased
but deep down they are a- against this person or whatever
so uh i don't think it's such a bad idea to think about
that it that it
a judge would be more consistent from one case to the next and not not de- and and uh not depend so much on the on the emotions of a particular case but be able to put it in overall perspective
some of them some of them do
and some of them don't
but uh this one uh
it seems to me that that you know when i studied civics in school or stuff that this the juries being involved in the sentencing wasn't wasn't so much
and i'm i'm trying to figure out whether that's i'm remembering wrong or whether that's a by state
i mean it's either guilty or not guilty
and uh i i guess
and i don't know whether it's by state or whether there's been some
but i yeah i certainly wouldn't be uh uh worried about that
i guess in terms of the uh you know ha- having a judge do it would seem to me to be more more fair and and uh unbiased
uh in terms of doing away with the with the unanimous jury i guess i guess i uh would be a little more leery of that kind of a change in in the trial system
that that's just a such a tradition that it's a that it's got to be a unanimous jury that uh i don't know where you'd where you'd draw the line anywhere else uh you know uh two-thirds or three-fourths or whatever
but uh and and i i i certainly wouldn't feel comfortable with just a just a bare majority
that's kind of how i you know
in certain cases i can see them going uh uh just basically with a judge guilty or not guilty verdict uh simply from a judge in highly publicized cases versus the small uh maybe you did a crime that was uh burglary or whatever
and it goes into the court case or whatever
and it's not highly publicized
but when you get into these highly publicized cases where everybody knows details whether it's through the national enquirer or whatever
uh it's the idea that person might initially have this thought well jeez this person's guilty no matter what
i'm not going to listen to the facts or and and con their way into uh getting past the lawyers and getting through that
but uh also there's aspect of cost
and i i'm not quite sure how much cost it does take for uh the judicial system to try and call a jury whether it's very costly or if it's something that's not costly or what
you know being that i'm not in the that area i really don't know
but i wonder if there is some big expense in trying to call a jury to trial and then having to pay whatever they have to pay if there's something that they have to pay
uh whether it's
and it's not
and and i'm
i know it is i know it is where i where i work
but i'm not sure that that's that that's necessarily required uh you know by law that it has to be paid
uh i suspect that's a that's a benefit of a bigger company
but but there are certainly some some that some that wouldn't uh
well i don't know if there's going to be solutions to the
well now it's in pretty disastrous shape for sure
there's uh maybe some short-term things that they can do
and it hurts everybody's pocket of course
but um i know that state has uh cutback uh raises for a year to help uh the uh state financial or whatever you might want to say to get better in a better condition
oh which state is that
uh state of minnesota
so there's the potential that perhaps you know the u s budget might want to take a look at it's uh federal employees or and take a look at saying well let's freeze wages
i mean everybody's doing it so it isn't like uh private business has had to do it
so it might have to be something that they might consider doing as a shir- that's got to be very short term
and the only other avenue that i can think of is uh looking at where they're spending the money and not so much as saying well we're spending too much in that area as perhaps looking at what is costing them the money
as for for instance i think you probably remember the military getting caught um with toilet seats that cost them four hundred five hundred dollars
and it was just
so so it gives you a- idea that
i mean there was um people at stanford who were soaking the government you know using millions of dollars of research money to uh for the president to buy beach homes or whatever it was
and i think that that maybe more widespread than well than we'd like to have think
the you know as far as
and actually uh the conferences were nothing
but uh you know they're getting paid for this
and it was something more than just the conferences
they were using it as eating out uh
when you think about people uh taking vacations these big government officials taking descendants in
and it's a real big crunch uh of course when they get caught then they're you know they're guilty of course
but uh during that time i'm sure there's hundreds of uh thousands of people that are uh spending money that does not belong to them
well that's right
uh i think that oh politicians talk a lot about waste but i'm not sure that that's really that much of the problem
i mean when you look at something like the gulf war it cost us god knows how much you know at a million dollars
and i don't think uh it's ended up being
i mean it gave people jobs but i think it also cost um quite a bit as far as because after they're done with the war a lot of things were no longer put to use
i mean it was kind of like okay we'll do this during this point and time
but after that that's you know uh they didn't want to do it anymore
so a lot of things that are saying that they're no longer going to be doing for next wars that are coming up that they did for this one in getting rid of a lot of things
so i don't know
well it was good talking to you
and have a good evening
well i don't
oh you have children
but we've had lots of them in the past
uh what have you had
well we had a dog before we moved here
uh and we couldn't bring her with us
and we've had hamsters and fish and birds
well you're going to have lots of pets with your children
and he was fourteen years old
and before that we had all dachshunds
and i think my husband wants another dachshund
and we're trying to debate because our children are grown
and and uh i don't know whether we really want to be tied down to a pe- you know another dog
and we do have a very loving cat that's you know kind of our baby
and uh and we like pets
and they think we should have a dog
and that's because they have a great dane
well we you know
if it um if it were just more peaceful you know with the little ones
so any pet that i get from now on will definitely be spayed or neutered
because uh i did
that's why we've never gotten a female you know in anything
and uh uh and our male cats you know we had
uh neutered right away
and of course it he doesn't know it
but um you know i do think that maybe we'll get a female next time and just had her have her spayed you know
well a lot of times now when you buy them from like the s p c a or from the humane societies or whatever their adoption includes their spaying
plus uh you know the safety factor and stuff
well we enjoy having pets
we uh you know i think they're a lot of company
and and when my mother lived with us uh the cat was really hers
and and he was kind of wild
our our daughter found her and brought her to us
and uh that cat walked in and walked right up to my mother and jumped up and curled up in her lap
and she was the only one at first that you know could really hold him you know because he was really skittish
but it was like he knew you know
and he would sleep with her
and so he was a lot of company to her
you know and and just love her
and he's cats are usually so independent
but this one you know he comes up
and he crawls up next to my husband now you know
and the cat would sleep
and when everybody turned we all four of us
but our cat would sleep with us
and he hated that
and when she'd walk on the couch along the back behind his head he hated that
so i guess it's probably probably if we get another animal it probably wouldn't be a cat
and it would definitely be an outdoor animal
because as i said our our schnauzer was old
and so he was becoming incontinent
and so then i would just have messes in the house
and i think that's one of the things that both of us are not wanting to start over with you know
and uh and it was new carpeting
and you know it jus- just really
oh that would
and they just
but it's grandpa's dog
and uh he's really getting too old to take care of it
but the dog messes all over the carpet
and my daughter is just nine months old and so then she crawls on the carpet
and oh the smell i mean it's just really awful
and that's that's one real drawback
but you know i guess you'll do just about anything for your pet if you love them enough
you know we were trying to decide to you know about putting him to sleep
he was just you know he was getting so old and had a other problems too
and and fortunately the decision was just taken away from us which made it a whole lot easier you know
and and again going through that because our our animals are almost like our kids in some ways you know
and and you grieve just as much over them when they go you know as you would a child
and and you know our son and and his wife and our daughter and her husband and the grandkids all say get a dog get a dog you know
and i can tell my husband you know deep down he you know he real-
you're in plano also huh
well good to hear
oh that was good
but that was it
well good to hear
they're they're pretty good
they've got some good good some good uh good players out there
well you ready for new year's eve
should we uh start this so we can
and i'm brian
okay nancy then i guess the today's subject is benefits in the job other than salary
what uh what do you feel are important to you or other people as as crucial benefits
well i'm a little different than other people because i don't have benefits with my job
and i work
so i find that it makes up for what i pay for insurance
and i i make enough money by the hour to make up for that
to to compensate for some of the benefits
and then i have my freedom
well that that's an excellent
so actually that is a benefit uh
well it is to me
and i'm just really not interested
well i guess that's a good point uh
i do belong to a a large corporation
or my that where i'm currently employed
and there's uh there's some different things uh one that you've already mentioned is is health insurance
i think through our health insurance that i can get better rates as a through a group plan as opposed to going out and getting health insurance on an individual basis because i had to do that at one time when i wasn't employed with a large corporation
and that got to be somewhat expensive
so i i think one of the benefits i i see is the uh is the group uh group discount
and especially if you have a family
and that's that's one thing i do have
if i didn't have a family i don't think i would have as as a male or as a as an individual of in this stage of my life
i don't think i would have insurance uh other
and in my previous job i really enjoyed because they had what was called flex schedule where i could go and i could work uh nine hour days and have like friday only work four hours or i could do uh work four days a week at ten hours a day and have a you know three w- day weekend
and make uh make my job flexible in that case
or did you have to do it the same every week
well basically yeah
i had to do that uh the same uh for about every quarter of the year
i mean uh because i was in a in a position of management i had responsibilities over people that uh i needed to make my schedule uh so that if i was not there i would have coverage by some other management personnel
so so i i think that uh that was a that was an excellent benefit that i really enjoyed
and i don't c- have that in my current operation
but uh you mentioned uh flexible work schedule
and that's that's good
and uh what other benefits do you think are important
oh well i guess
retirement that kind of thing which i don't worry much about so
but that's who i am
well and that's an individual thing
with uh with our current uh organization we do have a nice retirement package
and also a a nice thing that that we have in our corporation is a uh is a profit sharing plan where we can uh participate in the the profits of the company if we're you know if we've been there a while and we're vested uh which means that you know we have a an interest uh in the company that we can uh get some of the benefits of the either the profit high times or or in a sense suffer during the low times
and uh also uh in one of my wife's uh companies where she worked they'd had a real nice profit sharing plan that that
some of the t v shows i like to watch are uh mostly evening evening shows
and uh like for instance the one i'm looking forward to to tonight is twenty twenty
uh i like to watch forty-eight hours
never miss that and uh sometimes prime time live
uh and then the week goes by
and i don't think i
you know the the sunday night movies i watch those kind of things but uh most but basically a lot of documentary things and you know what's going on and that kind of thing
i li- i have a few you know favorite shows that i try not to miss
and uh i like rosie o'neill
oh i've never seen that one
i've seen a uh the previews for that
it it's probably very much a woman's mo- uh show
but uh and then there's a new sitcom on that is tim allen's uh what is it uh handyman
that's not what uh
oh we never miss that
or we try not to miss that
oh we think it is
oh just part of it
i thought it was you know
and it had such a good story too
well you know the little boy the little one was trying to decide if there was a santa claus
oh that's right
and the neighbor
and then uh it it's it appeared that maybe it probably wasn't the neighbor
and uh on sunday used to be on sunday nights now i can't figure out where they've moved it
on our uh public television they had a show at ten thirty that was a computer show
and it showed the latest uh developments from all the computer companies
well you know it's
unless you're really into computers you w- and software you probably wouldn't be interested
but i don't know
and uh you know what they they covered everything from entertainment to spreadsheets you know and then they also the hardware
so you could see what the new developments were and what to look for
it's public television course doesn't have the commercials during the show
and i like the frugal gourmet
oh i do too
oh i do too
but i just seem to to miss a lot of these programs
well there's very few that you know my life would stop if i didn't catch
but uh now i do
well i watch two
but one's a half-hour
and one's an hour
and and they lead into each other
and that's the bold and the beautiful and as the world turns
and i've watched the as the world turns since i was a little girl
so it's just you know
it's it's something i've done for the last probably twenty-five years
oh and so you get to come home and watch them
and i don't have anyone else at home
so i have freedom to watch whatever i want
but i like i like every i like the uh the information shows
and i like the comedies
and you know and i i do like good movies
i prescribed subscribe to h b o
so i can get some of the movies
but it we just canceled it last week because it seemed like it was so repetitious you know
but i don't sleep a whole lot
and i you know
and and uh
and you don't get good reception without cable
and it doesn't cost that much more to have one of the pay channels
so that's primarily why i have it right now
i i thought when i got my v c r i'd probably drop it you know
but that was years
say you did uh starters and bendix springs such as that on an old one
some that she had to uh label everything
and they uh well
and they quit making it
and it never did never did run right again
uh and like what were you replacing the starters and bendix on
uh a maverick and also uh a chrysler station wagon before that
did you replace just the uh bendix on the chrysler station wagon or the whole starter
they kept saying that the chrys- that's what chryslers did is they wore out starters
well i- i- if they start real easy you know you just hit the key
and it starts up and when it's properly tuned up that starter will last for a long time
see they built that starter so it would fit every v eight and all the slant sixes that they've built in like thirty-five years
so they've got a whole lot of torque
but to do that they did it
but they geared it down so the motor spins really fast so it's got to spin for very long
but uh most places don't put don't rebuild them with with g- with good enough bushings
so it's you know
anyway what are you driving now
uh my chrysler van
and it's it's pretty maintenance free you know
and uh at the beginning of the year last year and drove a chevrolet cavalier station wagon
and it didn't give me any trouble at all
uh rides or runs
it rides rides rough
you know i kind of
right now without getting some of the sportier models uh the four cylinders aren't real peppy
but uh they're starting to change that out in the last couple of years too
i've driven one im- uh
uh in a month i think i put uh three oil coolers on it
uh every time i turned around i was having trouble with it
everything else i ever owned was american built uh mostly older cars
uh i've been a mechanic
well i worked starting working my father's service station when i was about uh twelve
so i've been around cars a lot but uh driven a lot of old pontiacs
my first three cars were uh seventy model pontiacs a g t o and a bonneville and a station wagon
well till you got crazy with it
you know you get the four barrel all worked up
and suddenly it it it drops off fast
but long as you didn't spin the tires too much or or spend too much time with the secondaries kicked in it it didn't do too bad on gas
now do you think since they started with electronic ignition that it improves the way the car runs
and it still had the points and condenser in it
i uh pulled that old points distributor out and got an h e i distributor electronic distributor put into it
well i really enjoy reading the newspaper
we get the daily uh dallas morning news
and i try to look at it
well do you have time to read the paper in the morning
well not in the morning
but uh if the
well i have two children
and if they uh go out to play or something i like to keep my eye on them so i'll you know maybe go outside and read the paper while they're playing or sit in a chair by the window or something
you know a lot a lot of people don't take newspapers at all
we we took the morning news for a while
and then uh well we've been taking the times herald for ages
and then uh dog just ran off with my shoe
anyway uh and then we switched the morning news
but we found we couldn't read enough of it
and by the time i got home and had time to to read some
but but i guess the the issue is uh beside the newspaper do you take any news magazines
well we i don't take like time or newsweek or anything like that
but i do like to watch uh c n n
so it comes on at like the nine o'clock p m
and so i will turn that on while i'm doing some work
and i can hear the news not have to sit right down and listen to it
did did you did you hear what schwartzkopf had to say about uh pete arnett and uh the the news coverage
i mean yes i did hear that
and so uh i do try to keep that in mind that whenever you're reading a paper it usually has a particular flavor
well any you know time magazine and even the news that
that's why i like some diversity the idea that i we have time which which we take from time to time
the problem is they call up and make this deal you know
well we're taking that
and and we also hit the garland garland daily news
i guess it's it comes out sporadically like
but i think what's interesting is that if you're that there uh that as difficult as it is or as as much as they try they put some bias
and it was interesting that they think that they're basically impartial
but and and you know people accuse them of controlling the news he says you know we don't control the news we just report it the way we the way it is
well i wouldn't think th- i would really say that that's not true because uh it seems like certain newspapers always espouse certain candidates
and so uh news stations always tell the story from a certain angle
and that's why it's a good idea to get a wide variety of coverage so that you get a lot of different opinions
but you'll have a variety to choose from
and i i thought that was particularly interesting in the the gulf war that there were pieces of information that that were apparently uh leaked just as a as as uh a ploy
which was uh
i i find that fascinating that uh
i listen to k r l d and uh uh k l i f the news talk radio
and i actually listen to c n n radio
um i really uh have gotten out of the habit of listening to the radio from any kind of even music
well when i go to work i listen
and it's how come he usually calls me sometimes
and says oh i just heard on the news that such and such happened you know if it's something really interesting
and and then i'll know to to keep an eye out for it
but i've got out of the habit of listening to the radio
well with with your you know
if you're around the home though and and and can watch t v and read the paper the problem is is that about twenty minutes of news radio or thirty minutes is
and then they start repeating everything
and and so it's kind of a oh
that's what's interesting is the c n n uh
i don't think i'm trying to think if it's much local
and i listen to a little of ninety point one
i i'm i'm inveterate switcher
well i watch channel five
but that has to be
actually i think channel eight is probably
but i know dave fox
um well i am we're fairly new to the area
and so we're still shopping
uh from oklahoma city
and apparently channel eight was way down
and now they have turned it all around and done a pretty remarkable job
and then they've been some people move around
and uh john chriswell is anyway the
i i don't know
do you do you do you seem to
well i really think so
i noticed on channel eight that there's all of the uh anchors are seem to be like white anglo saxon protestant type people
and they all seem to be you know fairly similar
and i kind of prefer a you know some females
and i like different i like the anchors to be different kinds of people
i think that uh i like that
uh there i know you know john wylie price
but he's been protesting
and uh i prefer you know to have a little bit of variety like that because i think you're you're more likely to get
and i think he has legitimate argument
i mean you can uh
i i i grew up in alabama
and so i i have some prejudices
but i think that i think that that from a a justice standpoint because we have the option of not watching that station
uh i'm not sure i i'm totally in favor of affirmative action in some of the programs
but i think that uh in some cases this should be some real opportunity and and some diversity and and this kind of thing
and i think that dallas it turns out though from what i understand has quite good
and uh there for a few days and watch the news and and think dallas really does have have quite good news
i think channel eight is the number one uh a b c affiliate in the u s
well we you know
like all of the stations seem to be pretty good
so we had a a favorite
or i did have a favorite channel that i usually tuned into for local news
and you feel comfortable with them
in fact the the guy that was on the weatherman on channel eight worked for me oh long time ago
twenty years or so even longer than that twenty-one twenty-three years ago or so twenty-four anyway long time ago
and and shortly after i got we got here fourteen years ago
and uh they had they had fired him uh because he was too t-
anyway didn't he didn't have the personality
and that's interesting
that's that's what the t v stations do
and i think
if we remember that that they're out after the ratings
so that really effects how they report the news
well it's like the the dale hansen on channel eight is a sometimes a little too cutesy
have you talked have you been on the conversation when they beeped you at ten minutes
well good talking to you
are are you a t i-er
but are you at t i
so you have to do the random drug testing
in fact with me this is it's not much to talk about
or have you been participating in this
oh about ten or eleven calls
oh you got ten
well you you've passed me up
but i think that they were surprised to find it so low
i think they were expecting to find uh like the national average at t i
and i think it was tremendously down
but i think that
and they said that a certain number of people that the heavy drug users would either quit or go in rehabilitation programs
and i think that's what helps you know that in the warning that you have a drug program the people that are worried about it or are taking drugs actually go
and then usually a lot of them partake in some of the benefits of rehabilitation and everything
so that's real beneficial for the company and the employee
and our numbers have been way down
and so we had
and we did have a couple of cases where we really the person said that they hadn't used anything
and their test came back positive
and normally we didn't retest them
but there were a couple of people that we really thought that they were telling the truth
and we retested them like the next day
and they came back negative the second time
so that that's the only thing i think that might be a little bit of a problem
but at t i they before they had the testing i've forgotten seems like it's a year ago september something like that they told us that the agency that did it was the one that did it for the government
and of course that's critical just as the point that you brought up that whoever does your testing's got to be you know have a lot of quality control that they keep track of everything
and they were not
and i haven't heard of any
now i'm not in personnel or anything
but uh they say that there it's almost down to zero where people come back and say they are positive and they're not
and that of course has got to be critical
and i think that t i is latched themselves up with an established group
and that would be good for any company that does it and not to have just a very casual thing
it's got to be with a you know first class totally independent agency not local of course
ours i think well i think it was in the south somewhere
but it wasn't even in dallas you know the one that did us
huh do they have a policy where they counsel people if they come back positive
or do they fire them right away
they are they have one chance to then go in a program
you come back positive you have one chance to go in and go into they have a lot of uh rehabilitation both for alcohol and for drug use
and they have uh a lot of uh they have an agency where you can go for personal problems financial or whatever
and so they they they don't
it's uh definitely trying to encourage people to rehabilitate
in fact again before you go you know that's why i said when they first started it they had a rehabilitation program in effect that said if you worried about this and you may have taken drugs go ahead and get rehabilitated first
and they won't say anything about it
you know it's a weakness and all
and who all of us have weaknesses of one kind or another
and i think that those people that have that and however they got into it
i always worry about the the classical thing that you see on t v where the drug pushers give it to the kids for free you know and get them sucked in
and then they sell it to them
and they slip it to them
i don't even have that much knowledge to know whether that would get them addicted or not you know
and he works mostly with adolescents
oh you know a lot about that
but most of the time it's they get into the wrong crowd first
and then they start a drug problem
and i have knock wood pretty good luck or very good luck with my daughters
and one's at home gets dozen calls a night
oh well i'll let you go if you want to go ahead and take that
so we're starting
and i always say that i've learned so much more from them than i ever taught them
oh we're really excited about it
and they're always over in someone else's house
so our we've been lucky that our house is usually the place where the kids could come you know
and then you
but at least you see what's going on
and you always have your house welcome then your children think that you know you're cool parents and all that
well good luck with your expected baby there
oh well thanks
my wife was yelling was talking in my ear
she said reminded me to say that they're very cheap until they get to start driving
and we have one of course i say in college driving and one going to drive this summer
so kids are cost you practically nothing because you always get so many things from your relatives and everything
but you wait until they go and get a car
as they get older you know they cost practically nothing from one to five
and then slowly but surely starts to creep up when they start to
but it's well worth it and everything
you know i don't have much to say about drug testing
so you've done this ten times
so i get cash
i just got it a week or so ago saying you know so many calls will be something a prize and everything
well that great
well what kind of cash
well hope they follow through and everything
well technically we're not supposed to talk about the phone calls while we're on them
so i guess we better get off
well wayne i've never done any uh auto repairs myself at all
i mean i may have screwed in a little
but uh i personally haven't done anything
maybe i've uh changed win- wiper blades or something
but i have noticed since uh i got married that my husband he hates to do auto repairs
but he would rather do them himself than than to pay someone else
i guess he can't make himself pay someone to do the repairs when he knows he knows how to do it
and he'll do it
so he he hates the time that he takes
but he has changed um the brakes
and he has done all of the tune-ups
and the like that
and recently he changed the steering mechanism in the car
and and so he priced around
and everyone wanted several hundred dollars for it
so he thought well i can get one in a junkyard
and then he did it
and so i guess uh he's been pretty good about keeping our cars up
what uh what's your experience been like
well i uh i have a long experience with cars
i uh when i was younger uh my brother had a corvette
and i bought a corvette
and when you have a corvette you more or less do all the work
and i've done everything from build the motor from the uh you know the bare block on up
and i i'm the same way as your husband is when it comes to my car i hate to go pay somebody good money you know
in fact i um just this past weekend put new plugs in both uh my car an my wife's car
and so i uh i pretty much try to troubleshoot and do everything i can do myself
but i've i've gotten to the point in my life um you know i just crept over forty years old where i don't want to crawl underneath the car anymore
i mean it's um i don't know whether i've i've just reached a point you know
it's it's real rough in the winter time
and uh so i try to make sure that uh by the time fall runs around because we actually have winters here on the east coast um
that uh i have you know the car's in pretty good shape enough to last through the winter
and uh then springtime i usually end up giving them the uh a tune-up and make sure that they're running well
and uh you know it's like i had the muffler go out on my on my car shortly before it was required to go
in maryland they have uh emission tests
and you're required to get your car and go through the emission test
well my muffler of course starting going bad right before i was supposed to go to the emission test
so you know i had to do that job
and of course that was back in december when it's nice and cold outside
but the thing was that i could do the job myself
i mean the parts cost me oh roughly a hundred dollars
um if i'd taken it someplace and have it done it was going to be three hundred twenty-five
now like who's got that extra two and a quarter
well that's exactly the way he feels is that he really hates to spend the time
if he if he thinks it's going to be two hours it's four if you know whatever it always takes him twice as long
but then when he's finished he's he always says well now you owe me three hundred dollars
and then he thinks that he has the money that that he can spend on something
and he hasn't given it to someone else
so he gets some satisfaction out of that although generally i think he he does not look forward to or anticipate
and he just isn't one of them
i uh i don't mind it
um there was a time when i had my corvette
i mean of course i loved it um
but if you know
and there's a lot lo- other more important things i think i should be doing with my time
and i have the same problem
i mean you can tell him from me
but it doesn't matter
i mean i've i've had greasy fingernails for years
and it still takes me twice as long as i think it's going to take to do the job
so but th- i think the difference is that uh when you own the car you take more care in what you're doing
and you want to make sure that it's done right and put back together right
and you know i've i've in the past i've had brake jobs done by someone that when i went back and looked at it some months later i'd find something drastically wrong with it
you know like a spring that was put in incorrectly which could have resulted in brakes failing and me having an accident
you know those kind of things
and when you have a vehicle that's being used by you know other members of your family you know you don't want that kind of a situation to come up
and it's very very difficult to find a mechanic these days that you can trust
and uh he's about sixty miles from here
and so it
and if i have something that's really major that i can't handle or feel i don't have the time to handle i'll take it to him to do it
you know that it's uh really has a bad reputation is to feel that that people in general feel and have have rightly so i think been cheated many times
and um and well i know once when we had a
but um once the muffler needed to be changed
and uh he had looked at him himself
and but we saw a commercial for like fourteen or twenty dollars or something for a change
so he went in
and uh but when they quoted him a price they really wanted fifty or something
anyway but the car that the muffler people had um my at least my husband felt that they had damaged the muffler further you know
and so since then i don't think he's ever even seriously considered a you know any kind of job he thought he could do himself
but i know from his childhood he says that his father always buys and restores cars just as entertainment i guess
and um so kelly growing up he he felt like that that was a good way on saturday's that he developed a good relationship with his father
and so he used they used car repairs kind of as a way to have a you know something that they did together
and he thought that turned out pretty good because it you know it helped him to understand and be functional now
and it helped him to have a close relationship
so that's one one way he looked at it
that's probably uh uh something that uh is is you know is good for both of them
i know that uh my older son i could never get him interested in cars
and i couldn't you know
i just like you know
i mean your not interested in cars
i mean he he just would not have anything to do with them
and uh later on and like when he you know grew up got out of the house got his own car um he didn't know how to do anything to it i mean absolutely nothing
i mean he couldn't even check the oil
i mean that's that's how uninformed he was and disinterested
and i guess there are some people out there like that um you know
i always thought maybe you know if he took more of an interest and you know what i was doing
and maybe we could have communicated better
but uh yeah
i i think that's great
well i felt um i feel like i could myself do some things but that i have enough responsibility that if i have someone like my father when i was living at home and my husband that's willing to do it i go ahead and let them do it
i don't feel the need to um you know be a feminist on that issue and say i can take care of my own things
i'm i'm happy to let them ru- run the cars because i have so many other responsibilities that um
so i haven't tried to do a lot myself
uh i trained my uh my wife in the hou- in in doing things
in fact uh when i uh first transferred down to uh texas instruments back in nineteen eighty-seven
um uh when i left here uh she had to change a set of plugs on the car
and uh it was an interesting experience for her
i mean she'd always assisted me and done some other things
but for her to actually get in there and do it herself it was uh it was something t- a little different
it helps you feel i think comfortable with your car and feel like it's not so scary if um your driving it and you might get stranded somewhere that you might you think well i've i've been under that hood
and i know what's going on
i think it's important that everyone know you know basically how how the darn engine works
i've i've been out with my sister before when you know her car died on the highway
and i happened to be with her and managed to get her to the other side of the road because it was dark and all
and what do you see coming in the future
oh my goodness
um i don't know
i i'm twenty-three
well then i can tell you that roles have changed
and they changed quite a bit
and basically um the choices i mean you know
that's kind of um the opposite of what it was in the sixties and early seventies
it was sort of just to um go protest
and uh just everybody be damned and live with some one
and you know
soci- social morals were a little bit lacking
i know that uh in in the early seventies uh i think women were the first people to to make a move as far as individuals
um uh before that a lot of people that wanted to protest were large groups like uh black people or you know just large large groups of people
but but the
it was more it was more civil rights oriented
and i think i think the women's movement kind of brought in individual lives where you had women's movements
and you had gay movements
and i think since then is is when a lot of the women's roles have started to change
and some of the other stuff that um i think that changed it you uh when i first got out of college fifteen years ago they were always saying well if you if you were assertive you were a libber
or you were aggressive not assertive and independent
and in terms of the corporate community i've seen a big change in terms of men finally being quote unquote used to women
who are in uh controlling positions
as higher you know corporate in the corporate hierarchy
so i think that's good
i think that uh you know you can just look at home life and see i've been talking to a lot of people a- about education and things
and and what what what affects the school system
and i think that a big thing that effects it is that the mother is not home anymore
um like she used to be
she used to be kind of a kind of a a rock you know
and uh since since everyone is going out and working now whether it be because of finances or just the economy
uh the mother's not there anymore
and the children are
i think i think a lot of society is suffering
not to say that women shouldn't you know go out and do what they want to do
but i think that um
and they're not quite used to it yet
and that's i
the schools or the mo- the schools or the parents
um i'm trying to think of what else
a lot of the things um the demographics do
i mean there are more
but a lot of the things that brought feminism i mean there are just more women in in in the demographics just generally
i mean i'm the typical baby boomer
but in terms of women
i mean when i was twenty-three the issues were either go to graduate school or get married
um those were the general issues
and uh uh we were talking about child care
and he asked me if i had any kids
and i said no i'm just twenty
and i said no i'm just twenty-three
you know because i don't think of myself as needing to have children
but h- the first thing he says is well don't you miss that part of your life
and i just
my my mind just went
because it d- it really didn't doesn't even occur to me right now to have children
and i've been a married for eleven years
and i it just you know
just because i'm not sure if it's just if it's just me or or women in general that are twenty-three right now because um i'm really into my career
i'm trying to go somewhere and and get there quick and then worry about you know because right now in my career i'm i'm really starting out
and it's going to take me a while to move up
and i don't need anything kind of holding me back um
and and you'll find that that's the other big thing that has changed in terms of
um women don't feel like they need to get married anymore
and i just at the time um
an i was at a point where it was like i didn't date e-
i mean i just i went out to have a good time
but i didn't have to have male companionship
um and a lot of the um friends that i had in school at that point who had gone back and gone to law school or m b a programs
um which i also had done had just you know they were very sad
but then by the time i got married um
so i guess that's a big change in terms of just um the attachments that women feel like they need to have the dependency
it's it's just really not there anymore
and that that has to do with you know the women getting out and other women seeing uh women seeing other women you know
that's like oh i can do that
you know maybe
and i i i mean i don't know how
oh my god
um but it's okay
i mean i don't thi-
i i just turned twenty-three uh
and i'm still going you know oh my god i'm s- getting so old
because me myself i just like to move really really quickly
i'm you know
and so anything
i- i- when the age creeps up where i'm twenty-three and twenty-four
i'm thinking my time is running out you know
but i'm actually very very young
and what you'll find is
i mean i'm just now finally to a point where
i mean i don't know why i didn't didn't do it sooner
but this is probably typical of the women's movement too
um which is a complete i wouldn't say career change it's it's a subway
but it's still is a different application
and i mean if you think about it you know i c- i still can have another career
i mean i've worked for over fifteen years in what i've done
and i mean so when you're saying quick um i think that's probably one thing that your generation coming up after mine
is thinking that um they have to do everyth- you know sort of
i call kind of i call it a chewing syndrome
they have they have to rapidity of speech
and you'll find that probably by the time your twenty-eight thirty if you haven't slowed down
um because it's just you find out that you're really not um smelling the roses
and i know that sounds trite
i think i think a lot of uh people probably feeling that way
i know i'm probably feeling that way because it's
and whether i want to realize it or not everything on television is young
oh it is
you can't do this after twenty you know
e- y- everybody that's in the music business is starting out at fifteen
and so i feel like i'm old
it's like i sing i sing
and i would really love to become
uh a professional singer
but i think i'm too old now
oh you're not
and i'm twenty-three
because everyone i've seen coming up they're fifteen
i mean it's it's
and so i'm going i'm so old
and i'm i i really have to always tell myself no you're not you're very young
it's it's ju-
and you know so it's
well it's like us we're getting ready to do if possible for an adoption
and i have friends that say well why would you do that
why would you do that now at this part point
and um it's just individual choices
i stopped comparing myself a long time ago to somebody who had um
i mean he just turned forty
um i mean that's like your mother
but what you find is you don't compare the woman because you just get into trouble
um but what i was going to say about mothers is uh your mother probably just won't say it
but i mean my mother and her sisters are always saying uh to my cousins and i my female cousins
you girls are so lucky because quote unquote you have all these choices you know
and my cousins and i go well why couldn't you
that's that's why i say i feel i feel really lucky right now b- because i'm not married and because i don't have children
and so i mean even some days i'm looking for another job now
but and i get so depressed because not because i can't find a job but because i can't figure out what i want to do
and that's normal
and i thi-
and i'm lucky though because not a lot of people can sit there and go gee i don't know what to do
but it's depressing too
that's how i mean
what do you what do you that you're
i'm i'm a free-lance writer right now
and then um what i'm doing is working at um a electroni- an electronics company
and then i'm also
actually i'm excited tomorrow i have a uh luncheon appointment with a perspective client to do
uh marketing communications for them
i'm a i'm a news reporter now
oh you are
and what i'm looking for is something in i really don't want to stay in news
but i would like to stay in journalism
and i've been looking for something exactly like that jus-
and those people probably won-
i don- i went to u t at austin
and i i just happen to work at a waco station because you know
or you in radio or television or news
broa- broadcast news t v
uh my journalism degree is in
well we just ate out um had a big lunch actually because we both have been working late
and we had italian um
well do you really like italian food
it- it's not my favorite
i mean this isn't really excellent italian food
but it's um
but i have to tell you this if i don't because you're in plano
but my um softball unit here
actually it's very good it's all of these run adult males
it's it's all the garlic bread and all the
oh that sounds really good
so it wasn't too bad it really wasn't
but i was more in the mood for french toast any way
but do you have any favorite
well are there just the two of you
well when my husband and i go out we have four children
oh you're kidding
so that makes a difference
but we don't like to go there because that's the most expensive
so we like to go to a pizza place where you can buy a pizza for one price an- and feed the whole family
like at gatti's or something like that
but when my husband and i go out we like to go somewhere with a little atmosphere
and we usually head on down um oh what's the freeway down here
uh six thirty-five
and there are um all along that that freeway there are restaurant
but one of our favorites is pappasito's
you know it always kills me cause i don't like the the decorations so much
but i love the food i love the food
but it's probably the best tasting
um the shredded beef the type of
i like to get that uh
a shrimp it's a shrimp dish
and i don't remember the name of it
but it's rolled up into into something
and oh it's really good
it's a little bit with th- the meat market atmosphere you know
even though we don't have kids we've been married long enough to um be around not be around that
um i'm trying to think of what else we like to eat
the one thing i notice is it's just um about dining out that you probably can relate to with four children and two of us getting ready to adopt i mean we find prohibited
i mean lunch today was eighteen dollars
but i think that some of it's over priced
it is i don't know um
um go to the august moon which is down there
uh restaurant with the lions in the front
oh it's pretty good as far as chinese
but chinese isn't my favorite
but he likes it kind of
so he heats us up a good fight
now me i'm like i said seafood i'm
and i i like a lot of different ethnic foods
well we haven't been in years down near presby
and i had a meeting down there today
and i saw that
and i said gee i remember that they offer you um authentic japanese feeding
and i remember when we went
and um i had never had saki
but if you're looking for a very uh
and the girls wear kimonos and
oh how nice
you know if you're ever looking for that
um but what other kind of foods
gee i don't know
now i like barbecue okay texas barbecue
have you ever been to th- i think it's called spring creek barbecue
oh my husband's going upstairs
and he says free ice cream
and it was wonderful
in fact if i could pick my um restaurants on how their coffee is and how their french bread is and the butter and the desert i would be
and how are your kids at an age where they can contribute to what they want
or do you still order for them
well my two littlest
and she's six months
and then my four year old he he still
but my other older two they can
they're they're kind of
my littlest girl she's still like wants mcdonald's mcdonald's mcdonald's
everybody every child that i even know that eats vegetables um looked five years old still after a certain age realized that there is something called a mcdonald's
oh i'm telling you
well it's kind of funny is sometimes we're like we all want different things
and so there's a h avenue down here
so we all get to go to our own little thing and drive through and get our own thing
and then we go to park over there so we can all have our own
well that's all right as long as
i was going to say because with six people how do you um
i mean i can't even imagine you know trying to um
well five of them they're good
well we're getting ready to
but it's just on my mind
oh how nice
and somebody said to me in terms of
but they you have to bring a formula
and i said what's that
and i said well you know i'm
and i think that that would make them drool any way
you know i guess are you is it a little bit of constricted because a lot of restaurants don't take
in terms of talking about restaurants i mean are a lot of restaurants how are they when you have children let alone three or four children
you have to be careful if you go to a a restaurant that that really is more adults you know
like we could probably take our oldest son and and our oldest daughter
and they know how to act
and some restaurants are really trying to go for that atmosphere kind of thing
i just i just i've been in some places where they say they take children
and then i've just seen where the wait attendance the wait staff is rude you know
and that always just bothered me
and then um on the other hand sometimes the children or the adults are themselves
really pappasito's we love um
it's on uh
is it tia's not tia's um
that's mexican um right across from on the dillard's side there
and i can't think of it
and it had white tablecloth
i think it was like paper where you could write on them or something with crayons
i mean i was shocked
i mean the dish was dirty um
where you felt like
but other then that i don't know we we do our share of pizza eating too but more like go get it and carry it in cause we're too
i don't like strange people coming to my door um
well i i've got selv-
and i can't really think of any other um places
but you can always blame it on having children
well i enjoyed talking to you
and i guess you know
well good luck
so i don't really have a lot of uh concrete uh opinions
just what i know out of my peer group uh has gone through
and none of it has been good
uh the ones that can afford to have live-in nannies
uh but a lot of the other ones that have are professional uh
i'd say fifty percent of you know my peers that i'm in my circle of friends have tried it and then stopped working until they're you know going to get their children in kindergarten or first grade
uh but i
what what age child are you thinking in terms of
for for yourselves
so you're starting from the b-
after eleven years of marriage yeah we are
we're actually it's happening now
so we're just going through the process
so an- and actually the question is uh very appropriate
cause i'm not sure whether uh how strong the maternal instinct is going to be
and did you put him in daycare
or is he older now or younger
well he's he's now eighteen and in in you know has completed a couple of years of university
so he's out of daycare
and and so that
but i was working full-time uh when he was born
but i was very lucky because i was a a college professor
and so i was able to you know
and i it was walking distance from from my apartment
so i went up there
and i sort of left him with with a neighbor
and i left him in a carry cot when he was very little
and i said you know he doesn't need anything except you know look at him if he cries
but you know don't pick him up and and this sort of stuff
because i was gone only an hour at a stretch or an hour and a half
oh that's wonderful
and i was able to you know get his schedule just uh cooperated
and and i guess uh th- because of your um your uh profession
i mean i uh i'm in corporate communications
but i've done free-lance writing in the past
so what we're hoping is that uh
i mean my husband thinks i can do it
i've just never worked out of a domestic base you know
i've always been in a corporate uh environment
uh but i'm hoping that possibly i can do something where i can go flextime or part-time
or if they don't have that uh
so i think that's som- th- something that couples need in going into this
uh i don't know
but but i was out of the country when uh my my son was little
but but the thing is if you have this flextime and that you might be able to do something similar to what i did
which is you know be there short times
and then later on when he was you know
i mean this
we're talking about uh i went back to work and or taught some some classes like a week after he was born
oh my goodness
and so that's when i was saying you know don't don't pick him up and stuff
but then later what i did was i brought a woman into the house
and she she was supposed to help me a little bit with cooking and doing the baby's laundry and this sort of stuff
and then i also came home and sort of was able to see from a distance what she was doing
and you know in a sense she she carried him around a lot too much uh you know for for my taste
it was constantly no i don't want him
he might uh he might hurt himself
but you know in a sense you see what i'm saying though
from a mother's standpoint i mean in a way i- it was quote and unquote good ob- objectivity
because what he learned to do by the time he was two or so he would sit next to the desk where i was grading papers or writing lesson plans
and he had asked for a paper and you know sort of scribble
and then he realized that there were quiet times
and there were active times
and then he learned he he also learned that uh there were times that you had to be gone so you probably minimized
well we're actually uh we're getting ready
i mean you're far enough away now i can tell you
and that's uh just
as in like what twenty twenty and uh but we we're real excited because we've just developed a contact
and it's private
and it's hospital
it's we're just very excited
and w- i- i- what's the word i'm looking for
when you deal with issues like that uh in terms of family building through adoption uh and then you have people responding to you well if you go through that why would you put them in daycare
oh that's silly
uh issues are being raised prematurely in my mind
but i guess they're not because it's something i'll have to deal with sooner than later
uh and i what i've learned to do is just tune out everybody's opinion
i feel that if the child is healthy uh and as long as we make it feel secure i'd love to do something like with what you did
uh i don't think i could be dumper where i could take it from you know eight in the morning till nine at night or six at night and leave it there
uh maybe after two or three or y- years old
i don't know um
i mean your kids need you
well they need a schedule i think
what country were you uh in europe when you were uh uh
well that's the same thing
i mean i don't know how they are there
but uh in eastern europe
it just seems the united states does not provide for either child care or geriat- or elder care as i call it
uh and we're just not set up for that
uh with the
i was just going to say i guess uh my sensitivities are are much more with the you know to be at home
because actually i had my grandmother with me from the time she was from the time she was ninety-two until she died at ninety-seven
see i think that's wonderful
and i mean that was recently after my son
and i mean yes
and she was at home alone some of the time
but but still you know it was much better than being shipped to a daycare center
you know which is much my
i think we're t- we're too too much towards it's somebody problem you know
shove them in in some school for twelve hours a day
and i agree with that
that's why i y- you know
but you can probably empathize with this
in terms of what to do uh
and i just don't think there is a day a good daycare system
uh my company i'm particularly fortunate that they have they're in tune with that
but i've been at companies where uh you know the deci- the the trend is or the definite mood is well we made conscious decisions not to have children
and that's sad
and a couple like us building through adoption there it's almost radical to some people
and what you just learn to do is tune everybody else out
and uh i respect there are some women that i know that are divorced or on their own or in single parenting and men that they you know they may have the need for child care like that
but i agree with you that it's just i call it dumping
i i think that certainly there is a role uh for this type of help
and and as long as one can can supervise it and and you know make it work in into one's own schedule without it seeming like dumping or or or uh giving it you know the whole job to somebody else to take care of
it's ar- in tandem then
i just uh
and there are trade-offs too i think
one of the things that is a problem is that uh in terms of compensation to some of the child care providers
uh it's just you know it's so low
but yet the overall cost for somebody doing it on a daily or even a weekly basis it's prohibitive
and some people that are not making more than twenty thousand a year uh
actually there seems to be an alternative in my neighborhood
is there seem there are several u- u- m- mothers who stay home
and they take you know
but and they they take care of another child
and i i can actually n- could name five or six people around my neighborhood that really do a good job on this
and you know you might want to stay home one year
and some other lady might want to stay home for a a few years
and actually my neighbor has an eighteen month old
and she's at home part-time paralegal
so i'm thinking um
and we get along fantastically
so i'm thinking you know
and that's the way you have to uh
is that is child care or that type of idea completely foreign to them
well actually there was a daycare center uh where my son did go for a year
but then he actually started kindergarten at age three
and so and i- you know it wasn't like prekindergarten
so he he was ready to to go to school at that point
they're they do have such facilities
but for the most part uh th- with the extended family you know you can usually find somebody which is much like our neighbor you know to sharing responsibility
and i'm and also there aren't that many women who who d- who work
and there was just a very big uh series about moslem women
and there were enlightening things that broke some of my stereotypical thoughts
but uh i was just real curious when you said middle east if you didn't mind me asking
and i didn't mean israel
so you you assumed right
well even if you did that's okay actually
because at first thought when i s- you know i said that not many people work i'm i'm thinking oh well she's going to you know because certainly in israel the women do work
my father was uh came in right after world war two
so he was too old
and you were too young right
uh the the one guy i worked with down in austin hated it
uh he was a lineman down there
and while he was there he caught some kind of a strange disease
and uh all his hair fell out
and he had like a hundred and five fever for a while
and and uh
uh what about long lasting effects on him
well i have talked with a number of vietnam veterans
and i really i had no one directly related to me involved
but uh my sister's husband was in vietnam
and it it really made a completely different man out of him
then uh another friend of mine went
and he was in combat
but he came back
and he said okay that is it that is behind me i am going on with my life
he was uh he was a vietnam war veteran
but he was in the navy though
and but uh most of the folks that i have met that were actually on the land or in combat are still still carry a lot of anger
and uh i i i i really do not think that we did those young men right
i think that uh desert storm
well the armed forces did so much to you know agent orange
you know and they ta- they take a even now uh they take a free hand as far as medicine and uh you know how they treat the war casualties you know
you know or or it is hanging by a thread they still can't put it back together now
but but what they do afterwards and how they re- rehabilitate you
well you know one of the most troublesome things that i have encountered as a result is the incredible influx of southeast asians into this country since that conflict
uh not so
but there is just such a surge of southeast asians
it has affected the culture of this country uh
it's ab- it's about nine or ten percent now
well uh the culture is changing
uh even ten years ago there were not that many
a lot of shops are are operated by southeast asians
and uh tends to cause our kids to really have to buckle down to keep up with them which is not bad
uh but it might in the long run you can see where scholarships for example
uh even jobs uh jobs that would normally go to an american with a lesser education might be going to to some of these people here
and that is all a result of of of vietnam
and and you see a lot of a lot of men that were over there brought families back
uh and it concerns me that there is probably a lot of mixed breed youngsters still there
and i would be concerned or interested to find out how they are doing now
well they are probably not doing very well at all
because i know there is there is still people even in the dallas area
there are there are still people trying to get some member of their family back from uh vietnam
na- native vietnamese people
they were lost you know when they were little
and and they c- never did get back
oh i had not
that that had not occurred to me
and as is really a big waste because they didn't they didn't win
it spilled over into uh now i can't even think of the country
and and all they did is run and hide
and they were not really fighting you know
it it would have been the same as desert storm if all they had been fighting was north vietnam
but and i am not even sure who was involved more whether it was china or russia
you know they were pouring they were pouring weapons in there and and advising well digging tunnels for them
and there is no way that they could ever catch them
well i think the terrain had a lot to do with the the success of desert storm as opposed to that in vietnam
you know there is incredible cover in vietnam
and you can't find much cover on
and then they try to camouflage the top
well now even i think even now and in vietnam they could probably have done a better job
because they could
but and the and the corps of engineers i think do a better job now like they did in desert storm
because they had
he he dug a bunch of moats and filled them with oil and he set a lot of booby traps all along the way as they went
and they had to you know they had to blow them up or or disarm them
and then they had to fill in little bridges all the way where he where he had made those moats
but when when when you get into trouble like that in a place like vietnam you do tend to analyze the problems that you get into
and you say never more
and and you overcome those problems
and you are prepared next time
i think that is one of the reasons that they have they have pretty much avoided getting involved in south america
because look what happened when they were looking for noriega
and they lost him for four hours when they were right on top of him
well i know that
but they lost a whole lot of the life they might have had
uh being entirely different people
and they they really need
everybody that has that has stood there
you stand there with a rifle and blow a a piece of somebody apart
and that has to affect you if you are human you know
i can't uh
so they had to work all that that anger out and the and the nightmares that come along with it
i do not i do not really think that anybody can ever for- forget that
but they can they can reason and and try to adjust to to why they were there
well you see that is what the veterans are so angry about now
they say well we're
but that does not undo the ones that were done
and that is what makes the veterans angry
and i cannot blame them
but i sure cannot blame them for being angry
on the other hand you know you can be angry about something for a very long time
or you can say well that is the way it is and go on with your life
but it did
and that and that was that was in the in the era when kennedy was president that they were afraid of everything
and and and they f- initially got into it because of eisenhower
and he just he did not want to be in it any more than than what we started out in august with desert storm
and then it just blew up into the war
well it has been that way for a very very long time though
and that was many years ago
so and and and the asians historically have always had these kinds of wars going on
there there has not been a lot of peace in that part of the world
i really i do not know
i- we should not have maybe gotten involved
but if we did we certainly should have supported our people who were there
and uh i am afraid that they were treated as castaways for the most part
and i i saw the movie
and i think it did a good job depicting the temperament of the times
more than what was apocalypse now
well dudley have we pretty well discussed the subject
well i think so
uh my fianc3e works for the computers for the government
and that's how he got it
so who do you work for
so you don't have any benefits at all to talk about
well in in interviewing have you ever discussed benefits with some of the potential employers
yo- you normally just try to sell them on your uh aptitude and not you know well how much vacation do i get
well i'll tell you a little bit about what t i has as benefits
we do have uh
although they're tending to try to really cut costs more and more um what they started with a few years ago is that they only would allow you to go to um set hospitals in the area
they're hospitals that they're uh agreeing with uh t i that they'll be a certain rate you know for rooms and care and all that kind of stuff to keep co- you know costs down
so it's almost like a um uh an h m o you know kind of thing that uh only certain doctors are you going to be allowed to go to and get the full coverage
we have some dental coverage now um
but you have to pay a little more to really get something worthwhile
and if you didn't have the extra dental plus um you only get like a third of your cost which can be kind of expensive with a crown
so i i pay
um we do have pension although i've realized recently that the pension doesn't seem to be too good
and i know when you first start out working you're not thinking about that
oh i like to think about that
um we do have a new thing that they've started a few years ago um
and then t i um meets you half way up to a certain maximum
so like i put in a dollar they put in fifty cents
so that grows pretty good
and i think that will be more of something i can see of a pension than the regular pension plan
but you know that's not always a real for sure kind of thing
especially with this one you know it kind of goes up and down
but you hate to have it fluctuate
and like you know last year it was forty dollars a share
and now this year it's thirty six dollars a share
and you go gee i'm losing money
and we ge- you know vacation normally after you're here for six months
and you start to get like five days every six months is kind of how they accrue it to you
and it's one nice thing about t i is after you've been here uh for five years
oh that's nice
and we get some we get uh decent holidays
um a- at thanksgiving we always get the two days off which is nice to make a nice long weekend
and at christmas we always get two days at christmas
so that's nice so you always get two days at christmas
a lot of people just take you know that week
i normally take that week somehow you know
and you get the whole week at christmas time
well um i can just tell you like you know
well there's twelve kids in my family
so the the dental was very important you know to my dad
but um i think they took the dental away now
it's you know
it's just another you know telephone network
and they took the dental away
but now i think they're going to start getting into eye
i think uh um
but yeah i think sometime last year or just recently they started to give some kind of eye coverage
you get discounts on uh glasses
and i'm not quite sure there's certain places you can go to that have uh discounts for people that work here
so you can get glasses and contacts and stuff through those particular stores or something like that
and now for his pension he pretty much just has the stock
but my fianc3e
like if he puts in a dollar they'll put in a dollar you know
and then he's only allowed i think i don't know if it's maybe five percent or something like that that he's allowed to put in
and they'll match it
so and um he works for the
well he works for them
but that's that's where he works
and um he his vacation is really nice
and he'll be getting three weeks vacation
you know of course it's a go- it's for the government
and he has all all the holidays off
and you get some extra ones
you know you get columbus day and veterans day
and um he seems to be very happy you know
and you know he has all that
and with his doctors and stuff they have um a list of doctors that the employees can go to
and it only costs a dollar as long as they go to that doctor
you know and i think it works the same way with his prescriptions and stuff if he needs any
but you have to go you know to certain ones
but still that works out really nice
you know it
we're doing an h m o right now um
and when we go to get prescriptions it's five dollars so-
so- you know sometime sometimes when you go you know the prescription
like my husband always takes which is kind of like you know contact stuff only better
that's like a buck a capsule
so if you've got thirty in there it normally comes out to about thirty-four dollars so when you pay five it's a pretty good savings
then there's other times that you know maybe the prescription wouldn't cost more than like seven or eight dollars
and you pay five anyhow
so it isn't a
uh whether or not we wo- we like nursing homes
actually my grandmother owned and operated a nursing home for years
and her mother
oh you are kidding
and then my mother also owned and operated a nursing home
and then uh went on back to school and became the director of nurses at a nursing home
and uh my mother and my older sister both are geriatric nurses
oh for heaven's sake
so i do know something
actually the motivation for grandmother entering the business
and she needed company
and so she opened a nursing home and initially started with eight ladies
and then uh it it grew into a
uh then they
now see that is a nice attitude to go into
uh it seems like they must be waiting until it is a necessity and there is no chance of uh good companionship or doing anything
well that is not really true either uh
i think that is a stigma and an i and an impression that has come from some few bad experiences
you see those who had bad experiences talk about them
and those who do not may write
but they do not talk a whole lot about that
but what i mean is instead of maybe entering a nursing home
maybe other friends they wait until they are you know unable
well that is because they wait until the children make those choices
and uh she works for one here in dallas which is more a retirement village than it is a nursing home
and these these
i love watching these elderly people come they will come and tell her well i am going for my
and uh would yo- would you you know call down and have the van come around and take
and they are very active and very enthusiastic
and they have
or or one of the lovely cafeterias
and they have you know pink linen napkins for their dinners
oh i am certainly very much for a nursing home
and i think when the the parent gets old enough
see if they could could get this idea across though better than what it is
well now my daddy's mother uh lived in a a retirement village
and she and her sister had side by side duplexes
but they were there close
and they did have uh you know the button that you could push the central office if you got into problems
and they have security
oh well you have that with anything
but i would be willing to bet they are far less abused in a nursing home than are they are in
we used our nursing home as uh
like when my sister was real bad before she died uh we took her the last month and a half
and they were super with her
they were uh
well now my grandmother
of course all of my folks lived to be very old and my grandmother developed hodgkin's disease
when she was in her late eighties uh late seventies i mean
well a lot of people do that
and yet it is not you know
and it can become home to them
it it depends upon the individual
but you see we have had excellent experience with that
and uh i i did not put my husband in a nursing home when he became ill
i might i might like to be
but i would like
and i think you would shop for a nursing home just like you would shop for a church
do do the best job you could in choosing one
and you do not have the time to look
i have a cousin who is uh
and he did fine
but she made arrangements so that when she was gone
she did not want her her children her other children burdened with his care
so he they she has made arrangements that when she she was gone that he would go into the nursing home
and he has i would say he adjusted very well
and uh he he he has been there quite a long time
and uh he don't know me usually
so he goes wheeling down uh the hall to bingo
and uh he has adjusted very well
well one of the things i think that is most desirable for the elderly and that is routine
uh the only real problem with that in a nursing home is that the staff turns over
to to get the dedication
and that is sad because i think the health profession is one of the most critical
for some reason people resist uh the fact that they should be paid as well as businesses and that type of thing you know
i cannot imagine a more costly and a more a more uh better area to invest
but there seems to be a resistance
and as a matter of fact i do not see why they do not have children's programs in nursing homes
well around here we have some you know the churches
take your the children
and this uh
we i've probably personally take i think just two okay
but that's because my mother-in-law takes every one they print and gives them to me
so so i get all of them
uh the one that i really especially enjoy
and you may be familiar with it from wisconsin is called country
oh yes uh
and i get that it has recipes in it
and that's my very favorite
oh that's great
well i actually take country living
it's a country magazine on house beautiful because i like um that kind of stuff
decorating and uh getting ideas for a garden
in fact uh right before you called i was planning my tulips and uh putting them on blue print on where i'm going to put them
so i'm really into that
but uh so i really get into magazines that are kind of basically into um housing type things where the be decorating and gardening and recipes that kind of stuff
so i'm pretty much in the same category as what you're looking at
well we we tried for a while to take a news magazine
we took newsweek and i think we took it especially just during the war to kind of catch up on everything and have it be digested
but we've kind of discontinued that right now and we've we're going to start taking that uh u s news uh newspaper u s a today
i think with that what happens is uh it's interesting to read but you kind of just put the magazine away
and you never read it again unless there's some big article in there that you're going to keep for your kids
and we saved the ones from the war and one from the earthquake
exactly it sounds exactly like what we did we just saved everything we could for our daughter
but uh that's pretty similar
well you sound like you
but i find that with these country magazines i keep going back to them getting ideas looking back and saying jeez there was a flower garden in there that i that i would like to have some ideas you know i get a lot of ideas from them
and uh you're right the leaves are beautiful
and they are falling now
uh it just peaked uh last week
and it was just gorgeous out here
the other thing about magazines the only thing i don't like is they really get heavily into advertising and
you know it's it's it's fine
i'd rather almost have i know that part probably half their money comes from these people that are saying uh put my ad in your paper and i'll pay you or whatever
but uh there's been some magazines i've looked at
and it's a real turn off to see every other page
i i think i opened vogue the other day or something and it was just nothing uh-huh
and i thought why buy this
you know what's the point
it's almost i mean you could go into a store and get bombarded the same way
and my number one pet peeve in a magazine is when they put the perfume in it because uh real often i don't like very heavy perfumes and very often like you know in my bills also magazines and bills and they'll
but pretty much like i said the magazines i've had better homes and garden
and now i need a switch
and i'm going back to gourmet cooking because um i've had the magazine before back in nineteen uh eighty-six
and i thought well i'll give it a try again because you get tired of one magazine
and you need to try a change
well do you do you tear out of your magazines your recipes
or do you keep it
and sometimes most of the time i tear them out
a lot of times if uh you know if i got a chance to sit down at my typewriter i'll go ahead and type out recipes
but what i usually do is i'll try it out in the magazine first and without tearing it out and then give it a
and then if we like it it becomes part of the recipe collection
oh that's a good idea
well i'm going to pay attention more when i'm in the store to that country living i remember seeing the cover
back when i decorated the house with a lot of the little country uh primitive things the little the little pigs and the jeez and the ducks and that we had that was the big rage here couple of years ago
and i bought a lot of the country magazines and then it seems like when i put some of that away i quit buying it
but i had forgotten the recipes and i'm going to
it it that's what i i just went through uh we just recently moved from minnesota to wisconsin
and you don't want to part with any of them because there's one thing in each one
oh that's good
but i ended up uh reducing them down to like fifteen magazines out of uh hundreds
and i just said okay there's one picture in there that
it really doesn't you know it's got to have more than that it's got to have some good ideas it's got to have everything
so i just kind of went through
and i find that most of the magazines i really like is around christmas time because
i i know
basically i can tell you that i like just about every music there is except for uh uh real hard hard rock
but i go from classical all the way to uh jazz and country and uh soft pop uh
so i pretty much have a a wide range of uh what i like
and just there isn't any particular music that i enjoy more than just listening to all kinds so that's about it
now it's it's pretty neat music that they came out with
but there's like certain types of country western i can't handle that twangy stuff
the old old stuff that came out i think it was was it oh jeez came out with some of that hank williams
but other than that i like pretty much everything
so other than uh
lately you know with the new music that has come out some of the really good uh music they have the saxophone playing
and it's so funny because you can take an instrument and forget what it really sounds like when it plays by itself
i can i can pretty much
oh it's all wet tiana
and she slipped
anyway but uh um yeah
i i don't have interest of losing my ears
and he said he's lost most of his hearing
well it was good talking to you then
well same here
scott let's uh talk about advice that we can offer a parent where the child is going to go to a university and
i have some yes some children
and they're all quite young and so we want to plan for their education
or we're saving right now
and we're getting bonds and and uh and hopefully finances set aside so that they can choose a college that they want to
i'm in i'm in graduate school right now
in fact i'm even going uh selecting again for for my p h d
it's it's a close subject right now
what uh what do you use as a basis to determine which college or university you go to
for undergraduate i i you know my criteria were much different than than like for graduate school
uh when i when i wanted to go to an undergraduate institution i was looking for something that was you know rather small and easy to get around you know
i i got to where i i wanted to uh
well that's a that's that's good because i did quite a bit the same thing in my undergraduate work
i wanted to get a school that was small enough that was personable that you didn't have a lecture uh hall with about fifteen other students competing for the professor's attention and uh but you i felt that i got a pretty good uh undergraduate uh
where where did you go
i went to utah state university which is in logan utah and the nice thing about it too is i knew that i wanted to get into business and that their business college of business was accredited
and well known at least there in the state of utah and around the surrounding states and so forth
and so i i feel like number one you ne- you also need to see what kind of name the
like you mentioned before the name the college and university can can give you and another thing that uh another reason why i chose that was the the finances
i wanted to make sure that i would be able to afford it that i wouldn't get through four three years of the undergraduate work and and have to leave
and uh so i did a lot of talking with friends with family with uh counselors at high school and also read some some books on on the subject at the at the library
and uh it was kind of unusual because my my two older brothers and i all went to thr- three different universities depending on what our choice was
and i i felt very comfortable and good about that
do you do you worry do you worry any about uh uh being able
i mean obviously you've taken precautions you know or measures to uh try and pay for your children's education
but do you think that that's going to be enough
the the way that tuition is increasing um exponentially it's it's
i all i all i can hope for is that i land a professorship at a nice heavy university
well that's an excellent idea
one thing that uh that we did uh and my parents and our family is that we weren't able to afford um the kind of education that we all desired
so my parents stressed that we get excellent grades so that we apply and try for scholarships and uh scholarships were very beneficial in my case to help pay for my education because my parents couldn't
and what the scholarship could not supply i was able to to work for and and save and and and get
also my my brother um he's a he's a medical doctor right now
he had to you know
and he's he's working to pay those off
so i i think that the uh you know once you get past uh the initial stages of it that there's different options you can use
and and uh the student loans are are good options
that's what that's
and and as you're well aware that tuition's not
so what do you think about a year or two of public service
well i know it's hard for young people to think about giving up their years you know fr- their carefree years but people that i have known that have done that like from other countries especially
from germany and finland um they are just they have such a better more mature outlook on life
and i think they're better people because of it
i know um the church that i go to um the young men give two years of their life when they turn nineteen you know
and i be- i really believe that the people that do that are better people that make our
you know i i really agree with you
um i uh though i've never done that myself i i'm was a basically an education major when i graduated from college
and i accepted a job that at the time was just slightly above the poverty level to teach to um very rural children in a very low income district
and i spent a year teaching there and i think it was probably one of my largest eye-opening experiences because i come from nice middle class white suburban home and i did it um for one reason i wanted
so i wanted to stay close to where i was working on a masters degree but also because i just thought that it would be interesting to live some place else so totally different than my own up bringing and i
it changed it probably changed my political views
it changed my understanding of the world around me and i think um in fact i- if i had to do it all again i you know
after that you know you never think of it because i guess because i paid for all of my college education myself i never thought about doing that because i had all these college loans i'd started paying back
um beca- so that was that was one reason why i never considered it
but now that i'm further along and i'm still paying these college loans
i i think realistically you know you can have your college loans delayed now because i had them delayed because i'm back in graduate school at thirty years old
um i had them delayed because i'm back in graduate school and on that form it says if your joining the peace corps you can have them delayed and i thought that was you know very interesting
and i i would have thought of that earlier
i probably would have done you know just like is that is this is that the mormon church
because one of my neighbors uh did that in pittsburgh from pittsburgh
and i thought you know that really
i think it would have been a very good um experience for me
well i think so
and and in a time after high school um there's kind of a selfishness
i mean teenagers in our country are kind of kind of a year that parents don't look forward to and and things like that
and i think that it would help people to become
and to be more responsible when you're out on your own trying to um
and i think you know we have such a need now you know
i taught you know
i i think i was paid uh about nine thousand dollars to teach for the year and i worked in a very rural school district
and i i one of the things i taught was a computer class and these kids um you know every girl i taught except for one was pregnant
and they were they were high school juniors
and i just
there you know they came from poverty
and it was it was the school district couldn't hire many people
and i think you know in the sense that aspect of public service for education in some of the inner cities for um just social workers in some of the inner cities and some of the rural areas where they just need advice on medical um things
see i never
i i tell you sometimes i worry about things over seas because we have such problems right here in our own country
it would really um
and i don't
the people that i've known like from germany and finland that have done that are they do military service which you know
but still they have benefited from it
and um you know although i wouldn't want it to make people to go off to the military voluntarily
but it's it has helped them
and they are just a lot more mature
i know that my first couple of years of college were um uh probably too carefree at the
and then at the end i had to be too serious
well that's right
or they get they just get so excited to be away from home
and they do a lot of things to themselves that that we really don't want our young people to be doing
i think i think this was this was a very interesting topic uh because it's something that you know we don't talk about in this country probably enough
uh you know
because we're so we love our freedom and our freedom of choice and um having people
but you know our
like in our church it it is your free to do that or not you're encouraged to do it because um you know it it helps you
and of course we think it's helping other people
oh i think it is
i think um people
i you know
i spend a lot of my time teaching college students and um i find great disgust in them in their in their um
they don't understand uh how other people live um
and they're preoccupied with
i think that's uh just having a good time
and he always refers to it as short-term pleasure oriented
and everything has to be an immediate reward
and it has to be fun
well i i don't know how that would ever happen here
but at least um
well they say
i think i um have read recently that uh the bush administration has increased the funding for the peace corps
because i guess because of the changes in eastern europe uh they've increased funding for the peace corps
some of the i guess it's some of the peace dividend in the sense you known
and some of the are the overseas programs uh
well i have seen a big change i think in high school kids that my relatives
and friends that um i know when i was in high school i had an idea of what i really wanted to do with what my what i was going to study
and at least i had some interest in
a lot of the youth that i come in contact with are they say oh i want to be a doctor i want to be a lawyer
because they make a lot of money
and they don't have a goal
you know how many
and i guess i i live near washington being in in baltimore it's something like one in four people
and and i just sort of think that's ridiculous
with with the great needs that we need today in science and biology and uh you know the the problems we have with aids and cancer and and tha- how come everybody is a lawyer you know you know
not enough people want to do that to for uh because of a service that they could provide
you know if you want to be a lawyer because you know that you can provide a service that people need because you have to have lawyers in this country um but if you're just doing it because you think that's the best way to
well i guess i better go
well good luck to you
well thank you very much
uh let's see
so uh were we right in the middle east
uh i think what we did was good
but i think we just should have stayed there longer and continued doing what we did do
oh you agree with schwartzkopf who says uh drive on into baghdad
and it's almost like they're killing each other off
and there is not going to be anything left of iraq at all
well i think i don't think it would be good if we were to completely lose it um
i just mean that that the world in general
we've got to talk so it's just just as well we argue
um i don't know
i think we should have helped the the innocent people in iraq out a little bit more
than rather than just quitting where we did
but i think that's almost impossible next to impossible
so other political things that's going on
i heard mister bush say excuse me president bush say that he uh wanted to improve the highways
oh see i haven't really been keeping up with them
so i really don't know what he said
oh he wanted to take the current secondary highway system and turn it into interstates like the rest of the country
but wouldn't it be wonderful
i'm sorry i dropped the phone
oh okay um
see out here in the west a lot of our secondary roads are fifty-five we drive sixty-five
well i uh last weekend went home to visit my parents
and uh between here and west texas there was probably three and four hours at sixty-five miles an hour
oh i didn't realize that
oh you've never
i've never seen anything out i never seen the great
i just i'm a college student
and um i'm paying for my own education
and i'm i come from a large family
and we we we're never able to take vacations because there's there's twelve kids in the family
well my college educa- uh thirty-six
uh know virtually nothing else
i got my four year got my b s in general science
anyway uh i know nothing other than the west
in fact uh down in east texas where the company's located there's streams and water and things i don't understand trees and the gulf
and it's really interesting
so tell me about where you live
well um i'm i'm originally from butler
and that's about an hour away from where i am now
and um it's it's pretty like windy and hilly
uh how high is the highest elevation
oh i couldn't even tell you
like uh probably three thousand feet
oh i don't even know
uh right here in colorado springs where i live it's over six thousand foot
oh well see um
when i lived in texas every year i had to drive you know
and you know so i could have a feast of fresh seafood six eight twelve hours away
you know just just for fresh
i i'm really interested in the basic concept differences between west and east coast and the central parts of america
uh the farthest away from home
uh now when i was growing up in the panhandle of texas
look at your map later and see the the town of amarillo fifty miles north of that up in the panhandle
oh my gosh
and people buy jeans in town
but uh we thought nothing at all of wake up waking up in the morning hopping into your car grabbing the fishing poles and driving four hours
now see for me that's a long ways
even well like i i'm in like a little town right now
and um butler butler is about an hour north east of pittsburgh
so that will give you some idea of where i'm at
and i'm about i'm about two hours north east of pittsburgh
and uh i mean just this this little town here is basically a college town
the college without the college here this town would be nothing
because it's completely made up of fast food restaurants
and and in the summer when we co- uh
i mean there's just no one around
so are you working your way through college
um well i go home in the summer
and i work in the summer
and between what i make in the summer and student loans that's how i go to college
well how neat
well that's interesting
so uh what do you plan to do with it
um well like i said my fiancee
savings and loans uh
um my fiancee works down in d c
and i'd actually like to work for a company rather than a bank or a something
i'd rather work for a company and um like be their financial advisor or something
oh that would be great
let's see uh so we're all excited in colorado springs
the uh new employer is in the city
so we're expecting our local economy to
well maybe not a boom but uh at least recover to where we can all hold regular forty hour jobs still
well well what would be the unemployment rate out there
uh unemployment runs approximately six percent
see that's what it is here too
but now under employment i would suspect to run closer to eighteen or twenty percent
and the problem is that there are no good permanent full time jobs for people without a technical four year degree
and they have a job that has nothing to do
i uh i have five children all together
uh my oldest two are already out and about in the world
and i uh have a set of twins that are fourteen and uh my youngest is twelve
uh at any rate um my first two children uh i didn't spend a whole lot of time with them
worked about fifty-one hours a week because i worked every
and uh so i didn't get to spend as much time with them as i as i should have as i really wanted to
well it was with all of them
but it was uh more an impact i think on the oldest two
and uh they never you know i don't think they noticed i wasn't around that much
you know with all the children around the house it's
and uh so then i came out and was making as much money forty hours a week as i did fifty-one hours
so i've tried to spend more time with uh the children since then
um what i'm currently doing is uh taking a lot of time
um we just started a thing where every other week we go to uh movies
and so every couple of weeks we will go to the movies because that's how often they change the
and it's working out pretty well
um we're spending more time together
um in fact i found that i'm a lot closer with uh
and i don't even know where he's at
um he's taken off for parts unknown
but uh yeah
and uh my daughter is um
and uh so it's it's it's it's been difficult to try to find the time
and i think it's important that we do because uh
and i noticed parents not spending time with their
children and and going out and doing things
and you know i knew like the kids next door were all into cocaine
you know it just you know
i mean it was bad enough every place else
but drugs is in texas are extremely bad
and so i think it's kind of important that i that i you know nurture the relationship i have with my children now
and i'm doing my best to keep that up
well that's all you can do
what's your been your experience
well i i was going to ask too does your wife work
um she didn't up until the last oh six months
uh she worked a job until we moved to our new house
and uh she quit that job because it was too inconvenient
uh she starts a new job tomorrow which should take her out of the house about four days a week
so that sounds great
and but ours are all out of the nest
so uh as when they were growing up i probably we had a lot of similar things l- like you had you know having the time
but uh we were we're very active of course at church and uh boy scouting and girl scouts four h uh
and those activities helped a lot in
and uh we try to take a vacation with them every year camping of some sort something that wasn't expensive
and uh our youngest is uh expecting her first baby
so they're they're all out and on their own
and we have one to get married yet
and they'll all be married
uh and they're they're all doing pretty good
uh one i like i said lives near maryl- in in around maryland d c
and one lives in connecticut
and our baby lives just a mile over the hill
so we'll get to see her a little more than uh what we do the other ones
i've i've noticed uh another thing um
and uh you know he uh he worked a full-time job and a part-time job
and i never saw him
so i didn't have much of a role model to go by
know to learn how to be a a father and
i i can't ever remember playing ball with my dad or
and that does make a big difference
you know everybody's not father knows best
well none of us are
you know we're not none of us like they pro- portray it on those shows
mean the the the capability to uh create children doesn't necessarily mean you have the uh the mental capacity to raise them
now our daughter our well she's our second oldest she has she's the only that other one that has children
and she works full time
and i have mixed feelings about that
and i don't know if she'd be happy to stay at home
but yet on the other hand i i've got the mixed feelings that i think you should be at home with your children
but they seem to they seem to give uh quality time to those children when they are together
and and so it seems
so i don't know
i i don't think i ever would have had what it would take to work full time and raise a family
it's it's not easy
i've uh you know i've helped out extremely uh
well i can't say
but i've helped out
and uh y- as you know with five children it takes a lot of work
uh well now i work for texas instruments
so so i'm in computers
a lot of the people i've that's call- i've talked to work for uh for the same
and so i've uh
prior to that i uh i worked in a food store
and uh you know wor-
it uh it was uh it was a a smart move to make
and uh you know every time something new came up i was explaining it to them
and you you recognized this and
was able to you know
i uh started back to school
and that's why i
you know if you're working if you're taking twelve credits at night and you're working fifty-one hours a week there's not much time left to spend with
well it puts a strain on everybody your wife and your family
and the only thing you can remember is to
because it's very easy to uh become go your own direction when you're s- when you're working so hard and going to school too
well it it all paid off
well that's wonderful
so uh you know i got my degree and got the better paying job
and and uh you know we i think as a family we're a lot better off
it sounds to me like uh you're doing well
so uh he's been retired for three years now
well my goal is to try to retire by the time i'm fifty-five
oh well he made it at fifty
and and uh he went at fifty
and he still works part time at other thing you know same job as he was doing only he's retired and doing it independently
but uh nevertheless retired
well basically uh did you want to go first then
uh well i can
i i don't own my home
and i rent my home
and uh we aren't sure we're going to buy a house yet because we don't know if we're going to be staying here
in uh texas
i think as far as like our home it's uh in a small residential area
so it's kind of more of a country setting
it's it's nothing you know
it's it's just a typical home with uh three bedrooms uh two story type home
uh and i think as far as if it's for put it into standards of uh what other homes are around here it would be just about fitting right into the middle part of where the homes are
uh there's a river across from us which has more elaborate homes
where we can view the river from that distance there's still homes within our area that are you know pretty typical of what our home is
so it's uh pretty much that uh type of uh home
well our ho- our house we we're renting it from an individual who bought it
and he lives in korea
and he's owns eight or nine properties uh near here and uh so
but the houses around here there's five five houses on my street for sale right now
which is just uh in trouble
and they're not very expensive either
uh but we
so it's the rambler style
we have two two living areas and a dining room and a big kitchen
uh one of our bedrooms is really small
and we've made that into a den because we only have one child
so that was our best way of going with uh the small bedrooms because they are making bedrooms smaller and smaller
uh but uh anyway but
so that sounds great
and uh i don't know if we need to talk any more or whatever
have you d- have you done this before
uh about three times before
oh have you
i've well i've gotten several calls
uh but uh
i don't have to wait until somebody calls me even though i have a feeling what's going to happen is i'll probably get tons of calls you know so sooner or later
well they've i've talked to some people from cleveland
and i did talk to someone else who lives here in the same city i do
so that was kind of interesting
they're they're sure getting their people out
so well it was nice to talk to you anyway
well you take it easy gail
for as far as um i would think the probably the uh worst substance that's probably um
or started to say the uh
what causes the most air pollution is probably the car and uh whether or not um they'll ever get into like huge transit systems into big cities where people would all travel on a high speed uh train
and that's what we're finding um here where we're at in minneapolis area is that people don't want to carpool that there are inconveniences to that
or maybe you don't like the person you have to you would want to carpool with that kind of thing
so it's it's kind of a thing where uh i think the majority of the people do not carpool
i'm in texas and very few people carpool uh the people that i know don't want to because uh they never know for sure what time they're going to leave their job they never know when they want to run out and do an errand at noon you know
or if somebody gets sick and it's not the other person and they want to go home and that one person's got the car then they're they're stuck
and people don't want to give it up but now i think we've made great strides in changing a lot of that by going to the unleaded gasoline and
uh other than that uh i don't know
well my other line is ringing but we're going to ignore it
oh close to five minutes i believe
five minutes oh okay
and you're in minneapolis
well is the pollution really bad up there
uh actually no
we have uh quite a bit uh
but those are natural um but there is starting to
and they just put in a strict law that as of every year when you get your license tabs you have to have your car inspected to see if it's releasing any uh lead into the air or other pollutants
and if that's the case then you have to get your car fixed
well that's the way it has gotten here
we have just had that law i think about a year maybe a year and a half here in texas but uh i think it's a good idea because a lot of people still want to drive the older cars which you can't blame them for that and uh but if they are polluting the air they need do need to have them fixed and you know there's a big move especially in the industrial part in texas right now of controlling the c f c that the big manufacturing companies are producing into the air they're having to change the type of products they use uh they can't use
like i have a friend that's in the air conditioning heating business and they have to pay a penalty for every ounce or pound of this certain type of freon that they use in the air conditioning syst- systems therefore the individual every time they have a service call if they have an old unit that's still using this twenty-two freon or whatever it is it costs them three times as much to get it fixed and uh if you have a new high efficiency system that uses the new type of freons that do not release as many c f c into the atmosphere it doesn't cost as much so eventually people are going to have to go to newer systems you know
sure uh the other thing when you're talking about freon with cars uh air conditioning i'm sure over there it's a necessity versus something up here we can live without it
but it's uncomfortable but uh this year my husband recharged our freon because it was needed to be done
and one of the cans
and i don't know if there was something wrong with it or it his directions weren't quite fully instructed onto that
and i was thinking how many other people oh sure
because if you take it into a service station
they want to charge you forty dollars just for uh freon which only costs you about three dollars so i have this feeling that freon probably will increase in price because it is something that people will have to take into consideration and say hey that's that's right there
i think it's like three or four dollars a a can and it takes about four to five cans to fill up a air conditioning unit in a car
and i i thought about that
and my husband even was kind of woozy after that because i'm sure he breathed it
well of course in the uh
well um i i just think the way that things are going that um it would be good for young people to go ahead and have um dedicate themselves to at least something
i know like the mormon religion you know they require two years of service uh missionary service right
and um so but i think it would be good for all young people you know to be able to to do something like that um so that um you know i don't know i just feel it would be good for them to do that
i i thought it would be good too
but i did not think it would be good that they all do something like the peace corps because not all young people would have uh what it takes to go like that because i think it takes a certain person to to be able to do something like that
but there's a lot of other public service things that could be done
and and even even in our home towns there's a lot of um public service things that they could do uh you know drug rehabilitation and and alcohol and and just uh helping old people and um uh you know helping cripple just helping somebody else and i think that art of giving is something that um we don't have very much any more
or are they actually
why why why did they call it a proposal
oh i think they just gave it a title but is this not something that's um in legislation or in work some yeah
it's just a just a topic
um because there's so many um kids who have uh you know so much money and so much free time and uh nothing to do um and nothing to give their time to
um they don't even have a direction to give their their time to
so i think it would be really good for people to um to be able to give their time in in uh some kind of public service uh even in our government you know as uh aids to uh you know congress uh people so um yeah
it would be it'd be really good i think
well people that are um have received sentences in jail they have uh some of them are going out and doing uh they have to go out and do public service activities which to me is is good
this is something that um like you say is it's character building um you know learning how to to give to others and being less selfish
well i think sometimes it gives you a better picture of what some of the other people live like you know what what some of the other parts of the world are like or even other parts of the neighborhood some of the people how they live
oh i agree with you
and i think uh young people are so um uh focused just on themselves and their activities and whose going out with whom et cetera that uh you know to get a taste of what the real world is actually about doing that public service would be great
because that's one thing that's hard with young people you you can't tell them how things are they have to see for themselves now of course this might be after they've gone through their teen years
i would think so like right after um high school you know even if it was the the their um that summer right after high school you know three months
of course they've already gone through the period of time where they need more direction you know they their teenage years and that they really sometimes need a little better direction to go and something
course now peace corps that couldn't be done of course until they were done with school so
you know something that out that was outside of uh outside of school yeah
you know right right after you graduate from um high school because a lot of people are just um uh well gee whiz what do i do now if they're not focused on going to college
and uh you know having that that uh gung ho plan uh that's you know setting their life goals
so to me see that would be the the uh the greatest time for um you know teenagers to to do that would be right after they graduated from high school
but as for its being required
and like i said not now all young people should be able to do something
but not all certainly would be geared to even the the mormon boys that go out not all of them go
i mean it's disaster if they don't go
but but some of them are not
they're just not made to do that type of thing and they just aren't able to do it
so um yeah
but like i said requiring it would be uh
so what's uh things that you look for when you go out to dinner
oh i just like a nice quiet nice atmosphere and of course good food
um that sounds pretty
that's always that's always a concern but just a nice quiet easy place maybe candlelight something just to relax you know because i don't really go out to dinner that much
well we don't go out to dinner that much either
we try to get out maybe like once every month and a half or something like that
but i definitely want to go to a place that's nice and clean you know
um i've been to some that's been terrible
you know you see cockroaches crawling around and
but i try to get one that's nice and clean
and then i like to you know good food and good service
where you don't feel rushed you know and you can just relax and stay as long as you want
so is there some nice places to go to eat in plano
so we have quite a bit between us and there
it's about ten miles and there is all kinds of restaurants
and i had one that was a favorite for a long time
and then it changed hands and doubled the prices
and then it finally went out of business
so but it was really nice
um that sounds beautiful
and you could just really relax there and enjoy it
but it's gone
uh we have uh
anyhow we have only like one uh restaurant that's kind of nice
you know they have prime rib on uh weekends and then they have about six miles from here is called a little city called wesley
and they have a wesley hotel there that they serve food
and the atmosphere there is really really nice
oh that's nice
so and then if we really want to you know something different we go to modesto which is like twenty minutes away
but uh we don't have any fast foods here in this small city
well i have a son
but he's grown up
oh because i have a twelve year old that would eat a happy meal every night you know
and now's she's graduated to two cheeseburgers
but but um you know mcdonald's is definitely at the top of her list
and i hate these places
all the kids seem to love mcdonald's don't they you know
and i don't think there's an ounce of
well we have all kinds of fast foods everywhere around and it's really it's tempting when you come home from work
and you're tired
and you know you just are tempted to give in to that
and it costs a lot of money to do it too
you know it adds up
and it's not healthy
and i really got into that habit for a while
but i got out of it again because i just felt like it was just too unhealthy
well let's see what else can we talk about
oh it's foggy and cold here
i came from iowa when i was sixteen so i've lived out in california for a long long time
and you like it
so we used to have a lot more restaurants to go to there you know
but uh then i quit work and everything
and i bought a house
oh that would be fun
so right in chinatown so we went to lots of restaurants chinese restaurants
and they were really good
i really miss them you know
i just like to go in there and have a nice chinese dinner once in a while you know
but uh as far as missing living there no
it's close enough if i wanted to go there to san francisco for dinner or something why you know an hour and fifteen minutes we could be there and you know have dinner and then come on back
but uh have you ever been to california
well i have a twenty-one year old daughter in college there and she um is a world champion twirler and her coach is in california
so she went there for six years
so i went out a lot with her
and uh yeah
and i love it
and we tug back and forth who's going to move
but i think he's going to move because i'm the person with more to lose here
i have my twelve year old in school and she's happy
and i have my house
so i have too much to lose
and i have to admit that we just moved to plano recently and that i hadn't voted in an election yet
and although i did go down and register and i
has what's been your voting experience
i mean i
i i well personally i've been very diligent until recent years
for the issues that you know
i i also feel guilty uh not knowing and not going the extra mile myself and studying out the issues and studying out the candidates
but uh i have felt since i've been here that i haven't known what the issues were and that i because it was a new community
you really do have to study to get yourself uh up to par with what is truly going on and that takes a lot of research
and and people today are very busy
and uh and that is an excuse because we are we are always uh invo-
i know i'm heavily involved in other things and and to take time out and uh study the issues in depth would take quite a bit of time and i don't have the time to devote to that and uh you hopefully find that you want the candidates that are running to be honest and aboveboard
and unfortunately they are not
and uh it's really a dilemma uh that we find ourselves in i believe uh
because it is a task that is to me kind of overwhelming
and uh and uh i also feel especially in the presidential elections that uh since we're s- back on the old system of electoral votes and or that and that you don't necessarily your vote doesn't necessarily elect president
and it's kind of
and and it's hard to feel like one person
but i know that it's important
and i feel guilty that i haven't done that here haven't taken the time
and i know that you know people can make a difference
but it's hard to to face the corruption like you say and uh and to know what you're up against
and it makes me feel bad that
i mean i am thankful for the uh
and i hope that i will become a better make a better difference in
but i haven't done that so far
well i know that when you're in a smaller community
i live in mesquite and uh when we have uh a local election say for our mayor and so forth they really uh give a lot of information in the local newspaper not in the not in the bigger city dallas newspaper
i mean they they just give it a small portion of the newspaper
but the local newspaper really goes into uh quite a bit of history about the candidate and uh and then they have they raise a they raise two sides
and uh there's a pro and a con side and uh you can really uh feel comfortable in uh evaluating that uh candidate by uh that method
uh i feel pretty confident about the way it's put forth
now i wouldn't say that about the
uh i mean they've got people that are running that are admitted uh criminals and admitted
you know i'm sorry
but i don't believe in them turning a good uh uh a new leaf unless they have the lord that has done that to them
and uh without the lord they can't do it
and it's not very likely
i mean it seems like th-
well i believe that the um the voice that uh initialized this call asked about uh if we thought that it should be something that should be put into action
like the governme- if should the government make it universal or something like that
i i i i would be committed to that becau-
you you would be in favor of it
i know that there are many countries that uh are very successful with the operation of the government uh providing that plan
do they have options on who they uh you know like choices of doctors and that type of thing
um i'm not sure wha- how their program is run
but i know it has been successful
and i would really have to uh read the history of probably i uh the country that has fared very well with it
and i'd like to see the uh the data on that
and if you didn't have any choice on you know in who you go to
or to change even like if you didn't approve or didn't think you were getting good service
oh absolutely that the choice would be yours yes if you felt that you weren't being um given the proper guidelines for your health that you should be able to make um a choice there
i i have a friend that has their boy has been sick for several months
and they just have found out what's the trouble
and they have gone through uh one two three four five doctors and then a team of doctors
and they finally determined what the problem was
and the expense of that yes
and that that something like that you know i thought if you couldn't change or look elsewhere you know for help if you wer-
i don't know how that program works you know if you can do that
well i would i would think that they would have that as part part of the benefit to the health care program that you would indeed have a choice that you could select that individual yourself
and i'm sure that they would have a history of each doctor and hopefully that they would have their um accreditations there too
i guess that's that's primarily was one of my thoughts you know because you know how government is
but those guidelines have to be set up
and i think they should be voted on by the public
it it would
and of course they would give a full plan of what their intentions would be
and um i think that's primary uh for the health if they were going to have a universal health care plan
that uh they would have all the facts and the figures and uh what it would mean to each individual family or an id- individual perhaps being single
um i'm not sure what else that uh we could address uh on health care uh other than the fact i think uh the eyes and the ears and the uh whole self should be uh uh included in all of that
uh dental eye care and uh
um i wouldn't want to have to go for a private doctor for anything and not be covered by the program
i know where my son works they have uh an option right now where they can have their own physician
or they can choose one that their company has elected and that costs them less if they take the doctor that uh that the company has selected
and does he have an option uh if he doesn't care for the personality
well only to the point that he could go to somebody at his own expense
oh i see
otherwise he wo- you know he has to take the physician that uh and the hospital that the company has chosen as their you know the one they have taken
and there again i mean he's gotten good service
well if he's pleased with it i guess that's uh the bottom line
so but i i would be afraid of what would happen if you had a personality conflict or something
cause there's always that opposite story there
uh cause that's the first i've really known anybody that you know works for somebody that they had that option you know to make the choice of what kind of insurance policy they what kind of hospitalization they wanted to take
it's quite different from when i was uh under doctor's care that's for sure
i'm i'm very thankful that i'm not
uh we live in a rural area up here
what part of uh pennsylvania do you live in
uh are you familiar with any of the area that all
well i have a brother that lives there
uh near uh philadelphia
oh well that's that's a ways away
but we live in clarion county
uh we have a cousin that lives in philadelphia
so i'm a former michiganian
so i suppose really our situation here is even different that it is in you know like more populated areas as far as uh the doctors that are available
so uh we've been pretty fortunate
that is the fields that you know are opening up are um just phenomenal
i mean look at the aids uh case you know i mean they that's a whole new field in itself
it's just it's an auto immune deficiency but it sure is a dilly one
they uh they just don't seem to be
well there's guidelines that people have to follow
and if they're determined to uh have their cigarettes and the other uh carcinogenic causing items then how do you teach them
but a maj- a lot of them don't do these things even
and it doesn't seem to matter
so uh it rea-
i i i really believe our environment have a lot to do with it
well they say second hand smoke and that is worse than smoking
so so what do you do you know
well you just have to ban the smoking to their to their little room that they want to
so i haven't ever had that problem as far as that goes
so i can't take any credit for not smoking even
well it's a bad habit that's tha-
well it was nice talking with you
and you have a good day
and well you do the same
and uh we'll be t- i guess talking around the country
uh kate what kind of uh where do you like to eat out
well we uh we really like the mexican food you know here in texas and uh so we try and go around to different mexican restaurants trying them out
and so uh tia's is probably our favorite uh restaurant there
and i think they have one of the best services that uh that we really like it
it's where skillman uh curves into forest lane and it's real good mexican food
another real good one is uh rafael's down on mckinney avenue
oh that uh
we haven't explored uh you know too many places
um you know lot of the big name brand i guess uh chains yeah
but um oh we've tried places you know down uh by the collin creek mall
the uh you know alvarez
and um gosh we tried what was across the street el paso's el chico's or something
oh el chico's or el fenix one
something something like that
well i like tia's better than i do el chico's or el fenix
uh much better
uh mother mesquite's is one of our favorites
but then fajitas are one of my uh
i like it better than just about anything and they make very good fajitas there in their own uh homemade flour tortillas that are just absolutely wonderful
oh i know
i tell i tell you what
they are they just um they're excellent uh excellent food
well what else do you like
well i love uh i love seafood and i notice they have like the you know the louisiana purchase um
razzoo's has opened up down you know off of um um oh close to six thirty-five
now i haven't eaten there
but uh the service has always been so strange every time i've been in there
mostly it's been at lunch time and uh but i hear at night though they have uh you know the outdoor um bar
and um uh that's it's really uh you know kind of lively
so it's it's really good all their blackened grill stuff
oh i we like uh uh for the cajun the spicy we like atchafalaya's out on belt line in addison and it's a good restaurant
oh well that sounds great
and fish for one of the best fish restaurants in town is either vincent's there in plano or uh i believe it's a rusty scupper over on uh uh dallas parkway in addison which is absolutely wonderful
they have every kind of fish that you could imagine you'd want and the the atmosphere is wonderful too
oh well i uh i have children and and work
and so we uh we can eat a lot of fast food
fast food well i can understand that
and we had a lot of mcdonalds when they were first coming out
i i know
i i'm so sick of mcdonalds
and we used to eat there we used to eat there all the time
and so now we we we branch out at this wendy's or
oh and and cheap too
but but the kids they've got those expensive tastes
so uh they like tia's
so they can sit down and all that good kind of stuff
they they they're just spoiled rotten
i uh uh we love to eat out
so we uh we usually eat out generally two or three times a week
well it's just my husband and i
and it's either t v dinners at home or we go out to eat
and i would much rather go out to eat than t v dinners
oh me too
so i know uh i i know that i uh you know i just work
and i'm just tired when i get home
and i i just don't feel like cooking
and uh you know on the weekends there's always things to do
and uh so we like to go out to lunch on saturdays especially
now i we've been there twice and and both times i just oh the food just didn't quite settle with me and i don't know what it was
oh now that's surprising because normally they're just they're real good
and i love
i like because they they're even if they're crowded they're fast service you know
um don't have to wait forever for a table
and we also like owens uh country sausa-
now i haven't been there befo-
i went to one i think in ohio or or or somewhere up there
but i've never been to that one here
so now have you been to applebee's
and we like applebee's
i i really like that too
so that was uh
it it's fun
i like your up there in plano that uh country steak house
i've been i've been there twice
and they have we go for the salad bar
and i've been very lucky
i go to school i mean i go to work early
well that's nice
so my mom comes over in the morning and gets her ready for her school or just hangs by while she gets ready drives her to school
so i'm very very lucky
well how old um does a child have to be before you have to you get to stop making arrangements for him i wonder
well i could do it now
but she gets lonely in the morning
and i feel better
um she has a crazy father out there somewhere that i just don't let her out of my sight
so um you never know
well and um it's nice for them not to be alone
she feels that way you know
and we have a neighbor on the next block that she could always walk over there and go to school with
but we just feel better doing it this way
we we were about to stop one day this year
and then her father called the school and made all kinds of threats
and so we didn't stop
so even though she's twelve she's still a kid
so you got to be careful
well i'm glad you have that um opportunity to have your mom
i'm i'm glad too
well i i have two kids and uh five and six a girl and a boy
and um so far i haven't had to make a lot of child care arrangements for them because um i'm at home now full time
but um when i was going to school i would go to school a time that my husband wasn't you know when he was at home so that we would just switch back and forth like that
but um it's really scary
and i would really hate to be in a position to have to find child care
well i would too because even though a place can look pretty good on the outside we're finding out now that it's not always on the inside and i i just don't know what i would do if i had to do that
and they provide child care
and of course they charge for it but at least all the nurses can leave their children
and they're always watching them
and they feel a little better than if they dropped them off somewhere on the way
well that's nice
and i know that i have um done some babysitting myself
and i know how i feel how i felt as a provider of child care that even though you're you're taking care of someone else's child and you're forcing yourself to you know treat them equally and you know better usually better than your own um it's not the same
well that's right
and it made me realize that um no one will love your child as much as you and your mother your
and um the family
and no one will look out after them
and i just think um so far i think my preference would be rather than to have like a oh a big day care
that um what is that like child kinder care and things like that
and it was hard to treat her equally with my child
and they played together
and they were good friends
but like you said you tend to go more for the other one's side just because you are responsible
and so it it got hard
and um it just wasn't the same as when they were just playing as friends because she had to be there every day
so i stopped that after a year because it was difficult to balance it
and i know um when i pick my kids up from school they want to come home
and i and i would hate for them to have be picked up by a day care and be taken to another large group situation
so i think uh my preference would be a small small if i had to find day care would be a small someone that i knew
and i know that some parents they both do have to work
but a lot of people where i live are working just because they want bigger and better
and i would never do that
and i just never would do it
well that's true because even now when they're gone to school it seems like there's just not enough time left over
and uh by the time they have to eat and have homework and they want some free time
and there's just not enough to time in the day to do anything good quality for them
but that's really
uh i really haven't thought about the topic of drug testing
but uh just off the top of my head i i don't think i see much wrong with it
um if i owned a company and i wanted to make sure that it was run smoothly and that the people that i had uh coming in uh were trust worthy et cetera and so on i think i would i would uh probably do the random testing just to insure that my company uh runs safely and smoothly
um i i also haven't thought too much about it
uh but i suspect it it very much depends upon the job
and it's it's it's if it's not affecting someone's performance then i'm not sure if it's a problem
if if it's a position where it could potentially affect
if if if
uh if someone's working on heavy machinery
or say driving trucks or buses city buses or something like that
then that is something that affects the that affects the community
you know if you're you're drinking or on drugs or whatever you're driving a city bus you taking several lives in your hands
and then if you're a computer operator and uh there's really no big deal
i think you know
and for me i think that drug testing it follows the path that society is going in
i mean it's just it's just where society is right now
and you know something we have to cope with
and i think the drug testing is something that the drug users have to cope with
well i think it may it may that's in in that respect i think it may help a lot
i think it may be pushing people hopefully push people away from drug use
if they no that you know
of course i think um i'm not sure you know what the time span is
but i mean if i used drugs last week and i had a you know job interview that i wouldn't use drugs the day before or something
and they wouldn't even see it
i don't know what the you know limits are
i don't i don't actually know how long those things stay in the blood in the system
i've heard some i've heard some things will stay there for six months
you get flashbacks for uh forever
i i i guess so
i mean there must be some some something
i mean people get these little flashback things you know
so i don't really know
i mean i don't use any drugs
so i'm pretty uh uh i guess decisive about that
well see if you actually used drugs at all
and i'm i'm at at most a social drinker
so it's never a problem
so the only thing i would hate is if i were to go and uh
i mean it's kind of the same thing with the lie detector test
you know but people that
you know don't have anything to hide
and then there are some things that just aren't peoples business
that that that
so i think that a lot of people have trouble with that
i can i can understand that
i mean uh that's really
do you uh
do you worry about you know this or that
i mean you know what about the rights
but they would rather have it private
like especially in the case of drinking
you know if someone is something more than a social drinker shall we say yet they're not an alcoholic what do you do
i mean i took a lie detector once
and i didn't mind it
but i was just offended by some of the questions i guess
i mean there was one question do you like your mother
and i was going you know
well those are just
those are just to get probably to get some sort of those are to get the shock value out of you
or just to see
i do some i'm a graduate student in psych
and we sort of you know figure out
um i know a little bit about that kind of stuff
what they're trying to do there is they want to sort of get a base line measure for you you know
how is it that when you see these things and you know
and and and
kind of get
but with them they have no idea if you're just sort of jumping
but i guess i don't know some people have probably killed their mothers
well i guess so
i mean i guess i don't know how what actually happens if uh if you have killed your mother
and i don't think that you killed your mother though
i don't think that some i mean there are some people i mean
because in society a lot of people are taking drugs
but they take a lie detector test or a drug test or whatever
and the stuff that happened to them you know five years ago comes up
and it spoils their chances for just making it a little better
you know when they might be actually trying to
that's uh you know it it could blow things right away for them you know
unless they say well look unless they walk in they could walk in and say look i did do drugs a year ago
and i'm off them for a year now
but it will show up positive
and i would probably bring something in showing that i had been to such and such hospital for help or you know
or whatever it is that they do
because i mean then although then they can't legally discriminate i think on the basis
but i don't really know
i don't i don't
but it's an interesting topic that i never actually thought about
the other day we had talked about uh capital punishment
and i really really hadn't thought about it
i mean i think about it because i hear about it
but i hadn't had to sit down and and well what do i think about it
you know and that's kind of like today
i'm kind of you know in the middle on that one
well these are tough
so i think that's real good
well i think we pay too much in taxes
well i think they waste what we pay
i think they waste what all the money that we pay
i don't know how you feel um
and that particular state had an occupational income tax but no sales tax
and what you find out is there's one evil is the same as the other
here you don't there's no occupational tax
but it's a heavy sales tax
so they get you coming and going
now it's even it's even higher in dallas county
it's really i know it's just um
and the man said and that's eight percent
so it's really kind of sad
and then i don't know how you know in terms of when you all do your federal
but it just seems like if you're strictly middle income it seems like you get hit the worst
because it's at some point it goes up to thirty-three percent
and then the people that make you know five hundred thousand dollars and and and higher than that they don't have to pay
and sometimes they have to pay even less taxes
and i don't know somehow get a huh
oh i thought you were going to say something
the things that we can't you know
that make don't make that kind of money
i mean if they're in business and and they're making money
but they're making money then they should pay taxes then
and just somehow it doesn't seem you know
and then i you
mean you look at like uh that country singer uh what's his name willie nelson
i was reading about him in the paper and i said well you know he knew he was making money
some he didn't look that stupid
why didn't he pay his taxes you know
in a way it's almost like he had so much debt that uh filing bankruptcy was a way to get out of all of it you know
so do you file federal or joint income tax
or do you
and do you feel like you get hit by you know too much
so i'm single again
so and you know it's it's a lot worse for single people because they pay the same amount as as the people that make the same amount of money and they're married
and we right now we don't own any property
so we're in the same
so we're in the same kind of
but it's sort of like if you have like x point five children and earn you know you kind of get hit with you know
i i mean it doesn't even pay for me to earn a good wage because
but i mean there's actually less tax implication if i don't work full time compared to what my husband does you know
so it's kind of hard
if both of the both of the spouses work then you get a tax credit for that
yeah otherwise you're just you know
and if you have kids you get like seven hundred fifty dollars or something
well it's two thousand now
oh it is
well that's not too bad
then you get a you get a child care exemption
but it's not enough you know
i mean you pay from fifty to a hundred dollars a week in child care and and they only give you like i think it's about five or ten percent of that
oh my goodness
you know it doesn't even it's not even
well it was nice talking to you
oh you are
oh are you really
um the south hills area beaver county well originally beaver county
and uh where are you from
uh clarion county
i li- we live out in the country
we have we have two children that live in pittsburgh
i'm i'm talking to you from dallas right now
oh oh you are
do you work do you work for texas instruments then
and who how about you
my son works for a c- a computer
place that that needed this
uh federal company you know
well that's okay
so you're f- you have a big
oh that's a
uh we have a big old farmhouse that we've you know remodeled
it had been you know of course a farm
is it a is it a working farm
or is it
that's probably what i would uh
but you know
but we don't farm
i hear the
we live uh we lived in minneapolis for about five years
we we originally lived in dallas
and we met and got married and then um actually married in pittsburgh
and that's that's not what they want to hear on this call uh at any rate we came back here with
my husband was transferred around uh up to minnesota and now back to texas with t i and we're leasing a uh two story town home in a section of dallas they call north dallas
and it's uh near a little town called plano
well it's not little any more
he he's living now up uh in in maryland
but uh he
that's why we not sure we we're not sure we want to uh buy down here because we actually we lived up north long enough to appreciate the um
minneapolis-saint paul is very clean you know in terms of
and in terms of housing down here um you really have your pick
but it's just everything's overpriced for the economy
oh it's terrible
i mean we're we're in a leased town home
and it's uh you're probably your teeth will probably fall out figuratively speaking it's nine hundred a month
oh i'm not surprised
but you know what
if you if you get anything under five hundred you get into what they call high density living you know the big apartment complexes and and i just have no tolerance for that
and the people think the income is really great in some of those areas
but when they sit down and look at what it costs to live and uh
they're uh done up fairly nice uh
but like the town home we're in i don't know how i mean we
this is it's like a duplex
like a two by two they call it like in pittsburgh
and it's nice
but it's i mean the girl bought it for a hundred and ten
and now she can't sell it
and our neighbors
well prices have come down on the homes the duplexes
i mean we'll our neighbors the attached on the other side they're very nice thank god
oh my heaven
well i know up in connecticut the same thing happened
and uh it's
and it's really really bad
but we like our area
it like i said it's it's an old house and everything but uh
how far where is clarion county in relation to actually
because we're considering moving to pennsylvania
and it's it's really not you know not that far
are you going up toward uh uh
so you're you're not that far north then
well you're really not too bad
um was it a home that you've had for quite a f- few years
or that you've
well we've been here since sixty-six
oh then you have
uh we have fifty acres
oh pardon me
and and towns keep creeping closer and closer you know
i think that that's um
this has to do with homes uh indirectly
but i can remember when upper saint clair was out in the you know
and now it's
oh well that's okay um
but we but we live about ten miles from probably three or four not large towns but you know reasonable
but but sub-
substantially you know
um do you like living in an older home and restoring it like that
we we don't want to do too much more
uh oh golly
well how many rooms do you think
we have uh uh four rooms downstairs and a pantry and upstairs we have a bath a bath oh
that's that's large if your children aren't at home any more
well it really isn't too big yet
we we li-
so and they've all moved
well we've got um
th- this town house is pretty big
it's got three bedrooms two and a half baths um it's really nice
well it sounds like a good buy
i mean i would never buy it
but leasing it is fine
um but it's just again the the privacy you know
um we had a house in minneapolis that was on three acres
and my husband was raised um on a working farm near dayt-
oh that makes a big difference
and he said you know
he's he's slowly getting me to um not feel isolated if we move t- to where there's more land
but yet you can have your friends uh
that's kind of what like
his parents have uh land that they retired to um about a hundred miles out of atlanta and in georgia
and it is too far south for me
but um um but i mean they have one of the um
but they built one of these
i mean it's just beautiful
it's like a custom you know it's not like what i would think of when i think of old log cabins
you know i mean it's modern
it's country it's you know um
but uh i don't
what else about housing except it's uh well
pittsburgh's housing economy i- i- i think it's holding it's own
what part what sections are they in
uh in the mount lebanon area
and uh the one the one boy the house they bought is completely livable
the other one is uh uh has you know needs more work done
and but they have two children too
and they they bought what they could afford
and they've been in their house oh probably about twelve years now and um it's it's you know
they're s- going to start to see their return on their investment very soon
um but it's a beautiful home
i mean my brother lives
i mean he lives all in that same area going from mount lebanon um
and the neighborhoods are stable you know
you wou- you do when you mo-
when we first got married uh
and we moved once a year usually
oh my goodness
and then after they had to start paying to move us
that's why we're at a point now we've uh we're adopting
and we have been married ten plus years
and what happens is uh you just realize that once you get to a certain age the next house that you get
so we're considering pennsylvania
and we're just kind of you know toying with what exactly where we want to be you know
and but i disagree with that
you know they buy a place
and they just hate the area
and it and the economy here in dallas i mean it it's steady
but it's still not going up
and i um i just refuse to buy it um if i know i'm not going to be there for at least five years uh you you know
well my brother they're having trouble selling their home see
oh i'm sure
there i mean you can go down a street
and here he told you this every other house you know if it's been foreclosed on or you know even big executives um it's really i mean
a- and and it's hard to sell the properties
and they thought they were getting a great deal um because they could get a five hundred thousand dollar home with they call it zero lot lines no property
and it would make you ill to see this
i mean it would probably be like your house on uh you know a half a city block in pittsburgh or something
i i couldn't handle that
and that's you know like
you know it's across the way
and it's landscaped and all that with azaleas
but it's still it's still not that private
i get tired uh sometimes mowing
but you have a rider
and i do get tired of that
but uh i don't know
and your kids have
to tell you the truth um i think that if you can keep that that way you know kind of like a homestead
and uh like when i'm at home since
and i'll say i'm a homemaker since that's my basic thing uh
and uh in the summertime i wear cotton tops
and in the winter i wear uh like sweaters
and so i do that
but when i go out for meetings
and i have a couple of pantsuits because those are real in at this time
but that's basically what i do
well i think our tastes are fairly sim- similar
i'm uh a scientist
so that technically
i suppose i could get away with with extremely casual clothes
but for the most port part i don't
and and a pantsuit of one sort or another
and uh i guess dress it up with a with a a very nice black jacket when i have have visitors or have to give talks
well that sounds nice
uh it said the seasons
do do you change much through the season
actually i guess this summer i i wore some fairly nice jeans uh more than i have in previous seasons
but uh no
i tend to to use the same things because actually our offices are very cold in summer
i don't know whether they think by you know freezing them up overnight then they can save electricity during the day or something
i don't i don't i you know i'm not a clothes horse in the sense that some of my friends
and i guess although in as i recall the stereotype of of secretaries was you know overdress over kill sort of and in a s- in a sense the people i know who spend the most on clothes are secretaries
although the fact that most of the ones i know are in the government and they're not meeting the public it i find it a little bit strange that their priorities would would be to spend this money here
i mean i suppose if you were a a more a receptionist and meeting the public and it was the image of your company at stake perhaps you would have to dress up
uh well i don't have the resources to just go out and buy buy buy anyway
and so my don't change dramatically over the years
but basically i'm a a pretty much the same
and in the wintertime i change to the sweaters
and so it's not a whole lot of of change for me either
and uh especially when i go to the meetings and wear the dresses
i i i enjoy that
but it just wouldn't be uh smart for me to do that in my home with my children
so i have to uh
i have given seminars before in in creative writing and things like that
now i don't know if they consider that a job
i don't really get paid for that uh often
but uh when i do that then i i think i become more businesslike
uh but it doesn't really change my clothing style
i mean you can look businesslike in in a pant- the same pant suit you would you know wear for other things
i'm i'm really glad about that pant suits are popular because i'm allergic to many of the synthetics
and so i used to have a problem when when i was working in a restaurant while i was in college and had to dress up and nylons and things like that would just give me a terrible rash
but otherwise now i'm i guess we're both pretty practical
well it's been great talking to you
well have a good day
well uh i'm i'm certainly under the uh uh the influence of the idea that that the government needs to have less control on what uh what the citizens do
although i do see this as a uh something that definitely needs to be taken care of
whether that whether that should be put in the hands of the corporation or the the hands of the hands of the government is a you know a a different question i think as far as i'm concerned
in in other words i am fa- in favor of drug contro- or or or drug testing
uh i was drug tested when i came to my job here at t i
yet but but at the same time i don't think uh that should be governed by by the government uh per se
i think that the corporations should uh do all that
they should uh have drug screening before they hire an employee
and uh any time that an employee
like if they're coming to late work all the time and uh if they if they're especially if there's they're on the line or any kind of sensitive job where you know if they can if they made a mistake it would cost a lot of money or or people's lives
i i agree with you
i you know i would even think that uh uh i could in theory take that a l- a you know a step further and say anybody in any job you know if the corporation felt like uh b- b-
and this is why i mean uh drugs are
i mean i- th- it's what drives crime
it's what drives uh uh any sort of of uh uh pain and discomfort in the world or in america i think is some- is somewhat uh uh driven by drugs
and i think that uh were corporations and uh private industry to take uh take command in this situation that maybe maybe we might have some some control over that
we you know
if you can't work then you can't
course that might up crime you know when uh people go in and steal your television and ste- and sell it just because they can't they can't work anymore you know
but you got to have a a safe work place
you you're definitely right
that uh you can't you can't have it any other way
uh you know whether
if it's a policeman and he's working with uh the public and he has a and has a gun in his holster or or even you know if it's a guy at mcdonald's cooking a burger i think
what what do you think uh
what percentage of of corporations and uh private industry do you think use uh drug testing
i think it's it's more frequent now
because uh all the jobs that i've applied for have uh mentioned some type of drug screening
uh i work at sears
and i just do warehouse work
and did they give you drug testing
but now they they uh they issued a statement about that about three months ago
oh so are they going to uh begin spontaneous uh drug testing
uh not that i know of
it was more about uh all the people's problems
like they've been laying off a lot of people
and uh and uh they sent out the employee assistance cards for anyone that had any sort of drug problem or work related problem
family problems you know
but i know they have a lot of drug problems
what do you think about uh you know
something that kind of concerns me is uh y- you know you and i are tested for for whatever work we happen to do
because because a lot of them are you know they're hypocritical
they they talk against drugs and then they get caught you know
whether it's drugs or any other kind of uh
like the the money laundering scams all that was drug related
so and that cost us the country you know billions of dollars
i i can't see i can't see how we can expect the you know uh uh people working in the in in america to uh to put any trust into our political officials if they don't you know uh
just doesn't make sense to have them
i have a couple of credit cards and uh use them
oh we try not to
or we use credit cards also if we want to get an extended warranty on an item that we're purchasing
oh well that's an idea
so so yes
and basically we use it mainly when we're traveling or out of state or or somewhere where you know they don't take local they don't take out of state checks and so when we're traveling some
uh we do use them
uh we try not to
but he he's one who believes in credit cards
and he uses them quite a bit
he he likes that
well that's that's a good thing because lot of people don't pay at the end of the month and they just pay the minimum required balance
and that's when you get into expenses
and you get in over your head
and say well i'm going to buy this when it's good and on sale
and then i can go ahead and pay for it when i get my check at the end of the month
well sometimes you do come on bargains and that
and it's really useful
and some places won't take you know like personal checks or cash even but they would take a credit card
how a- how are the laws in pennsylvania uh as as regard well not the laws but the rates credit card rates in pennsylvania
so we don't deal where they do that
we cha- you know we go to places where they don't charge extra
like the gas stations more
and uh we just try to avoid you know the ones that do that
we just don't uh go there because there's enough other ones around that don't charge you anything
extra because actually to me credit cards are the same as cash
and and so that the end of the month or when you get your credit card bill are you saying that that way you're not left stranded and high and dry
you're you're one of the good i guess good faithful shoppers that don't get into a problem when it comes to budgeting their money
well i can't say we never have
now we have you know at times made payments
but we try not to
so i think that there's a great advantage to a credit card in those situations
because sometimes uh there's times when you may maybe couldn't take advantage of something but with a credit card you can
um do you have uh multiple credit cards
and do you find that advantageous
well i think we're narrowing it down actually
uh uh like i said my husband likes them
and we have quite a few
but we really get when you get down to the nitty gritty there's probably three that we use most of the time
we're we're actually in the same boat
we like to use three uh basic credit cards
and we don't have an awful lot of expenses or surprises when it comes the end of the month
and do you find that you get an awful lot of credit card applications through the mail
or three times a week
well it's not every week
but you you do get them
but i re- i really don't like it the charges that you know
we try to limit look at that also
so the annual fee
what they charge per year to use our money you know they're charging us to spend our money
and i i'm not real crazy about that
so we try to look at that also
so there is the basic annual fee for the credit card plus they charge any where from seventeen to twenty-three percent uh based upon what the state will allow
did you hear the questions that the lady uh brought up
such as how much time well
and how many do you have
and with we have uh
so we see them at least once a week
and we see our son and his wife
and uh we baby-sit quite frequently
so we're a fairly close-knit family
and uh and of course with the holidays and everything
well you're very fortunate
and my oldest daughter lives in amsterdam holland
so it's kind of hard for us to visit with them as much as i'd like to
because we've we one thing we do have together is we're both musicians
she is a a a concert uh harpsichordist
and uh her husband builds forte pianos
and uh that's why they're over there
and then i have a a son who lives in uh
and i get to see him maybe once every three months
so i really we've lost you know
i'd like to have an everyday contact with children uh as well as you do for that matter
and my young my youngest daughter lives in new jersey
oh you don't get to see any of yours very often
and so they i don't hardly get to see any of them
she works in these um
they work uh they're really both um
what do you what activities do you do with your children when you are together
oh most the time
well right now it's football season
and our daughter is a big cowboy fan
so my husband
so she watches that
and i play with the grandchildren
but now like last weekend um there's the soviet space exhibit is here in dallas
and it ends
uh in january
so she and and the three boys and my husband and i went over into fort worth to see the space exhibit
and this sunday
oh it's been here for quite uh some time
it's very interesting very interesting
and it's been very well done
uh and this uh next sunday they're coming over after the cowboy game
uh we're going to go take the boys to see christmas lights and go to a santa's village
and uh then when our son's over we have a pool
and he and his wife come and a lot of their friends
and we have cookouts on sunday uh
well that sounds like you have really wonderful activities that keep you together
and uh we we do a lot with with our kids
and we we always have
uh we're very family oriented
well that's wonderful
and the kids seem to enjoy being with us
and their friends enjoy being with us
so which that keeps us very very young with all these young people passing in and out and eating
and seems like i've
well it does
and then they all end up spending the night christmas eve night so that
but they're all
and uh then have christmas dinner with us and then go to other in-laws and things
so we see a lot of them
but we enjoy christmas eve night because they all start arriving by about eleven o'clock
and we open presents about five o'clock christmas
and you know and uh then
and my sister and and her husband are coming down
so there's going to be eleven of us for christmas
and you seem to be making out all right
wh- what do you think of uh of the current trends of how other people spend time with their children and so forth
oh i i think the trends are going back to spending more time with families
i think parents are definitely uh spending more and more time
i don't think they're leaving them with baby-sitters you know
i think i think family quality time is becoming much more important than it was there for about uh i don't know eight or nine years
of of course i find now that i spend more time with my grandchildren in detail
i know more about them and watch their growth and how they improve and and learn much more so than my own kids
when when your own children are growing up you just take them for granted
and you go ahead and do your thing
so i'm going to have difficulty with this topic
but uh what kinds of things do you and your family do
um well we go out and fly kites
and we go fishing
and we go to movies
and we go out to the farm
and and uh she likes to pick flowers and look at birds
um then your kind family is probably pretty rare now a days
well i'm divorced
but that's what
and we color a lot
and i read her stories
you know whether their parents are together or divorced they don't spend enough time together
and and i think that contributes to a lot of why society is going downhill right now is because the basic family unit is being destroyed
and uh because that i think that when you spend a lot of time with each other you communicate a lot
and the communication helps you build on your uh helps just just build your family
that's pretty to me that's pretty rare
whenever i do have children i i'm going to try as hard as i can to s- see that we spend a lot of time together you know
you know that's good sometimes because you need to you know get away
but um i don't think you you should spend too much time outside at the detriment of of losing your fam- the family unit
because then you never get to know them either
and as i understand it
you know kids these days are growing up so much faster
and once they hit like ten or eleven or twelve you know you've pretty much lost them
so um do you think that you do you think that your family is pretty rare in that you do a lot of things or just the relationship between you and your daughter
i really do because because i don't see many others
and when whenever we go to the park or something sometimes on the weekdays we'll see other families
but not usually on the weekends
what do you think is the key to to just bringing the american family back together
well i think they can turn off the t v for one thing
and and go out and do stuff you know
because she always likes to do things whenever the t v off
you know she'll forget about the t v completely
huh i think that's the first thing a lot of people do
and i know i'm guilty of it
like i came in from work today
and i like to watch 'em
but i think that's that is a big problem the television
and it's it's too static you know
but there's no thinking involved no motion you know
and i think think that's another reason why people are uh so health conscious now is because america's becoming really a couch potato society
you know people aren't doing anything just sitting around you know no thinking involved
and now i think i think people are trying to get out of that
and that um there's a lot of
and that people are you know starting to look out for cholesterol and things like that trying to get out and workout more often and jog and walk and different things like that
and that's probably good you know
that's also something you know family oriented that everyone can do
but when was uh when she was here last summer we played tennis
but she hasn't brought her tennis racquet over lately
how how old is she
um well she has
we we just been hitting the ball on the ground
and then we kick the ball
well it was very nice talking to you
so you like to fish huh
but i like to fish
and there's a lot of lakes around here
uh are there many lakes up there
we actu- uh we have the those little the the the great lakes you know
plus we're in what's called the finger lake region of new york
and these are uh real good uh for like you know bass fishing and so forth
we have a qui- actually quite a lot of variety
there's uh there's
we have large mouth small mouth uh sort of musky pike stuff like that
you know all sorts of fun stuff like that
uh we have a pretty large bass masters tournament actually takes place right on lake ontario every year
so it's it's that's a lot of fun
do you like what do you like to go for
oh it's it's uh
but i hardly ever catch one
but uh uh they have a tail race over in lake lavon and uh you know they wash when they open up the dam and let out water they wash down the fish
and uh you catch that white bass and crappie out of there
we have uh some friends who live on the lake and it the lake it just seems is is completely filled with bass to the point where you know normally you go y- y- go fishing for bass you get a lot of sunfish or or cat or whatever and some other strange stuff
but in this particular lake we went out with some friends once
and we just every time you tossed the line in you pull up a five six seven inch minimum bass
and usually you pull up you know
it's a real it's a real enjoyable experience to go fishing there because we just we pull up you know bass after bass
during perch season as well you pull up a lot of uh
probably during during perch season the perch will run in very large schools
so what they'll do is j-
you'll you'll be sort of boating around
and they'll be boating around
and they'll hit a they'll hit a school of perches in the middle and when they do you can just drop the lines in and just pull them in one at
they they just drop it in
what do you what do you catch perch on
uh i they actually they
according to them you can catch when the perch are running you can catch them on just about anything
but you know i've
she told me that they will sometimes use corn or anything you know
they'll they'll they'll hit because they're just sort of surrounded these large schools
but uh uh some fish steal it off the hook sometimes
uh the other day i was fishing with bread uh
there's a college across the street and they
it's it's full of carp and uh i caught a carp on a about what size is that uh i think it was a number two treble hook
and it's huge
its its mouth was full of hooks
so he was in a bad way
but uh it's
well it's uh it was sixteen inches long
wow that's that's that's a nice size carp
i think it was about a pound and a half you know
but all they're good for is the fight
boy they d- they really don't want to come out of the water
they they zip through the water you know
you're how your line goes you know and i thought you know that uh i wasn't going to be able to get it in because uh the one i hooked just about ten minutes before when i tried to raise it out of the water it fell off
so it wasn't hooked very well
but you know i got it that far
i figured that uh
that that that counts
and he laughed when it fell off
and i said that's a quick release right there
do you like eat the fish that you catch
or are you more of a sport fisherman
uh catfish yeah
but uh i haven't eaten anything else you know
uh there's some uh
and my uncle has a a pond upstream
and there's a lot of crappie in there now
but uh i think he's the only one that's that's caught enough crappie or a big enough crappie to eat
but the catfish there's you know there's hundreds of them from like two to six pounds and that
so you can just oh
because i don't actually like fish
so when i fish it's more for sport than anything else
and if you know
when you when you have to look in their eyes and you know hit them in the head or whatever that's what you do with a catfish you know because you have to sever their spinal cord
and and and and and be careful you don't get stung
have you ever tried uh deep sea fishing
uh not yet
my brother went off the coast of maine uh
he he said that it was just like that
they were throwing like uh uh hell benders or uh uh some other kind of treble hook lure
and and uh each time they bring them in they'd have at least one
sometimes they've had two on you know one on every hook
we i was out in florida with a friend a while ago
and we would go and just uh drop two you know a a two or three rig two or three hooked rig as well down off a boat
and the captain had you know some kind of sonar in the boat so he'd maneuver us into a school of fish
and you just drop it in and
you you get one or two at a shot you know
it was it was a like twenty dollars for six hours of fishing on some big charter boat
you know and and and they'll clean your fish on a tip basis for you if you want
well this is
this this this was for a you know large
we we weren't all related just you know thirty people off the shop in the boat there
but this is great because it was i think it was nineteen dollars for five hours and twenty dollars for six hours or something
so you'd get to go out there for five- for for six hours and get a nice suntan and bring along some lunch and
well i i don't know if it's been five minutes yet or not
um i'm i'm relatively satisfied with the benefits i have
i think that um our health insurance is terribly expensive
but um you know that's that's my major complaints i guess
and a lot of times they turn down your claims
so that leaves you paying for all of it
or or maybe that it's not understood what should be covered and what isn't
it's the type that if you go to a certain doctor then uh you just pay ten dollars
and then uh the insurance pays the rest of the bill
or if you go outside you get uh seventy thirty
but what i found recently is what they've been doing is they they poll somehow the area
and then they have what they consider a justifiable price for the area where your doctor is located based on zip code
and so recently when when we had a claim um they didn't pay the eighty-five percent they paid much lower
and when i called they said oh well that's because your doctor is charging much more than the norm for the area
and i was really surprised because either there aren't that many of that type of doctor within that zip code so that you know two doctors could balance each other out or their you know their statistics aren't very accurate
and and they're probably doing it to their benefit anyway
but it's it's difficult
what about other other benefits
well i work for sears
and and um that's about the the only real benefit you have is health insurance
well you have vacation i mea-
but everybody gets vacation
i mean like uh t i and some other places you know they have so- recreational facilities
and they have a driving range and weight room
and you know i think they even have a swimming pool and i don't know if they have any tennis courts or anything like that
but you know to me vacation
and i mean different places have different amounts of vacation i would assume
and um you know the leniency with which they let you take leave without pay perhaps or um
and some places just sort of believe you
um ours is based on number of days
and you know people try to build them up in case they really do get seriously ill
but um otherwise i'm not aware of any problems with the benefits around here
so maybe that covers the topic then
well i don't know the work- the working conditions you know if you could include that in benefits
and and some places don't compensate you for the hazards that you that you have to work under
or maybe a ben- uh not really a benefit either but would be the allowing you to use the telephone for personal calls
um but you know i suppose some places are are more stringent about that than others
and and maybe arriving late or something like that you know
how how they enforce the rules
but other than that i don't have much feeling for
since like i said um i don't have a big problem with with them
um work- workmen's comp is a big thing now in in texas because um um how much it costs the employers and a a lot of them are going to their own insurance now
and it reduces some of the length of the benefits and uh and i don't know besides that
but i i noticed right off that was a year less than what the state was allowing
oh i i didn't know that somebody could avoid workmen's compensation
well well they still have to pay it
but they buy their own instead of going through the state
oh i see
so apparently it costs less that way
i suppose that whenever companies can avoid um benefits it's to the to to the benefit of the company
but i would think they would get a much greater turnover
and that people would be dissatisfied
that's what i what i think
the- they should be able they should be able to judge their benefits on how happy their employees are
and how much profit they're making
and then have everybody be unhappy and and have a constant turnover of people
i mean sure the payroll is lower that way
but i would assume that the productivity is way down also
if they have to train the same employee a new employee every six months then i don't see how they can save money
you know and once they once they get somebody good they ought to hang onto them
well thank you for calling
well she lives in utah
so well i guess we're going to talk about children today
so you ready
they're they're all out on their own
so uh do you want to start first
yo- yo- do you work
but i know that it's very difficult to to find good help sometimes when and especially when your when you want your children to be taken care of
um you know there's a
and and um there's a big controversy whether they should have to um have a a l- a law to have them certified or or not
and um you know there's pros and cons on both side of that because if they were then you kind of know that they had to go through some kind of testing
or some kind of something to be on get an okay seal
but yet most of the problems we hear
but maybe we don't hear about the other ones though that could be
you know the individual incidence or something
uh now usually when i have someone tend um
oh well he's plenty big enough then
he's he's very good
um but um
and they did a good job
um but i've never had to leave them like in a day care center
and i've been very lucky just be able to stay home
i i worked four years one time
but my last two children were uh both entering high school age
and uh they were of course gone while i was w- working
so it wasn't a problem i saw
and i stayed home the rest of the time
i so i didn't have that problem either
now i have i
and they've been in day care uh
it it's difficult
but yet she's the type of person that i don't know if she'd be happy staying at home
well some people aren't
she she surprised me though
she's done a lot of things that i never thought she would do you know with
oh is that
and uh sh- they've used the day care most of the time
and uh she she also had a small child she brought with her
and it did not work out uh at all
it she thought it was going to
but uh i- th- the lady called
and her baby wasn't very old at the time and said she was having trouble
and this baby is the
and and she was having problems with her
and so she called and said things were okay settled down and was all right
well my daughter decided to call them and check
and things weren't okay
her her one son was watching the soapies
and the baby was in his crib with the door shut just screaming his heart out
and the baby-sitter was in the kitchen with her baby
and so that ended that
and she was most upset uh over finding this
so uh she they kind of had decided that the day care was better
and the age groups are separated
well nannies have been an option uh
but i know that at day care they have more of a a routine like at- maybe in uh
story time uh
and the this one has been particularly nice
and they would tell the parents what they did that day
you know if they said anything or did anything
so it kind of ac- i- kept them
uh on people that had been in that day care but was no longer there
because they wouldn't have nothing to worry about saying you know
if there was a problem they they would i think be more ready to tell you what it was
oh i think so because if they were still there you know they might not
and uh other than how else how do you judge other than from what others have uh what you see uh the cleanliness and that type of thing
and usually they aren't at that age
you know um
but it would be real difficult to pick you you know to find one and decide
well i know i uh about three years ago i i tended some children
and uh you know i i wondered if i would have to be certified
or whether they'd just bring them
and and we got to where well we were just friends
and then if there was a problem
and then we'd sit down
but it never happened
and and so things worked out okay
and their kids played with my kids
and it worked out well
i- it worked out good
i'm going to i've decided i'm going to baby-sit my
i i i sell avon and stanley products
and i've got that worked out
so he's going to deliver my products
so i'll do my orders and that by phone
well that will be great
but i th- i think i'll enjoy doing
i i think i'll enjoy
i i guess i kind of miss having a baby around
and and you know the grandparents uh i always hear it's always fun when you can send them home at the end of the day instead of
well they do say you enjoy them more
a some somebody said if they knew grandchildren where so much fun they would have had them first
well uh my husband's mother lives right over here
and she takes care of them sometimes
and and just is a lovely lady
and i've always appreciated when she's sat with them
always said she would not let me baby-sit because you do hear grandparents complaining you know because they're stuck with their grandchildren so much
but they're the ones that complain a lot are the first
i i do have some opinions
but go ahead
um well i know that they're they're real cautious about letting middle eastern people into the country now because of all the terrorism
i hadn't thought about that uh
what what what all do you know about it
uh well i just have an opinion
now i didn't think i thought the terrorism thing was overstated i mean
but uh maybe it is or isn't i suppose
and everyone's afraid you know of how the war was going to go and everything
i said i told her no
and there wasn't you know
but uh i i i'm concerned that we're letting too many that we don't have enough controls
i think that uh the asian gangsters that we've let in here
and if and the guys from uh cuba you know there's a lot of criminals down in florida that we've let in from cuba that fidel pushed off on us
and uh and the last you know
out of all the asians we brought in there's a tremendous criminal element that we let in from from asia
and i think that there's got to be some sort of controls over that
i mean this asia mafia thing is getting out of hand
i don't i don't i didn't know what i don't even know what our controls are
i don't even know what uh if we have any guidelines at all uh on immigration
um i always thought that we did
but i don't i don't i don't know what they are right now
there i don't think there's much of much of one because i'm sure all the people from cuba have been released from that camp that they were in
and uh most of them it's just like australia most of them were criminals from cuba and i think that was just an attempt that that fidel castro to undermine you know the united states to some extent
so he just released and got rid of all his criminals and sent them to us
and it's almost the same thing in in uh from asia because
i i do have some sympathy with uh you know
but i think that we need to do something with uh the immigration of back and a- forth across mexico uh i i'm sympathetic
i don't know what the answer is i guess
i'm sympathetic certainly with that that that they want to come over here
and they i guess hundreds of thousands come over every year to work
and if if they have jobs you know i hear the story that they're taking away american jobs
but i don't know uh
so i i'm sympathetic
but i don't have an answer
i don't uh i think that we should have good relations with with mexico
but that's not really exactly immigration
and it isn't
owe the children education and all that uh
so i guess it's what they
their the mexican kids get a good education along the way
and maybe that's a benefit to everybody you know
and a lot of the mexican people just cross the border during the daytime to come over here and work and they have green cards
and uh then like you said a lot of
and uh and and most of them you know are working in janitorial positions
so i i don't know
like you said i don't know how much how much they're taking from the work force you know
um uh of course you mentioned the language
i feel so bad that we here in texas or certainly the southern part of the united states uh california texas and all that why our kids don't speak fluid spanish uh by junior high you know as well as us you know so that we could wouldn't have the language barrier certainly
that that that is a shame that we have this tremendous border of mexico
and then in europe you know they speak their french and all
and they try they go out of their way to try to speak their neighbor's language so they can understand
we we cert- we don't really even make an effort to speak spanish
and i feel bad about that
and that's you know one reason that i did it is because because whenever you travel anywhere near the border you know there more and more people speak spanish
i i do have some spanish books
and i've always uh
every year i say i'm going to try to speak some newcomers language you know
or how much money they're putting into it uh
i mean how much my wife says how much the federal government is putting into it immigration
well it's basically on the well
and uh it's more um
the immigration is tied in with uh drug trafficking
so they have to watch out who comes in
and and they're always finding drugs on you know on the most um
but a dog found it the other day you know on the border
i i i think that certainly is a problem
they uh didn't say to talk about that
but that is i mean
you know they're redoing that and going to make it a museum a national museum
since all of us had uh ancestors that came over that way
or not all
but i guess i guess if you go back far enough you came over on a boat originally you know
but uh a lot of us have parents grandparents
and i'm sure they came over you know through ellis island you know
so we all immigrants one way or another well
and one of the one of the things that really gets to me uh about the mexicans is that um once they have children over here their children are american citizens then
and then they'll ship the parents back
and that leaves the children without any parents
but i don't understand whose rule is that you know
so and they you know and and they just follow the rule no matter you know
so that doesn't seem fair to the children
you would think they could at least get a a a visa or something until they uh get citizenship
and then they granted them amnesty if they could prove when was that it was in the eighties some time if they could prove they'd been here five years
and uh a lot of them had been you know
some of them some of them moved back and forth
but uh most of them don't ever want to go back to mexico
i i could see you could see why
i think most you know like especially the celebrities and everything they just have a uh well they have to get a green card if they going to do any kind of work you know in movies and and such
but most of them have temporary visas
i guess you can get work visas pretty easily uh
as long it's like well
it's a kind of a bad a bad bad example
but when rafael septien took the job with the cowboys they had to offer his job to any other applicant that could do it
so that you know
and that's the thing with the jobs
and of course no one beat him out
so you know he just ruined his own career
oh well yeah
well it's still interesting after all this time that we're probably one of the one of the few countries that people are still desperately trying to immigrate to
uh although i guess europe now that the communism is falling apart that maybe there'll be won't be that much of a rush to get out of all the communist com- countries uh
i guess poland now now is noncommunist
so maybe not
maybe immigration from europe to here will s- you know slowly uh change
maybe it'll be even out like trade you know
so many people will immigrate here in the twentieth at the year two thousand
you know maybe it will average out
it doesn't has doesn't seem so far
because there are other i j- uh job opportunities
in europe that there aren't here you know even um
like or- orchestra players can find a job sometimes
and i'm a trumpet player
i uh i don't any more
and i was a music major for a while
but i had a trumpet teacher that played in the mexico city symphony
so so he had to have a work visa there
and of course they had a lot of musicians from from other countries and uh in the mexico city symphony
but i think um like three out of the four other people in the trumpet section are from mexico now
but i think the conductor i don't know or one of the conductors is is from another country
you know and then and eduardo mana's from mexico
so he had to
well i um i haven't really lived in a lot of big cities
i mean i'm living in dallas now
but um so i don't really have a lot of experience with air pollution
but i know when i lived down in houston on the outskirts of houston there were some towns like pasadena that had oil refineries
and um if you would drive by there like on your way to the beach or something
and it always smelled really bad
well i i live out in the country
so that part is good
uh we're maybe one hundred miles from pittsburgh
and right now in our area were fighting against a toxic waste incinerator
and uh it won't be too for from where we live
and everybody really has been you know fighting against it because we we do not want it
well we don't want one any place
we would like the uh industry to do more to take care of the waste products before they turn to incineration because we feel that uh the small percentage that they're going to be putting into the air is too much
it's just i mean it's just so bad that there is just so much going into the air
and and the little bit you say that there putting in here and there and everywhere it all adds up
plus all the problems in the middle east
oh that has to be terrible over there
so it's just um why are we doing this to ourselves
but um i you know what really amazes me about like that pasadena area and the oil refineries
i mean between the freeway and the oil refinery you would see a neighborhood
and you just thought well it's obvious that there's a lot going up in the air there
and what comes up must come down
breathing it we're breathing it all the time
and and how if they have all of those um
toxicity i mean it there's signs around saying how dangerous it is
and here you are living
and i figure we're paying to take care of this toxic waste no matter who does it
and they have shown some of the industries have been real good at uh uh doing their part in uh reducing the amount that they have
uh they've reused some of it uh
and that they've shown that it uh to begin with apparently it does cost more
but once they get started it's really it saves them money in the end
and it cuts down on the end product that has to be dealt with some other way
and if they would all
that's what that's what we want done
is we want industry to take you know more responsibility in taking care of it
well um individual companies and things are so selfish
and their desires to save a few dollars and and that
it's it's the money
and uh even the incinerator the money and the income that they're going to make off this is you know just astronomical
well have you ever visited um like los angeles or any place that's ever it's kind of known that it has uh pollution in it's air
we went as far as as uh like las vegas
we did go we should have gone the whole way over
but we didn't
but i understand that
and she said how wonderful it was to be able to look into the sky and see some of the things that she saw
well what about in new york
well i've been to new york
because i have family there
it's it's kind of northwest part of pennsylvania
it's um very lush and pretty
up in the back in the east
well i'm thirty-one
you're you're young
and and these
we have some people who say well this isn't going to affect me this air pollution
uh older people
or they think they're far enough away from something
and they don't realize these things are going to affect everybody
and if you're older it's not going to affect you that way
you have children uh
uh everybody is going to be affected by it
and we all you know need to be willing to help pay a little bit like
i've heard some people uh grumble about their uh cars passing their emission tests
and how they've had to how it's more expensive and things
and i thought well it's so much better
now see we don't have that here yet
oh you don't
i have read that that that it has really helped where the problem is greater where the population is greater
and that it has made a difference
well i really think it must
i mean well think about how many automobiles there are
and each is putting out
like we have a car
an older one of our cars is an older car
and every time you start it from the tail pipe it makes a black spot
and you know that that is a sign
and that's all cars are doing that
and it's really polluting the air
and it's also it's causing of lot of the real terrible suffering like cancer
and like i said i think you have to pay for it no matter what you do you with it because it's industry
and they find out well this dump doesn't work
so we have to clean this up and move it someplace else
and we're paying to have our air polluted and our water streams polluted
where they want to put the one area they want to put the incinerator is right in the middle of the clarion the two water sheds that feed clarion river
and you know it just boggles our mind that they can consider even putting it there because
it will you know
and it's just hard to think that they could allow them to do things like this
well i've really enjoyed the conversation
and it's instead of waiting until it directly affects me like you say
well you have a good day
well you too
okay uh do you have young children
one is uh two
and the other one's four
and uh this is my first year of staying home
oh well then you are familiar with it
i uh i have grandchildren
and i know uh one has gone to a well two of them have gone to preschool
and i know what the experience my daughter has faced with that
well uh the
and so i felt that that i need to move on with them
and so i found another baby-sitter
and she was wonderful
and it just seemed like it was so hard to find uh really good child care
so it was in home child care
well both times
and uh and then i worked in in the child care centers
and i wasn't really happy with the particular one that i was working in
so i just always had a fear about you know child care centers
so that's why i put them in a in a in home day care
and then i just decided that i was just missing a lot of their time whether they were so little
and and i couldn't get off of work as often as i wanted to when they were ill
so i just decided it was probably best just to stay home for a while until they were a little more
and uh i could go back to work
i know that in raising my children uh i was fortunate
but uh and i know my daughter
because she has three
and to have three in day care you know even though one of them's in school full time one of them's you know in kindergarten
i mean it's so expensive
and i'm glad that she gets to stay home so that she can then participate with what's going on in their life
uh bosses don't always seem to understand getting off to go to christmas programs in the middle of the day or something
you know and i know that one of the day cares and it's a a well-known chain uh she was not at all happy with
it was there was too many children per person
and the middle grandson went there as a uh like a preschool thing
she was wanting him actually to start getting a certain amount of of learning and training and stuff
not just there you know
so he went like uh i think he went well five mornings a week if i remember correctly
and uh you know and it was supposed to be a base
you know starting to learn the colors and and learning to associate with children so that when he went to you know school and stuff
and uh she was most unhappy with it
you know and uh she pulled him out of that one and put him in a another one that was excellent
it was it was like a little kindergarten
and uh they had hot lunches
and and they had classes that you know one class they'd do art
uh it was just it was really a very excellent one
and how old was he
and uh so you know it helped him and and the first one uh he went to a uh church preschool that was very good
and it was a excellent
my little boy goes to the methodist uh in garland
oh does he
they uh the church ones church ones seem to be very well run
well i've i've heard that the methodist ones are excellent
oh i had uh i just assumed that most churches going by you know experience there that you know that they were good
i i didn't know that uh you know
i just know that you know first united methodist of richardson was just a great program
because this is first united methodist in garland that he goes to
and i'm real happy with that
well that's a
well are you enjoying staying home
uh i taught for richardson school district and uh i taught early childhood
and i really enjoyed it
but it was just it was taking a lot of my time
and i noticed i was spending less and less time with them
and it just seemed like they were sick more often and i just couldn't get the time off to
well isn't it very hard to teach young children and then come home and deal with young children
and i felt
could you tell me what you think contributes most to uh air pollution
well it's hard to say
i mean while it's certainly the case that things like automobiles and factories uh pollute a lot uh if you look at how much pollution is say kicked up by an active volcano uh it's certainly less than clear that anything man can do in this sort of scale of things has much effect at all
um well you talked about uh volcanos
i'm not sure how many active volcanos there are now and and what the amount of material that they do uh put into the atmosphere
i think probably the greatest cause is uh vehicles
um uh do you live right in the city itself
but i certainly work near a city
so ca- can you notice
well it's it's
it's mainly farms and uh no heavy industry
oh i see
and it's in the north
i live up in the uh northeast corner
and attleboro sits in just over the line
but there isn't a lot of heavy industry
and we get an occasional
it depends which way the winds blowing from boston cause we're like forty miles south of boston
so we'll pick up that
and uh i've noticed over the past say maybe five or six years uh
and i notice that the fly patterns now of the jets are getting bigger
they're swinging wider so that now they are coming over over our homes
and it seems like uh we're catching all that residue
but other than that you know we don't have the unless we're catching it from the midwest the emissions
you know from the power plants um
you mean like from the coal
one of our our biggest electrical plants in rhode island uses coal to uh
um there doesn't seem to be much emission from them
but i'm not sure about the rest of the country
um it's interesting
because in order to uh keep with the e p a standards which which tend to be visible uh what's coming out of your smokestack they do all their emissions at night
uh so people get up
well is that right
and they've got this black ash on their cars
which you know seems to be
i mean i really think that if the e p a had anything on the ball they'd go in there with a few phosphorous grenades light up the sky photograph the emissions at that point and uh you know
there there must be uh uh some of the some of the uh larger plants up uh up around one hundred twenty-eight
um we've got reports that uh
during the night seems like they'd blow off their their stacks from uh
and they do that at night too because
employees been complaining that the cars have been pitted and you know spots all over them
so you're right
they could do something a- about about that i guess
how are your uh your lakes
oh they've been getting cleaner
but um yeah
i'm not sure how much the water pollution is is directly related to the air pollution other than acid rain
that's that's what i was uh
i mean the stuff i've read recently in technology review basically indicates that acid rain may be a little bit uh overstated that a lot of the die off they've seen in forests may not really be due to acid rain at all
didn't they just have an article oh on uh
up upstate new york somewhere
and they thought that was more beneficial because you know it it some of it does soak in
and some of it runs off right away into the in to the streams and rivers
and some of the fish were supposedly making a comeback
i i read that recently somewhere
and i can't remember where
but i i thought it was up there
so that's interesting because new hampshire
and parts of vermont um they showed pictures of of extensive tree damage that they attributed to acid rain
um you kind of think it's something else then
well that's what the environmentalists were claiming in this article
oh they didn't say they didn't say what though
they just said they thought acid rains contribution may be less than was previously suspected um that it may be other natural things at work um
uh natural disease
so it's it's less than clear
but um i don't know
i mean what do you think we can uh i guess as individuals or as a group do about uh air pollution
uh we can demand uh more efficient automobiles for one thing
i still think that's that's uh one of our major causes of pollutants
uh how we go about that it's uh uh it's a little bit difficult
i think it's up to individuals too to ask automakers for for less pollutant vehicles
you ne- yo- ne- i think you need a a vehicle something like uh ralph nader nader's raiders or where uh or uh uh a a r p which has a lot of members
uh if you can get those types of groups
i mean i remember reading an article that said like it's uh the older polluters
the the twelve and fifteen year old cars you know contribute like ninety percent
and the new cars it's hardly is hardly anything
but how about all the trucks and buses that are out there
uh when was the last time you saw a truck that didn't belch smoke or uh
but doesn't that just mean they're out of tune
uh i'm not really sure
you think that that that the uh the trucking indus- industry is that uh incompetent that they wouldn't you know
fuel is is one of their biggest costs
so you would
but diesel engines
it you know it's it
i mean they do generate a lot of soot
but that at least that kind of particulate comes out of the air pretty quickly
we could also uh push for legislation for uh rapid transit systems
but only because we got used to uh single person single car
but we could that
pollution air pollution
the uh united states and canada are i guess is is going into uh some types of agreements to limit uh what's being given out by power plants
so that's helping
well what do you think about like a device a meter right on a tail pipe
and you pay the tax based on how much you polluted
now that's an idea
don't say that too loud though because uh every city and town will have a meter on your
well it just means if you don't pollute right or you pollute very little you don't have to pay any tax
or you just buy one of these things
and it it uh
maybe you you could probably devise them so it slowly closed off your tail pipe
and uh the less you pollute the longer the devise lasts
and if you pollute a lot then it closed off your tail pipe
and you couldn't start your car anymore
that's a that's an interesting concept
but uh you know it's uh
i guess the difficulty would be to that somebody could obviously just take it right off the tail pipe again
so you probably would have to build it right into the muffler or something
well i was going to say
you could put it in you could you could it could be installed like a catalytic converter
i mean i guess you could take those off too
but mufflers would be a little more obvious if you took that off
well not unless it was built into every muffler
but if you was talking about something which was more or less universal that uh busses and any kind of vehicle
had to pay a pollution tax uh this would penalize the heavy polluters and not penalize the light polluters
that's a that's quite a concept
you should uh pursue that i think or patent it
but it shouldn't be too hard to do something like that
but that's a that's a thought
and that will solve uh a lot of problems
i don't know if you uh if you approached the automobile industry if they would be too keen on installing something like that
uh but you know a proposal to uh uh i guess the proper authorities
well you might uh generate some yeah
but that's that's a good idea
other than that i'm not sure what what individuals can do other than like i said get involved through a group or an organization
what are your m- music interests
uh just about any kind of music except acid rock
i i don't care
but uh i grew up with country and western
uh i'm pretty diversified too
i i don't i don't like acid rock either
so uh the only
so it was country music
but then uh when i
my uh our cable doesn't
and uh it was tremendous
now he he is a uh
and and uh so i i i appreciate his too
his his mus-
he he he's from ireland isn't he
and it was uh mostly all irish tunes
they had a band with him that uh had a harpist and another flute and then a guy that played the bagpipes plus the uh tin whistle
and a couple of violins and uh drum
and they they played all the irish jigs and so forth
i he he is really good
i i i come from a musical background
so uh uh i've played fl- flute flute and piano
i i i have a b- big appreciation for music
i i'm getting now to the age where i don't like the new stuff that's coming an- and much of the new stuff that's coming out
i love to just lay back on the couch and and turn a good good instrumental
that's that's nice to do that is
i'm getting well versed in in kiddy music
i'm i've never played an instrument in my life
oh i could never do that
i've i've done i've done that at church too
so let's see
well what kind of music do you not like
well like i say the acid rock
an i don't care for rap music either
but that's not music
well it's it's it's not it's not music
it's just it's just uh uh talking in a beat
it is just it's not exciting at all
it doesn't it doesn't give you relaxation
i and i love i like orchestra music too like the
boston pops or or anything
are are they good
i i have i have
we went and saw uh l- l- les miserables oh the music in that was fantastic
i i've heard i've heard that that is a really
it it uh
but it was out you know out at the state fair music hall
and uh it was well worth the price
i i bet it was
i i really bet it was
is that the only uh musical
just just ever so often you know a real a real good one like that one
that that would be that would be nice
i went and saw uh i think it was uh sugar babies
i can't i don't know what that's about
uh that was the one with mickey rooney
and uh oh what's that real oh not real old my wife she is old too
uh uh uh i think i know who you're ta- oh i know who you're talking about
that wa- that was that was
i remember that being uh here a few years ago
oh oh the last country music
my my parents still uh really like country
and they they like uh they like the oak ridge boys and the statler brothers
and and uh well my my my my parents
my husband likes uh country music real well
and he he likes some of the new groups like shenandoah
i think i think they're a bit over exposed
i get kind
of tire- get tir- tired of every other song being alabama on the
oh i i've never cared for hank
and i never have figured out how he won uh entertainer of the year for about
oh we we watch those award shows too
but i just i just don't care for him
i guess probably my favorite all time country and western song or singer is uh probably eddy arnold
is is it
i i think i i know who that is
i think my parents have
i got a i've got about a hundred and or had a uh some uh i sold some of them i had about a hundred and fifty old seventy-eight r p m records of country and western
smiley burnette i don't know if you were old enough to remember him
he was uh played in the old western movies
he was the sidekick of gene autry i believe or they
i think his name in in the movie was froggy
i've i've never seen a gene autry movie
i took them up here to collectors rector- records and was able to get a little money for them but uh
my m- mother and dad use to uh own a restaurant
and he had uh they had a uh nickelodeon of course in the restaurant
well that wou-
and when they would come and change the records the guys would the guy would give her the old records so that's where i got my
that would be gr- great if they weren't too worn out
you you'd well you'd think there would be
well the problem is most of the record players now will not play them because
well that's true
you have to have that needle that uh particular kind of needle and uh they
just won't play on a modern day uh phonograph
well that's a shame
and you see seventy-eights
a a lot at at the stores a- a- at record stores
i'm i'm sure you could find old players for them
but that would cost a fortune
of course they you know just don't have the quality of records nowadays either because
you you get that scratchy sound
well those things were big and thick weren't they
and the ones you buy
and they're just so thin and
and they just they're not meant to last
ne- neither are tapes
i i bu- we buy cassette tapes
and machines will eat them
and so the best bet any anymo- these days are compact disk
but i i guess you know the old country and western music you
so that's all you had to listen to was the
th- there's too much t v now and the radio is you know more exciting
really than than television
your imagination i- i- kept
wha- what day what day was that on
do you ha- can you recall
uh uh seems like it was on a friday
well what do you think about the idea of uh kids having to do public service work for a year
well i i think it's a pretty good idea
i think they should either do that or or afford some time to the military or or helping elderly people
i i you know i think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that could use some help
and i think that before we expend all our young talent overseas and and helping other countries we ought to perhaps give a little bit of our help to our own folks at home
and i'm not sure that that's not a bad idea
and or the military for a year or two
uh i agree with you
uh uh what i'm thinking about is back
you know the parents kind of pushed them to join like the boy scouts
and they did do do do a lot of public service activities
but these days they're not uh
par- parents aren't encouraging their kids to do things like that
because when i was in the girl scouts we did a lot of public service things because that's just part o- of of the scouting and you know
i i really think that both the boy scouts and girl scouts is a excellent two excellent organizations
you know kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that
and they don't follow it at all you know
and and i don't know what the high rank is for the gals
i i uh
so there's not uh
oh they're just not
they they lose interest
and then when they young young adults
i i like to see
of course there's you know third world countries that can use all kind of help
but there's a lot that can be done right here in this country
but i think
i'm you know
uh i'm not i'm not so sure that overseas help helping overseas would be such a hot idea for for uh a lot of young k- people
but since there is much that needs to be done here
i think that yeah i think that we need to really address what we've done here
and and then perhaps even a six month tour overseas that gives them much broader outlook
well it's been really good
and uh hopefully we'll have other good topic maybe another call someday
but i i don't really have too much more to say on this topic i guess
i i agree with you
it we i guess we both agree that it's a good thing
well you take care
well i don't know
i've i've had mixed emotions i guess when i listen to uh the radio and and watch t v about the different uh things that are happening
uh i'm against it
but on the same token uh i went out and purchased a gun just because i wanted the right to do that
so i i have a rifle in the house
uh the ammunition is probably so old i'm afraid to use it
but uh i bought it for target practicing and uh and also because i wanted a weapon
uh how do you feel about it
well i think uh down here in texas they don't have a waiting period on handguns
and i think they need that
uh and i do have a i have a pistol
and i have a twenty-two or a twelve gauge shotgun
an- you know i do like to have my guns
uh i don't know if i'll ever use it you know
and like you my bullets to my little pistol's probably uh about three years old
uh my gun hasn't been shot in a year or two
well up uh up in new england where i'm from uh you had to get a permit before you could buy any amu- am- ammunition
and i thought that was really good
and i think if they uh
takes two weeks for that system to process uh your request for uh not as a gun permit but uh but to buy ammunition
i i i agree
i think you know one of the things that that that needs to happen is uh to to stop the impulse buyer from uh buying it quickly and and uh
but if someone's really determined to to pick up a firearm
and you can get them really cheap
i i had a waiting period on my pistol because i was down in uh tennessee
and uh they had a waiting period
and uh we bought it there
that wasn't too too bad
because if if you're going to go buy something uh uh of that nature i think you you're going to have some idea as to what you're going to do with it
in other words you know you don't have a need to go buy a gun to go shoot it the next day
i i at times i think they ought to have a waiting period on all firearms
i do too uh because
but i don't know uh
or at least ours does
uh it's you know
you have a little uh thing on the bo- bottom of th- on top of the barrel where you you turn it
and the spread changes
and i guess it doesn't have any any automatic features to it
the further away i get the the uh wider the shot gets from the target
and the closer that i get the tighter that it gets
my husband had a uh a police gun at one time
and i shot
and it just a li-
i don- i forget
uh since we moved
huh well the the uh clubs that we've got around here are kind of expensive
but uh it's well worth it
you can go down and shoot up against a sand bag and some targets and have uh competition
uh i've never really joined a club because i haven't got the time not because i haven't got the desire
uh there's an annual membership fee uh that's that's fairly high
plus there's ini- an initiation fee that you have to pay because of first time uh uh member
so the whole process can cost you a hundred fifty dollars to join the club
plus you have to pay for the the ammunition in any tournaments that you would join in
well that's what my husband
it you know
he went mostly just to uh shoot at paper targets
uh but you know they used speed and accuracy and all that
i think that that the gun clubs serve a useful purpose
in fact i'd like to see somehow they tie the legislation into not only when you buy a weapon you have to uh show that you've gone to school or gone to some class to know how to handle that weapon
and you know it it
and you give him a license because he waited nine days
he could he could not only uh uh shoot himself
he could he could uh mishandle a weapon leave it at home and let a child get at it
well we uh we was living on a navy base down in memphis
and uh this one guy decided to play uh lonesome cowboy or something
and he was twirling his gun around and shot himself in his foot
i can't remember what the na- the term was going around
about uh private citizens selling a weapons
like if you wanted to sell your pistol to me
do you believe there ought to be legislation guiding the uh buyer and the seller
and or do you believe that you ought to be able to sell your system uh
uh that's a hard one because we did that
but uh i think there ought to be some rule against it
i'll uh you know
i- isn't there a way to uh to deregister yourself after you register a gun
because i have
and i've kept it you know the one gun that was in my name
the uh the rifle that i've got is not registered
and uh i don't know why i never registered it
but the uh
the uh the
well see uh my husband has a thing
if they go to uh regulating uh
it's just like the uh the social security system
once they uh they gave everybody a number
and now they're making you uh uh get one at at birth
and once they have your number they have your identification
and if you try to do anything uh like uh not identify yourself to the government they know who you are
and that's true
bu- bu- you know they know so how much money you make a week to uh probably your uh
uh i've lost my train of thought
oh the soc-
you you were talking about uh uh fed- what the federal government knows about people
they they probably know everything from half the time wh- ho- what time you go to the bathroom
that's that's a little bit extreme
but they could know anything and everything about you
and uh i'd like to have my gun
if they go to banding banning them i'd lose my gun
but we wouldn't lose our pis- our uh shotgun
and uh we're wanting to get a couple of more that no one knows about
but i don't i don't uh
do you find it difficult picking up uh guns that that are not registered
i can i can buy some uh today if i wanted to
just you know put up the money
well you can look in the uh the
it's a a ho- it's a it's a bargain thing
uh you go and ever- you know always see guns in there
and there's there's no waiting period on that
and it took us all of twelve hours
you know and i'm sure it'd be even less for somebody with a good gun
huh and i think the federal government is uh is really far away from uh uh control
i i don't believe in uh
i'm s- i shouldn't probably say control
uh but i would like to see them have a monitoring capability so that they know who has what weapons
well i agree with you there
uh we could look at our paychecks and see how much control they have
so i can't complain too much
uh i don't know if its their proposal or one that's being seriously kicked around
i've i've always felt for a long time that i i think that all young kids ought to do a stint uh primarily in the military
they you know they have uh it mandatory for for the the uh at least the young men
well you take israel i mean everybody does
teaches teaches a lot
i mean i went in the service when i was eighteen
and uh stayed in for ten years
uh did a lot of growing up
and that's uh how he put himself through school basically
and he didn't have a chance to uh you know
so he had to do something to
and he did
and he was very successful
well my parents wanted to send me to college
and i was dead set against it
you know i had wanderlust you know
and i got in
and after after wasting the first six years partying and everything else i decided uh-huh time to settle down and do something
so i started to work on my education
course my job was such that i didn't i couldn't do it as much as i wanted and still i ended up going two semesters when i got out just to get my degree
but i've been in school ever since
there's other kinds of service to the country that could be done you know
i mean if you don't like
i mean working in the national parks
uh working clean up the roadsides i mean i've always felt that people on welfare should be required to spend at least part of their time
not all the time because that takes away from their opportunity to look for a job but
all these all this money that we're throwing away to pay people to go out and do things when we're paying all these welfare recipients
and if they're able-bodied people i don't see any problem at all with having them go out there and and if nothing else get a group of them together and take them around to old folks places and let them cut the yards paint the houses
i mean uh
and his sole job was just tracking down people who were getting benefits and able-bodied
and he he had all kinds of horror stories
you know these guys go down there and get their unemployment checks
and back back in those days they also use to give
and i'm i jus- i have a hard time dealing with that
what i hear one time i think it was on paul harvey's uh radio segment that he said that if the money that goes into welfare each year was to be given directly to the people without all the middle people in the government bureaucracy each person would receive like forty-five thousand dollars
i mean i was astounded
i you you think about you think about the layer of bureaucracy between the money and the recipient
and somebody's taking that away
and and there's probably there's easily probably six or seven times that amount being spent on the bureaucracy
you know it's it's it's totally ridiculous
and now i i i uh started out when i first got in graduate school
and uh quite honestly i just got so fed up with it i just couldn't stand it any more
i mean this is the kind of thing you look at
and when you're writing up budgets you wonder okay how much money do we need
well you need x number dollars for the recipients
but you need x number dollars to administer the program
well just ridiculous
i mean there's got to be a different way
but it'll never happen
i mean these these people out here getting that money are big voting blocks
i think i think there ought to be some kind of assistance as far as uh
and i would limit it strictly to something like tuition assistance
and they'll help the country eventually too
and that's only going to help
i mean i mean look at the statistics
i mean it's sad
and and we've got the lowest rates of the civilized countries in science and math
i mean what are we what are we becoming
and now we're no- we're not going to do it because everybody is beating us at the game
and they they did it better than we do
but on the other hand we kind of lose out
i think that if uh young people had service to the country might give them more ambition
and and it can be good for them too
i mean even even the greedy kids that we've got now
oh god you go to the mall
and you see you know fourteen year old kids flaunting money because the parents give them money to go down and play video games all night you know for what
and i'll i'll teach them something good
well you know you know why they do it is so they can get them out of the house
uh that's my other complaint
they've they've relinquished their parenting
well as a substitute teacher for a year i i can say yes
i mean i talked with somebody else about that another time
and you know when i's in graduate school working on my master's degree in math i was uh teaching as part of my part of the program
and i just love teaching
that was a lot that's probably the most fun i had
and uh it helped me out because i learned things and learned how to do things differently
and when uh when come time to get out of school i thought boy i'd like to teach
but you know for for what
you know i don't want to live in a little one bedroom apartment the rest of my life
i mean that that's a sad thing to think
and that's kind of selfish on my part
and i admit that
well in a way it is
but you have to look out for yourself you know
i mean that's some-
and when we pay garbage men more than we pay teachers
i mean yeah
i mean i i have a great deal of admiration for these people who can go out there and do that
but uh i mean there's there's a sense of priorities here too
you know we need
but you know when it gets right down to it
i mean one's import-
i mean on the other hand i mean you take a garbage man in new york city starts out at twenty-six thousand dollars
well i bet you there's a whole bunch of homeless people up there who would take that job for thirteen thousand dollars a year
i mean my other pet peeve is unions
you know it's just it's it's ridiculous the way unions have gone
and they served a good function
and they served a good function
but there are enough laws on the books now that unions are outdated
and they're only there to perpetuate their own their own power structure
and they uh
and they were having a hard time
and they told the strikers there look
or else we're going to be out of business
and they wouldn't come back
so they went bankrupt
and and they all lost their jobs
and it's like you know
and and and that's really what happened to the steel industry in this country
so many times i mean you had the uh the coal miners and steel workers going out at the same time
and well that took care of that industry and and then and i'll tell you
detroit worked awfully hard on on stopping car manufacturing in this country
and they're trying to do that now with the imports
i mean you know we've never caught up
and i don't think we ever will
i mean here it is
and we've got we've got to go into partnership with the japanese to build cars
well back to the original subject
they could they could i mean you could organize something just within your community
and that's a great idea
i think they ought to take them and i don't know just have sort of like a a a manpower pool and say okay look
what's wrong with it an or if anything is wrong with it and what we can do about it what should be done about it
well one thing that pops into my mind real quick is uh about the uh funding of the the school system right now
evidently uh that's that's a big problem
it's amazing uh
i always thought that teachers never got paid nearly enough i mean
to be doing what they're doing uh
when i was in college i i enjoyed teaching
'cause i did some teaching part-time
and i really enjoyed that
but i wouldn't want to go teach high school or junior high
it just you know all the problems
oh lord i mean yeah
an you talk about stress and pressure
and you know and they're being paid probably half what most people being paid
and we're paying basketball people you know millions of dollars a year for for what you know
and then they uh poof it off you know do like tarpley
but uh i
what gets me is i can't believe that congress uh or our state legislature can't come up with uh some kind of workable means to have funds for the school
you know it's uh
now do you have little kids or what
but i have a sister that's a uh school teacher
my wife and i have a a three year old almost four and a a two year old
so we're looking at the the older one going to school next year not not well not this coming fall but the year after that
so it's getting close
so you know we're we're thinking about that
or they going be taught something
we're going to we're going to be involved in our child's education
because uh i guess we don't trust the school system which is very sad uh
but but if it doesn't start at home it's not going to go anywhere
and we're going to try to teach him good values because you know we- when when they get to upper level school and they start teaching them well hey if you can play football or basketball that's what's important not if you can read or write or do or un- understand some science
i mean give me a break
that's that's that's bogus
well and uh you know one thing my wife and i've talked about i- are uh private schools
you know whether uh uh we would want to invest in in private schools as they're g- growing up because you know just in the dallas area um we're not real comfortable with the with the public schools
and dallas uh school district just recently got an advised status because of their low quality schooling
we were hoping you know well the school districts going to be good you know for resale value and
but uh i can definitely uh see on down the road you know where we do have kids and are getting to that age that's going to be a definite concern
we talked you talked about before about the school funding
but i think what's going to have to happen is there's going to have to be tuition for grade school and junior high and high school kids
that's the only way they're going to fund it because if they start raising taxes for property and people are going to throw a fit
and you know that's
and i don't think any politician's going to do that
and the only thing they they would think of would be tuition you know
and you know that's going to that's going to affect the people that are having kids in school of course which is probably the only fair thing to do
but it will be hard for those that people that have have in school because they have to pay out even more
and you know it's going to really hurt the the middle class uh people i think
because uh they're the ones that will probably have to to carry the brunt of the load
and most of the problems with kids in school carrying guns and and knives and everything
i mean good grief what's
now that's that's just unbelievable to me you know
i mean when i was in junior high and high school that never happened
we didn't we didn't even think about it you know
and now you know what do we have now
you know got kids that either got a you know a magnum gun school
like good grief
i mean i'd i'd be afraid to be in school i mean b- teaching or even being a student
and think what what's it going to be like for my my youngest an my oldest son when he goes to school
i mean i i'm afraid for him to go
but there again you can't hold them back
and you want to encourage them you know to to be active and everything in school
but uh you know with all the peer pressure that's going on with all the negative things it is uh it's a tough environment to be growing up in
and that was
well i was i graduated high school in nineteen seventy-nine
so you know it's lot different now
and what's it going to be like in another twelve years when my uh oldest son is in high school
i'm afraid to i'm afraid to even think about it
that yeah that is a scary thought
but uh i don't know
i i guess what you have to do is just uh keep in uh you know encouraging them and and uh uh try to be open with them so that y- you can deal with the problems as they come up
you got to you got to be your child's best friend i guess
even when they're a teenager and they you know are kind of standoffish
still you got to be their best friend because when they've got problems who they going to go to their friends that are dealing drugs or or your parents
an and if they go to their friends dealing drugs they're going to be in even worse shape
and and the schools don't don't really encourage to stay away from that you know
i maybe i'm wrong because i haven't you know been in that kind of environment for a long time
it just is amazing you know
of course wh- if i say this is a good value someone else is going to stand up and say oh no
and the a c l u is going to get after them and have a lawsuit
which is going to take twenty years to resolve you know
well and i think uh you touched on it you know
that's where they that's where they get the the deep rooted values
and and and uh and that's about right
then you just have to hope and pray that that everything uh works out works out okay
well i got to be going
well hey i appreciate the call
have a good life uh
this is quite a quite a long distance
how come uh you don't have any now
well i i live in an apartment building
and and uh and and it it it's ju- just not feasible you know
i'd love to have a dog you know
i've got a little doggy uh that i've had quite uh quite a long time
she's uh uh uh a poodle
uh a toy poodle a toy poodle
my i got my mom a teacup little mutt
and uh it's funny how uh how i i uh a- acquired this animal
uh when i was uh married my uh ex-wife had said that she had a friend who had a little puppy that she needed
uh the woman needed someone to baby-sit
and uh this is what she had told the kids
and she even told me that
and after the two week period was up uh she then informed me that the woman no longer wanted the little puppy and wanted to know if we wanted to keep it
oh for sure
well after you had an animal for a
so i've had this dog now for for sixteen years
and she's been a lot of company
uh she's uh however getting a little old
and things are starting to fail
uh i i live alone now
and she stays in the house all day while i go to work
and uh she's been holding herself pretty well the uh up until you know recently where she's been having accidents in the house because she either is losing control or she forgets where she is
and uh i find a little present on the floor
but she's she's usually pretty good
well my my mother has one that's uh
it's uh it's uh teacup
and uh it's
but you know just i e- e- you know
the way my mom's presence countenance is just just for having a puppy
but you know having this dog
oh possibly four
but uh it was it it's it's really made such a difference for her
i really would like to uh
i'm a disabled person so i'm unable to to really take care of a pet
and if that weren't so i would certainly have one
i just i just
huh well you might want to get yourself uh an animal that doesn't require much attention like a cat
uh i i i typically am not a cat person
i have a friend that uh has on occasion uh brought her cat over for me to keep for
and this cat is like no other cat i have ever seen
and uh it would sleep on my chest
it's just it's just a great cat
well my my personal preference is is a dog
uh i don't know that uh that i would ever want a cat
oh i like cats
well you don't own cats
uh they're not uh they're they're affectionate
you they they own you or or you know
grant you with you their presence you know
well my my dog when i came home uh when i come home in the evenings my dog greets me at the door
i don't know that a cat would do that uh
and she knew whether to to to quietly come up to me or to just run and knock me over
i mean she really could pick up on my mood uh the way i walked in the door
it was uh uncanny
huh i i think uh in a way we're able to read each other pretty well because uh she knows when i'm upset and i know when she's not feeling good too
i know like when she has an accident i know she's not doing it on purpose
when when she was younger she used to do that to get even with me
uh and and you know some people might not believe that
but but but uh i do
like if i if i put her in a room all by herself and close the door and leave her there for a few hours uh because i was going out she would uh break something or rip up the carpet or do something just to uh to to let me know that she was unhappy with what i did
well i had that cat that i mentioned alfie
one morning you know the first thing you do is you get up and you you you feed this cat some- something and and you make sure that it can get to its litter box
well for some reason during the night the door was not quite wide enough for it to get through
and uh the next morning uh when my roommate got up and and uh did not feed it right away it decided that that it was going to protest
and so it jumped up on my bed and anointed my blanket
for me looking looking at me eye to eye
uh it was about two years ago she got sick on me
and i took her to the uh to the vet's because she wasn't eating and and uh she wasn't able to jump
she you know lost all her activity
and uh she stayed there for one day
and the doctor called me up and said uh she had a low white cell count and that uh she wasn't she was dying and uh suggested that i take her to a working hos- dog hospital animal hospital
so i took his suggestion
and i uh took the the dog to a hospital the dog hospital there
and they said they'd keep her there for three days
well she ended staying there five days at a hundred and something dollars a day because she was in intensive care
plus the the uh the vet sent me a bill for what he did
and uh then she recouped
and then she got sick on me again
and i brought her to a different vet this time
and i told the vet what medication i had given her and everything
and uh he gave me the medication the same medication that i gave her the last time
and she was okay
and she's been okay every since
huh well that's great
well the see the problem is if if the if someone would have came up to me and said it's going to cost you five hundred dollars to keep your dog alive
but what they well what they do is is they say well it's going to cost you know twenty dollars for tests and forty dollars for this
and and you know and it creeps up on you
you don't know that uh you know
you really y- you don't know what it's going to until it's all over
uh to give you an example my mom had an elderly cat who uh whoever evidently got a hold of it
and uh the cat got sick
so she took the cat to the vet
and she had the cat there for two days
and then the cat died
so the doctor had called her up and said uh your cat died
and you owe me this bill
and oh by the way do you want me to to bury the cat
so it cost her three hundred dollars uh
and she didn't get the cat back
they had to pay for all the medical uh bills that the cat ran up plus the burial expenses
so that that was kind of a surprise
well even the you know
they they claimed they did the best that they could have have
and then the cat uh died
so i'm i'm looking for another cat for them uh
i i've i've got a little kitten uh that's still uh just being born right now
so another five or six weeks
well that that that that will make their day
i i think it will
because they're both in their in their seventies and uh the cat uh although it's a little bit of work for them sometimes it turns it turns out to be uh uh a pleasant experience for them
uh i think they enjoy that
for cats anyway you know
well the same here
and you take care
uh so what do you do to exercise
i uh weight train uh three days on and one day off
i uh ride bicycles
i play basketball uh couple times a week
uh that's what i do
uh i guess i bicycle
uh the amount varies
uh i guess a play softball one night a week
and i backpack a lot over the summer
that's that's about the extent of it
i mean i don't do any of those things particularly you know for exercise
but uh i guess the bicycling is the one thing i'll sort of like do if i feel like i need to go exercise
uh but i do it mostly for fun
uh what do you ride uh like a bunch of hills or pretty flat
it it it varies
uh out near my house is pretty hilly
uh but sometimes i bike to work which is about uh a fifteen mile trip each way
and that's mostly flat
uh about forty-five fifty minutes
how d- how does that work work out with uh storing your bike and showering and all that
uh basically uh i work on a campus
so i can store my bike in my office and walk across the uh campus to the uh gym use the shower there uh but it's it's enough of a pain that i did it consistently one year
i would commute every day uh
but it just became such a pain
i mean we're talking you know forty-five fifty minutes for biking
uh and sometimes longer if you had adverse wind and then another half an hour you know to cool down and take a shower and all this kind of stuff
it was a big hunk hunk of the day
uh and then of course another hour to get back home
uh so i've been doing that less and and concentrating more on you know light biking when i get home on the evening and then you know some more on the weekends
uh i guess mostly i bike on my own
uh though i haven't gone on any extended trips with it
uh well actually my wife just got me into it
and i did an did an internship at the institute for aerobics research in dallas
and i learned all the health benefits of you know
and all i did was weights and aerobic exercise
and then my wife got me into the aerobic exercise and said you really need to do it
once i got into this uh internship i learned all the physiological ad- advan- advantages to it
so i began a program couple i don't know probably three or four weeks ago
and i did my first bike rally this saturday
i did uh forty forty miles
and uh that's the longest i've ever ridden so far
i usually you know fifteen or twenty
and it was it was kind of hilly
and it was pretty tough
but uh i'm looking at uh doing a lot more of it because you know my wife is really into it
oh i see
and i i kind of held her back a little bit this this weekend
you know she wanted to stay with me
are you think of doing any like centuries or
that would be cool sometime if i could you know work up to that
i just wondered if you were going to do that mostly or more like you know uh
and one's more just you know
that you know that's
and i may do that sometime
i've it's kind of funny
and i was just reading through a bicycle magazine and going through all the different tours coming up
i mean around texas you you got about five or six
oh that's nice
i didn't know that and you know until i came down here and
because i lived in indiana all my life
and you know you may say see one or two guys on a bicycle that or above the age of fifteen or something but other than that it's nothing up there like it is down here
i mean generally in the midwest it seems to be less much less
i mean maybe it's because of the winters
uh or maybe just because you know there's there's a lot more flat lands you know out in the west
so it makes biking a better alternative for transportation
it there's a lot of bikers around here
it's it's really neat
there are a lot of a lot of resources a lot of magazines and stuff
little texas bicyclist is like a little newspaper that comes out every month
just go to the bike shock bi- bike shop and pick it up
and it's got all the rides coming up
so i guess i'm going to be busy about every saturday this summer
oh that's terrific
so uh how long have you been biking
oh i guess as an adult for just about the past uh three years or so
uh you know i guess last time i did it before that was college which was about ten years ago
and uh yeah
i guess i just never really thought about it much for a while uh until i suddenly discovered all my friends were basically biking a lot
and so i thought i'd try it too
have you ever had a uh it's kind of slightly off the subject but you ever had a uh a blood workup done recently or since you've been biking
because it really from what i understand it really improves your uh cholesterol and you know it uh
oh that's great
i've i've definitely noticed it's had a good effect on my pulse rate my resting pulse
you know it gets it down to about forty
that's that's hard-core
i mean there are some people
they've got a uh mountain bike
you know with the big knobby tires
and i don't do that
i basically i i pretty much lay off for the winter
uh i was thinking of getting rollers for the last winter you know because it will help your balance when you're indoor training
uh but i just you know more or less stocked like an exercise bike and that kind of thing
i mean winters are kind of a problem
so i'm more or less out of shape now that i've been biking i guess this year for just a couple of weeks
uh but you know up here
it's it's it's it's pretty good
the main the main thing i guess for me is just to enjoy it because once it starts seeming like you know exercise and a chore
so you uh change up your routes a lot and keep a
i try to go someplace pretty different you know every week
i rotate around uh about four different routes uh from my house
or i'll sometimes come in the school
it's it's nice riding to school because it's all along a canal path
because it's just it's along the erie canal up here
so what school is it
uh university of rochester
so it's fairly picturesque
and uh so it's it's it's a good ride
but got a guy that rides a hundred and fifty miles a week
that's uh motivating
oh it was good talking to you
well good talking to you
and keep up the good work
uh far as you know crime in the cities i'm sure like in yours it's pretty pretty bad
uh probably the biggest thing we've got going now is the robberies
uh well i don't actually live in the city
but i'd probably say that's roughly right
i mean crimes against property seem to outnumber crimes against life
but i i think with the current war on drugs and all this kind of stuff i'd say probably the police department would claim the number one crimes crimes are probably solicitation of prostitution uh and sale of drugs
prob- probably right if you look at it from that stand point
is there anything uh that you particularly are concerned with in your particular area as far as security and that sort of thing
uh where i live now it's it's not so bad
i mean i can basically leave my front door unlocked and not have to worry about it
uh but i do have friends that live in the city
and i think that they get a lot of fallout from this war on drug thing uh just because there are like crack houses you know on their street and stuff like this
do you live in a real small town or or out in the country
how far out from the city i mean do you
i live in a little suburb uh which is i guess from dallas is twelve miles or so but it's pretty congested
but it doesn't really feel like you're in the country
our major crimes in our immediate town uh is probably robberies house robberies and very few instances of you know alcohol drugs uh reported
but uh right now our neighborhood is running about uh eighty percent of the homeowners have been robbed
sometime during their their uh existence in that neighborhood
and since that time everybody's got some sort of burglar system or you know uh burglar alarms uh and including the out uh the outer perimeter type uh devices
it's cut back you know considerably
but it it just shifts it from our neighborhood to another neighborhood to other neighborhood
so it still uh remains city wide pretty pretty high
are there are there any theories on why this is happening
uh i would say the majority of it's happening during the day uh between probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon
well most families most families are young
and both people are working
so they're happening during the hours they're gone from work
uh so uh i would say that's probably their prime motivation
they'll they'll stock your house and uh look at your pattern and then go from there
so they're professionals
uh they classify most of them as professionals
uh you get a few of them that are a little bit sloppier uh just taking uh you know just junk items that they they can just get you know ten to twenty bucks for real quick
probably the biggest items that uh that you get in our neighborhood or would be the high classed automobiles
the you know mercedes volvos things that they can get you know big dollars for and the jewelry are the major targets
very few you know penny penny ante stuff
well what do you think can be done to reduce that sort of crime
well uh the police force for one
i think they could uh definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use
oh right now i think we are about thirty thousand people
and there's only eight officers that patrol for thirty for that amount of people which is not very many
but i mean that's going to tend to
i mean it seems to me that sort of approach will tend to simply make the cost of committing the crime slightly higher
course in our particular state uh we have the prison overcrowding whatever
so they're giving the early release uh
and and it's
i think what they need to do is stop building more jails and start giving stiffer sentences uh
but for the
so you think that would be a deterrent
that would be certainly be a deterrent
and uh not necessarily you know give in to their uh human rights desires
you know if they're overcrowded just keep cramming them in there till they just suffocate uh
well what about an innocent person who happens to have been found guilty
uh i think they'd have to go to extra measures to make sure a person's guilty you know in a lot of cases
course i i know you can't be a hundred percent foolproof
so you'd you'd rather see it harder to convict somebody
uh to convict somebody
and then those convicted especially of you know murder and and uh you know major crimes
uh to reach the life sentences and you know death penalties and follow-through with that
uh especially you know in the case of murder uh i know in my case i my wife and daughter were kidnapped
oh my goodness
during a house robbery back in eighty-five and we caught the individuals got caught
and uh you know two counts of kidnapping uh you know the the forty-five to the head you know just the the mental anguish and the whole nine yards uh you know the guy only got five years
and you know he was out within two months because of the parole system
so what what
did you did you sue him under the civil system
well you could probably sue him for mental anguish or something right
well the insurance companies and all that tried to tried to go after him
and they said well you know he they're he has no job
there's nothing that he has that that you could go after
makes you wish that had uh still had indentured servitude for this sort of thing
uh very seld-
but they give the guy a job in prison and make him pay his damn debt
but they don't you don't
and uh you know and they're
they uh been in jail before
they've been released you know several times which is another
uh deal i hate to see
but uh you know basically the guy commits you know three major crimes and and uh
i i think that's re-
and we're out you know uh you know fifteen thousand dollars
you know the guy gets out in two months
and he goes out and commits it again
so what what uh
what what deterrent does he really have
i think in our in our particular neighborhood vigilantism is becoming a real real possibility
oh my god
uh we've had a couple instances where break ins where the people have actually you know shot the people and uh return offenders have
they've actually waited for them where they've robbed you know particular neighborhood
then other people will wait up you know and wait for somebody to do something else try to take it in their own hands
but uh nevertheless
i think people are just getting fed up and saying you know you can't arrest all of us
you can you know you can get some of us
uh and we're beginning to see more and more of that
and that that's a deterrent too if you think the home owner might be armed right and awake here you break in
and you're going to get shot
that's i mean that's certainly a possibility in in
we have had a few cases where the guy has broken in you know during the middle of the night and gotten himself shot to death
and uh it helps for a while but then just another different set of people come in
and most of the people are transients from out outside of the state
uh i would say probably eighty percent of them that are caught they're from places like up in oklahoma and louisiana arkansas you know across the the border
so you know people who don't readily read the newspapers in our town or whatever it's not many from the local communities
but uh it's a problem
and i i just i think that the court systems need to be more accurate in in stiffer in their penalties
and and uh giving the uh police uh agencies a little bit more jurisdiction over what they do when they when they catch these people
i mean i i tend to agree with you
i think uh what i would like to see is number one completely getting rid of these victimless crimes uh there's no reason to enforce those and spend time and money doing it and and worry about these things where people are getting hurt
and i think one of the big things that you can do is to increase deterrence is uh if someone is found guilty of a uh felony level offense they lose their citizenship
and they lose their constitutional rights
and just a lot of things that we're trying to worry about you know protecting these people from we just don't protect them
i know like in my wife's case they made her feel like the criminal
and i think i think that's ridiculous
they they went to all all
and then since then we have painted the bedroom
well i painted the outside of my house and one bathroom
but i get i have that problem with the the ceiling you know the uh the blown blown ceiling
you know where you get around the edge
well that is hard
now i asked janice or somebody recently how you do that uh when you paint the ceilings you know where you have got that textured stuff that they have special rollers that are real soft and furry that you paint that with
well how do you get the edge though
the the straight edge
oh i see
we use uh uh a two inch brush with uh on a slant and that mostly does it even though you still make mistakes
huh well are you going to paint the outside of your house too
see the people that own the house they uh pay for anything like that that we do
as far as the the materials
so i am thinking i am going to change it to uh something you know
oh that will be nice
or two tone or two tone
but i have a problem
and we can't paint the chimney
well you have got to get one of those ladders
and that is what he
and he has finished everything except the chimney
well we did too
and it it's just too high
but and the only thing i would consider doing a professional maybe doing that
well our house in new mexico it was stucco
but we had all this trim to paint and lots of it
and we did basically seventy-five percent of the house
and then i was afraid to do the eaves way up high and stuff
so i hired this man to come in and do it a young kid
and he came with with his own raf-
those where you built like a rafter thing
oh oh oh oh i know what you are talking about uh scaffold
and i think he charged me a hundred dollars to finish up
and literally i wouldn't have done it with the scaffolds because all the places that i had left for him were above huge humongous cactus and if he fell he was dead
and he knew that
so that was worth it getting a professional for that
plus he cleaned up my mess
but other than that it was pretty easy doing it ourself and caulking it and everything ourself
i mean you think
but we did uh like two heavy coats over it
but then that way you know you are assured you did a good job than you are you know if you hire someone to do it
but that friend of mine that painted his house out there in your neighborhood he went to uh i guess to buy his paint and yet he bought like seventeen gallons
and anyway he when he checked out and he was using his charge card too
they only charged him for one gallon of paint like thirteen bucks or something
oh my word
and he had he had the uh he had already carried a ladder outside and told her that
and she wrung all that stuff up and made a mistake on the price of the paint so she had to start all over again and when he got outside he noticed his receipt was like thirteen ninety-nine or something
oh my word
and he saw
so that was really worth it painting his own house
it was like over two hundred dollars worth of free stuff
oh my word
oh my word
well he really saved in that way
i think we are going to do uh another bathroom
but i think i will probably just do it in a roller
uh rollers are so messy
oh i know
but it's that it's the textured wall
well a little paintbrush
well what do you think
gun control seems to be a rather uh timely topic with all that's going on legislation wise
and uh the interesting scale that they assigned it uh the one being a banned and ten being no regulations or totally free
i don't mind regulating of the the guns
and i would certainly call for a ban on certain types
now the wisdom as to which types that's going to be a debate forever i would assume
uh the method of controlling it well that's all into how much money you want to put into the controls
uh one point that was made in the
the representative stood up and said you know we can check a guy's credit card instantly
but uh we don't want to check his background
and of course those are two different issues as far as privacy goes uh
but there still the technology exists to check it if they want
so it's kind of a
and then you've got the group of people that decide that there's no particular reason to have them at all
and you got to balance those against the ones that say there is some sport to it
and i guess i would fall more in the realm that i like the sport issue of it
but i could give it up without too much trouble
and it costs a bit to do uh finding ranges and things like that
uh i have shot a variety of guns for a number of years
but it's just not like golf or whatever
i mean there are other things that you could go do
so uh i don't see the joy of shooting as that much of a driving factor
so i don't have that problem
and boy you can get them on either side
and just like you say
uh well think i guess i'd have to place myself uh probably seven or eight
i'm sorry excuse me that
uh two or three
uh because of we had a neighbor child that was killed by another child because they had a gun in the house
and the father kept the bullets in a separate place
but the little boy was five years old and was intelligent enough to
uh he knew where both places were loaded the gun
and they were playing cowboys and indians
and he shot the other little boy right between the eyes
it destroyed two families uh in just that instant
and and a lot of people say that they need it for protection uh
uh then you know that uh uh
if you live anywhere real close that uh
the safety is uh
but uh uh we have never had a gun in the house with my children growing up
uh i uh
once uh uh knew a fellow that had had been a policeman
and he said that if you pull a gun on a robber he's going to assume that you know how to use it well
and he's going to you know try to shoot first
uh and if not
uh then usually they uh
i mean you know they
so i'm when my handicapped son is not at home i'm by myself
but uh there's
and and the rare
you know the very few of those burglaries actually occur in such a way that you knew the guy was coming
and had time to do anything about it
and i don't have that problem
the uh n r as uh claim that the uh the constitutional the right to bear arms and that whole statement uh
but i don't see it as that that difficult of a
and have a you have a earn a right
you know there's all sorts of arguments there but i don't even want to worry about what the original intent was
so we change our rights with our social status
and they can be taken away by a man
i know well
even here where i work uh we have a gun club
and of course those people are very avid
but i can't see why any uh o- on the street citizen should be able to be allowed to have a machine gun
uh you know when you were talking about maybe what kind of guns that would be hard to decide
but there are a few guns that uh just are not uh sport
or i mean
so uh i think they should have at least some control over over those things
uh and when you were speaking about how they can check up you know on credit cards
well i understand about the privacy act and everything
but why can't they check to see if the person who is applying for this gun has had a record or not
and if they do
course the argument with the people in the gun club uh is that uh well the people that are going to get guns are the ones that are going to steal them anyway
and so it's not going to be that they're buying them
so it it is a hard question
it's very difficult to uh legislate uh crooks or you want however you want to word it so it's
well this may be a never ending topic
so i'd better let you go
well thanks for talking
oh is that right
and so that uh helped out a little bit i think
well he tends to go into a lot of detail sometimes
and i don't think he was truthful in a lot of what he did in texas
so i wasn't sure how credible he was
oh is that right
but anyway what do you think we've gained from the spaceflights
so uh this going to the moon seemed to be a exciting adventure
but i don't know that it really benefitted mankind that much
oh is that right
uh well i've actually worked for the company that uh has been blamed for the challenger disaster uh morton thiakol
and uh you know that's been kind of a a real negative feeling here
is sure it was you know very unfortunate thing that occurred there
uh we live in uh utah
oh oh great
because i'm in dallas
that's how we got hooked up to the program was her her husband works for penney's there
no her name is uh my last name is skidmore
and her her husband's name is his last name is weight
well you probably know a lot about it
i wasn't sure that they were blaming that sp- space disaster on one company
well they were
there was uh
apparently the specifications for the joints uh
they were not to perform in uh cold weather
and uh apparently there was definitely a a joint that did not
and uh if you've ever seen the size of those uh motors that put them into space
i mean they're as long as a football field practically and about twelve foot in diameter
and and there is a lot of pressure lot of thrust to get that much weight up in the air
so it's this book was interesting though
talked about how a lot of the problems they have to come overcome to uh
it's a very complex uh situation to go into space
the thing that he went into quite a bit of detail about how how much of a problem it is to re-enter the earth's atmosphere
but they have to come in at a just the right angle
if you come in at the wrong angle what happens is they bounce off and go back into space and if they come into it at a different angle there is so much friction that it burns them up
well i saw one of some of those early space capsules at smithsonian
but you could see the scorch on them you know
they had though piles but you could see where they would come off in the how hot it got because it was still the scorch on them which was quite interesting
excuse me go ahead
i've i've i would say i've never i've never seen an actual capsule
i've seen more more of the motors that that they produced out there
well these were the ones that john glenn went up in you know and the old old ones
people have commented how uh they were surprised at how small they were
they just uh
looked pretty confining huh
and uh the whole thing was small
and yeah you i mean you actually put it on
well i thought there was some medical benefits that we have learned from space
but did he go into that in the book
not really uh
i know one thing they've they've mentioned that i didn't get from the book by the way
but it talked about uh
they're able to manufacture uh different kinds of crystals and ball bearings and things like that in a zero gravity state that they turned out being almost uh nearly perfect as far as a ball bearing goes
but i'm not sure you have to go to outer space to achieve that zero gravity
well that's true
well do you think we should continue to support it at the level
well i thought probably one of the things they were doing that they didn't tell us was spying
because i think those satellites you know or not satellites but the spaceflights could really spy
and with uh with russia's demise i didn't know if we should continue to support it at the current level
uh i think they have cut it back to be honest with you
from from the glory days when they did the apollo shots to the moon
uh i appreciate having the satellites
you know that's certainly made it nice for other purpose
we don't but i i know that's certainly helped a lot in that regard uh
well the topic's about government
uh i'm not altogether sure that that's my best topic uh
i mean you i i think people tend to think that the government is not corrupt
i mean that's what i would like to think
i i i think that the last uh part of that question was particularly interesting uh about uh uh uh can all unethical behavior or how much unethical behavior can be made illegal uh because i- it seems to me that when
maybe maybe that's what is happening
maybe so many things have become public with the media over the past you know ten to twenty years that uh it becomes more evident
perhaps things that we didn't think of before and just concentrated on the lawmaking or the results that would be seen in public works or bills that are passed or you know et cetera like that and we were just not exposed to the personal lives of these persons
and i couldn't help thinking when that last quest- it was a funny question when that last part of the question came about h- how many things can we uh actually put a legal code on that uh
because you start prying in people's private lives you ruin their lives as well as
and sometimes you know i don't even know how much of a difference it really makes you know
i mean i guess in some cases sure we care about what they did in the past but uh sometimes i don't know i think it gets in the way of the better judgment
i mean just because you did something in the past doesn't mean he's not a good enough person to be a politician
i i i agree with that and uh and also that if the results that they're putting out and what they actually seem to be accomplishing by legitimate means is what's you know going to the public then uh then they'll pay for their private life in their own private conscience
and uh you kn- when it becomes public though it becomes scandalous
the that's that's the thing that
uh things that you don't know uh d- do do not worm their way around and influence other people or perhaps lead other people astray
people could say oh they do it
so i guess you know
but as soon as things do get public uh there there is that terrible concern
so sometimes i ask myself what are uh people doing that are in the media when somebody you know comes up to office
i guess it's what sells newspapers you know
a- and and and as far as uh you know myself having any particular personal uh knowledge or insight into politics or politicians it i'm not terribly involved in it
and i you know try to do whatever i can on the little local area
but i i i- it just is not one of the things that i have uh placed uh uh a a lot of my particular time and effort into
so i i always feel very outside this kind of uh
i just kind of read the paper follow up on peop- i mean you know just keep an eye on what's going on but i don't really play an active role in any kind of politics
i'm not i'm not in there
i'm not one of those uh you know volunteers that's down at headquarters and whatever uh although i admire the people that do that
and they certainly do get inside information and uh of course the better you know a person that might be affiliated with that kind of thing the more you can trust their their judgment and their insight
but the media insight as you said
a uh golden retriever
ooh that's one of my favorite kinds of dogs
let's see he just had his fourth birthday
and we got him when he was about eight weeks old
and uh he's pretty okay
he actually he just went to the vet yesterday to get his shots and everything
and they put him on the scale
and he's up to ninety four now
but he's not a real he's not a real tall uh dog for a golden retriever
it's uh just me and my wife
and uh he's kind of our temporary substitute for having kids
well we have a cat who's also about four years old
and he also sheds a lot
but we uh we hope to get a golden retriever someday
but we figure we'll get the kids and then the the dog
uh have you ever had a retriever before
but my husband had one when he was growing up
because i i find that they're good around other animals like cats and other dogs
is is your dog an inside and outdoors
we we're kind of in a not a real busy neighborhood but more so than i'd want him to be out too much
and he doesn't like it if we tie him outside
and when it comes to being alone
uh now if you give him the freedom to walk around and go wherever he wants he likes that
but he does not like to be tied outside
he'll he'll just bark and bark and bark
um when he gets outside does in does he run away and then eventually come back
he's uh taken to the training pretty well
and uh he knows where our yard is
and we have a pretty small yard
but he seems to know the boundaries
and he usually is good about staying within them
although our next door neighbors have a dog too
and uh she she is good friends with my dog
and so he often gets to smelling her scent and will go over there to sniff around and stuff
and uh if i catch him i call him
and he comes back
so he he's pretty good about taking to commands and and things
i i trained him on my own
and uh this is the first dog i've had all my own as an adult
we've had kid or we've had dogs when i was a kid
but this this is the first one that i uh took in
so i wasn't sure if i'd be able to get it all right the first time
but uh he he seems to have picked it up pretty well
just you know firm tone of voice and those sorts of things
i i see other people out there
and they hit their dogs and try to
and and those horrible collars that they put on them with invinc- invisible fencing
it's uh it's a system you can put in your yard where you bury these little uh transducers or emitters in your yard at the perimeter
and then they wear a collar with a special little attachment on it
and if they get too close to that perimeter it it zaps them
well a friend of mine at work here said that he tried it with his dog
and he wanted to see what he was subjecting his dog to
so he held on to the collar
and he walked out to the perimeter
and so i i don't take too well to to those sorts of training techniques
it's uh is your cat an indoor cat or an outdoor cat
yeah he's indoor and all declawed because i know the uh average life span of an outdoor cat is eighteen months
that and also just uh getting hit i guess or getting beat up
and the average life span of an indoor cat is eighteen years
what uh what kind of climate do you have
well uh it's we just moved recently
so now we're in the uh dallas area
and it's very very nice
actually i uh i guess i am
um it just seems kind of funny that this is a topic of discussion
uh i do uh some uh woodworking myself
uh in fact i'm in the middle of a project right now making a bed for my son
um what kind of pine
it's uh it's uh plywood uh face i guess
but i cut it out in the shape of a crayon box
and then i painted uh about eight different uh colors uh you know
the crayons that are sticking up it will be the headboard and then
oh he'll be delighted
i got uh it got delayed for a little bit and uh because of work
and now uh i've got to jump back in and finish the
because i've got it all cut out
it's all uh
but i've got to go a second layer with the yellow
or do you have powered you know a
uh i did uh jigsaw uh and the uh regular straight saw for some of it
to do the uh th- the turn cut
uh how about yourself
well i'm i am interested in woodworking
our local schools have adult education in the evening uh and i use their tools m- a- an- and some of their guidance
and i'm very handy
and you know if i touch it it turns into something us- usually
what what type of art do you focus on
uh well actually i'm very you know
and and my projects had to do with acrylic painting
but i'm really interested in the crafts
and i kind of
once i get so- you know really pretty good at something i want to try something else
actually i get good enough to sell it or have people say oh wow
and then i it's like well the thrill is gone
so let's do something else
i i'm signed up for a class in pottery making
huh so you have a m f a in in what division of art
well i i actually have a masters of art
and it's in art education
so i'm a licensed teacher
but jobs being what they are i substitute teach and that way i have time for my kids too
and i've been fortunate that i can afford to work part-time
and uh they're cutting back
so i don't go in all that often
but i've been real interested in some of those cute country country kind of things
uh i see stuff in craft galleries for five hundred dollars
and i say oh no
and and i go
and i make it
i i love to cook
oh that's great
and i saw a silver necklace that had these little teeny weeny silver spatulas and and and knife and and a fork and all kinds of stuff and i went
and i signed up for class because then again you get you know get someone to guide you
and you get the tools you don't feel like buying
and i made a necklace that i saw in a gallery for three hundred twenty dollars
but it didn't
but if it cost me twenty dollars you know
and then i
then i saw a one of these country looking wood watermelons
and then the watermelon the red with the with the seeds painted in
and i got two six foot inch thick boards turned into a watermelon
and cutting that wedge out was no joke
oh i'm i'm sure
and the teacher was one of these negative people
oh that's dangerous
and i'm going well how about this way
i i want to do that
so we did get the wedge cut out by building some kind of a cradle for it
and then you used a handsaw or a backsaw
well it the instructions in the book i had said use a coping saw
but there's no coping saw big enough to for a fourteen inch wide watermelon that and he wanted me to do it by hand with a regular saw
so we built a cradle for it
and we got th- once it was turned we got one s- one cut out on the table saw on the radial saw
by getting the other one out without the slice now flying in your face was something you had to think about
now did you cut a quarter wedge in this
uh i'd say it's about an eighth
you know jus-
well i i'm envisioning uh uh a water- a watermelon like a log
and then uh what i've seen of this kind before is you have the uh the uh
 yeah
 yeah
 okay
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 yes
 uh-huh
 so do we
 yeah
 right
 that is a really pretty state park
 uh-huh
 i'm not sure
 i'm actually in the air division
 it's a similar thing
 i have in the past
 
 you buy something on credit
  yeah 
 no
 and always kind of thought that too  kind of an extra buffer 
 i'm sure the people love golf up there like they do down here
 true
 we still have a lot to see though
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
 it just breaks my heart to see these poor little old dogs wandering the streets looking starved
 yeah
 oh
 okay
 yeah
 yeah
 yes
 right
 well that uh that i think may go on a lot
 uh-huh
 not
 right
 yeah
 yeah
  to  a certain extent
 oh
 diagram
 yeah
 yeah
 
 up until his death
 do you think there's very many really good day-care centers around your area
 yeah
  yeah 
 we're renting a house
 
 yeah
 yeah
 no
 i hope you get better
  uh-huh 
 everything all parts of the food
 right
 can't say it
  right 
 no
 with a baggy sweatshirt
 how'd you do that
 i'm going to check that
 okay
 it's usually not a one time accidental thing i don't think
 uh-huh
 i still believe i get very fed up with government sometimes
 uh-huh
 it's all the dirt i have
 so which is fine you know
 uh-huh
 
 right
 we'll see you
 that is
  wren 
 you must have some of their lines memorized
 uh-huh
 twelve children
 i was going to say you didn't have the typical
 yeah
 yeah
 i found that out
 yeah
 i'm not in the middle of anything
 okay
 yeah
 yeah
 oh really
 yeah
 i do too
 yeah
 they eat it one to two meals everyday in north africa
 i like that
 was c n n
 right
 a little bit better than some of the others
 yeah
 a ring at all
 yeah
 yeah
  yeah
 uh-huh
 warren moon's an  excellent
 yeah
 uh-huh
 oh shoot
 yeah
 they were just covered with them
 right
 all right
 
 yeah
 how do people in texas deal with dallas houston and san antonio
 i've noticed that
 exactly
 uh-huh
 me too
 uh-huh
 whereas it would have been
 the engine blew up
 okay
  right 
 
 that's true
 
 it's just a point that i have observed that we
 
 uh-huh
 we need rain really bad
 yeah
 yeah    
 he was raised in the south
 you probably have some friends that have television
 my god i can't imagine
 i'm trying to think what else is on television
 right
 yeah
  okay 
 uh-huh
 i really like   a lot
 the grass was dead everywhere
 
 when we had our larger cars we didn't mind uh keeping them up
 uh-huh
 those were not good cars
 yeah
 i'm not really expecting to get anything out of it
 
 yeah
 as long as it's not used to delay the trial so much
 that's true
 uh-huh
 right
  i'm a historian 
  golly 
 the language barriers
 if something is out of style i do not really care
 one is bad enough
 uh-huh
  yeah 
 not
 do i have kids
 y-
 i guess it just couldn't handle
 they do yes
 those people down there don't really
 uh-huh
 yeah
 no
 for which if they would just pay me enough money i would be willing to consider
 i've got a lot of
 sure
 interestingly   in honduras
 we've all got to do it right now
 gone are the days of those things they use-
 i don't know
 that has broadened so much also
 exactly
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 a girl
 like i say i've made a couple of calls to texas and just talked to all different kinds of people
 oh
 i try to keep it pretty reasonable
 yes
 yeah
 no
 yes
 it was just a total fiasco
 really
 uh-huh
 there was no trees where i was from in amarillo
 yeah
 lubbock is
 uh-huh
 be interesting to see when as mexico develops industrially whether you know without
 yeah
 it depends on the state you live actually
 we're sort of like the middle east peace talks ourselves
 i haven't
 yeah
  uh-huh 
 i do too
 really
 yeah
 uh-huh
 right
 seems like it takes so long between conviction and carrying out the penalty that i don't see that it makes any difference to sentence anybody
 makes a lot of difference
 that's exactly right
 yeah
 i do cringe when i hear some of the problems we've had
 not at all
 even to watch it
 uh-huh
 yeah
 i haven't read his book
 six seven and eight
 i wasn't
 i don't know what it was
 yeah
 okay
 you
 yeah
 exactly
 all within in an hour
  yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 so we've got four cars for our five licensed drivers
 yeah
 yeah
 i see
 uh-huh
 they bring home notes that say they have to get a good night's sleep and eat right in the morning before
 right
 the one
 have you ever had them just come up in different places
 how long have you been in raleigh
 yeah
 uh-huh
  please come back to work 
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 i think it was 
 let me push the button
 sure
 just a little bit of begging will
 yeah
 they made a little patio area where they can go outside
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
  no kidding 
 they have a fish that's called an oyster cracker
 yeah
 uh-huh
 right
 yeah
 young mothers
 
 if i start into something and i really enjoy what i'm reading
 uh-huh
 i wasn't in central america
 we're fixing to get in the car
  i couldn't help myself 
 we got it at a little bit of an incline
 
 to be a lot of fun
 i hate to see that
 in my car and let someone else check the oil even
 uh-huh
 no
 have you ever camped on sand
 what
 just the volume makes a big difference
  uh-huh 
 right 
 that's four each
 it really is
 they like to be outside as much as possible
 uh-huh
 i got to shovel it all lots of fun
 i've even had some of them
 uh-huh 
 the same in some of the areas around here
 right
 yeah
 the first one i got
 yeah
 i just hope it doesn't go up any more
 that's true
 
  that's  really sad
  right
 right
 because there's just not enough of me to drive them around everywhere
 the men that are out there fixing power lines are tested a lot
 yeah
 levels of it the one from seventeen hundred til say the end of the civil war
 you're not old
 yeah
 yeah
 frank e
 yes sir
 right
 okay
 i'm just teasing
 yeah
 it's something
 it's so comfortable
 that's right
 right
 there was a high error rate in the analysis of drug results
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
  lawry's  prime rib
 or something like that
  right 
 more especially where you are
 i know
 i did
 uh-huh
 okay
 yeah
 yeah
 bleachers
 cocoon
 uh-huh
 seems like a nice place to go
 when i was a couple of years ago involved in some pretrial stuff and
 it's just i don't have a trailer hitch on my car anymore
 you're buying these knock offs
 uh-huh
 i said no turkey is only for thanksgiving
 uh-huh
 when i was growing up we had cats
 we still have lots of little goldfish
 yes
 yeah
 i think they will probably win one or two more games than they did this year
  to  really be camping
 one is in ninth grade
 yeah 
 that's true
  chairmen 
 d-
 i
 yeah
 little baby kittens dropped and stuff
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 
 i had one lady one time
 uh-huh
 yes
 i said
 i'm not saying just give them money
 that seems to be the norm of most movies
 i just want to kill her
 yeah
 uh-huh
  you  must have come to washington at least once
 that's the whole thing
 right
 he needs to get outside and play
 uh-huh
 oh
  somewhere  on one afternoon
 i don't know where i really come down on it
 
 
 i'm not quite sure
 uh-huh 
 yeah

 right
 
 i know it
 yeah
 yeah
 oh good for you
 
 right
 i like to know where it's going to
 uh-huh
 where's bob or what about bob
 uh-huh
 in utah
 that's computer stuff
 i imagine
 that's when i was in the elementary school years
 uh-huh
 you're kidding
 i have
 uh-huh
 yeah
 i'm actually working on a data base at home just to keep track of things nothing special
  uh-huh 
 what division you all in
 uh-huh
 you may never get the truth
 yeah
 it's probably true
 uh-huh
 yeah
 i like country and western
 yes
 yeah
 wasn't that what part of the lottery is going to go for if we approve it
 uh-huh
 he had my vote double
 home from work
 right
  know 
 yeah
 yeah
 definitely
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 okay
 okay
 your first ones you mean it
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 right
 do you have a sam's wholesale warehouse up there
 this was yanked
 yeah
  right
 uh-huh
 it's kind of an easy thing to talk about
 okay
 that's where i picked it up
  uh-huh
 right
 yes
 you can't get in there
 with a
 the jeezer music as i call it
 you didn't have to mix paint then right
 yes
 i didn't know that
 yeah
 it's good to have a partner
 uh-huh
 we've had a real nice mild spring
 uh-huh
 they fought individually
 they have some wonderful camping areas there
 we do
 do you work
 in the dallas area
 uh-huh
 they said
 i think the kids need some time to play
 the whole lot i'm sitting on is roughly half an acre
 yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 we don't get to go that often

 yeah
  a lot  of people are
 yeah
 uh-huh
 we- the the middle girl doesn't get a whole lot of attention
 yeah
 yeah
 i think it was like
 as well as hot lunch
 take them off
 yeah
 
 flimsy
 i don't know
 right
 he brought it home
 if you could come up with a device that's the thing
 which is a shame
 i guess you'd have to call them great men in some sense
 that was poor quality i think
 uh-huh
 like you're judging us
 i work for t i
 uh-huh
 right
 everybody in the country is preapproved i think
 it was really
 i found about it on the network
  uh-huh 
 yeah
  i don't know 
 yeah
  right 
 yeah
 okay
 maybe supply some arms or something
 i can you understand that
 do they have many buildings that have security there
 yeah
 
 it is so safe there that you can leave your purse on the subway
 i live in atlanta also
 uh-huh
 i go to a few games
 that's not real surprising
 smell the continuous
 that's part of that propaganda thing
 and colorado springs
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
 the woodworking
 it in a million years to do it myself
 it's
 i'm jealous
 really
  yeah
 yeah
 no
 uh-huh
 yeah
 you're amazed at how much that adds up
 uh-huh
 yeah
  enough  to
 parents and children husbands and wives
 how about your
 i kn-
 that's true
 right
 i can't
 uh-huh
 at that stage of life you only have so much money left

 right
 ye-
  wow that's good 
 they can come from all over the city
  uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 
 there are a number of good movies like that
 do you have children
 but
 yeah
 yeah
 not only can it be fun
 i know
 my goodness
 it's
 it would be hard
 i think they're a little bit biased sometimes
  little  value just in whatever you do
 what about you guys
 was it bad
 right
 that i think is my invasion privacy because it's the government
 i agree
 do you have children
 i'm like  god  
 yeah
 like if you order something through a mail order catalog
 you mean in cable
  yeah 
 yeah
 yeah
 i got it right on the tip of my tongue and can't say it helen something
 uh-huh
  right 
 uh-huh
 yeah
  
 i do too
 i don't know if i have anything handy

  i think  it was sixty eighty
 right
 uh-huh
 whoops

 uh-huh
 he never really got in a game never did a whole lot
 no
 yes
 uh-huh

 i'm kind of old fashioned i guess that way
 uh-huh
 and raise my children
 a keeshonden
 you're not too surprised on much of anything
 yeah
 yeah
 it's just
 uh-huh
  yeah 
 and then people the the wrong people will just fight their way
 do you
 that's right
 and you got the cars
 yeah
 yeah
 central
 that's
 is she of alzheimer's or something like that
 uh-huh
 yeah
 that's probably what i'll try and look for whenever i do have
 uh-huh
 my husband does
 it'd be nice to be a pro golfer
 interesting
 
 
 the store and come home and sit down and watch it
 was that good
 i think it's a little harsh to say that they should have to spend a year or two
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 you just do it and be done with it and don't worry about it
 yeah
 okay
 about five or six years ago my dad  who plays every now and then took me out with him
 more of that
 what we have
 uh-huh
 i was going to say it must have been wal-mart
 well i've heard this one theory that if that if a kid commits a crime that uh instead of the prosecuting the kid they prosecute the parent
  right 
 yes
 you bet
 they're not cutting in any other corner
 that we can't improve these things
 it was really suspenseful
 okay
 i understand we're supposed to talk about spaceflight
 then you're that much farther ahead
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
  that makes sense 
 yeah
 go out to the nursing home help guide some craft programs perhaps work on some
  right 
 yeah
 yeah
 there were places where she could actually take her
 yeah
 i have heard it is
 just
 yeah
 uh-huh
 that's true
 uh-huh
 yeah
 and you wanted to go back some
 
 okay
 
 go ahead
 right
 i do
  uh-huh
 for some reason they put a bathroom light switch in the hallway
  did you 
 yeah
 uh-huh
 that's easy
 where are you from originally
 it's it's pretty tough that way
 yeah
 uh-huh
 
 well it's a matter of name recognition
 
 i know
 uh-huh
 it was funny
 sure
 i work at texas instruments
 yeah
 that's right
 bu-
 wow
 i love that
 no
 uh-huh
 right
 right
 yeah
 yeah
 yes
 like i said if we don't have we also set aside money for entertainment
 the eagles yeah
 is texas one of them
 yes
 they just used things
 it's just as boring
 right
 all right
 have you ever killed your mother
  uh-huh 
 it wouldn't be perfect
 sometimes called the dismal science
 i try to
 c o u s c o u s
 that's really nice
 it was really enjoyable
 yeah
 i never learned
 yeah
 
 uh-huh
 yeah 
 exactly
 
 it's not just random people
 how about you
 yeah
 uh-huh
 that's one i can watch
 that is one solution to it
 right
 now particulates would come from trash burning or incineration or something like that here in dallas
 oh
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 i was going to read while it was on
 uh-huh
 well pretty soon it's going to get to the point where no one is going to be able to afford to send their kids to college or to do go to college
  yeah 
 yep
 disposal is a problem
 it's loud and repetitious without having a great deal of meaning
 
 but she just wants to be able to have that freedom
 it's hard to say
 how do you like it out there
 uh-huh
 i think so
 uh-huh
 
 yeah
 it's really neat
 boy that's a good deal
 right
 uh-huh
 yeah
 just life in general
 right
 yeah
 yeah
 it sounds like you have a baby there
 it's just if you really want the majority of the people to vote then give them a couple of days
 i guess my husband got a letter at the office
 you don't
 uh-huh
  okay 
 yes
 uh-huh
 that should be a lot of fun
 and i don't know that's true or not
  that  it was a virus
 yeah
 i don't know
 uh-huh
 i have seven cats
 yes
 uh-huh
 what
  uh-huh 
 there are those teams that play in professional national football league
 i don't like it
 yeah
 that's why they want them there because them somebody takes care of them all day
 
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 hearing anyway
 four or five years
 
 she had injured her back and needed a walking partner
 yeah
  uh-huh 
   no  
  uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 i don't
 that gives me plenty of exercise
 absolutely
 i need a hole there
 yes
 i see
 that gets
 uh-huh
 hi
 
 that is for sure
 it
 i almost never watch television as a matter of course
 i was just thinking
 i do
 i think it was just rare
 uh-huh
 
 uh-huh
 that's why i was thinking it couldn't be just a totally funny part
  bye-bye 
 uh-huh
 yeah
 
 i went to
 yeah
 we do a few things
 yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 aspen
 yeah
 definitely agree with that
 you'd think it would carry mostly religious
  he may never have  all those motor skills back
 it was also extremely difficult to stay awake sometimes because there was so many witnesses
 right
 i think that's really important
 oh
 our community doesn't really have any organized recycling drive
 uh-huh
 there is a lot of crime
 i was born in new mexico
 it's a little more understandable under the circumstances i guess
 i have a four year old and a three year old
 no
 i think we realize it's failed
 okay
 wow
 sure
 yes
 okay
 yeah
 did not know that
 ten
 
 uh-huh
 yes
 yeah
 or is it like
 he is in the navy
 it is
 okay
  yeah 
 we like them around
 sure
 yeah
 yeah
 i hope to get up there
  some of the scuds 
 
  just started shooting people 
 i think so too
 
 
 yeah
 they use freon twenty-two in air conditioning systems in houses and the like and heat pumps
 i don't have a headache any more
 even i would kind of like to go
 yeah
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 reba mcintire is a little too country for me
 we've got methadone programs where people who desperately want to get off drugs can't  get onto the program 
 it's wonderful
 
 we've only been in i think it's science place two
 you have pets i understand a couple of them
 no shirt or anything
 i think twenty thirty years ago a lot of women
 oh
 right
 uh-huh
 in my day we talked quietly behind our hands about people that we suspected might be
 he says i'm following the orders of my president
 i think it
 that's right
 oh
  yeah 
 uh-huh
 
  yeah 
 right
 it was a cadillac
 
 uh-huh
 i
 i had two cars there for a while
 yeah
 what kind
 
 what
 right
 huh-uh
 uh-huh
 absolutely
 uh-huh
 we didn't have to go with sleeping bags
 yeah
 
 that
 yeah
 right
 yeah
 yeah
 nursing is
 that
 uh-huh
 are you familiar with that
 they're really happy that i don't cook anymore
 uh-huh
  usually if you  can find somebody
 okay
 my god i think it would be next year is what i'd read
 
 television sure makes child rearing easy on you
 it's too cold
 i stayed
 i love seafood
 that one kid that becca likes he has aids
 i guess the first time i played golf has been probably about eight or ten years ago now when i was in college
 i think we put too much on politicians
 right
 isn't  that funny
 pretty good
 you know
 no
 i like his movies
 my husband went to is in graduate school actually right now
 right
 uh-huh
 pork barrel politics
 you had to come home and  clean before you could  even do anything probably
 yeah
 that's right
 i may
 it is it is
 that's what she plans to do
 right
 it is
 i am actually a junior
 uh-huh
 i lived
 uh-huh
 that's right
 yes
  yeah
 she got about two thousand dollars worth
 yeah
 i am one of those crazy people that reads the directions
 yeah
 it didn't sound
 are you there
 uh-huh
 yeah
 it's god's country
 social lives and so forth
  i was  in toledo last summer
 ye-
 exactly
 yeah
 uh-huh
 it's not a lot
 i'm five three
 it's beautiful
 
 and glass
 right
 i know two of my daughters had to have that
  right 
 
 yeah
 yeah
 
 yeah
  
 not too far away
 okay
 need to teach them good values
 they're the ones that probably are paying the highest
 had watching them
 yeah
 oh
 type of deal
 n-
 that's what i remember from living up north is that you'd get everything set and then you'd have a frost
 i
 yes
 that'll encourage me to always go since i spent that much money
 
 uh-huh
 reverse that trend at that point
 oh
 i looked conser-
 e d s has eight years
 right
 sure
 when does it become detrimental to our family to the point that you have to consider that as opposed to considering her current circumstances
 uh-huh
 yeah
 
 
 i grew up about the same time you did
 look how young she is
  yeah 
 uh-huh
 i imagine
 right
 
 this is the neat thing about the place we ended up at
  right 
 right
 
 uh-huh
 it was totally irr- 
 now there might be now
  
 i
 jim hart was playing
 start up
 okay
 yeah 
 they don't really pay a whole lot of attention to buffers
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
 they've got three daughters
 now they have gotten this wonderful idea of not taking out as much taxes
 isn't that bad
 i guess you could consider that a hobby
  yeah 
  children 
 
 ready to go
 yes
 the headlines on the news or whatever is someone says they found a cure for aids
 we're going to have a baby this summer
 we've gotten out a time or two on a rented basis
 yeah
 uh-huh
 oh yeah
 that's the bad thing there is that we spent so much money
 just from the heat of it all
 bye
 i see
 uh-huh
 i guess it'd be best if you knew each person and what they stood for and why and everything
 uh-huh
 you're almost looked down upon if you don't try to do all of these things
 uh-huh
 no
 i understand
 right
 
 uh-huh
 yeah
  altogether
 bye-bye
 i i think
  uh-huh 
 that's true
 everywhere you went there was sand
 i work at n c n b now
 you always have the lack of funds
 ford products
 it really is
 it does indeed
 city water has chlorine in it
 yeah
 right
 that is hard
 that's what we're doing
 uh-huh
 sure
 
 right
 i've
 yeah
 you lost an investment
 i think at t i it took five years
 okay
 what a dead place
 
 is he still around
 i'd like to go just sight see a little bit sometime
  yeah 
 oh
 uh-huh
 i hope you have kids just like yourself
 yeah
 right yeah
 
 but they don't have
 you understand what i am saying
 my dad is a farmer
 i
 uh-huh
 i play a lot of racquetball
 okay
 right
 i know
 my grand mamma died a couple of years ago so but he's you know
 there's a lot of things that they don't do in school anymore
 uh-huh
 the judicial system is aimed at the citizens
 it's a euphonium
   yeah
 it is for me
 i don't
 uh-huh
 yeah
 life is to interesting to read fiction
 yeah
 no
 uh
 yeah
 i've talked to
  uh-huh 
 they had five or six servants you know and and a lot of expensive uh holdings and all that
 yes
 uh-huh
 ye-
  as mexicans
 uh-huh
 yeah
 you guys sure want to be out of range
  however you  come to that conclusion
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
 yeah
 it's like let's see if we can get her to run up her bills
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 
 do you know anything about  that 
 i don't work at t i
 great
 to give it  a little more body 
 if it's life and a day then he's not eligible for parole
 i won-
 of history
 it was
 i went
 was i supposed to do something
 to a parent
 yeah
 it's a good experience
 we're in a recession here
  we've never  even seen that
 uh-huh
 
 you want to be around for the crisis and things like that
 oh
 right
 yeah
 uh-huh
 go ahead
 this was when the peace corps first are started
 uh-huh
 yeah
 drove it right to the shop
 right
 okay
 now a friend of mine who was studying social work here in philadelphia worked for an adult day care program for mostly for patient's with alzheimer
 like some member of the family gets the flu or whatever
 i just get aggravated about it
 we just couldn't leave without it
  uh-huh 
 telephone pioneers of america
 maybe they're burnt out or
 we're tired of doing it though
 have you just started doing this
  no
 it was terrible
 i never heard   
 exactly
 nowhere near that expensive
 huh
 yes
 uh-huh
 
 yeah
 you probably have nice big pine
 but uh
 uh-huh
 i see
 i might just donate my little one to the scout troop and let them
 white
  yeah 
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 no
 
 it sounds like we've covered all the bases
 and it you know
 
 what do you think about that
 no
 yeah
 right
 tried to get fondue and white wine
 yeah
 yeah
 do you have friends there
  that sounds good 
 
 yeah
 she's a
  yeah 
 boy
 uh-huh
 we've been sort of opera fans for a few years now
 you hate to  get rid of it because you know how much you spent on them
 yeah
 yeah
 i don't do any drugs
 
 uh-huh
 i just took grades one through six
 uh-huh
 i enjoyed talking to you
 seriously
 in education
 i see
 are you involved in the legal system at all
 yeah
 already
 it's not bad yeah
  bye 
 they get so heavy they kind of weigh it down
   i guess this is what you call a natural end
 so many people are moving back into those old houses and are restoring them
 that's right
 my goodness
 i am sort of rereading it
 okay
 no
 
 because it seems uh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 it was made back in the early sixties
 uh-huh
  i'm with  the f b i
 okay
 one was still in diapers when i started baby-sitting
 absolutely
 that's discouraging if you own property
  yes 
 and she'd been
 obstinate
 that's it
 i just read one about grace kelley
 well the oth- the other instance i think of their inability to to handle things the cholera
 
 houston
 uh-huh
  how   about that 
 regardless of the racial makeup
 okay
 uh-huh
  people just 
  uh-huh 
 is it
 some kids are really having it
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 it's not getting any better
 i have a pretty good mathematical concept for what's involved
 oh
 right
 that's okay
 what i hate is
  right 
 uh-huh
 right
 uh-huh
 no
 that's right
 uh-huh
 yeah
 do you have children in
 you don't think so
 how are we doing in recycling
 boom
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 no
 utah is a pretty state from what i remember of it
 uh-huh
 bye-bye
 same to you
 no
 that's basically eastern european jewish food
 true
 no
 we are this weekend going to go see dance with wolves
 that's a big deal in texas too
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 yes
 
 
 i don't think they like the fact that i have one either
 you have
 i've noticed people doing that down here too
 if you like wildlife it's a fabulous vacation
 uh-huh
 they
 bye-bye
  yeah
 i understand that
  uh-huh
 yeah
 my baby-sitter would take them and then pick them up
 i'm from utah area
 now grapes are the ones that you have to pull all that off
 yeah
 okay
 my goodness
 right
 if you want to play tennis or racquetball
 are you married at all
 uh-huh
 and i remembered seeing some of these things coming through at rush hour even with the tee
 but
 i had very flexible hours
 yeah
 um
 it sounds wonderful
 i just tell the credit card company don't pay the charge
 so it was it was you know the best
 uh-huh
 no
   that could be 
 yeah
 uh-huh
 i don't blame you not nowadays
 not really
 yeah
 uh-huh
 the others were hand me downs through the families
  yeah
 and we've been in a drought for the last five years
 
 yeah
 yeah
  huh-uh 
 when they were growing up
 
 you never know
 
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
  going to 
 she's gorgeous
 uh-huh
 slow down a little bit
 
 they stay up until all hours of the night
 i'm pretty sure he was this past season
 so it's it's always nice to see people that like each other
  uh-huh 
 you may get a cold snap or two or some rain or something like we've been getting in december
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 i was cau-
 right
 is it
 in dallas yet
  it's time to  replace it
 uh-huh
 something my husband
 you're right
 yes
 
 that's a good point
 right
 i'm in a book club
 i never did that
 shrivels up and dies
 it's called the christian music station or something like that
 huh-uh
 uh-huh
 yeah
  yeah 
 they've got sixty or so of iraq's planes
 you've got to see it especially since you have a german
 even the bench warmer i would
 which is everybody that i know
  the take 
 the golden delicious were fantastic this year
 
 right
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 you work for five six seven
 i've never been to texas
 wayne's world hey man
 i haven't been to mexico or canada or
 okay
 or something
 i'll have to keep that in mind
 how many kids do you have
  right 
 yeah
 they were just pressed aluminum
 i know
 oh
 do you exercise a lot
 it's a special occasion
 it does
 not yet at all
 that's great
 the thing about when it gets hot here is i don't like the humidity
 yes
  bye now 
 right
 uh-huh
 stupid
 green
 not right now
  yeah 
 which ones
 oh
 yeah
 yeah
 right
 the only gripe i have is performance
 it was very very difficult
 uh-huh
 i don't have any friends that have the disease
 i i
 i'm sure there's a lot of people that have had
 yeah
 uh-huh
 you talked about thanksgiving there are interesting meals at different times
 
 let's talk about the baby
 that would be even
 i'm not real familiar with that
 yeah
 yeah
  oh 
 okay
 right
 right
 yeah
 neither one of us do
 that same house here would probably cost three-quarters of a million dollars
 uh-huh
 i know
 they don't take any stands on anything
 uh-huh
 what
 
 you too
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 i
 yeah
 all he saw was my hair
 now they go to a state college
 yeah
 i don't know
 yeah
 i felt like we roughed it then
 yeah
 
  i 
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 that's for sure
 they just totally wrote it off their book
 yeah
 i agree
 use different words instead i think
 
 okay
 i know a woman who's just wonderful at that
 that is true
  we- 
 well i agree with the boredom of the election process
  right 
 yeah
  by  the thought that i have to support
 oh
 it's a crystal
 okay
 and uh you know i- i was amazed cause i'd pick up a local paper and i'd read about all of these you know really interesting things going on
 that's what i would do too
 
 okay
 good luck in your car hunting
 it didn't show me anything
 put a little bitty portable computer in there and a plasma display
 uh-huh
 no
 uh-huh
 you too
 do you all just sort of chip in and help out with stuff when you are there
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 right
 you've been to the city
 
  nay
 yeah
 yeah
 
 excuse me
 she was my favorite character on there
 uh-huh
 that's true
 my husband wants to go into medical school and be a neurosurgeon
 uh-huh
 yes
 yeah
 uh-huh
 yeah
 debates would come up up there in massachusetts and you know in that area over uh air pollution
 uh-huh
 right
 yes
 exactly
 if it was it would probably have to be a pattern
 not this bill
 yes
 uh-huh
  i think so 
 uh-huh
 yeah
 really
 every morning
 how high are the taxes going to be when my children are my age
 she said it's getting too big for us to take care of
  too much of a  difference
 yeah
 we just went ahead and laid them down
 yeah
 they could go visit them during the day
 i was just saying that way
 uh-huh
 everything had a little bit of curry in it
 you are very very much aware of what goes on
 i
 i watched all three games of that
 he doesn't really like mine let alone another one
 nice talking to you
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 really
 uh-huh
 yeah
 
 yeah
 in denver
 yeah
 it's hard to know what the good movies are anymore
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 it's very successful for some of
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 they say
 when you're too old to do anything else go play golf
 
  on his 
 that's what i heard
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 if you get junk mail on a regular basis from any particular company you can
 how
 uh-huh
 that's what i've heard yeah
 yes
 yeah
 i'm real
 that's right
 yes
 uh-huh
 yeah
 that's right
  i don't know
 how about you
 have you painted anything recently
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 you just
 you kind of
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
 i guess if i did maybe i would
 uh-huh
 see
 i voted absentee one year
 most really care in this center really care
 who's going to pay for mine
 give an incentive
 we stayed right on the same track with each other
 they not only give me a demonstrator but the hardware as well as the software
  uh-huh 
 uh-huh
  it's a  hard question
 really
 lawn mower broke
 we both have older cars
   i went to metropolitan a couple of years ago
 uh-huh
 it's kind of scary
 oh
 
 did you read tom clancy's a clear and present danger
 
 she always lived here in the south
 that would be wonderful
 yeah
 i don't know who that guy is
 
 yeah
 right
 if enough of the public
 yeah
 yeah
 you have a good day
 i
 who do you think
 uh-huh
 yeah
  uh-huh 
 yeah
 one place i think i didn't take her
 right
 i can go ahead and start
 they had a free day  at kindercare 
 both my mother's parents and my father's parents were immigrants
 no
 uh-huh
 but not
 you almost have
 yeah
 it can be very educational
 uh-huh
 he learns from the older boys too
 you just have to go once a year
 uh-huh
 i am
 they couldn't put anything in it hardly
 
 the only trouble is that you can afford to go anywhere
 yeah
 uh-huh
   so much more to learn now that it really makes it more difficult i would think
 yeah
 that's exactly the kind of thing i would have said
 uh-huh
 they really impress me
 that by doing that we'll be free
 yeah
 i don't think they're in a conspiracy
 that you'd heard or that you owned an album of
 yeah
 rather than a home
 uh-huh
 what is that sound
 uh-huh
  what  is your problem
 it was really very official
 you know at least you get out of here at three
 marvelous
 uh-huh
 purple buddy
 yeah
 i still watch cartoons sometimes every once in a while
 yeah
 yes
 okay
 everything here
 it took that long
 yeah
 generally then i dress you know nicer
 yeah
 organizations to do
 it might be advantageous to do that
 yeah
 i guess i'd would like to see somebody like yeltsin to get more power
 i think we ought to worry about our own species
 a big le baron
 right
 paper just seems so innocuous
 yeah
 yeah
 no
 they're kind of low to the ground after driving the explorer
 it
  yeah
 yeah
 i think that's where they hit most of us
 ooh you took on a
 right
 i have
 and you got to have it
 uh-huh
 to minnesota
 oh
 huh-uh
 they're
 yeah 
 isn't that interesting
 
 yeah
 yes
 we put them out for people
 walk down the street and
 it sure is
 right
 my immediate reaction is that it's some sort of strange phone message
 that's right
 matter of fact if anything she's worse
 they really are
 yeah
 oh
 right
 what
 so
 yeah
 but we're still experiencing a very uneven
 what is it
 yeah
 yeah
 
 that's just great
 uh-huh
 yes
 yeah
 i hardly drive
 after it came out
 oh
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 do you think most states have that
 uh-huh
 depend
 oh
 sensors and things like that
 in new hampshire
 oh
  right 
 
  okay
 uh-huh
 i didn't realize it would melt so easily
 there's so many different ways to catch fish
 sure 
 pets get like that don't they 
 i think it worked out very very well
 there you go
 yeah
 uh-huh
 cold or something
 that was another funny thing
 right
  it's just so well done
 yeah
 that just bugs me to death
 yeah
 there's a little more craziness down there
 i said a few things to him when i got home
 do you
 yeah
 yeah
  yeah 
 oh
 yeah
 it's going to be a short conversation because i agree with you
 it certainly does
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 right
 so do we
 uh-huh
 gosh
  i wish i were dealing with baudelaire 
 boy i have  to hunt them down
 the drug problem that's another one
 you can tell
 ye-
 absolutely
 
 is that what you're saying
 with
  uh-huh 
 no
 uh-huh
 it's more spirited  
 that's an excellent movie
 some i guess like
 i'm a student
 it is
 uh-huh
 yep
 uh-huh
 you did that recently too uh
 huh
 it's a sad story
 i'm for anything that cleans up the air or the water or or or anything
 mister mom
 uh-huh
 yeah
 but i think the hardest thing to do is whenever you've got a person who's mentally very alert and active and their body just hasn't kept up with them and i think that's in a way it's more some an area where some of the day care uh
 right
 grass
 yeah
 it was a le baron with everything on it
 
 and and just very happy to get that
 
 they definitely do
 what can they do about the oil burning over in kuwait
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 i'm a summer person i like the heat
 they're usually more afraid of you than you are of them usually
 uh-huh
  right 
 it's true
 uh-huh
  uh-huh 
 it's really ridiculous
  uh-huh 
 
 uh-huh
 if you'll take lessons the first thing they put in your hand is an iron
 now they're down into the hundreds nineties
 it was horrible
 yeah
 okay
 oh
 yeah
 but it took our total time
 yeah
 i've
 huh-uh
 yeah
  a  difference
 right
 i think it's going to
 uh-huh
 no
 uh-huh
 sure
 i know
 uh-huh
 that's sort of like what truman had
 that's very true
 i thought that was a real unusual thing
 simple as that
 it's one thing to send grass there
 exactly
 it's completely trivial to for instance listen in on someone's car phone or walk around phone since they're just radio signals
 uh-huh
 that's okay
  magic 
 
 
 people donate more money
 she knows something right that she  
 have you been sailing
 yeah
 yeah
 we have that here too
 it's beautiful
 i work for t i
 my wife and i feel that we never have a moment that we can call our own
 you're not kidding
 yeah
 yeah
  bye-bye 
 it's too
 you
  uh-huh
 i know
 uh-huh

 yeah
 and and c- came  
 our house is kind of on a little hill
 where did you go to school
 yeah
 you know
 agreed
 sure
 yeah
 she thinks it's wonderful
  you're  going to have on extra expenses for car
 is that how they do it at t i maybe
 okay
 uh-huh
 usually in the week i'm  
 yeah
 yes
 yeah
 right yeah
 it was fairly expensive though
 they were very good
 yeah
 that's
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 me too
 yeah
 my next oldest daughter that's in college in california is a world twirling champion
 uh-huh
 really
 that sounds good
 personally
 like when you're in a bad part of italy or something
 
 it's when
 i don't live in a house
 
 i grew up in oak cliff
 uh-huh
 that didn't last long  
 she had to label everything
 what would happen if the   required young people to do service to the country
 yeah
 yeah
 which was a chocolate sack
 we just have the basic right now
 good
 i'll probably talk to you again
 yeah
 
 yeah
 do you do a lot of camping
  then the only advise passed  down is don't go to georgia tech
 i agree
 good
 it all depends on what i'm fishing for and the time of day
 yeah
 i don't know now
 yeah
 you can
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 of course it wasn't sunny like it is here
 right
 what do you have
 this isn't for me
 yeah
 i know
 yeah
 
 yeah
 are full and there is nowhere else to put our garbage
 i don't either
 wow
 do you have any children
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 huh
 uh-huh
 yeah
 i like people like neil diamond and
 what about you
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 it's lazy
 yeah
 maybe they gave up that right when they committed the crimes
 uh-huh
 what was that
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 um there's a large minority population
 they were fourteen pounds and
 uh-huh
 that's right
 sorry about my mind
 they do
 it takes a lot of training and a lot of abuse to get a dog to really  respond 
 uh-huh
 i would love to
 uh-huh
 different times
 
 
 i saw on one of the talk shows this woman judge i believe from florida
 oh well actually yes
  uh-huh 
 it's it's the uh ongoing acid rain problem
 yes
 we-
 i guess so
 yeah
 the thing that worries me about that is that if you just raise salaries across the board you're going to be
 right
 yes
 uh-huh
 
 yeah
 okay
 
 i thought he was great
  yeah
 more so supported them when they got home
 he ought to be able to perform
 many more deaths have occurred in and dealing with coal plants then ever around nuclear plants
 i see
 as a crime free zone any longer
 but it seems to be getting worse and worse
 you won't even
 yeah
 yeah
 that's a
 oh
 that's about all i have
 you will not pay your bill at the end of the month
  right 
 one of these twelve by forty-eight's that got repoed
 they've been there eight years
 i work for  n i s t 
 
 okay
 no
 uh-huh
 their room and board
 some evenings are worse than others
 right
 yeah
 no earthly idea
 joe pros
 just because of exactly what you said
 uh-huh
 i really can't get into that
 i just bought a car
 i just don't see the designer's
 no
 uh-huh
 i don't know
  yeah 
 they're people who farm on the hillside and then leave the hillside to another hillside and farm on that hillside
 it's fairly easy and fast
 yeah
 because we have to go down uh once a year here in maryland and get out car's exhaust systems checked for emission content
 
 right
 yeah
  i don't know 
   temporary
 i don't know
 you don't have to put it down
 uh-huh
 yeah
  i have been just  so happy
 i don't know
 oh
 he tried to make bagels one time
 uh-huh
 
 depends on what you consider expensive
 there's too many lawsuits
 are we picking him up every saturday
 exactly
 do you like to make your own guacamole
 yeah
 boy he's a big one
 have you
 uh-huh
 yeah
 people would always bring them when they go to the countries
 oh
 yeah
 okay
 like you say you bowl
 yeah
 uh-huh
 i'm not sure how we get that
 we couldn't find a place to camp
 i see what you're saying
 right
 i got one at work that i bought for one of the guys there at work
 yeah
 in the summers
 right
 boy i tell you
 rugby is definitely big in college
 yeah
 he might see it one day
 that's true
 yes
 do you have the overcrowding in your prisons that we are facing down here
 yeah
 that's right
 yeah
 i had rather do other things
 coronary cholesterol and chlorine
 hold on one second
  uh-huh 
 
 i didn't realize that there were groups that go in like that
 life is  so much more enjoyable
 
  bye-bye 
 yeah
 it just really gets way
 major
 okay
 they withhold what they're supposed to and at the end of the year it's not enough
 huh
 i know
 
 you do it
 okay
 they just don't care
 i don't want to go there
 i sure don't
 right
 it's a scream
 i appreciate it
 or something like that
 just about any kind of music
 uh we've got
 right
 quantum leap
 yeah
 it's more high tech
 uh-huh
 she'd much rather be here with me
  i think so too 
 
 he may uh-huh
 oh
 uh-huh
 yeah
 is that right
 last weekend we went to six flags saturday
 okay
 uh-huh
 be-
 i just i think it's a bigger risk than
 you could take a little longer  and  just watch a little bit more i guess
 
 they're dealt with
 he didn't have a problem with reading
 yeah
 really
 it is interesting
 that sounds good
 uh-huh
 
 no
 yeah
 yeah
 in the salt water
  i've  got some onions out
 and i d- drive uh
 yeah
 i'll bet
 right
 i just like willie nelson i guess because he's such a character
 i'm a graduate student
 it's real easy to get isolated in your own little community
 i don't want to have to mess with it
 i'm wondering with the boom down here
 where do you live
 that's correct
 yeah
  in politics 
 uh the causes of crime
 
 it really is
 
 uh-huh
 i'd like to start sewing again
 my goodness
 sure
 all things being equal yes
 i have friends that pay about nine hundred dollars for a town house in
 those people that i know
 i really like
 uh-huh
 
 uh-huh
 right
 yeah
 
 the numbers
 uh-huh
 there has been so much work done already
 right
 why don't you start
 uh-huh
 okay
 let's see
 yeah
 when did you first come to texas
 it makes it so much lighter
 uh-huh
 i'm doing fine
 yes
 everybody should be able to have surgeries that will save their lives or things that will make their life more comfortable verses than just the rich people that can afford to pay or to work for corporations that have wonderful health benefits
 my grandparents and all my relatives are from wisconsin
 my friend had a v w rabbit
 uh-huh
 
 i've heard too many people say i hate it here
  yeah
 yeah
 right
 that's true
 right
 or what you read
 it's too late then
 yeah
 is that true
 a nifty idea
 by the  campsite it's so
 no
 but we just talked a lot
 that's right
  to worry about it 
 those milk cartons take up so much room
 uh-huh
 she was in the house
 you've got to work for a living
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 do forestry work
 uh cause they clean the uh the lenses for cameras
 because they're boring
 no
 they do intimidate
 uh-huh
 you feel invigorated
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 seems that way yeah
 that's true
 yeah
 yeah
 used to go on
 well i know of number of people that are in the in the uh school district an- down in in uh san antonio
 yeah
 yeah
 sounds good
 uh-huh
 that's possible
 they
 yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 yeah
 i don't know what that is
 that's the one i was thinking of
 we wanted it to be as authentic as possible
 huh
 if you're going to go to a college where student faculty ratio is three and four hundred to one i don't think you're going to have as meaningful of a college experience as if you're down to the thirty to forty to one
 yeah
 it was interesting
 okay
 they love to play with kids
 yeah
 bye-bye
 yeah
 we managed to get to one
 uh-huh
 yes
 it
 you take a look at the output at the same time
  no 
 we are
 no
 too bad the mavericks couldn't get him
 yeah
 yes
 that is right
 we like that
 what branch were you in
 yes
 really
 it's really sad
 uh-huh
 right
 yeah
 uh-huh
 right
 do we get enough news or something like  that 
 that's right
 right
  uh-huh 
  yeah
 uh-huh
 and fievel goes west
 what
 for about four weeks
 yeah
 okay
 does he
 yeah
 yeah
 our house in castroville was the first one too
 some years back
 i don't know why
 yeah
 sure
  yeah 
 i'm just taking the other side so we'll have a discussion here
 yeah
 really
 i don't think it had to do to with woman running against man
 how has it been this week for you
 yeah
 there are some smart ones out there
 that's right
 i've never been past ohio
 and yet there's
 uh-huh
 huh-uh
 i know they asked in the topic for ideas on how to control crime
 and she'll be wearing my clothes
 uh-huh
  bye
 i don't
 that's true
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 i
 yeah
 course they keep saying the weather's going to change and we're going to have more florida type weather up here
 yeah
  uh-huh 
 management
 
 good good prices good good food there
 yeah
 indeed i found myself restricting my viewing to a couple of hours a day one in the morning and one in the evening
 uh-huh
 i hear of one every now and then
 yeah
 yes
 yeah
 yeah
 
 they're about three hours away if you go due north
 i'll fix the porch up with pumpkins for halloween and christmas
 
  have  you done anything like that
 yeah
 right
 yeah
 that's changing
 there's
 plano
 what ages are they
 yeah
 i guess that's it
 i did the dance step when i lived up in michigan
 that's right
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 where we are not allowed to
 
 it was
 yeah
  uh-huh 
 yeah
 i do that also
 the
 yes he is
 
 yeah
  yeah
 it was really nice
 yeah
 i grew up in michigan
  yeah 
 yeah
 what would we like to say
 that one
  yeah 
 uh-huh
 so you listen to kind of church music gospel
 i don't know what he's going to be in austin
 uh-huh
 yeah
 this is pretty well where l b j and audelia skillman cross
 which is i think what they also don't know
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 they have done a beautiful job
 some of them in the penal system
 right
 i read that half where she was in her later years
 didn't you
 that will go down and come up easily
  wow 
 because they're enclosed
 i don't believe in hunting
 to commute to work
 uh-huh
  uh-huh 
 me too
 that must be tough
 
 we're from the north
 i've been on a few juries
 yeah
 most of the area where we live in most of the kids have cars
 yeah
 right
 die
 i get tired of newspaper littering the garage
 
 i don't know what new york does about theirs
 yeah
 yes
 which has made us as lot more stable
 
 yeah
 right
 i don't know how else to explain it
 but uh then don't
 yeah
 i think
 uh-huh
 i was trying to get my children quiet for a minute
 yeah
 i don't think there's very much of a threat there today
 someone could be sentenced to thirty-five years
 yeah
 
 have i
 i have a younger daughter now
 it really was
 they had left her on the bus closed up all afternoon
 it's not quite that simple
 i read the wall street journal
 uh-huh
 
 we're supposed to talk about lawn and garden
 right
  down there 
 yeah
 then we decided to have kids
 that's really true
 yeah
  and  parking it and sitting inside and watching t v
 blacksburg
 he didn't apply to any school further
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 that's because he's probably doing what i do worrying about
 i think our five minutes is about up anyhow
 i've never done that one before
 yeah
 yeah
 very much
 
  yeah 
 that's right
 looking for arrowheads and
 how do you feel
 it's just like a sesame street
 i can't complain about it because i haven't used it
 yes
 
 that's your weekend
 i guess we're  the same age then
 yeah
 
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 yeah
 because i didn't take it in right away and let a whole year go by
 i really was surprised when it ended so quickly
 
 right
 that's true
 it sure is
 no
 wow
 yeah
 me too
  yeah 
 uh-huh
 do you have brothers
 that's true
 right
 so uh
  uh-huh 
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 you still can see well
 no
 it's a
 a matter of fact he's never seen without his jacket to the suit on buttoned
 they're blurred
 i'm pretty simple right now
 yeah
 what my husband had very strong feelings
 that's true
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 it was fun
 all the sounds of the karate chops flying through the air
  yes 
 yeah
 okay
 no
 uh-huh
 she had a son that was epileptic from birth
 bye-bye
 yeah
 that's really about it
   really
 she doesn't mind when we cover up her eyes
 where do you live
  
 a-
 i think they're looking after their own self preservation more than they're actually looking after the good of the country
 
 yeah
 oh
 uh-huh
 yeah
 that's right
 and so the drain on the family
 you don't see things thrown away
 yeah
 that's pretty neat
 uh-huh
 what kind of wok do you have
 back on the italian we went to some place across from collin creek mall that absolutely putrid for italian food
 i
 right right
 
 
 he will get up
 do you know how to use them in your life or to influence
 then they should be  
 you're talking when you think about price it's several thousand dollars lower than the comparable honda or nissan or something along those lines
 yeah
  i'm  originally from pennsylvania
 yes
 that's pretty out there
 okay
 you think i could spend my money
 i really came to love san diego and feel very
 uh-huh
  uh-huh 
 i'm not real sure what the
 my family was real liberal
 but i just don't trust people now
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
  yeah 
 yeah
 uh-huh
  tourist  attraction
 very well because now the adults are more aware of it
 it's hard on the car
 it was great talking with you
  foreign  aid
 i think that would be interesting
 and they they do some pretty good news
 i read that too
 right
 anything extra
 nice talking with you too
 we pay five percent sales tax
 uh-huh
 exactly
 yeah
 that
 yeah
 yeah
 that's great
 i know it
 nobody can have this many relatives
 something that we can just cook in a hurry after we get off work
 
 uh-huh
 i imagine
 huh
 no
 there was too many people too many
 i agree
 i can't remember how far in advance we reserved
 then they need to be watched carefully
 yeah
  uh-huh 
 who
 the quantities what are good for you what isn't
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
  you know something
 uh-huh
 yeah
 
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
  yeah 
 i've got two little ones

 oh
 those are the ones that i really really hate too
 no
 yeah
 that sounds good
 yeah
 we have kroger but not a skaggs
  right 
 yeah
 uh-huh
 yeah
 right

 no
 which was different
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 and that's his station so i call it the jeezer music
 as long as i have a shower nearby i'm fine
 did you get the booklet on how to get the gifts and all
 i don't know
 
 it was good talking to you
 yeah
 yeah
  that  come
 yes
 bye-bye
 uh-huh
 yeah
 women have come into the work force in the last twenty thirty years
 gosh
 you look at all these candidates that want to become president
 uh-huh
  that  sounds great
 i was never into those movies either
 yeah
 that's true
 really
 taxes
 have you seen the mov-
 i think it
 we haven't seen that one
 yeah
  huh 
 yeah
 yeah
 so i think you can have both
 good luck in your car buying
 yeah
 that's right
 yeah
 we haven't
 uh-huh
 and black and white
 uh-huh
 they're
 yeah
 yeah
  rome new york 
 right
  uh-huh 
 yeah
 you mean the clocks
 i think then you have to replace it with other things
 
 yeah
 thanks
 yeah
 i see
 uh-huh
 that's the
 finance
 that's what you're saying
 yeah
 i don't think it's something that people really think about either
 
 it'll be comfortable
 uh-huh
 some sort of program or
 uh-huh
 they weren't like any of the mexican american or black people i had gone to school with
 uh-huh
 bye bye
 yeah
 yes
 really
 i don't know whether uh you classify the skylark and the calais as
 still need a little bit of space
 me
 that's great
 i think i look better
 i know
  which  i would like to see rather than so many kids getting out of school
 i
 they liked it
 oh
 i have never played in any tournament except just a scramble
 yeah
 yes
 uh-huh
 yeah
 we camp year round
 do you know
 exactly
 
 i like that kind of stuff
 we- because i she loves she's one of those that loves th- outside
 yeah
 
 um
 uh-huh
 let's see
 yeah
 yeah
 i don't think that many by the builder that built this house
   sure  
 uh-huh
 yes
 yeah
 the last one was back down to lubbock texas
 uh-huh
 wow
 i tried the news magazines like time newsweek u s news and world report
 people are too different
 no
 it's fun
 how long does it keep
 i can't
 i measured it one time
 which she doesn't allow them to watch the soapies
 
 uh-huh
 yeah
 i was smarter than most of the people that i was working for
 i'm a former t i-er
 yeah
 radio
 uh-huh
 yeah
 sure
 is all we paid for cars in those days
  okay 
 no
 that's frightening too
 uh-huh
  i get  through
 right
 yeah
 
 right
 sure
 right
 
 yeah
 i know
  that's 
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 right
 but uh
 about the last thing i did
 
 we live out in the country
 instead of
 yeah
 sure
 you essentially need to have someone taking care of the person full-time
 yeah
 you did it manually
 it really would
 for the dorm
 yeah
 hundred miles due east of here
 has affected you personally
 isn't it amazing that somebody can write that many books
 it seems like you could see it through about three layers of paint
 yeah
 have you been down there
 i read usually that kind of stuff
 it's just
 yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
  nobody talks about it 
 yeah
 where are you from in california
 no
 that's real important to little kids
 yeah
 i had to cut some of the sides down
 uh-huh
 where do you work
 they're real good
 yeah
 it's very pleasant
 
 and they take their girls
 it can get very expensive
 yeah
  something new 
 right
 
 uh-huh
 and i said no somebody
 was it hard when you first came
 uh-huh
 it has taken on a more profound
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 upstate new york
 that's right
 huh-uh
 
 yeah
 i don't recall that they have any female anchors
 to the heat
 yes
 uh-huh
 to be able to use it or a day during the week or something
 right
 i have got to hit it
 uh-huh
 you know what i mean
 really
  i know how that goes 
 yeah
 nowadays with the way the income tax i think housing is strictly to itemize
 are you a t i
 no
 some danielle steel
 how far west have you been
 i don't think so
 yeah
 exactly
 it's a big problem
 uh-huh
 i was a photographer before
 wow
 yeah
 yeah
  you've got to
 yeah
 
  because we're  both originally from this part of the country
 speaking of that i think terminator two is supposed to be out
 you
 uh-huh
 
 uh-huh
 something sweet
 i never made one for myself though
 yeah
 
 yeah
 here we go
 come in handy
 congress woman
 yeah
 uh-huh
 
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 
 it's one of the few times i wanted more news than
  huh 
 right
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 i am
 don't answer your phone hello
 i guess
 i hope you know more about it than i do
 uh-huh
 first thing i did was turn the tv on
 uh-huh
 hey listen if i had my way i wouldn't pay my taxes
 uh-huh
 yeah
 oh
 this is betty
 is it
 it's taken a long time to break away
 he had to redo that too
 they are in there but they are real spooky
 i think that's difficult on them
 uh-huh
 yeah
 right
  i
 oh
 oh
 how about you
 yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 i don't even know who won the pennant last year
 
 uh-huh
 what do you do there
 do you wish you
 yeah
 yeah
 no
 i don't even know the name of the river there
 
 that is such a nice thing
 there's nothing wrong with that
 bring it home and
 within our family we have said
 
 you do
 as well as a lot of the explosives we were running into
 i check the scores the next morning
 yeah 
 uh-huh
 and and for campaign that's it
 right
 uh-huh
 i can't think of what school he went to
 it's just when you
 i guess that's when it was
 you never think about that do you
 uh-huh
 i think if i had to come home and then go somewhere i'd never make it
 kind of like the cowboys
 are you familiar with it
 sure
 uh-huh
 i tend to eat expensive food
 they're cute
 big boom
 it's very sophisticated
 uh-huh
  yeah 
 i used to watch
 yeah
  yeah 
 that's neat isn't it
  yep 
  uh-huh 
 oh
 and uh it it was prev- she she did pretty well
 i mean you know if i was setting up a daycare there would be so many needs you would have to customize your service to
 yeah
 uh-huh
 lot of places have tho-
 yeah
 they'd be ready to vote 
 why not
 you need metal instead of plastic
 yeah
 yes
 the school thing might be changing
 oh okay
 i guess i'm the one just supporting most of the others
 i wish i did
 yeah
 getting to see the same women every morning
 yeah
 uh-huh
 called gondolas
 there's less of a sense of privacy
 yeah
 yeah
 we could not find anything that had any kind of redeeming value in it
 i would say no
 right
 yeah
 public school
 right
 yet your absolutely right
 right
  good talking to you 
 it's
 yeah
 i don't know
 uh-huh
  stuff up 
 it was kind of sad
 yeah
 yeah
 
 no
 uh-huh
 there okay
 i think that it's time that we concentrate more on what's going on within our own borders than what's going on in the middle east
 yeah
 yeah
 it was it was the funniest thing
 are you a bible fan too
 that would be my answer of an easy way to get these guys out of there for twenty years
 what's amazing is some of them have been on death row for a number of years
 i've never
 kind of cuts your possibilities for the flower beds
 yeah
 yeah
 i can't remember exactly what it was
  uh-huh 
 
 they're really trying to get you into that situation because they know they've really got you then
 uh-huh
 yeah
 those are fascinating to me
 
 it doesn't
 it's just
 yeah
 yeah
  yeah 
 she never really had a chance to work
 i enjoy them to a degree
 yes
 if him and his wife weren't getting along
 uh-huh
 
 i know
 i guess i take it for granted kind of because i just
 they're testing that
 
 right
 yeah
 uh-huh
 bye
 oh
  it  is obvious
 uh our children are both uh basically adults
 right
     shock you
 that's their marketing
 uh-huh
 
 there's a couple now that i tend to want to watch
 uh-huh
 yeah
 that is right
 really
 right
 years ago it would have been fine
 it's free
 right
 he's a very considerate person
 yeah
 right
  is so much more serious then when we  were younger
 yes
 behind us
 oh
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 okay
 worked at a camp there
 okay
 okay
 those are real
 no
 the snow up here is really kind of starting to melt now
 right
 in fact it puts it out on tuesdays and thursdays
 you have a bonus
 yeah
 uh-huh
 do you
 tends to tends to strap only the legitimate people
 uh-huh
 all right
 i guess that would be good
 yeah
 yeah
 you can make laws against corruption
 uh-huh
 hi
 yeah
 you look very odd in the water
 yeah
 they keep on dying
 when i married i thought i'd be married the rest of my life
 
 right
 i think it would be that
 they are my favorite team too
 yeah
 sure
 he ended up with about three sets of tools in order to work on that fool thing
 gosh
 yeah
 hi
 for like groceries we say about this much per week
 my parents live in boston
 really
 uh-huh
 if i ever decide to tune it in again
 
 very much so
 they never
 so i'll be faced with having to return that product and uh hoping that uh you know that they will accept it
  yeah 
 no
  uh-huh 
 right
 not personally
  that is good 
 it's not going to be wholesale because of the cost
 that they make
 that's another one of my favorites
 
 no
 uh-huh
 bagels and lox
 uh-huh
 where they have to be working all the time
  uh-huh
 right
 uh-huh
  yeah
 that's   what i'm  saying
 right
   had-  
 i think you know i think in a lot of ways the law is good because it tries to to protect you know the people who are in the states
 that would be fun
 uh-huh
 we just recently moved to texas
 they never had some of the more fun classes i guess  
 yeah
 right
  yeah 
 uh-huh
 have to agree with you
 it is
 yeah
  uh-huh 
 they're even dark
 
 uh-huh
 that's pretty good
 have you
 
 i think you're right
 that's great
 huh
 that's exactly it
 yeah
 right
  bye 
 right
 
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
 two of them live real close to me
 my toyota did
 yeah
 
 okay
 uh-huh
 jeez
 uh-huh
 i think most shows were doing that
 you're not
 i think my parents took me there when i was real young

  uh-huh 
 vociferously
 yep
 wow

 oh
 they just moved on
 yeah
 i didn't much care  for the first one

 yeah
 i've just received some
 where do you live
 it just goes straight in there
 that was the one place where i was also able to do weight training
 mostly oldsmobiles
 you know how that is
 i'm not that up on the policy of ways
 no matter where you were you stopped and sat down and watched it
 where you from 
 yeah
 there's nothing in it you don't know
 they get loans and grants and scholarships and stuff like that
 no
 yeah
 are you from boston
 yeah
 if you give up then you can come live in our country
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 why didn't it work last time
  yeah
 she would go her way
 we just try not to pay any more in than we have to
 and mostly just movies when there's a good movie on
 in what way
  when you have  fish au gratin
 bye
 i have
 i think it was romain drive or romain street or something there in los angeles
 uh-huh
  because  you can't wear them here
 yeah
 uh-huh
 you do not have to give a telephone number
 yeah
 throw them in the back
 they're real fat little white things
 yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 right
 i presume that i do
 i think that's a nice gesture on the kuwaiti government part to do that
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 i
 i know it
 right
 we've never really been rained on the few times we've gone
 uh-huh
 call them the new orleans ain'ts any more
 uh-huh
 high

 our son-in-law is from panama
 exactly
 exactly
 i just had a baby
 i think it's a hundred years
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 i had my school do it

 i'm satisfied with the vacation
 i can't hear them
 our last daughter she did not want to go to school
 absolutely
  yeah 
 my husband is a hunter fisherman outdoorsman marlboro type person who had to have a sporting dog
 yeah
 right
 yeah
 right
 uh-huh
  you do it 
 i certainly don't remember my parents running me here and there and supporting me in all these things
 i'm willing to pay for that for my children
 yeah
 there's nowhere that you can go that you would have to be afraid
 yeah
 yeah
 
 certainly
  what does he charge me 
 type of thing
 i would think so if you only have one bathroom for three bedrooms
 yeah
 great nancy
 i don't know what my kids see any more
 uh-huh
 i saw that
 uh-huh
 okay
 but i do know of a way to get around the computer generated calls
 right
 i know what you mean
 i don't think there's been a magazine as they used to be even good housekeeping i don't
 
 yeah
 uh-huh
  right 
 his medical through his company
 i can't remember what the name of them   are either
 that sucks
 uh-huh
 she doesn't believe in the woman working unless she has to
 i didn't happen to see that
 oh uh
 
 yeah
 i know
 right
 i
 at no charge for a whole year that you will use it
 
 and my husband is a little bit of a male chauvinist
 i know there's not any food that you can get
 one of my favorite movies it's not one that i haven't seen
 yeah
 that's the word float
  yeah 
 uh-huh
 yeah
 i had one
 what's your view
 how far can you go with that one
 they've got a lot of special needs
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 sure
 it must be in
 i'm originally from oklahoma
  yeah
 uh-huh
 yes
 yeah
 i think we have too
 
  is that right 
 we do as a matter of fact
 you bet
 yeah
 uh-huh
 i am not a member of the national rifle association
 no
 they're twins born on the bicentennial
 it's a pretty nice neighborhood
 my husband would like to live there
 uh-huh
  uh-huh 
 roast marshmallows
 me too
 that's a good feeling
 uh-huh
 my children i have five children
 yeah
  because  i know she's going to have to face that
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 okay
 what color is your dog
  yeah 
 right
 you just felt gee if i weren't here
 
 i think we're lucky to have as good a coverage as we have i really do
 uh-huh
 one of these days we'll get down there although
 yes
 yeah
 we got that
 oh
 they ought to make them very reasonably  do something  outrageous to them
 he had a blue one before
 yeah
 yeah
 nice talking to you linda
 i know
 now i know another reason why i'm not going to get a c d player for a while
 yeah
 bye-bye
 that's true
 i think you could recover from a pistol but not from a shotgun
 i work for the government in washington
  uh-huh 
 wow
 you just
 that's a good size fish
 
 uh-huh
 yeah
 every year
 i'm fascinated by that
 most of the time
 and one thing she's trying to instill in kids um besides just reading and writing are just some the golden rules
 can you tell much difference between the local radio t v stations
 where'd you get the car
  his life  isn't worth very much then
 which most of them probably aren't
 uh-huh
 it's like they were using them as friends when we were having the conflict
 what's that
 yeah
 yeah
 okay
 i don't know
 sure
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
 knowing
 no
 let's see
 that's right
 i hate the eight and a half percent sales tax
  deed  for deed that
 they really ought to change the name i think in indianapolis
 they are
 that's one of the worst
 just more facts would be nice
 yeah
 i don't think they can
  uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 right
  right 
 i didn't like the way it ended though
 
 right
 sure
 uh-huh
 
 uh-huh
 yeah
 i think  that's  generally speaking pretty true
 although it is not killing that many people now it still has the opportunity to get out of control and become a huge problem
 who's going to come and build me a fence too
 oh
 i would say about ten or fifteen years ago i
 yeah
 yeah
 okay
 have you read that
 i think so too
 really
 i went to europe nineteen seventy-three

 uh-huh
 and and tell your wife i hope we i get her again sometime too
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 yeah
 that's about it
 i don't think i've read it
 yeah
 sometimes i think they carry it a little bit too far
 that's the kind of things  that throw you off
 i'm supposed to ask you how do you make use of your credit cards
 right
 uh-huh
 they're always wanting to go on a diet or something
 i'm glad that you're in the business
 yes
 i don't think it would
 i think most people are aware at least now common knowledge is that
 the
 yeah
 have you heard of that
 okay
 i
 right
 but we have been looking at these red chevro-
 
 how can you afford all of this
 the bedrooms are a little bit small except the master bedroom's a little bigger
 yes
 i have no idea
 
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 that's true
 uh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 do you have that where you live
 right
 uh-huh
  uh-huh 
 right
 it was supposed to be two dollars an hour for two kids
 it was just crazy enough for th-
 huh-uh
 that's
 
 we're hoping it takes off again
 it does
 you are talking about p o w or missing in actions
 yeah
 several people were supposed to bring
 it must be a somewhat different environment from a regular college
 right
 uh-huh
 what part of the country are you from
 yeah
 yeah
 
 yeah
 i will not read my lips or whatever
 
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
 right
 i was hoping he was going to get best actor

 uh-huh
 yeah
 that's right
 uh-huh
 yeah

 nina and cliff
 uh-huh
 bye-bye
 yeah
 wow
 yeah
 a lot of work
 yeah
 i know
 uh-huh
 right
 they actually show you what duckwork and things
 just never given back
 someone came home
 uh-huh
 right
 what is the woodward book you are referring to
 french horn is absolutely wonderful instrument
 it seems like we are doing it here forever
  a six  person jury could have decided either way of course
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 now i mean now there's i heard that they were going to start calling on saturdays or some-
 we go in
 anyone that would use chemical weapons to fight his own people
 yeah
 yeah
 all over the place
 banking
 yeah
 don't get a lot of particulates
 they go to jail
 
 i know
 that's a long time
 
 huh-uh
  uh-huh 
 for me
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
 we live in a little small town
 no
 the ninety-eight
 uh-huh
 yes
 uh-huh
 that's right
 you think you're getting your money's worth
 you all don't have any other children around there
 right
 uh-huh
 i had
 that's right
 
 uh-huh
  
  you get to 
 they need money so much because they're constantly having to  run 
  oh
 because it looked so formidable
 just start not even
 uh-huh
 two years
 do you do needlepoint also and cross stitching
 yeah
 
 yeah
 uh-huh
 i had to put my bifocals on to see it
 that's one of those few that i do watch when the television is on
  huh 
 we do oil well services
 yeah
 right
 yes
 it's  
 yeah
 my job kind of hinders me from exercising
 good
 are you a player
 have you ever been to biffin's
 that's true
 we're getting to where
 yeah
 
 it was aerobics and lifting weights three nights a week
 me too
  bye bye 
  yeah 
 let me turn off my stereo here
 yeah
 that's neat
 yeah that's true
 uh-huh
 it really does
 and they can show you the records they've gotten all their maintenance on schedule and everything like that
  yes 
 uh-huh
 right
 
 that's another bias
 
 they been trying these people now for twenty-two years ever since i was a child
 
 it doesn't pay well
 especially as rainy as it's been in the last couple of years
 bye-bye
 uh-huh
 of course my family and i
 it's going to look like
 some of my suits i haven't put on for
 i think i will enjoy cooking more when i am not working when i do not get home until five-thirty or six and i have to cook and clean up
 right
  yeah 
 yes
 that might help a little bit especially in some places
 no
  yeah 
 i get a kick out of that
 i
 
 
 uh-huh
 huh-uh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 
 as a matter of fact i prefer public television
  yeah
 actually seventeen now
 uh-huh
 hi cynthia
 few women in the class
 then a then a doctor type job
 yeah
 that's true
 uh-huh
 
 let somebody get something out of it
 i'm a government employee
 i took  a lot of my 
 
 i like to watch rock and roll videos and any kind of  videos 
 they were floating around
 uh-huh
 boy what a help that is
  and  training
 yeah
 no
 no
 that's true
 everybody's spayed
  that is neat 
 uh-huh
 oh
 that
  you  should just put down the basics and put n a where you don't want to answer
 that's true
 very much
 
 yes
 that they that they like pick on th- the advanced students and pay more attention to them
 right
 i'm living in that dorm
 yeah
 sure
 up on blocks
 yeah
 i miss it
 even the religious organizations
 all local
 yeah
 yeah
 i don't think i'd go to work without a bulletproof vest on myself  
 a lot of things
 you actually have to go up there
 yeah
 uh-huh
 bye-bye
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 yeah
 he does it every day like a ritual
 yeah
 huh
 uh-huh
 which is most unfortunate because we all lose out
 
 yeah
 of course
 uh-huh
 it was like we can't take it back
 we just couldn't
 yeah
 sure
 it gives it a little tang
  if it 
 yeah
 i think that was probably the last movie i've seen too
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 more than just seriously
 uh-huh
 atlanta and dallas are almost identical in every way weather and everything
 did i reach the dallas area
 okay
 to look through my things and not trust me
 uh-huh
 as far as brokers all i get calls from brokers in new york
 
 just to imagine that one day they're just going to turn around and someone is going to say we don't like you and start attacking again
 
 no
 
 i like that
 and for three months
 he's going to be working for chevron
 
 yeah
 i know i have to do more aerobics
 everybody
 okay
 
 right
 yeah
 have you seen the debit cards where they actually debit your account when you
 nope
  right 
 uh-huh
 right
 i think maybe more information should be given out about it
  and watch it on  monday night
 good
 i agree
 i know
 we have blueberries blackberries
 in fact this morning i was almost late for work because i'm almost at the end of this book
 not really because i'm listed in the phone book
 yeah
 right
 basically
 yeah
 we play r b i baseball on nintendo
 what was wrong with her was she not attractive enough did she not take good enough care of her man to keep his interest
 have you
 we have a separate area for the garden
 i'm a
 okay
  uh-huh 
 oh
 it carried over
  it's like  nothing to them
 yeah
 yeah
  i have a younger brother like that
  i  could possibly do it
 did someone just come up with this design
 when the
 good buddies
  uh-huh 
 either
 my son's in a performance tonight
 right
 uh-huh
 i'm saying that's how it was perceived
 which is not always true
 oh
 uh-huh
 in fact a lot of people will ride outside in the snow
 right
 that's the way
 yeah
 and the interest to the children
 uh-huh
 
 and then come home and get back into regular clothes again
 uh-huh
 yeah
 we had to call the insurance company
 no
 another problem is you're going to keep the smarter people in the system too long paying the wages they do
 right
 yeah
 no
 married
 yeah
 this was in louisiana
 i'm that way about a lot of different shows
 i didn't know we had one either
 yes
 
 yeah
 oh yes
 okay this person is taking drugs
 yeah
 what area of lakes do you like
 what are some of your favorite foods
  uh-huh 
 uh-huh
  uh-huh 
 as a matter of fact i can tell you something about that
 what i have always identified is i am basically good with money
  right 
  the thing
 uh-huh
 as we visited we were involved every weekend in just helping them redo this and refinish that
 uh-huh
 we'll start them inside
 yeah
 i'm still a full size person
 uh-huh
 oh
 yeah
 right
 uh-huh
 
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
 that's just it
 yeah
 what do you want to do
 uh-huh
 
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 right
  yeah  
 yes
 yeah
 yeah
 
 uh-huh
 gorgeous leaves and trees and all the lakes and the mountains and things
  but there's so many more people 
 i just finished james michener's texas book
 
 we wound up selling the house
 right
 you wonder about that sometimes
 uh-huh
 i think that was good
 i like the old-timey ones
  uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 really
 i'm sure that's true
 yeah
 i wonder
  it's like
  yeah
 i'm trying to get out
 i'm from new jersey originally
 
 and they would buy a plot of land and contractors and builders
 
 isn't that terrible
 yeah
 and so
 uh-huh
  that  would make me happy though
 yeah
 okay
 yeah
 yeah
  uh-huh 
  okay
 yeah
 i know
 yeah
 they're putting in fifty sixty hours a week
 you mean
  i think that's true
 i thought that was just great
 boy
 the standard old tuna fish
 absolutely
 right
 that
 yeah
 huh-uh
 
 and the uranium
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 i know that both of mine have probably learned quite a bit from there
 yeah
 eighty-six
 you only have to check in with the office once or twice a week
 how old is she
 that's why
 yeah
 
 right
 or
 i think that's just part of their overall educational process is to get out and see and do things
 yeah
 really
 that is true
 i think the greed of the eighties got
 uh-huh
 it's making me hungry for them
 oh
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 they're hos-
 yes
 i think they're wonderful
 it does every
 
 pardon me
 what's your favorite thing to cook if you're having a dinner party
 uh-huh

 yeah
 yeah
 i'm in lubbock texas
 
 bye-bye
 you too
 yes ma'am
 yeah
 if it ever touched my fam-
 
 yeah

 yeah
 yeah
 okay
 yeah
 we do that too
  doctor seuss 
 i don't know
 that's right

 yeah
 uh-huh
 i was led to believe that if you weren't t i that you get money

 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 fantastic experience
 that's true
 uh-huh
 uh-huh 
 right
 uh-huh
 i had one at t i and then one at another engineering company
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 everything happened during the sixties
 they're real neat
  yeah
 and have a real sense of priorities and that they can do anything and be anything both male and female  a lot 
 she's a female
 okay

 yeah right
 yeah
 it's a little tercel
 i can't quit smoking
 and the money magazines
 i tell you what
 the what
 or for those people in the tollbooth
 uh-huh
 that's a deterrent
 come about this time of year i am kind of ready for it to start getting spring
 absolutely
 yeah
 yeah
 just stinks
 i don't think it's the basic
 yeah
 wow
 how weird
 of just putting everything on there day after day after day
 
 that they
  no
 it's really good public relations for small schools
  she was alone with them 
 
 that makes me feel a little better
 there sure are
 uh-huh
 i really
 uh-huh
 
 yeah
 that's true
 yeah
 that is about it
 yeah
 oh
 it's really is a buyer's market there now

 okay
 yeah
 uh-huh
 right
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 yeah
 sure
 uh-huh
 huh-uh

 i think there's still a lot to be made though
 uh-huh
  no 
 last year it was the end of july
 on the ceiling
 uh-huh
 okay
 yeah
 have you had problems getting colors to match
 deal where a doctor was going to be sued for malpractice on the death on an infant
 that's right
 they're really good cars
 yeah
 i don't know
 uh-huh
  no 
 yeah
 but it's you know it's under so much control
 there's no doubt about it 
 of everything that i did i guess i enjoyed probably wallpapering the most
 i agree
 yeah
 do you know who chuck mangione is
 did they know that all along
 that was so cool
 me too on gun control
 oh
 then things improved right
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 the police don't catch them
 yeah
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 
 wow
 i hope you didn't have a big vacuum cleaner
 you think about aids research
 not a seventies baby
 uh-huh
 yeah i agree
 i didn't give away the whole thing
 me too
 huh-uh
 control is something that i wouldn't want the federal government to have
 gosh horrible stuff like that
 then you'll never leave
 was for tuna fish
 yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 yeah
 they portray things on t v obviously that they never would have years ago
  huh 
 yeah
 the first year i had to tell the kids not to pick them when they were red because they were supposed to be blackberries
 right
 uh-huh
 yeah
 especially the last few years
 goodness
 right
 uh-huh
 yeah
 they're cooperative rather than competitive
 yeah
 there was one guy that we tested for preemployment for drugs who absolutely swore up and down that it showed that he was using amphetamines
 kind
 yeah
 in our case it's like when you hire on they'll test you
 huh
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 yeah
 they know everything

 uh-huh
 my husband is a counselor

 eating all that hot food
 uh-huh
 afterwards and things

 uh-huh
 i know dupont and dow and several other chemical companies are working uh feverishly to try to come up with a substitute for fluorocarbons
