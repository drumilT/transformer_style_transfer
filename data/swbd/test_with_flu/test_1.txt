you're taking words and developing a picture in your mind
None
it's excellent
we haven't got children yet
i hope to set an example for ours that reading it can be your best friend
even if you haven't got a human friend around you can pick up a book and
i guess i'd better close now so i can
are you a teacher
i was
yeah
we think books are important around here
you have a good day
how do you feel about the way the u s has reacted in the middle east
it was favorable
i think the sanctions would have worked
it would of taken longer
and now with all this stuff coming out with woodward's book and everything
i saw a nightline program last night about all the funding of hussein's back as early as nineteen eighty-six
been a different turn
i don't think we projected what was going to happen after the war
it just came out i guess yesterday
and it says that colin powell was against an early
it seems like there's always some body digging things like that
i'm not for sure we know exactly what all happened in that situation
we were so fast to get over the vietnam whatever the vietnam syndrome is that now we've tied ourselves up there in the middle east for a long period of time
i was very against our involvement so quickly
if we had that good of a correlation through the united nations then they could have made sanctions work i'm pretty sure
we are i think
in we've just misread almost everything in that we always seem to be getting in bad with the wrong fellow for the next thing down the road
we don't tend to read israel correctly
i don't know
it's not going to be anything we're going to get out of very soon
being a historian you read all that clear back at least to the turn of the century with all the mess after the first world war
you're absolutely right
if we do find so-called experts in any area of the world we don't listen to them
i don't know
be interesting to keep watching i guess
i'm just afraid it's going
i'm not sure we're sensitive to other cultures
i happen to teach at a college with a tremendous number of international students
cultural diversity is just something we really don't understand
it needs to be taught from the earliest grades
with our school systems in such disarray i don't know it doesn't look terribly hopeful
i'm not sure it's something you can teach
you can at least
give them the awareness of the different cultures and at least let them know that other people do things differently than maybe in their own neighborhood
and when those people are around
you can get them to meet
we're all pretty much alike
it's something as i said won't go away
it will be a good topic for me in the class for along time
i teach history
what about the whole situation with the refugees the kurds
i would just think if bush was so successful in lining up the correlation to prosecute a war then he should be equally successful in getting that same correlation to push the united nations to somehow persuade those nations to give the kurds a homeland
what about the palestinians
that's the same thing
they haven't been waiting quite as long even though they've been waiting since forty-eight
that becomes a different matter simply because your dealing with israel
they seem to be more intractable than ever
that shamir can't retain his leadership if he backs down the slightest bit
i don't think there's anybody of major stature on the scene like the great statesman of the past
at least we thought they were
do you think the u s should even be involved as the world leader in the sense trying to resolve these issues
should we have just stayed out of it
i wish we could stay out of it
the oil is not going to allow us to
i'm not for sure that we're not destined at least for the foreseeable future as long as we can keep our own head above water to be the world leader
bush is probably if he can keep that correlation together especially the french and the british and the germans and be sure that the japanese can kick in some of their money
cold selves
i wouldn't have necessarily fought for the kuwaitis
nobody likes them in that part of the world
it's just such a volatile area
there's just no stability period
in a sense i don't know that i would say it's good
in a sense i'm glad that saudi wasn't more changed by the situation
i don't think it's our world to westernize the whole world
the fact that the saudi could just sort of pull back and remain culturally sort of clean is interesting
it's not our role to make everybody like us
it's just for those who may have wanted to travel in that part of the world that are up in the age i am it's going to eliminate that for awhile
i actually lived in beirut from sixty-eight to eighty-four
did you
it's been dangerous for sometime
i haven't been to beirut
i've heard what a wonderful city that
it's just totally gone to
that's it
it depends on whether one talks physical or sort of cultural
culturally it's obviously changed a lot
it's more of a survival city
the buildings are still intact and still beautiful
there's garbage when i left
it's just a different cultural aspect
the trucks don't come daily
you really don't want the garbage in your house
i traveled in the area too
that many of the countries turkey and syria are the same as they were for traveling
i've been to north africa a lot but not
i never could get a visa
even when things were good in the middle east americans weren't really given visas to go into baghdad
it's a very beautiful part very interesting historically of course which was my interest art history
i think we've done them a good job today then
he was checking to see if i was going to stay in because i've been so busy with this presidential search
have a good business trip
you continue
i think the republicans have taxed us just as much as the democrats
i don't think there's a change between one party than the other
i think we get a lot back
not as much as we should
i guess what i feel about it is that it's so mismanaged that there's got to be something
when we pay so much for the debt instead of using the money for where it ought to go it's ridiculous
what kills me is when they had a chance to put into action the glen- rub-
the gramm rudman act
what is it the act where they had to cut everything across the board they kept putting off doing that
i think they spend too much
they spend too much on themselves too
a lot of the taxes gets back to the members of the congress and everything all running for twenty years rather than
things like mailings
they don't try to conserve
of course here at home we end up conserving and conserving
when i don't have money i don't buy something
i think it is the congress and them just don't have any interest in saving us money
i don't know quite how to do it
i think we need to have the one line veto so that they don't have to spend so much time doing everything
if it's not so what
maybe it was connecticut
one of the small states up there where he had a bill through for a drug agency that would be located there
he was the only one that wanted it
he was going to build it in his home town
they were going to hire a lot of people
it was ridiculous the whole thing
that's right
they asked him about it
do you know that the drug agency doesn't want this
they do things that are just like the
the trouble is you have so little input about it
you don't know enough to know what to do about some of this stuff
they do what they want to do with it
the other thing about is i think limiting their time in office would be good
i just can't believe there aren't other people out there that could do just as well as what we've got
i've said it several times on different subjects about the government that two terms is enough for all of them
whether you're mayor all the way up city council the works i think certainly president that two terms is plenty
we get these professionals out of there
they have to learn how to earn a living again themselves rather than living off of us
that's right
i think people in general
the idea of what you need to exist is so outrageous that it's not hardly
it starts at the courts
it starts everywhere until we've just lost control of any kind of perspective about what is acceptable and what is not acceptable
it's so much money
you can't even add it up
you
our national debt in the trillions of dollars
you just
the other thing is it's all very well to give money to help other people
i think we need to do that
they need to put more limits on them
they've given that away for fifty years
i think that's probably unless we can afford it
i don't really mind helping people
you need to get rid of this thing that's just eating us up and get things on an even
if it were a family we'd be up before the magistrate
the government does it
it's all right
i know we're taxed to death on every thing
they don't even talk about that
they don't even consider it like you saying to cut something back
they are at least doing something now with the military
of course you know t i
you know that's hurting us although
t i has gotten a lot of good contracts from the war and everything else
and if they'll get a lot of programs in the future because of their exotic weapon systems
that's the only good that i've seen congress do and everybody and all the congressmen and the president and everybody
we're all going to have to do it
it just isn't fair though that when this happens in some places it needs to all come off everywhere
that's why i thought this is the time
they need to put that into action and show they mean business that they've got to cut costs
not the only but
i don't understand the present school thing
i have two daughters
one's about to be in high school
i think that paying for
i don't mind paying for school taxes even though my kids will be out of it
you just feel like it's out of control
then it just aggravates you
i agree with you
i think that's a wide open subject what you said
i think the people will here shortly
i think that's right
if they don't pull it in and start doing something i think they're really going to have to i think
i think the next time we have an election we need to try to get some of the ones that have been there forever out too what they did last election
ninety some odd percent of the same old boys got back in
we need to try to get people to two terms so they respect our wishes
that's what they're called they don't
maybe we can change and get us rid of some of those guys that are in there guys and gals whatever they are
there lot of places where it's worse than it is here
still you don't want it to get that bad good heavens
we need to try to get hold of it and have things be honest
i guess in the fact i don't really mind paying taxes
i would just like to know that they're not being foolishly spent that they're doing something that's positive for somebody
i don't really feel like i use taxes very much
you're right
i use them in roads and lot of things
i think one of the good ones in the metroplex in the last say twenty-five years or so maybe longer they've built all these dams
the corps of engineers soon as they finish a lake they'll get another one
we've had droughts here in long summers we've had good water supply
that's due to the corps of engineers looking years ahead and building all these reservoirs for us
the state actually did some good work in that a couple of years ago
sam johnson came out and talked to us about what they had done
they really had done some good work
there are a lot of places where they're in real trouble
i think it would be easy enough to be in trouble here too if they don't take that early stand
they need to start another one
the growth is fast enough so that they can't afford to just dawdle and wait til they need them
it's good to talk to you
about nine
just a housewife
great
i kind of watch them on the news
that's about it
michael jordan's on chicago bulls isn't he
did he get hurt last night
i saw just a little bit of the game today
he was out there playing
although what i saw was at the end of the first quarter
i think he only had eight points at the end of the first quarter
i don't know
i don't know who won
i don't know
who do you normally pull for the mavericks or
i kind of feel about the mavericks the way i do about the cowboys now
just all this roy tarpley stuff
what is it
he's in trouble again down in houston
they said the other night his contract is so big that if anything happens to him if they don't trade him they'll have to pay him off
they're rather have him except that he gets in trouble all the time and falls off the wagon and have some chance of him playing earning his money
that's just dollars right out of the franchise
i've always been pulling for the lakers for a long time
not just because they always win
when they had akeem anybody who was old as that playing that well i just kind of had to go with them
now they kind of got caught up with a lot of the other players and course all the people that follow the lakers and everything out there in california
it also helps when they were winning
they play better as a team than anybody else seems like
i always wondered that
i will take a look at the individual score in the individual stance in the n b a they have in the paper fifteen different categories
they'll have the highest scorer the top rebounders assists foul shooting percentages and all that
you go down through
virtually every one of the categories there isn't a laker in the top ten
usually hardly anybody in the top twenty except for magic yet the lakers continue to win
you're right
i think they do really play much better as a team than they do each one individually at their spot
year in and year out it's not like they have
a lot of teams will win in the playoffs
the next year they'll be too busy doing their endorsements and stuff to concentrate on the game
i understand that
i guess boston's really giving
aren't they playing detroit
i think they're really giving them a run for their money
his back is bad all the time now i think
they play two or three times a week
they go on road trips
they do the same thing
they stay out for two or three weeks at a time
it really gets
they're sleeping in different bed every night
i imagine that really helps his back
he said the other night on the news that he hadn't done any extra shooting for six weeks
he's the one that's always winning the three point shot
he does that every year
matter of fact i watched him on t v sink i don't know a
jeez it was thirty five baskets in thirty seconds or something like that from three point range
just playing horse and stuff like that
because it kind of a violent game
they d-
they don't wear any pads
some of those guys got pretty funny looking eye wear
they have to wear goggles because they get hit in the face with elbows all the time
i was looking in the paper for something on it
here's the top n b a draft prospects
they're all the size of football players except they're just taller
several years ago when i was up in cleveland i was staying at the marriott
the cavaliers were playing somebody
i think it was utah or somebody like that
i was down by the pool
there was all these guys standing around about chest deep in water
i wear contacts
i had my glasses on
i went down there and just jumped into the water where they were
it went right up over my head
i came up spittering and sputtering for air
they were all the basketball players there to play the cavaliers they were all six eight and six ten
they were standing in water that was six foot
it was funny i tell you
i saw a guy
he got on the elevator
he had his swimsuit on
he was just skin and bones
it looked like something out of africa
he says yeah
he says i weigh about two hundred and forty pounds he says it's not much when you stretch it over seven foot one
you're right
those guys really the big ones
he's got to be way up there
here's a guy from l s u stanley roberts
he weighs two hundred and eighty pounds
god that's a lot
that's a lot of guy coming down on you
who's supposed to have the best draft picks
here it says
this is for underclassmen for june twenty-six i guess they have a lottery on it
that's how they take them in order
it must not be according to how they did during the year
i used to go down to reunion arena
went down there a couple years on the day of the draft that was really pretty interesting
they usually have a video highlights of the season and basically kind of walks you through what happened to the mavs and who they traded for and how they did and a lot of good footage both the good and the bad i don't know
i didn't go down there last year
it was only a couple dollars to get in
it was really kind of interesting
who do you thinks going to win the playoffs
chicago and let's see golden state and the lakers and chicago and philadelphia
the
philadelphia was favored by one point over chicago and the lakers one point over golden state and detroit by five over boston
i think boston will win
i'd like to see them back up there again
they really gave some really good years of enjoyment and fun and everything
i don't know
i haven't really gone to a lot of games live
boy i'd sure like to
do you have any advice for college
i'm full of advice
i'm fairly full of it myself
the main point that i have about choosing where you want to go to school is that you have to early on define what it is you want to do or at least what area you want to be in
i had the unpleasant experience of going through several schools that were very specialized
undergraduate schools before i found a good school that was more general to give me time to make up my mind
that's interesting
i went to a liberal arts school at first
None
by the end of the second you had to pick some sort of major
until then they didn't sort of force you
they sort of forced you to run around taking classes in everything until then certain requirements
that you had to sort of get a general feel for everything
it wasn't that specialized
i'm a great proponent of liberal arts education
being an engineer now i believe in it even more strongly than i did before
i was just on a committee recently sponsored by the american association for the advancement of science where they were just trying to figure out how to fit science and liberal arts together because there are people who are getting just wonderful science educations and not getting enough liberal arts
thus far it's working to my advantage
the great gap historically with engineers has been while they may have all this technical information they have no way of imparting it except to another engineer
i have the ability to listen to them and then translate that into something that nonengineers can understand
that must be helpful
i figure that that's probably the thing i would most tell any parent to tell their kids i think probably
save specialization i guess for graduate school unless they're sure early on they want to do something like engineering or something
they can
even at that i have a son who's only nine at the moment
i see him very rapidly becoming the engineering personality
if he decides to pursue that i'm going to insist that he spend two years at a liberal arts college before i'll even let him go to an engineering college
that's a good idea
where i am right now
i'm at the university of rochester
that's a pretty good engineering school i think
i think they have pretty good engineering here
they also have a fairly large liberal arts college as well a sort of a separate arts and sciences college
i believe the engineers are sort of required to take classes in everything
i do work in language processing
at least one person who's in my field started off as an electrical engineer student and then switched over at some point into language processing because he found that he enjoyed it more
they do force them
i agree
i have the experience
the typical land grant university
while it has both engineering and liberal arts the engineering students tend to cluster together
they're in classes together even when they're outside of the engineering department
they don't learn the communications
they don't learn the thought processes of other fields of endeavor
that's kind of like if i were king for a day and got to make one rule
you don't need any philosophy at all in school
or some other thought provoking area
when i went to undergraduate we had
don't know if you know of it or not
we had a requirement freshman year of just humanities
then you were given a choice of
there were ten or twelve or whatever or fifteen different courses that you could take
they all came out of philosophy english and literature departments
they were a set of assigned readings everybody had to read for
the first year humanities courses everyone had to read the iliad and so forth
what they did do was they all approached it from very different
that you could have one class in the philosophy of something the philosophy of greek mythology or something that actually approached this or a literature course or just all sorts of different perspectives on it
people got to pick and choose
by the end everyone had a good sample of sort of how to think about these things nonscientifically
that sort of forced them
i believe that one of the best things to do at least for me in school was i was sort of forced to take lots of different kinds of courses
i was forced to take i think you know some sort of art history course
we all grumbled about it at first
then afterward we all wound up taking extra art history classes because it just seemed like something we didn't totally know nothing about but just enjoyed very much doing
yes
and something i would never would have done if i wasn't forced to take it
i remember that experience that and extra music classes
that really is something that i notice
i talk to a lot of my friends at school that are more specialized
they don't have that
they went in and took their courses that they were expected to take
that was all
that will continue to grow even as you go beyond graduate school
i'm hoping i'm hoping
have you gone straight through
i graduated college in eighty-seven
i just went straight through
i'm finishing up next year
in graduate school i've been trying to do the same thing take courses completely outside my area
i'm finding in graduate school it's a lot harder because i just don't have the time any more to sort of sit in a course that i'm not getting graded for
i have to try and go myself
i went for two or three weeks and realized not enough time for the work unfortunately
i'm just wind up spending a lot of time doing that instead
what else
i think i
let me encourage you to stop and experience life along the way
i first enrolled in college in nineteen sixty-six
six years and a war later i got an undergraduate degree
fifteen years after that i got the first of a set of master's degrees
four years after that i got another master's degree
you had real world experience in the middle there
that helped you think
that was
it certainly makes acceptance of different ideas a lot easier
i have sort of some
i sort of hinge halfway out in the real world
getting real world
especially she works for a temporary agency
i never would have had
i've learned much just sort of by watching her and her business as well
i can see where that might be a
vicarious learning is a wonderful thing
experience is a wonderful
i'll take that and think that through a little bit
my wife as i may have mentioned just finished a doctorate a couple of years ago
she pursued her education along the lines that i did with lots of break in between
she feels reasonably comfortable teaching now
i take it since you selected this topic that you have children
i have nine younger brothers and sisters
they've been latchkey children for a while
they're almost where i can start saying they're young adults
i don't have to worry about child care too much anymore
we're supposed to discuss what criteria we would ask
i would assume if you were looking for a day-care center or something like that
if i were look-
probably even baby-sitters would be the same thing
i think my top priority would be that it would be someone who would be responsible and someone that would actually like children
i would want to know if they've had any past experience with children
i think that varies
once they get to a certain age it's almost more important that it's someone that can entertain your child as opposed to someone who's really qualified per se
with a baby definitely have to be someone who knows how to handle a baby and would know how to respond to an emergency
i did a lot of baby-sitting when i was younger
i did most of my baby-sitting when i was between the ages of thirteen and sixteen
the only thing people ever asked me
of course they knew i came from a family with younger kids
they really didn't ask me if i was used to children or not
i was pretty surprised because if i had a child and someone i personally would ask for people that that person has baby-sit for before
i baby-sat a lot also when i grew up
coming from that background and the background as a parent now i think the reason that people don't ask a whole lot of questions is a lot of times baby-sitters
you get somebody where you kind of know the family already
that gives you so much basic knowledge that you don't ask a whole lot of questions
i had three younger brothers and sisters myself
they thought okay
she knows how to treat children
my first baby-sitting job was pretty strange
this lady saw us at church
she was a younger lady
that was it
she knew that i was one of the oldest girls in my family
she just asked my mom if i could baby-sit
she really didn't know my name or anything
she had two children
she pretty much just assumed that i would know how to handle them
i enjoy kids
i get along with them very well
there's no problem
with today's world and the kids today i can't say that i would just ask someone that i didn't know like that to baby-sit
i agree with you
there again she knew of your family
she met in a safe setting such as church
she was going on those two instincts
i was very very protective on who baby-sat my children
i would be too
it really shocked me
just about six months ago someone came to my front door rang the doorbell
the daughter was about a second grader
she was actively looking for people who would baby-sit her child
i thought she doesn't know me or my children from anything
i was almost more reluctant of letting my older children go baby-sit for her because i didn't know her
people are so different
i know
obviously you've never had to look for a day care or anything
i did have my child in a day care for just a short time when my oldest was about two and a half i worked just a part-time job
in those situations what i did is i went in
i made a few phone calls
that was a concern with me
you learn a lot by going in there
they explain to you what their day consists of and what their general rules are
that's as much as i know
you probably could get really good feedback from a lot of other working mothers that have done this over and over again
what was it
i think i went by location for one thing
i think you start out with the criteria of do i know of anything
do i know anyone who has their child in a day care
i would say most people would probably go by word of mouth
even at that you have to consider the logistics of it
you're not going to take your child south of town if you work north
even if that's the best one in the whole wide world
there are just so many considerations
then again did money come into play with it at all
money is always a factor in my life
i've never had the luxury of not having that be a factor even in something as important as day care
i know if i didn't have that stipulation i would have done things differently
montessori school would be something that i would have pursued
that's always a little bit more expensive than what i could look at
i was very very fortunate in that i didn't have to do that on a full-time basis
when you get into the full-time basis day care
where you from tina
garland texas
my lands
probably most people you talk to do
i don't have anybody that works for t i
my son works for a computer company the national institute of something
i guess we're supposed to talk about foods today
foods like you would for a dinner party or something like that
i don't know
i don't think they ate all that much different
the thing that i found interesting
my husband and i lived up in washington state for awhile up there of course they ate a lot of sea food
down here sea food is pretty expensive because
it's not as good as if it's fresh
here we eat a lot of mexican foods
it just
they probably were trying to do the best they could
chicken fried steak
up there it was hardly ever heard of
up there hardly anyone drank ice tea
they do in the summertime
when we have a dinner party around here i think a lot of the time a mexican menu is something real popular
i know that i do a lot of planning with our church
a lot of the times when we get together everybody will bring a mexican dish
italian food is real big too
i don't know
we really use most anything
i think parties and that though are
we had a dinner party here not too long ago with a mystery dinner party
your bread family and your
ham and bake potatoes
something from each area that you're supposed to choose from
we ourselves are into the wok cooking
we've really been enjoying those meals
that's good
i love that kind of cooking
unfortunately i am married to a man and have two children that eat about four things
all our family is gone
it's much different
my husband didn't like that
us kids
we ate that when he wasn't going to be home for supper
that's pretty much what we do
they like spaghetti
that's one meal
the whole family eats
there are several things that
as a matter of fact i keep chicken nuggets handy all the time because
those always go good
they are real easy to cook
that way whatever meat we have if they don't like it
my girls don't like beef
that's good the way the things are going
it could be they don't
it takes more chewing
it is easier to chew
they're not too much into beef
at least we keep our chicken nuggets handy for them
we don't a whole lot
most of the entertaining we do is church associated
we do get together for fellowships at our church
my husband and i do a lot of the planning in that
that's good
it's fun to
our homemakers meet at the church also
that's what we do most of the time for that
you don't really include any certain food groups
you like best
it doesn't happen very often
you can
those are fun
it's the only time i can remember that
it might have been the main dish that hardly anyone showed up with
each an appetizer
we had tons of desserts and tons of appetizers
when we came to the main dish plate
there was only two or three
not really
and were kind of angry with whoever it was
you know they know better
go ahead and fix your dish
call someone that can
that sounds neat
i can't believe you're so far away
you sound so close
i'm up at my daughter's
None
we were getting ready to go swimming
we're waiting on my sister
have we talked long enough
i'll let
i've enjoyed talking to you
same here
let's see
that sounds like an army
i have only got two
they are one
any number is nice let me tell you
i kind of decided that single children that that's not parenting
do not tell that to all my friends
sometimes you can hurt them by having too much quality time too
quality time with them outside of the work day
when i take care of some people's kids
when they have teachers' holidays
you can spot them
you take one that's used to being busy having something to do all the time it makes a big difference
keeps you busy
did all five of yours complete college
she's married now
how did you go about selecting a college then
we did not do it right all the time
i do not always think you should try to make them stay closer to home
right now i think the main thing is to look at what they are interested in and take what they are interested in
then start looking for schools
do you think that what they say that they are interested in is at eighteen is going to be what they are ultimately graduating at
mike our oldest boy i think he would have
he wanted to go to embrey riddle
we talked him into going local here first
he only went a few months and then transferred to pittsburgh
he went to aeronautical just learning to work on engines and that
it has to do with airplanes and everything which is what his whole life is
i really wish we would have let him go where he wanted to go originally
he would probably be flying is what he would be doing
right now of course he's working for pratt and whitney in connecticut
they build and rebuild non jet engines
how about the other three who went
the second one we let her go where she wanted to
she went to erie to gannan university or gannan college
she went there two years
it was more expensive
she soon realized
even though she did not like clarion she came back and finished at clarion because it saved her quite a bit of money
she got really the same basic education that she wanted
our other two boys they went to clarion also and did very well there
they have all really got really good jobs
did they have an idea that they were definitely going to go to college and
i always thought she would change her mind
she did not
there's nothing wrong with that if
it does make a difference in your wage income
if they get an education and are willing to go where the jobs are they can make a much better income
my kids they are all making more than my husband was making when he retired from the state
that boggles
i went four years to undergrad at university of nebraska at lincoln
there really was not a choice
the finances dictated that you had to go there
i was
one of the rhodes scholars kids
i just knew that the finances would not support it
to go anyplace else i think that i would definitely have gone
when i finished there then i got a scholarship to go the harvard university in boston
i think that was probably one of the best things that had ever happened
i was
taken out of my element the homogeny midwest
looked differently sounded differently
i think it was probably one of the best things that ever happened to me
my kids i keep saying that i would like them to go to the best school that they possibly could
i do not know what the realities is going to look like
i really think it's important
that's the way we are
it does make a difference
they say you should not look at the expense of the college when you are looking
they say that a lot of times you get more help
in the long run if it's really what they want they are better off
we did all we could
they pretty much had to borrow a lot of their money to go
they suggested some sort of a recipe for
did you have anything in mind that you'd like to share
i just had a christmas around the world party the other night and had some hors d'oeuvres
i fixed a crab meat spread that is real good and real easy
it's eight ounces of cream cheese softened
you mix it with one tablespoon onion juice and one tablespoon lemon juice one tablespoon worcester sauce and mix it and spread it out onto a plate
you take and
that always goes over real well
it's real easy
i don't think
it doesn't make quite as much as you think
how much crab meat did you use
drain it real good
one can of flake
have you ever used the imitation yet
i used it last christmastime
what did i put it in
there's a little tidbit with the sauce to dip it into and stuff
i have it here on hand for about a week
all of a sudden it dawned on me
i found out
they said it is a fish product
therefore you really don't have a very long life once you buy it
i thought they should put some directions on some of these new things they're making that you really don't know what the shelf life is
i had bought a cheesecake
they very nicely put onto the box that it may be re frozen which i felt was real nice
that's a good idea
it was lawry's i believe or lawler's
i got it
they're very good cheesecakes
that sounds good that's great
they have the little papers between them
hey that sounds
i think they're about nine dollars and something
it's something good to have on hand too
you can
you can re freeze
i thaw it
you can re freeze it
they're very good
that's the one thing that i hate to make is desserts
do you
that's my favorite
i really don't care for desserts that well other than one piece of it
i love to eat it
i don't like to make it
you have to rack your brain
time i don't have anymore
that's the thing i hate most about entertaining is thinking of what i'm going to serve
i said i can make it no time
we just built a new home
i have one of these kitchens that's the center of the house no matter where they're at your company can see you cooking
what i have learned in the ten months we've lived here is that when i entertain i have to have my foods all prepared and in the oven with
with the open area you don't want someone from your dining room seeing your mess like you said
that's right
you have to have the picturesque kitchen right out of the magazine
i like to have mine all done anyway because then i want to party too
you know the funny thing is now that i have a large kitchen with a big island and that i still have people trying to come
i said out
it has worked out
at our point of life we know many of the people we're entertaining well enough that they know it's very much at home type situation
a lot of our entertaining anymore with the couples again that we've known a long time like you we all bring things
it sure makes it a whole lot easier
we even have a better one
i'm not a big exerciser
i kind of had to start after i had my baby because i wanted to lose that extra weight
basically at this point i'm a real walker
i don't do that fancy type walking where they kind of move their hips and keep their arms up
i mostly just take a walk around the block or with my baby
that's good
i have to do that at least once a day if it's going to make any effect on since i have to eat the same as i did before
how old is your baby
she was premature
she's about nine months now though
i walk two and a half to three miles every night
that's great
my husband and i were on nutrisystem about eighteen months ago he lost sixty-two pounds i lost twenty-one
my goodness
we walk our dog every night and go up around the elementary school
except if it's raining or real cold which it hasn't been we try to get out every night
he plays racquetball twice a week
i'm not into that
i think the walking is enough to help us stay in shape and toned
i think that is just wonderful
as far as i'm concerned i have several other children
i think at this point to fit it to other things it's kind of a task
it's not to where i'm just so freed up that i just go this is wonderful
tonight we won't finish with the football game till around nine thirty
we will just go out after that
my kids luckily are old enough i can leave them at home alone while i go out and walk
does your husband usually go with you then
that's really nice
he's not really into it
i have to
his doctor said he needed to lose weight and exercise
once he got motivated now he's ready to walk every night
our dog has lost a little weight
he gets excited when he sees us put on our walking shoes
i think after you've done it a certain amount of time it kind of does get to be a routine
when i first started it that was the hardest thing was to get ready and get out there
now if i haven't done it in a day or two or something i really notice that i haven't done it in a
i like the time because my kids sometimes they come with me
sometimes they don't
when they don't i really notice how fun it can be when they come
i like to have somebody come with me
i know enough of the people that if anything ever happened i could go to a home around this block area
it's not real dangerous
still i don't like to go alone
it's nice to have another person there
sometimes it's my kids
i think that's great
sometimes when i take my kids to the playground that's the only other exercise i really think i do
i found real quick that wasn't for me
it just wore me out
i got to the point i dreaded going in
it doesn't cost anything
it gives me time to think
i think not only does it help my body
i think it helps my mind too
i like that
i think that's great
that's what i do for
i don't know about you
i was really enjoying the cool snap last couple of weeks
i'm ready for it to come back
you like the rain do you
not the rain so much as the cool the other mornings when it was sixty-five when we woke up and sixty-six
today i know when i got up that the temperature said more close seventy-nine or eighty i'm kind of ready for the pumpkin weather
are you
i have a friend who's the same way
anything below sixty she's just not happy i think what i would miss is the change of seasons and all because i know in plano we really don't have as many seasons as
they have more of the four seasons
i'm from utah
i like
you're used to that too
i usually like it about sweater weather
the problem here in plano is it doesn't last very long
you get a couple of weeks of that indian summer
it's cold i wish it were several months of that
the other thing is i don't like the rain either
i don't either unless it's
some of my favorite's a friday night when it rains
you really didn't have anywhere to go
it's sleeping time
if you have to get up and get out in it i don't like it either
it always makes their games be postponed forever and ever and ever on on and on
sure it does
also the evenings are going to be getting darker sooner as it gets cooler
i did a walk last night
it seemed like it was a little bit hot still
i agree absolutely
it's all relative
i was from west texas
it was very dry
i thought dallas was awful
i still think so
then this summer we went to orlando for a week
it was so humid there that all your windows were wet every morning
when we got back to dallas it seemed really dry
i agree with you
is that right
i guess i can't say that i don't like the rain completely
it really helps our garden
i don't know if that's because plants are just that way
they like rain
it seems they thrive when it rains
i am ready for a little bit of the cooler weather and not so much in the nineties but something like
i guess my best would be probably sixty-eight when you wake up or sixty-six and then probably seventy-five during the day
i like seventies okay
do you like the heat in the summer then when it gets up in the nineties and hundreds
i don't like nineties
you can give me seventies you can give me eighties i'm okay
i do too
when it gets too hot then i don't like that i stay in the house because it's just too hot
i do too that was one thing about the year around school that originally we had been sort of negative on it
then we started thinking especially in plano the weather
i've thought about that too
when we take our vacations we do take them in august sometimes so that we can be away from here
when it gets way too hot we've been here for several years
we've been here years when it's been hundreds
in fact this morning when they were talking about harold taft they were talking about how this has been one of the milder of the summers and milder fall
you can tell when they talk about beautiful weather some mornings when it'll be too cold
they'll say
those are the ones that like the cold weather
he always did such a good job i thought
it was really a shame
i guess it's
is that right
yeah you don't have to wait for them to cut off your time
then have a good day
i hope you enjoy the weather this week
about nursing homes
and older people
my husband has a grandmother that lives with his mother they're just really close here
his mother has bad health too
i go over sometimes in the day when he's at work
i help with her and bathe her and feed her
that's hard to be a caretaker i really believe
it's very difficult
she has alzheimer's and does not remember a lot if anything
she asks the same questions over and over again which is not unrealistic
you just have to try and be patient and answer them again or just answer another question
i
just bring the kids in the family
just come over and visit grandma because she gets very disoriented
my father is ninety-two
i think that's wonderful
he and mother still live at the house and drive and do the whole thing
whenever something happens to one of them then
i just know too many horror stories about nursing homes
i know stories for sure that
it's tragic that when people live so long that they really don't have a place to go
i think it's wonderful these places that aren't nursing homes necessarily
they can go and reside there like little apartments
i like that idea if they can handle it themselves
i think it would be nice
my dad's the type he wouldn't want to spend the money on anything
he's from that old depression era
it's just blissfull that they're both
i would imagine that if something happens i'll move one of them or bot- in with me
i know a lot of people have said that and then find out how tough it is
i think you'd have to really
they also wanted us to talk about you'd have to really check on this homes
i just don't know how much you can see when you go for a
so many people when they put people in the nurses home they never see them
i've talked to many owners of places and say that nobody even
maybe christmas
i think nursing homes some are good i have to say that
for the most part i truly believe that the parents would be better if they were with the children
i do too
or if they could be real real nearby where they could see them everyday or so
i know governor richards is really upset about what she's finding in the nursing homes regulation in texas
maybe we'll get it improved
i think it's very difficult in the first place to make that choice to have them go there
it's tough i'm sure
if you find out that they are not having good care i'm sure that you'd pull them out of there so fast
yet if you didn't feel like you could be a good caretaker i don't
it's one that needs a great deal of thought
and especially if you're not a person that is a medical person maybe or something that the person needs medical treatment
i know a friend of mine who had a father she brought to her home to live there
he needed the medical treatment
she had a nursing person come in three times a week to help him out
that might be a partial solution
i personally am for the trying it at home caretaker part before i think i'd ever
it's good to hear from you
have you faced elderly care yet nursing home care for any of your parents
in fact tonight i had the dinner with my three brothers and our wives
we were talking
we had a review today
a few things we had to do that
it's not
i guess we all do
i think sooner or later
they were to the point that they only lived both of them about six weeks once they got in
i believe that was one of the hardest things i ever did
it's absolutely devastating
we've looked around
my wife has looked extensively at all the ones in the area
the one she is in now there's a lot of drawbacks a lot of things we don't like
it's no different than every one
and the cost of it the three thousand dollars a month when you think about it for what you're paying a hospital for even not as much care
there's a little bit of difference in the two between my mother and my mother-in-law
theirs both ran
i think my mother-in-law's was fifteen hundred
my mother's was two thousand
this has been five years ago
one of the things that i had discovered is that if they knew that i came in there at all different hours they got much better care than if
they knew
if i'd pop in unexpectedly i discovered they did better
uh-huh
a couple of times with my mother-in-law i would catch something not being taken care of
and would have to rate
i got to where i knew then when my mother was in not to go the same time all the time
when i was looking for the nursing homes another thing that i learned
for some reason i just went back and on my own went around the different floors
i saw areas that they had not shown me
i'll be darned
they did not come across as well as what they had originally shown me
we did not put her in that one
we put her in another one that i went a couple of times when they weren't expecting me and saw and was much better pleased with the situation
this is the whole point
i know my mother's in a unit that's mainly alzheimer's we're convinced that she probably would be better off in a geriatric
the fact that these people
it's reminds me too much of an asylum type situation
it's very very
who knows
they call it dementia
we don't know
i mean she does not know us anymore whether it's alzheimer's or what it is nobody really knows
it's basically the same
her health is not that bad
although she has gone downhill drastically since this last
she had been in a retirement community
somewhere in the back of her mind she had it that she would live with her children
we just did not have the capabilities to take care of her
she has gone down steadily since she has been in
she's been in the nursing home now for
and that she could handle a hospital
we says you know mom if you get better that you could come out
one of the cars i'm thinking about buying next is a nice safe small car
the reason being is we just purchased a van a little while ago because we have a big family
we use that to get back and forth and haul kids around and so forth
we have another four door car that i drive to work
i think it'd be more economical if i were able to a smaller car and wouldn't cost much with gas
what are you looking at
i'm really not looking at anything for a while
when you're driving down the road you see all these pretty new ones that are out
you think maybe i would like a new car
i think i'll be driving mine about two or three more years anyway
the cost of new cars recently are extremely outrageous for the
i sure do like the looks of that new mitsubishi diamante
the costs of a new car and those new models are extremely out of our price range right now
the last one i bought i bought a
it's a town car
it was a demo returned i got it with i think it was fourteen thousand miles on it and nearly ten thousand dollars less than what the list price was
i was really pleased to find that
then i bought it for cheaper
i was looking at a honda accord a brand new one i bought the lincoln town car for just a little less money than what i was going to buy the new honda accord
you get a much bigger better comfortable ride
the thing about it is they give you that hundred thousand mile five year warranty where it only costs you twenty-five dollars to have anything repaired
that's fantastic
i have really been impressed
to find another one that i can afford
i have loved this car better than anything i've ever driven because you can go on the road and get there
you're not even tired
very comfortable smooth ride
it gets like twenty-six miles to the gallon on the road
it does
that's unbelievable for that size of car
they kept telling me that
i thought they're crazy
before i signed the papers on it i took it over to boozier city it did it
it's
that kind of gas mileage we're kind of hoping for on our van
that's kind of what we've always been told they'll do
we hope for it
it never happens it does get good gas mileage
that's excellent
most of the time when i don't go anywhere i can drive it for three weeks to and from work and then fill it up
does it need a lot of repairs
i've taken it in twice for just really minor things
it cost me the twenty-five dollars
really something really silly when we first got it
they have all these lights in the car it has this fancy little light that gives you a reading light for the passengers in the back seat we couldn't get the light to turn off
we kept trying
we went out to dinner with some friends
it stayed on all night just shining right down on them we couldn't get it to turn off
the next day my husband goes out there
he tries to get it off
we turn the knob in the front that's supposed to turn the lights on and off
we turned everything we could
he took it in
they said you just have to press the switch
i can't get the light off
they took it in and charged us the twenty-five dollars
they called and told us though that all you have to do is turn the off switch
they showed us where the switch was
they charged you twenty-five dollars just to tell you that
they thought there was really something wrong with it when he told them he had already done the switch
they probably went through the
he hadn't done the right one
it's right on the arm rest in the back we didn't know it was there
the guy hit it with his arm when he got in the car
we've had just
it's been in two maybe three times
it's just been real minor things
i think that you have an excellent deal then
the company is able probably to offer that kind of warranty on the car because they know it's so well built that they don't expect any kind of major repairs whereas with an awful lot of other lower quality cars you would be getting repairs after repair after repair those companies wouldn't be able to afford that for that kind of extended warranty or warranty at all
it's been an enjoyable car
like i say i'll probably never be able to have another one because i think we bought it for about sixteen thousand i said i'll never find another one for that price
they keep going up
i'll have to enjoy it
i guess i stand on probably ten for no restrictions
i recently just moved to texas from south dakota and nebraska
i realize that probably way back when when the constitution was written it probably regarded more of a national defense than anything else
on the other hand too people then needed to use firearms for survival in terms of food i was raised hunting all the time
i lived on the farm and enjoy hunting
i guess i have some problems with being restricted to owning a gun for hunting purposes mainly
it scares me a little bit to think that they would begin restricting gun control to the point where eventually we may not be able to have that right any more
i can understand that
of course being oklahoman and texan
i used to things in my father and my husband having guns and all
i used to be all in favor of it
all of a sudden it's starting to get really scary with these gangs
because i know that's not going to happen then i have to probably right up there about an eight
moving to this area of course it happens everywhere
i guess we're pretty naive coming from small towns in the midwest and then moving to a larger city where there are drive-by shootings
there seems like killing for no reason at all
it just seems like in the past three or four years it has just gotten so much worse than it was
there's always been a certain amount of crime in your urban areas
i know we lived in chicago for seven years
of course it was definitely there
when we first moved here it wasn't as bad as this
it's just getting all of a sudden so much worse
i don't know whether it's due to the drugs and the drug kings that are here and jamaican drug kings coming in
yet i hate the government constantly telling me what i can do and what i can't do
that's basically what the gun control would end up being
i think so
there's always the old saying that keeps coming up that if a person wants a gun bad enough they'll get one
None
it's very true
it's not the law abiding citizen that is dangerous with the gun
i said i think the only way i would be in big favor of gun control is if they could absolutely guarantee that nobody would have them
i think that would almost have to go with armies too
they'd have to be almost world-wide which we know would never ever happen
even if you said okay
armed forces could have them
i suppose years ago way back when they had the revolutionary war and people decided that they were fed up with the government
if they didn't have a way to fight back
what do you think of this law that they're putting into effect that you have to wait x number of days before you can carry the gun or actually purchase the gun
they introduced some gun control back when i was a teenager i believe in terms of every gun you bought had to be licensed i believe
that didn't bother me too much
i guess it depends if there are some statistics that show that people commit crimes on the spur of the moment
i guess our topic is about movies what is coincidence
we went to the movies that past weekend
so did i
i heard that was excellent
i wanted to see that
i was deciding between that and my girl
my boyfriend and i went to see my girl
how was that
it was excellent
i heard that's a movie that you really can't take children
i heard the opposite that you should take children to see it
i don't know though
i've heard that and then what you just told me
because the little boy dies
it kind of shows how his best friend this little girl deals with his death and i think maybe how children should deal with death
it was really good
cape fear was more suspenseful
that's a real good movie to see
i heard it was sort of not too violent
it was kind of gross kind of like silence of the lambs
it was kind of
it's not as bad as silence of the lambs
it's just as suspenseful i think
it was a real good movie
we saw beauty and the beast
i've seen
boy it's been so long since we've been to the movies
we've rented some videos
i think the last one i rented was mortal thoughts with demi moore
i didn't see that
that's okay
and what about bob
that was cute
i guess that's about it
do you go to the movies often
i hadn't been to the movies for a really long time since last weekend
there's been movies out that i've been wanting to see
i just don't get a chance to get out and see them
we have two little kids
it's hard for us to get out and go to the movies
we try and do
i don't know about the last movie i've seen on t v that was real good
i watched that movie with
that her sister got killed
he had murdered her
that was pretty good
valerie bertinelli
i saw that two part series
i heard it was a true story
i saw that other movie about mother wife murderer
with judith light
that was really good
boy
i like the true stories
it's hard to believe that this really happened
we don't really
do you all still have drive-ins up there
we may have just a couple over here
i believe that the american public and i as an individual and private citizen have a right to bear arms and to have a gun as long as i am responsible with it and protect the safety and welfare of my kids
and so that they're not playing with it and so that they can't hurt themselves or anyone else playing with it
i think that education with a gun is critical and important
however i do believe that guns ought to be maintained and controlled that you can't go out and just buy one off the corner and do whatever you want with it because people that are angry or have concerns or want to seek vengeance right away have easy access to guns
in the heat of the moment they can go and do some damage that can hurt themselves and other people
on a scale of one to ten i think i would rate myself in the six or seven or eight
i think that there ought to be some control
i still think that individuals have a right
let me make sure
you think that maybe a five day waiting period for handguns or that stuff would be legitimate
i don't know if a five day waiting period would be legitimate
that might cool down some tempers
i think a one day would be sufficient
if you see an awful lot of exhibits and things and if you would like to purchase a gun if that five day waiting period were in effect you wouldn't be able to purchase one at that gun show
you would be able to buy it
they'd just have to mail it to you i suppose
i don't think you can mail guns through the mail
i think that's against the law ever since kennedy was assassinated
how do you feel about guns
i think that's the problem that we need to address is why these people want to kill other people rather than the instrument they particularly used in the assault whether
do you think that there will continue to always be crazies
then how do you propose that we prohibit those types of individuals from gaining access to guns
we have some laws on the books that don't allow convicted felons to purchase guns if i understand correctly
i would agree
a short waiting period would be appropriate to take care of the heat of the moment type things
i think banning semiautomatic twenty-two rifles is a bit on the extreme side
a total ban on guns would just leave guns in the hands of criminals who don't care what the rules are anyway
do you feel there is a need in the world today to have an automatic handgun
you could do it just for fun kind of like a game
i think that the police or law enforcement have a need because of the tight quarters they might find themselves
the public i don't know
i think a person needs a way of defending themselves
he took care of it
he saved himself in the process also
how is work going
that's prohibited where we work
although down here in texas you do have a right to wear and carry arms with you at all times
you can still do that down here
is it concealed
does it have to
you can't
has to be in sight so that you're not a menace or a problem to individuals
should we go ahead and keep exploring
should we call a halt to it
i think we made a major wrong turn when we went to the current generation of space craft the reusable ones like they are now because they have not proven as reliable as they should have
i think some of the earlier approaches were much better in many ways
however we've gained an awful lot from the space program all the way from remote monitoring to teflon to some new space age materials plastics and all that
i think it's been a good investment
somebody was telling me the return was about twenty-five or thirty dollars for every dollar spent which is amazing for any governmental financed program
i think though now that we're finally starting to get over the fears and the guilt that we had out of challenger
i don't know
i'm in favor of getting closer to seeing certain things
i'd like to see them also go back up there see what they can do see about setting a space station up
i don't think we should stop
i don't think we should cut the money
where do you think we ought to go with it
you talking about a fully manned space station that we'll keep up there
i'd like to see that
i'd like for us to really find out more about the actual universe and get up there and see what's going on even if there's no life up there or anything
who knows
i would like to see them do something like that
i hate to see them just keep getting diverted off to spying on other nations and putting up defense things
i think they lose sight of probably what they're supposed to be doing
i think about half the nations now are military related are they not
it seems like that high a percentage
let's go back to our original thing with our experiments and all our actual exploring of space and all that
and with russia seemingly not going to be as big a threat
it can't afford to
huh-uh
have you gone out to fort worth to see the soviet space exhibit
it's only going to be there a couple of more weeks
we went
we took our grandsons and went the weekend before last
it is marvelous
it's really neat how they have done it
they have a scaled down model showing how the fuel trucks and things run out there to it and how they
all the things that are against the actual space ship how they fall away from it
and the loading of it it's actually
maybe i need to run out there this weekend
it's well worth the time and effort
we went early on sunday
we got out there about ten ten thirty
do you have to have tickets ahead
if you have children if you go to mcdonald's they have coupons or did have
they may be through with them now
buy one adult
one child gets in free
i think both of my kids are too old for that they're both
i had grandchildren
their dad was at work
the boys loved it
i felt the six year old that he'd be kind of bored
he wasn't
even the three year old enjoyed it they had one of those moon vehicles and had it so it looked like it was on the moon and showed it moving around and stuff
it was really neat
that's something else
the russians have had manned space stations for years now
they had the merv see we've yet to keep anyone up over a week or ten days
in going through it i got the impression that actually they were farther ahead
they're talking about
actually probably any government
what do you think in the short term we should be doing to improve it
i saw a program recently
it said every time they cut fifty-five million dollars on a certain thing then they brag about how much money they cut
they go and spend that money somewhere else that's why the budget is never balanced
they spend it somewhere else they pad out their staff or spend it in bounced checks at the
i'm getting kind of disgusted with the fact that they're counting a reduced deficit as being some big step
first of all this proposed budget has the largest deficit ever
two the deficit is as far from a balanced budget
you're still overspending
it's just the amount that you're overspending
this is
it seems like the goal is to reduce the deficit to some still outrageous amount
i think in the long term something is going to have to be done with sort of the
it seems to be kind of inherent in the political process right that you've got people
there isn't any sort of overall accountability
i don't know
i suppose that the only kind of solution ultimately that we're going to have is exposure and information
i don't know that in general the american people are that interested to listen to as much
you're going to have to know what people are doing and how partisan
we can throw in some highway bill
you can throw
it's a pretty vicious cycle
i think they should limit the senate to one six year term
my dad was always a proponent of that
he felt that that would get people involved who were interested in being public servants as opposed to personal servants
don't let them come back
keep congress to two terms of two years a piece it'll be overturning
they won't have the same people there all the time all the special interest groups will have to renegotiate all of their payoffs and kickbacks
that'll keep them busy enough so that they won't have as much influence
one of the biggest things is the fact that they're always trying to lean somebody toward one way or another whether it's the oil companies or the automotive companies and the air bag thing
the air bag came out twenty years ago
only now they're getting that put in cars
the oil companies really aren't responsible
the government doesn't jump on them hard enough to make them do anything
i think that that's probably right
in terms of long term you just got to get people
at one point at least on a local level going into politics what you're doing is really trying to serve the community right
you don't expect to make any money out of it
maybe you gain a little bit of local fame
you put in a lot of work in exchange for that
i don't have the feeling that national level politicians are at all like that
i think that the problem with having junior people coming in all the time is that you end up kind of wasting a lot of time with inept politicians or people who don't know how to deal with it
on the other hand maybe that's
we have small children two and four our dining is very limited
we're past that now
we're more
wyatt's cafeteria
is that right
the kids just love everything that's there
we're pretty fortunate
kind of buffet style
that's good
you can go in and go out
the food's already served
you don't have to wait
it's already in front of them when you sit down
and things like souper salads
it's buffet
it's already prepared
and any eating area that you just don't have to wait an extreme amount of time
we got three kids too
when the kids are small if you going to wait you don't go out
it was terrible
we waited almost
None
we were ready to go home
you had the kids with you
they waited forty-five minutes
we rarely go eat in those kind of eating situations any more
we do love to eat out
we do it as often as we can
times that we do have baby-sitters we try and catch some things that we normally wouldn't do
where do you like to go when you got a baby-sitter
let me see for new year's we went to eat at uncle julio's
it's on walnut and greenville
what kind of
basically mexican food
it's supposed to be very similar to
it's a mexican restaurant off of central
there's a zillion of them
i've heard about it
the original was on northwest highway just west of loop twelve
if you like mexican stuff it's a good place
we like seafood also
you ever been to vincent's
you ever tried a place called louisiana purchase
this is in plano
it's on parker and central expressway it's ca-
if you like it kind of hot that is good food
we've been to chefalia's
it's right at midway
and excellent food
we've been going to all sorts of weird type places with it
what is that
you get one free
you pay for one now type thing
we've been from barbecue to
if you like continental stuff that is really nice
talk your husband into taking you there some night
it's not a cheap place
it's very nice
where is that
it's north of campbell but off central it used to be a northern telecom building in the ground floor
it's the tallest building on the northwest side of campbell and just before you get to campbell it's in the lower floor
it's really a nice restaurant if you like continental stuff
tell him to take you there for your anniversary
they got a place where you can dance and all that kind of stuff
my birthday's coming up
there's if you like cont-
i like continental stuff myself
i like that
that's down in the stoneleigh hotel now
that is really super kind of stuff too if you like continental at all that kind of stuff either one of those two you go through a hundred bucks without half trying
it's really nice place
you don't have to spend that much
how do you use your credit cards
we use them for
paying our gas and for paying just about anything because we don't like to pay for our checks
we use it quite a bit we pay off every month though
we never have to pay interest
we never get the credit cards if there's a monthly or a yearly charge
we never have to pay anything extra
i won't use one that i have to pay an annual fee like you i use it to buy my gas with
my shell credit card i use that
my emporium card and weinstocks card i use that
i'm like you
i don't do it either
it's just really weird
i don't carry a lot of cash with me because i'm always afraid that someone's going to steal my purse
it's a rare day when i even have seventy-five cents in my purse
enough for a phone call
that's about all
other than that that's the way i use them
i know some people that uses them so bad that every one of them that they've got they can't charge any more
i think that's terrible
if you have good credit it helps you in the long run when you want to go make a bigger purchase or something
if anything ever happens that you do need to you have excellent credit
it really does help
i think it's more convenient too in a lot of cases
whenever we go on trips we always use our visa or our mastercard or whatever
we really don't have to pay for it out of our own pockets until about a month later it helps us gain interest in the bank when we do it
we come out even a little bit ahead because we've been able to use whatever first off and then pay for it later
i think it's better to use credit cards too like i say because there's so many people around any more that's watching what you're doing if you pull a wad of money out of your pocket they're going to hit you over the head
it just seems like somebody's always watching
i don't carry money
i'd just soon use my credit cards and just pay them off
also if someone did happen to steal your credit card my husband was saying that if you notice it within i think it's twenty-four hours you can report it in
he said the most you'd ever have to pay is fifty dollars for them to cancel whatever payments you had
if whoever tried to credit it to the hilt you'd only have to pay fifty dollars of it
you can have your card back with pretty good rating because you can pay fifty dollars but not maybe five thousand or whatever
some of those stores don't even seem to check your signature or anything
i notice that some of them don't even look
they just slide it in there and pass it back to you
i don't think that's right
i think they should check it to make sure that the signature at least matches
it's just a precaution for everybody
let's see
i also like to use discover when i can because they give you some money back every year
i don't
that's that sears discovery card
i don't have that one
we just started doing that
you know what
it comes in handy for when you're buying things like tickets for the train or airplanes because they'll give you some money back
it's only a little bit
it's still something
we got two fifty last year it helps out here and there
for your using your credit card you get a rebate or something
i think they start giving you a half a percent back which doesn't sound like a thing
when you add up everything you've charged up on the discover card for a year they give you a half percent of that
that adds up to two fifty or something
i see
that's what
i know we're going to get back more this year because we spent a little bit more probably
i see
they do it for how long you've been a member i think too they increase the percentage a little bit
do you exercise during the day time or go to a gym or anything
i used to go to a gym last summer
then i started school again
i don't exercise as much as i'd like
i do enjoy going to a gym and working out
just i do sit ups sometimes before i go to bed or when i wake up
i ride a exercise bike a lot
i try to do it at night before i go to bed
it's really weird
i'll get down on the floor
i'll holler and tell my cat nikki
she can be upstairs in the bedroom
i don't know
pretty soon here she comes
i lay out there in the living room floor and do my exercises
i had a problem with my back
when i went to physical therapy they gave me some exercises for my back
i just try to keep that up because it seems like if i don't then my back gives me a problem again
i try to do it every night
that's good
it seems like it's
i can tell when i do it and when i don't do it
you know it's got to be good for you
a long time ago i belonged to a gym now i notice that in this small city that i live in they do have a gym that just opened up here about a month ago
i was kind of thinking about joining it
i haven't even gone down there and talked to them yet
it does really make you feel good
i like to bicycle too
that gives you lots of exercise
i bike in the summer
we go fifty to a hundred miles every sunday
my goodness
otherwise you wouldn't be able to go very far
i'm not that energetic
like i say i just do it at night
try to get my stomach muscles toned up
because boy they seem like they really get out of shape
once you get out of shape it's hard to get back into shape
i try to do it every night
like i say i'd rather do that than watch television anyhow
it's just kind of nice and especially when i have my cat that comes down and joins me
i guess that's about all i can tell you about my exercising
i don't
i don't go swimming
i don't swim much neither
they do say that swimming is really really good for you for every part of your body
i wished i did know how to do that
if they had a pool here in patterson i'd probably put my bathing suit on and go down there
they don't have a pool in this small city either
listen then
do you do any woodworking
i really love it
what do you do
i do it for a hobby i have my own equipment
i have a jig saw and a scroll saw and in the process of getting a router i like to cut out my wood and then tole paint on the items that i cut out
i'm not the one that cuts them out
my husband cuts them out he likes using the little band saws and jig saws more than the stroll saw because the stroll saw is a lot slower he's got a router
now he wants a plunge router
he cuts them out
i took a tole painting class to learn how to paint them right
what we want to do is make them and then maybe take them to these craft shows or flea market things and see if we can sell some of them
i really like it so far
that is fun
my neighbor had a little doll made out of wood i took a pattern off of that
it's just a wooden doll with a painted face you make the dress for it
you drill holes around the top of the head
you stick in rope and tie ribbons around it
it looked really cute
i've got a couple of those started
as far as wood work that's all we've been doing right now
that sounds really fun
they have a really fancy boutique out here in ogden utah i just got back from that today
if you could get your projects into boutiques they are wonderful
they buy them from you
you just given them to them on consignment or something
that boutique they take twenty percent of the sell price
i see
you would put your sell price they would take twenty percent off of that at the counter
then at the end of the boutique which usually runs for a week then they give you what you earned
you have to decide what your price is going to be and then up it twenty percent so you can get what you need out of it
if the customers are willing to pay it then you get a profit
these little things are so cute though
i have seen those
i went through some of the books down here at the craft shop there's a lots of little things you can get to cut out
that's what i want is a shop smith
gene's got one of those too
does he
that's my ultimate dream
you're lucky
he's retired now i'm kind of semi retired
i'm drawing my pension from them
i'm still looking for a part time job
he has all day long that he can work on this stuff and do cut outs like that
he's got a lot of tools
how nice
it's just getting started
these little wooden things they seem to sell really good
i know a lot of people that have gotten them
my next door neighbor every time she sees something she thinks it's so cute she wants to buy it
i'm just hoping that we can get some cut out and painted before summer starts because we don't want to have garage sales or anything like that in the winter time
how is the market for things like that in california
it seems like they go real good
the country anyhow out here i live out in the valley country seems to be the in thing out here
anything that looks like it might be country is what they want
they just snap it right up
this little rabbit that i made in tole painting class is a welcome
it's going to have little wooden hearts holding it in its hands and then welcome written on those little wooden hearts
i think large corporations can give better benefits than small corporations because right now i'm working for a very small corporation where the owner is right there
there is a lot of profit that's coming in
when it comes to small corporations they seem to pocket it a little bit quickly or whatever or however you want to say it
the benefits aren't as great when i worked for a big corporation because the big corporations seem to look at its employees and say okay
you have better vacation plans
you have just in general maternity leave plans that kind of thing
big corporations are able to do that versus small corporations
i've worked for both big and small
i've had a chance to kind of take a look at the pros and cons of both
i worked for h and r block here in massachusetts for awhile
the only
they even hate to give out unemployment at the end of tax season because fairly even though they're a large scale company the individual offices are very small now i work for the framingham
we have much better benefits in the system
let me see we have a profit sharing plan to a degree
that's pretty good for being a school district type program
we have the eye glasses the health care and the whole kit and caboodle because what they did is they threw all the town employees in together
the small corporation that i work for there's no pension plan there's no type of savings of any sort that the company will reimburse you for
i think you're allowed i think two or three days a year
it's not accumulative type of sick leave things like that
i've been looking at big corporations and saying the big corporation that i've worked for in the past had the pension plans had the big health care
you didn't have to pay in as much as if you go to a very small place
they don't have as good as insurance packages as big corporations
my father's retired from the town of framingham he said that they haven't gotten a cost of living raise in over five years
he said that's the only thing that really stinks as far as being retired
i hear that bill is in the senate right now
it's hopefully will go through
i think the schools are at where the schools isn't just the school system and not just the teachers
they took in the whole town plus all
we have the teachers union which helps out a lot
the town of framingham pays the benefits
that's pretty good
that's all the town workers water and sewer where it's a very large town
it's should be a city
they kept it a town
where it's extremely large they were able to offer a little bit more which was really great because we don't have to pay a mayor
that's true
it does end up being quite a bit when you have to hire somebody for that position sure
most of the town employees as far as electoral positions are part-time
it works out good
that's it
i've kind of looked around at that too
salary wise i don't think i'm making as much with a big corporation because i think when you look at big corps or large
i'm talking hugh companies like three m honeywell texas instruments
it's like come on
of course when it's a small corporation it also wants to expand
that money is spent
when it comes to telling kids that they have to do two or three years of service into some kind of community i don't know if that's appropriate for a government to suggest that and say you have to do two years of community service before you can be a citizen
or in the aspect that we're telling kids that this is what is suggested for you to do
as far as a high school course i could see it as maybe a sociology course to where a student would get credits if they were to be involved with some kind of community type of program
to tell them that they had to do two years thereafter post high school of community service i'm not quite sure if that's appropriate for anybody to be telling somebody they have to do
that's a good idea to have it as a study program for school where it be more on a voluntary basis as opposed to mandatory
i don't think
they should have the same rights as anyone else
anything shouldn't be mandatory other than i guess when you come to paying taxes or something like that
if it's beneficial in some kind of way then maybe people be more eager
i have thought about this on many times when you get these young troubled teenagers that don't have the perspective of the community a sense of community or perhaps the sense that they may have problems
there are other people out in the community that may have problems
then i can see it as maybe a probationary type of thing
if they were abusive
if they destroyed some property around the area then they would have to restore it and perhaps work for the community to beautify it or whatever
i could see that working in
i think they have done that
judges have said this is what you're going to get for
i could see that as something that might occur in the court system for those that are troubled
that's a good idea
i think they should have more programs like that
i think us being taxpayers we pay for people that's in jail or in trouble anyway
they should be programs set up by the government that could utilize those forms in different areas
i agree wholeheartedly
the thing is is that's not enough of that kind of stuff going on like you say is a lot of crimes and stuff or misdemeanors why have someone in jail for a year or two for a misdemeanor
sometimes putting them in jail doesn't really help because there's nothing in there that would
there's a lot of anger especially if they haven't went through treatment
they dealt with other people in the system of prisons which you always deal with somebody that's a little bit worse than yourself
i would say the crimes would probably be
you're dealing with people that may be an influence later on
an issue of anger would be is that i went to prison for a year or two
i didn't get any rehabilitation then again those that have physically assaulted somebody that's extremely tough to put them into some kind of program out in the community if they're of a violent sort and to say
i don't know about you
i work outside the home
in fact
i work different shifts so are pretty much a later shift to where i don't have the family time
when my husband gets home he's home with my daughter alone
a couple of hours later i'm home
i don't know
it seems that your employers seem to be taking more and more time away from the family
if you do have any time it's kind of like on a rush cycle that you have to get so many other things done just to maintain your home and maintain the things outside your home plus try to have that relationship with your children
it's a very hard juggling act
i look at my daughter
she's now going to be four
i keep saying jeez i don't have that much time with her
she's growing fast
i stay home
i know that it must be really challenging to try to juggle a job and also your children
i know my husband if i were gone as much as he is we wouldn't have the influence on them that i would want to put on them
i also notice that the children that come over here to play that go to daycare every day they don't like to be around adults
they're the very same age as my children
i'm finding as i volunteer up at the school i just being
i'm not educated at all in really detecting this
i can talk to the teacher and tell them on a pretty good basis after i've worked up at the school for a couple of weeks which kids go to daycare and which kids stay home
you can just tell in their personalities and how they respond to the adults the ones that are home and the ones even that are at home that are getting the love and attention that they need
they are more use to being with their own age kids they're not use to being with adults and to responding to adults
i think the trend in the united states
i feel really bad that it's turned so much to where the children are
in fact i spent the first three years at home with my daughter
i guess i felt fairly fortunate that i was able to do that
i did notice the difference between those of infants being placed in daycare
i thought to myself how can a mother place her child at the age of six weeks or four weeks or two weeks or three weeks
it's our society saying yes
you need this job
if you look all over in the other countries like europe and that their standards of living are a lot less than what ours are
that's part of it too
like my husband was saying maybe some of the problems we brought on to ourselves is that these women back in the nineteen fifties were staying at home with their kids and then made the decision jeez i'll go out and get a part-time job
financially they got themselves into i'll have the boat
it's nice
really past generation women have done it to women of this day and age too
our financial situations are as it almost takes two people to bring in an income to support a family now
it cost us a lot of financial problems doing it
pretty soon you're at the limit where you've got to say okay you've sacrificed for so many years at home
you're not getting any further along you have to make that decision to go back to work part-time or go back to work full-time
you have to make that decision
it's a tough one
i think one of the things that people look at too though is how they spend their time with their children i think with working moms if you can get the bosses to give you almost a rotation like they're going to do with year-round school where you work
what do you think about it
i like the choices you have in nursing homes now whereas you put
when people got to the point where they were debilitated and couldn't take care of themselves there was no other choice
maybe you lived too far away to care for them
your daily job or whatever prevented it
i like the choices you have now where they can go into an apartment type setting and basically have a independent life-style but assisted care
if things deteriorate they can go to a second level which is where they prepare their meals for them they still live somewhat independently
they have people checking on them and making sure they have hot meals
and then where the same community a lot of times will also have the third level which is full care where they're in a wheelchair or where they're in a bed
they can't get around
then they have full care
i really like those options now
i think about it more often because my husband's parents they're very active right now
they're seventy-five and seventy-two
that comes up somewhat more often in my thoughts as i see these things because of their age
it's funny
i know people that are in all three and people that work
i know someone that works in all three different stages like you said
i have known people close to me that have been in all three
i have seen them go from where they're in an apartment building
we call it
we have high rises
it's just for elderly people
one of their spouses has already passed away
it's really nice for them because then they're with people their own age and people that have gone through things exactly what they have gone through
it's really nice to go and see them where they can still get around and everything
they still do their own thing
it's really nice to see them because
sometimes
i had a great aunt
she lived with us for three months because she's starting to get alzheimer's disease
i know i have a bunch of younger brothers and sisters
i know it was hard for me as well as it was for them to actually sit down because she doesn't like doing things that the younger kids like doing
it's really nice to see that
that's some of the things i would find important before i would look into that for a person is like you're saying a good mix of people who have the same interests
and the programs
besides just different levels within the same program they have different types of programs
this one area is a bit more expensive
the people who probably are living there have had more money in their life
but things that people where they have similar interests
and the programs that they have where some of them will have dances once a week some of them sponsor different crafts
they go to the arboretum to see things
they make sure that if they want to go to church there's a bus there
None
dallas area is a big metropolitan area
a lot of these places have churches or have individual transportation
that's something i'd look for something that would make me happy personally if i had to live there
even in the nice ones and even in the ones where they can live fairly independently they really don't necessarily like it because they're not in their own home
i think those kinds of things to make it more homelike and to make it more enjoyable for them that'd be one thing i'd look for along with the health care aspects to make sure that it was clean and that they had good doctors and nurses
i'm in college
i'm only twenty-one
i had a speech class last semester
there was a girl in my class who did a speech on home care of the elderly
i was so surprised to hear how many people
whenever they're in the older people they're fastened to their beds so they can't get out just because they wander the halls
they get the wrong medicine just because the aides or whoever just give them the wrong medicine
many of them are
it was awful to hear what some of these people really went through
i forget the percentage of people that she had said
she did research on it and everything
that's one of the things that we don't think about as we get older and the money that it now requires to be in one of these places
if their children passed away before they did they can be in some places that are not good
they have very minimal care
the care that they are getting the people who are giving it are paid at a minimum wage
they don't care as much
like you said the caretakers in some cases are trying to make easy on themselves to the point where they're putting people in bed or overmedicating them so they'll stay in one spot and not do anything
that certainly would be something to watch for
some of these places can even be two and three thousand dollars a month to stay in
sometimes they share a room
it's just a little cubbyhole
they share it with another person
they're still paying that much
None
you've got to really strike a balance in what kind of level of care you need and then unfortunately what you can afford at the same time
i've been lucky
my mom's parents they're both in their eighties
i was just home for spring break
my grandma she goes maybe we'll just sell the house
i was like no
there are other communities too that aren't necessarily a nursing home
i had an aunt who lived in a small town in texas that was in a
it was a housing division
it was supplemented
most of them were on social security
they got some kind of supplemental aid besides from the state government
it was this little bitty one bedroom house
it was a separate house
they had a living room and a bedroom and a kitchen
they had people who came in who supervised all these houses
were fifteen or twenty of them all right together kind of like on one block
they had a supervisory
it sounds like an apartment or som-
it was more like a headquarters or something anyway where they staffed it three shifts a day so that if they needed someone they could ring
someone
they always cooked
then they had the choice
they had their own possessions still in there some of them
they could make their own breakfast if they wanted to and their own dinner
they always had somebody come in for lunch
they didn't have to mess with the yard
they had a maid service that came in and cleaned everybody's house
they didn't have to worry about that
it was really a nice compromise especially because she felt like she was still living in her own house
she still had her own couch and her own bed
it really helped a lot
she was a lot more comfortable
she didn't resent
we've run into a lot of problems where our relatives were
i've lived here for thirty years
this is our home
we have nothing else to show for our lives
we don't want to leave
we've run into a lot of that
that's why this
she felt that way too
it helped that she got to still be in a house and still have some of her own stuff
i guess that
it's probably not widely available
that's what
i know we have an ol-
it's basically a nursing home too
everyone has basically their own room
th-
if someone would come to get them they're allowed to leave with them
there's a staff there that makes supper for them
each person has a chore
maybe wednesday night it's george's turn to set all the tables
it's really nice because that keeps them going too rather than just sitting around
i know our youth group goes over
we play bingo with them and stuff like that
an even if it's just a little bit
it's more like living in a big house where it's your turn to set the table like you're saying or whatever instead of being waited on hand and foot all the time
i think before i-
i don't think it's right to just put someone in it
that's when it's important to really check out the medical aspects of it when you're in something like that
that they'll get the kind of medical care they need
without doing something like you're saying to keep them still to make the staff happy
as far as
we don't want to get in the habit of watching a lot of t v because we both were raised that way where our parents sort of stuck us in front of a t v to be the baby-sitter
we just don't want that
we want more communication and interaction amongst us as a family
we both like sports
we figured what better way to get out and be together as a family and also have it be good for you
plus we both like to cook
that's something we spend time together too is cooking and preparing meals and stuff
None
i'm the third oldest of twelve children
my gosh
like i said i
i'm only twenty-one
there's nine that are younger than me
like i sa- i don't have any children
i'm getting married in october
we haven't discussed this at all
now i've noticed that while i'm at college and when i go home my
when i do go home they enjoy just laying around me
if we do watch t v at night they just enjoy just laying on top of me or something
as far as that goes we play games
i play old maid and fish with them
we play board games
when it's ni-
i'm from pennsylvania
when it's nice out we go outside
we like to play kick ball and softball and stuff
in the summer i think there's seven of us still at home
all seven are in a sport
also the girls are in softball
the boys are in baseball
all summer we live on hamburgers and hot dogs and sports
that's it
do you
None
and sort of be there with them
that's good too as far as entering
you're you're participating
you're not
at least you're encouraging them on and stuff
even if our kids get into sports that we're really not interested in i want them to know that we're still there so to speak as a family
it's funny because my mom and dad both were kind of athletic
although it wasn't them playing i notice whenever i was playing softball and such my mom and dad got into it more than i did
they'd be in the audience screaming and yelling
a lot of times the parents get into it just as much as the kids
i found a lot of times when we went on to tournaments and stuff it was really funny because the crowds would get into fights who can scream louder and everything
it's really pretty funny to see my parents get into it
they're not really even participating
that would be fun
boy you have a lot of experience as far as different ways a family can interact and do things together
if you're not
did some people go to their rooms and
the one down thing about having that many people in our family is we really don't have any privacy when we're at home because you couldn't possibly have a house with twelve bedrooms
like i say i'll be twenty-two next month
i'm closer to the younger kids than i am the ones my own age
i think
that's because the ones that are older all have their own little thing to do
the younger kids are at home
i like to spend time with them
i don't
when you were growing up and the younger ones weren't around what did you do
i see
now that they've all sort of moved off
now that we're getting older each one of us are going our own direction
do you think even
what did you do when you were younger
we had blocks and stuff
in the winter when it wa-
we couldn't go outside because of the snow and stuff
we would do just even stupid things
we try hurtling our couches and stuff and
to see who could jump over
and hide and seek
we have a bigger house than a lot
we could play hide and go seek in our house and even stuff like that
you had a lot of games and things you played even when you were kids with the ones that you
we're all pretty close together
my sister that's closest to me we're only fourteen months apart
there was never just one alone
not real spread in age
we were all pretty close where we always had a buddy to play with
is that pretty common up there in
i don't speak with many people that come from families that large any more
my husband's mother came from a family of thirteen
that's his mother
their catholic
that's
that's it then i think
probably maybe that
do you see yourself having thirteen kids or twelve kids
when i was younger i used to say that i would like to have five
i've even cut that down now
to me five wasn't even a lot because i was just so used to twelve
it would be really hard now to have twelve children
i would think for your parents it would still be hard even nowadays just to raise twelve kids
my oldest brother he's twenty-four
he put himself through college
there's a sister older than me
she works
i think she even gives mom and dad a little bit of rent money
i'm putting myself through college
i'm getting married in october
my fianc3e and i are paying for most of the wedding
my brother right behind me he moved out
he has an apartment
he works
the next one down is in the marines
he's out of the house
it's kind of like they don't
sometimes i think maybe the larger families create more independence in the children though
i think they do
you don't expect anything because there is not enough to go around for everybody you kind of have your own independence on going out and getting it yourself
i find it a lot when i'm up here at college because i've always had a bank account
i've always had my own checking account since i was in tenth grade
i would work in the summer
there's a lot of kids up here that would have no idea how to even do a checkbook or
to manage money
my roommate's
know how to even go about getting money
how to get a job or just when you get a job what your responsibility is
my mom and dad whenever we would go out and we would get a summer job
we would start blowing money
my mom said that's stupid for you to be blowing money
when we all graduated from high school
i'm still covered under my mom and dad's life insurance because i'm still in school
i have my own policy too
i had a poli-
my mom and dad got it set up helped me to get it and everything
i have my own policy
i pay for my own life insurance too
my mom and dad because there's so many of us and because of the way the laws are now if we want to drive we have to pay for our own insurance on our cars
my mom said that's silly to let one of the older one's drive it
if we were in a wreck you can be sued for anything now
she said that's really not fair to the younger kids
they can take everything away from my mom and dad
the little kids would have nothing
i agree with her
i don't know
if we want to drive we pay our own insurance
really i think sometimes there's an advantage
sometimes it's good to have a bigger family because it does make you more independent
it makes you know that you can't take anything for granted that when you get something you're lucky to get it so to speak
i don't know
it is hard i can imagine on your parents
you watch david letterman
our favorite t v show
i live in a dorm our favorite t v show is cheers
we try
here they show it every day
on thursdays is the night where the new ones come on
that's cool
we watch it every day
late night we don't watch
they show the twilight zone at one thirty
we just stay and watch that
i used to live in the house that the guy owned
it was all full with shelves everywhere
we didn't have enough books to fill it up
why do you like david letterman
he just totally sarcastic and hilarious
i don't know
he's got curly hair
so do i
do you watch saturday night live
so do i
i don't know
this guy asked me to dance
he goes do you want to dance
he goes i'm sorry
wait
with the
i didn't see the rest of it
you missed wayne's world
let's see
every time we walk in the room we turn on the t v because we don't want to do anything like study or anything
all we do is turn
when i was in high school i used to do my homework in front of the t v set
kind of annoying
that's cool
kind of annoying in front of t v trying to do homework
trying to write an essay you start talking about
i just bogused on all my homework
it really didn't matter
i did that all through college
it worked
let's see
the news we don't watch
i watched through the war
it was like haven't i seen this episode before
if you watch it for five minutes then it repeats everything over and over and over
it's like man
in north c-
the thing is here they just give you local news okay
a house burned down in this little town
were here
i go what happened worldwide
it's like even though two hundred and fifty thousand people died somewhere else they're not going to tell you
they're going to spend more time on doing a thing on a cross guard who's a hundred and five years old
than they are on anything else
let's see
we watch for example
i haven't seen it in years
i used to
i used to hate star trek
i thought
when i was in high school and junior high school i used to hate it then we started watching it
the new ones are pretty cool because they got especially things that fuck with your mind
what happened is they have this hologram right
you can program
everything looks real
you can touch everything and stuff
it's only a program
it's really great because sometimes the hologram makes up all these things
sometimes it's funny
None
we watch football
football kind of after a while
we got two teams of the a c c going there
there's nothing to do
for example yesterday some girl goes do you dares want to go to a picnic right
it's like we just woke up
we had a hangover and everything
we just woke up
we're watching t v
i go no
today we're just going to dedicate ourself to watching golf and bowling
it was like god do you guys really watch that
i was
a whole golf tournament it's
for example baseball
me too
somebody told me that you can watch baseball
the actual play time that there is is five minutes
the play time is when the pitcher pitches the ball and it goes to the catcher or when the pitcher pitches and it's hit
that's five seconds for the whole play that's it
maybe a home run could last a little bit longer because the guy has to run around all the bases
it's it's like that
it's just
when i went home that's all they had on t v i watched entire games of baseball
they're going my god
t v in argentina's really bad
from argentina why'd you come over here
because i wanted to go to school here
that's cool
they have better computer science up here than they do down there
my father works for i b m
we came up here
we came to the united states in nineteen seventy-seven we lived here for about seven years
then i said i'm going to move back up there to go to college
he goes but do it fast
i did my undergraduate in two years
it's just
we've been talking for five minutes
tell your dad that now he owes you five bucks
we just recently graduated from rice university
we were going through a lot of job interviews and things
some of the things that were important to me when my husband was looking for his job was hours
i didn't want him to have a job that would make him kind of be on call all the time and have to go in at any time and even on the weekends and things
that was important to me and also insurance for our family we'd like to be able to take care of our medical needs and not be thinking so much about whether or not you can afford it
we have that aetna that's the insurance that we have right now
when we were in colorado they had a different type of h m o there that i really liked a lot
it was not that kind of h m o where you have to go to their sort of clinics this
it was with a certain list of doctors that participated in the h m o
that's nice
then you only had to pay the
for us it was a five dollar co-payment every time you went to the doctor and three dollars for the prescriptions
i especially liked the prescription especially since my children tend to have ear infections all the time
those prescriptions can be very expensive
i know
we just are fifty dollars for this series of antibiotics and things
i know
especially if you get what is it seclor i think that just about breaks the bank
we were interested in having dental insurance too
having been in school we kind of put things off and only went in when we knew there was a problem somewhere and stuff
we wanted to be able to go in and have our teeth cleaned and just checked all over
do you have the basic plan or do you have the other one
we have
we're at aetna with an ex-
we have the dental insurance is separate
the one that's you get additional
for most things it tends to cover it
we don't too many major expenses at this point
we have been able to find dentists that will accept pretty much whatever the basic plan pays
a couple of times we've had to pay i don't know three to five dollars but that's not that bad
let's see
besides insurance other things that we looked at
my husband does not like to commute very far
we don't like him to be having to drive an hour to work or something
we kind of looked for where his office would be located
he's at the one that's at six thirty-five by living in plano we're just about fifteen minutes away
that's not bad
especially when they finish all the construction out here we didn't want him to
we had some job offers in the new york area
we thought he would be really commuting not only is it trouble to have to drive but it takes time away
that was something that was important to us
like i say we kind of felt deprived that he had been in school and been away from us for so long
we were anxious to do everything we could to have made us be more together
what other
those are some of the things that are very important to us too
we'd like other benefits that are provided
the athletic facilities that you sometimes take advantage of i think that's pretty nice
i have to say that since we've come here we haven't done it too much though
we haven't enrolled in too many of the classes or any of that
that's a nice benefit to have
also what opportunities there would be for advancement i think we looked at besides just what salary you would be having now
when could your salary increase was there somewhere to go
that's one of i think the hard things right now
they're going through some tough times to say the least
one of the drawbacks i think of working for a big company is often times you do have to follow pretty rigid
if an employee is especially exemplary i think it's often
in a smaller company it's a little bit easier for them to say hey this person did a wonderful job give him a big bonus kind of thing
that's one of the things that happens when you're dealing with a large company
we also were interested in being sure that he felt like he liked the people that he would be working with and that there would be some opportunity for friendships that way so that you would feel happy going to work every day rather than thinking i can't stand these people
that's something that was important to him in thinking he could work under
just since last summer
i was going to say
we may be having to drive to plano
i think one of the most deciding factors of why we chose this area is that my husband was raised in irving we have a lot of family here his side of the family
it's not that far but people would ha-
although we had really good friends and we had church and school support and things we were anxious to move close to family members just because we wanted our children to know their grandparents and things like that
that really made a big difference i think in why we chose t i and chose to move this way
it's really hard
they were the only grandchildren
our families are really far away
we went downtown and
that's nice
i think it made her trip a little bit nicer
i think it is important to want to be close to your family
it's hard
just for us to snatch a half hour like that is a special occasion for us
it's nice that you can have your family close like that
i wanted to be close to family but i also thought it would be harder to be close to family
i think that we're really satisfied with that choice
we kind of felt like it was worth it to us
my children just ran out the door so i need to go check on them
i've really enjoyed the conversation
i have too
nice to have met you
you have a good day
i think that a woman's role has come a long way
we have gone more into the business aspect like i say of i don't know working more
i think we've even gone into more the labor aspect of it also
with the pay and everything
i feel that we've missed as far as the top jobs go
the higher echelon
if you look at most corporations there isn't a woman that's on the board of directors or that type of thing
that they are not in the home by choice anymore
it's mostly
it's gotten to be a two income family to just survive today between taxes and the cost of living
i don't think raises have kept up with a lot of the stuff as far as your medical insurance and just groceries and gasoline and all
i think that we did come a long way in the sense that like you say we're out in the labor force but i think we've lost something too
there is twelve kids in my family
my mom never could really work because she was kind of pregnant from day one
she doesn't believe in
there's a lot of truth to that
then a career is a smart choice
i think it's great but if you have a family i think you owe the family a responsibility
to have children and just get a day care or someone to take care of it and not really have the bonding process that takes place with babies and stuff i think that the mother and the child lose
i think that's why there is so many problems with kids today
they don't have the family roots anymore
i'm not saying that it's totally gone but it's nothing like what it used to be
in that sense
also my mom thinks
she's kind of right with it
like for the men that don't have jobs
she feels if there is women out there just because they want to do it she said they could stay at home
that's what i'm saying
that there are ways to prevent families
basically there's contraceptives and all kinds of ways to prevent pregnancies
do you think that
that's the freedom of choice
i agree with that
anyone who has children that doesn't really want them isn't going to be a good parent
i shouldn't say they are not going to be a good parent
they won't have that
they won't be as good as they could be
it's not something that they really wanted
i had three children
i wanted every one of them
i worked third shift for a good part of my life just so i would be home with them
i had to work but i tried to make it as painless as possible
one saturday morning we were all sitting at the breakfast table
the kids were talking daddy this daddy that daddy this daddy that
i was sitting there
it was because i had worked for about nine months
when they were coming home i was going to work
i wasn't there at supper time or bed time
they couldn't tell me what went on at school because they would be coming in the door
we were
that's why i said that's it
i either have to quit or try something else
i went on third shift
i worked that shift for eleven years
i feel that's very important
it's too bad because mothers miss out on so much too
in the sense that we've come a long way
we've sacrificed a lot to get there
i agree
i really think that like after the second world war when women went to work in factories and all that that was out of necessity because the men weren't here anymore
then it got to be a point where they got some independence
they just enjoyed the income the extra
i notice today kids
we had apartments before we had homes
we had to walk before we had a car
now kids at sixteen years old they have their birthday
i know
to me it's like we've lost our values in this country
i'm not trying to be a prude or old fashioned or anything but i don't think unless you earn something and you've worked for it and you have a sense of pride about it
while i did this no one gave it to me
you will prize that possession
it's just like college too
my parents there is no way they could afford to send twelve kids to college
so far there is only two of us that have gone
my older brother has paid his entire way
i'm on my
i'll graduate
i paid my entire way
that's the way it'll go down the line
i don't have a car because i'm paying for college
if i want a car
i think that's right
i'll bet your values are a lot higher and your self esteem and the way you think about things is probably a lot more common sense than these kids that don't have that responsibility
i've had my
i know kids up here that have their own cars
money is just given to them
they still get their allowance
i have held a summer job since i was in the eleventh grade
i have had to take care of my own money
have my own checking account
i know a lot of kids that don't even know
i tell them i pay for my own life insurance and their mouths just drop to the floor
if they do they don't know it
that's what i say you'll be so much better off for it as you get older
a lot of kids resent things that parents tell them and stuff
it's because you've been there
i know
and no one can tell anyone anything you are going to find out for yourself
i don't think you should just not listen to advice even if you don't take it just listen
there is no harm in that whereas sometimes you can't even get that from a kid
really
what do you feel the changes in the future with the abortions and that type of thing women in politics and president someday maybe
i think contraceptives are going to be more popular
i realize that they are popular now
i think i really think people are going to start using more contraceptives
with the abortion i don't think there is going to be as many abortions but i don't know what women will do when they get into politics about abortion
i still think people have a choice
if you can live with it and your conscience is clear then all of us are going to answer to it one day maybe
no one has said for sure
i do
we are not supposed to say that that's okay but i really feel that it's freedom of choice
you as an individual what you do that to me is your business
different circumstances call for different things
i haven't
when the war was on i watched c n n and nightline pretty regularly and read the paper and all
when
lately the last week or two i guess with easter
and spring break with the kids i hadn't been thinking much about the middle east and what's going on over there
just really the last couple of days since the u n debate or whatever you want to call it that voted on whether there was going to be a cease fire
i guess the thing really isn't over
they had i don't know if you call it standout or whatever
anyway they stopped and waited to see if iraq would accept a permanent cease fire situation though
as i understand it from the iraqi point of view this current cease fire thing that the u n had set up the iraqis are probably not going to go for at all
i guess from what i understand they could take off at any moment without
i
when the crisis began last august i couldn't remember things that i had studied in the past in school and all
i got out my encyclopedias and tried to read about the history
it was really what i felt was kind of cynical
why they expect it's going to start this week
it's just not people
it's not
they fight with each other
they have such hatred for israel
the thing that's kind of interesting about this
he came within a quarter of an inch of going to saudi
he ended up in korea instead because of the way they split a transportation group out in lubbock
he ended up going to korea
his buddies ended up going to saudi
he's still in korea and his buddies home now
he almost wishes that he could have gone home
got it over with
i just
with
i'm afraid that we would have to stay
the other thing too when this all started if you did much reading on the thing the country of kuwait was just somebody's
you go back to world war i when the ottoman empire broke up and the british and the french and the british and the french mostly decided to carve up that part of the world and call part of it persia and part of it iraq and part of it something else
they split things along geographical lines but they didn't take any kind of consideration into social or cultural things at all
the country of kuwait really doesn't make just a whole lot of sense except that it is an excepted place it's like any other country
iraq has had designs on that place since nineteen twenty-two
it wasn't like something that just suddenly popped up
it's just that this was an excuse to make some noise
something that i
now we are a legitimate player
in the game over there
we are now a legitimate player in the game because we came in with a certain amount of force and we defeated
iran couldn't do it in seven years
we went in and did in seven days what iran couldn't do in seven years
that kind of ups our stock in there just a little bit
now what they're saying is that since we won whatever we say goes because it's a kind of a might make strike sort of attitude about it
we've got the power
they'd go in and they'd win something
they could call the shots for the period of time until the next strong man came up and caused problems
i just
i just would prefer that sometimes we've said we're not interested in what other countries do
other times we jump in and do things
while i'm glad that they
it was important demilitarize that area because of all the build up armaments
i hope we don't try to keep in there and try to keep our fingers in the pot and try to
we just don't want to send our people there and make them stay
that's the big thing
we still got a little bit of the old vietnam problem in the back of our minds
we got this
we're used to wars where you can get in do the job and get out
vietnam we never did get out never did get the job done because they were too ham strung
this thing
they gave the guys the power and the material and told them to go do it and they did it
the big fuss that we're going to see now for the next few weeks i would think is the business with the shiites of all people in the southern part of the country and also the kurds
these people evidently are being killed off by the thousands
whether the united nations
whether the united nations comes around and says hey wait a minute we know this thing isn't all that much over we've got to go back in there and be sure that this large population isn't just wiped out
seems to be exactly what's happening right at the moment
None
i don't think there's much hope for
there never will be
the only way that you're going to have peace over there if we determine that we want to go in and wipe out every last one of them
until we make a decision to do that there won't be peace but i don't think we want to make that decision either
that's a little rough
we're not quite up to that sort of thing
i guess i better go
that's fun
i enjoyed the topic
i love to do all kinds of crafts and sewing
i find that's my one release
i like to do physical things like sports
i really enjoy softball
my favorite is volleyball
i'm at school
i'm in
i live up at the college
sometimes it's hard for me to do that
i just sometimes
i go to my room and i walk in turn the radio on or just kind of veg out or something
i have two small kids
i don't have much time to go places and play sports
i just love to sew
i make a lot of my christmas presents
i love to do all kinds of crafts and stuff like that
i like to do that stuff but when i'm at school i don't have time to do it or even time to learn how to do it
i don't have a whole lot of time now but i have more time than i did
a lot of my sewing i kind of do out of necessity
i've got two kids to put clothes on
i come from a family of twelve children
when i'm up here i really miss my younger brothers and sisters
that's a change because there's nine of them that are younger than me
when i know my mom and dad aren't home i'll call home just to talk to my little brothers and sisters
i really miss them a lot
i don't
i just have one brother and he's married
they have a couple kids
i don't get on the phone too much
i enjoy going places with my kids
i do sports but i don't have a lot of time for them
i'm not much of a basketball fan either
i enjoy playing volleyball but i don't have a lot of time to do it
i used to play it a lot when i was in school
now that i'm married and stuff i'm really bad
i'm the opposing teams best player so to speak
i enjoy just
i have varied interests and stuff
not that i like reading but i do do a lot of reading while i'm here at school
i love to read but i don't have a lot of time to read an
what reading i do i kind of do because it's the necessary stuff
as far as fun reading i maybe get to read the sunday paper but that's about it
i remember in college i did a lot of reading most of it text books
keeping busy with everything else going on
yeah
i like to do
i've made stuffed cows dress dolls
you make clothes for them and everything like that
those have been real popular with my family
i do things like that
i don't have enough time to do it to really take orders on it
it's like i can only do it when i have time
do you
i have several of those that i've made as wedding gifts
i made them out of all lace and satin and made them as wedding gifts and stuff like that
just little things
i didn't have a lot of
when i was in college
i did sewing for other people when i had time
that's about all the sewing i did
i never had time to sew myself a new dress or anything like that
yeah
that's about it
i guess maybe we've covered the topic pretty good
i'm not too much
mine are just mostly things i just do out of necessity
it's been nice talking to you
i'm a college student if i do any garden work it's only when i go home in the summer
where do you go to college
do you do gardening at home
we have a large family
my goodness
almost all our vegetables and everything is from the garden
we have a pretty good size garden
i guess you glad you got to go to college so you'd get some rest
my mom likes flowers so we have a lot of flowers too
i don't have as many now
i had a whole bunch
now i work and i live in the city so that sort a kind of hung it up
i have a few flowers but most of mine are in barrels and things like that
this year i decided that
my husband made a little garden out there with some tomatoes and stuff in it
i decided that i don't like grass
i don't like to have to have to pull grass i decided
mine looks real good
i've seen a lot of people that do that
i've seen elderly people that really can't get out too much sometimes
it's just like a high rise for elderly people
she does her own thing and everything
she has
she has a tomato plant year round
she
they keep it warm for all the older people
she keeps it year round
i could probably plant one and bring it in just like i bring my plants in every year
i got a patio
i tried to talk my husband into just buying a whole bunch of pots
and planting them all in it because that's favorite thing is tomatoes to grow
he said no
he was going to plant in the earth like he always has
he's always had a garden out in the country
i think he kind of misses it a little bit since we moved to the city
i went ahead and planted one and mine looks better than his
i
are they
do they just come out in the morning then go we call them morning glories up here
they really look like an orchid when they come out
they only bloom for one day
the next morning as soon as the sun hits it it starts opening up
when it gets dark it closes
that's it
it's done completely done
they look like orchids is what they look like
they look like different color ones
i have yellow ones
i have red ones
i have purple ones
they have the real velvety looking stuff inside it looks just like orchids in different colors
really pretty
they're beautiful
i have a friend when i lived out in the country
she had belonged to this kind of society that every year or every so many months they would send you different bulbs that they came out with
they were real expensive
they were
the most expensive one that she gave me a bulb for was thirty-two fifty for one bulb
my gosh
what she would do is she would plant them and they multiplied
the next year when she weeded them out so they wouldn't be as thick she'd give me some of the bulbs
i have some of the most beautiful day lilies that you've ever seen
when we decided to move it was really funny because like i said i had a whole bunch of different kinds of things
i kept saying i want to take a few of these and i want to take these and i want to take these
we had a tree that was seventeen foot tall or something like that that he said no no i am not taking the tree
every time we went outside he'd look at something that was humongous
the last day he said can't we leave the grass
i said yeah
i brought
i brought as much as i could bring without really tearing up their place
just like
the people that bought the place i knew that they would
if i left one bulb of each one of them by this year they'd have ten bulbs of each one of them
it wasn't like it was going to be this big raw place or something
i just couldn't see it going off and leaving everything like that
this house i really liked it and everything but the yard was a lot to be desired
there was nothing
it is ugly
i even tried making it look nicer
it was so ugly
it did not help let me tell you
really the plants that i brought over and put out here are just about all
i don't do any of the mowing or edging and all that my husband does all that stuff
that's because i'm allergic to the grass
that'd be awful
then it doesn't make me ill
even up here at school it gets hot and we have the windows open
they mow the grass up here sometimes six o'clock in the morning
just to smell the grass it's just
i used to until i got so allergic to it
i don't know if it's all
it's not as bad here
saint augustine i think is what we have
it's not as bad as it was when we were out in the country
out in the country
my gosh
i get shots for it now too
one good thing about it i don't have to mow the grass
that's really nice
do you like to plant in it
the first thing we always plant is tomatoes every year
we plant cucumbers
sometimes when my dad has
he said the vines are just so
it must be the
then there'll be maybe two years in a row that we can't get anything
now that's something that grows like a weed here
it grows like a weed
we have to allow extra room for those extra space
they take up a lot
we usually get
just pulling them as fast as you can
we tried it too where you run it up a fence we had some weird cucumbers because they grew inside the fence
the little thing would be half on one side and half on the other
my gosh
it was
they're so heavy
cucumbers here grow like crazy
tomatoes grow like crazy at our house
we have a section of tomatoes
we put the tomatoes there every year in the same section
i swear we get tomatoes six rows up
if we have any the birds will pick or something
some of the seeds drop
i know we do that too
at the first year
i was from the city when we got married
the first year that we planted i couldn't figure out the
the first year after we planted them
the first year after we'd had a crop all these little things
we had cucumbers coming up in the middle of our okra
i thought how did this get here i know i didn't put that seed there
it was weird but the birds had evidently just deposited them for us
sometimes too when we take out our garbage
we just dump it in the middle of the garden after your garden's basically done we're finding out
we have peach trees in the middle of our garden now because we took peach seeds and dump them there whenever the garden
what did you get
what convinced you to get that one
a friend of my father's he'd driven it all over the country and it runs great
it has a hundred and fifty-three thousand
it's still running real well
right now we have two cars
i have my husband and myself and we have two sons who are drivers one of which is an eighty-eight plymouth voyager van
we have
about a year ago we picked up a second hand audi that was a sedan
we got that
someone came into his lane and hit him
fortunately he was able to
he was out of the hospital by that night but the car was completely totalled my two sons had been a passenger in a car about a year and a half before that which was hit by another car
i was getting really nervous
i finally said i want a really solid car
we found the audi second hand
i guess right now my criteria for cars is being solid able to take an impact
the things that i would want
our
i think the brakes on the plymouth van are terrible
i don't go all that fast but it just doesn't hold
i definitely want to get anti lock brakes
i don't know
do you have any particular things that are priorities on your list
i didn't really need power windows but it has power windows and steering and air conditioning
None
it has a stereo and a cassette player he's told me it gets forty-two miles to the gallon
the van on highways can get about twenty-eight
but it does not
if i'm on a highway and i can get twenty twenty-one miles per gallon i consider that i'm lucky
maybe sometimes i've gotten twenty-two
it comes out around the eighteen or nineteen local driving that's to me is a real drawback
i wish i could settle for twenty-eight
the frills on that car are nice but they're not necessary for me except air conditioning
in washington d c area it gets hot and humid
air conditioning is definitely a necessity for us through two or three months in the summer
i don't need
if you want to have open windows to be able to op-
i've lived all these years without them
one of the things that we've liked when we gotten a new car and this used car has it is a sun roof those are really nice in good weather
i guess if we get a new car it definitely would have to have anti lock brakes
i'd love to get an air bag and a sun roof just so it'd be a good solid car
i guess that those are my major criteria
everything else is a luxury
if you were to buy a brand new car what would you look for
like you said anti-lock brakes and air bag
i'd really like to have a car that's dependable that you drive like a
it's funny that you use
once you get something fancy you get stuck somewhere off of the main area you can be really
i know the audi parts are terribly expensive
it jus-
i would love i wish that engineering would make something as solid as a german car
we certainly have the technology
it's amazing
everything is more solid in it
you don't feel you've got any of the flabby plastic i know
i'm willing to give up a little bit in the mileage for a solid car
do you need air conditioning down there
we really do even today it's supposed to get up into the nineties
we've had eleven days in a row over ninety
enjoy your car
i can't think of anything
i have one
it's a real pet peeve of mine
it seems i do work during the day
when i'm home i'm either cooking or running doing
things or laundry or stuff
i hate when the phone rings and it turns out to be a telephone salesman
it's real
number one i really feel that that's my own home
i ha-
if i want something i will get it
i never buy anything from a telephone
i wouldn't
i really feel they're invading my time and my space by interfering in whatever i'm doing
it's a little bit like junk mail except you can't ignore it quite as easily
i try to be polite
at the same point
i just say thank you very much for calling but i'm not interested
i hang up before they can say anything
it works very well
you don't hear how
i just feel that's my thing on invasion of privacy
i sort of have a sort
i wish that there were a way that you could submit your telephone number to the phone company and have a penalty for anyone who calls you to sell things
how do you get your name off the junk mailing list
you do that by
you can't do it for any compan-
you can then send it
they can pro-
that company is not allowed to sent you any junk mail
i didn't even know that
you have to go to the post office and ask them for the form that you fill out not to get junk mail from specific companies
i wish there were something like that where you can call the telephone company you could have your number put in a registry
anyone making these calls have to check that registry for that area and is not allowed under penalty of being reported or something to call you
that would be one way of doing it
one of my pet peeves is when you have an answering machine and they hang up before they leave a message
i think that is so stupid
i'm guilty of that sometimes
i've called and there really wasn't any significant message
i wasn't going to be available to be called back
it was sort of like the hell
i'm not going to spend the time leaving a message
i'll call later
the other thing that there is recourse to and that's another thing is when you use your credit card and then they ask for a telephone number
legally they're not allowed
i don't really like announcing in public when you're sitting there
my telephone and i don't like the way telephone numbers can be used
it turned out it had to have been my husband's office phone number
we weren't actually able to trace it but we were able to discard the charges
it was
i realize that this is your identification
i worked with someone that got hold of his
i don't ever get anything over the phone because i don't want to give my social security number out
you should never give the social security number
sometimes if you charge
because they pick them up at the box office we'll call
that's the only thing i would ever have ever used it for the phone
that was because i initiated it
occasionally i do order things from catalogs over the phone
again i initiate it not the company
if you're buying something in a store and you pay for it by charge and they ask you for your telephone number you do not have to give it
that's a law that went into effect a year or two ago
i never even knew that
you can just say i'm not required to give that by law
they won't
the credit card company accepts the charges
it-
is there any
wha- in this
pet peeves that you have that don't necessarily invade your privacy
this is limited to the privacy issue the invasion of privacy
i guess that's probably my biggest one in terms of invasion of privacy for people outside the family of course
i've got little pet peeves with my family
i guess that just comes with the territory with a family that
can't think of any that would invade my privacy
nothing that you felt that
i othe-
i really can't say anything that would really bother me
so many things i think over the years have been accepted that are no longer done
i can remember when i was very young much younger and i applied for a job
they said aren't you planning to have children
that's none of their business
of course by law they can't ask that
there has been i think a lot done to protect privacy
aids and all that stuff
with your sex
they've gotten a lot with
i think it's for the better of i-
you mean for working and stuff
i don't because i think whenever something like that
i think it's more safety than anything else
i sometimes feel sometimes individual rights including the right to privacy have to be sacrificed for a greater benefit
i know
for example airline pilots
i do want my pilot to be sober
i know
i know
that i've covered for people that came in drunk on the late shift or something
it's dangerous
i kind of do their work for them because they make it more hazardous than what it is without them
i think some of the people that oppose mandatory drug testing for certain areas say it's not
let's see what was the topic
advice for parents help their kids through college
did you
if you had children would you want them to go to a certain place
i would want them to make that decision
i would
i pretty much made my decision on my own and my older brother likewise
we were both pretty much happy with what we did
i think i would not push them towards any one place
i just finished college a couple years ago
i
i went to a college that was fairly local
i feel like my education
i know
some people are real adamant about going to a certain school or whatever
i guess a lot of it would depend on maybe what your major was or something
and then find a school that's good for that
i picked it for a couple of reasons it was only about an hour and ten minutes away from home
you lived there at school then
another reason was i paid for my entire education
it was roughly around six thousand a year
that was for tuition
i did not go out a lot
i did not order out a lot
i did not spend money on myself
then again i was there for school
then another reason was i was not sure
i knew that clarion was known for two things
that's what i ended up going for is for business
are you working somewhere then
i am not looking around here
i see
are you
i see
does he work for a company down there
i see
the big company
i have been working for t i for about twelve years i guess
i am originally from illinois but i have gone to college i guess a few different places
i think for the most part the teachers have been pretty good and i have got out of it what i have put into it
i think that's most of it personally
that's why with my kids i think that i am just going to encourage them to go
i am going to try to help them financially
i think financially i am
i will say here's what you have got
you can either go a couple of years locally and then if you want to move off to a more expensive school then we might be able to handle it but
otherwise you can just go for four years somewhere and i will try to help you i do not know the financial end of it like you said
of course t i paid for a lot of the tuition and books and stuff but it still was a challenge to do
i think financially that's one of the big aspects
you
or whether your parents are
since you were paid for school yourself do you think you had a different outlook on it like your grades and things like that
i felt it was mine and i could do with it what i wanted
i think if my parents would have paid for it they would have been on me
they pretty much got to the point
you are at that age
you are going to have to decide what you want to do
it's not ours
lets me go
i did not do poorly
i worked
i did not
it was just harder
i was used to being on top
when i started there it was like you are mediocre
i think
i guess it depends on the way you are raised too
if you grow to expect that
you kind of go there as sort of a vacation
they did not take it very serious
i did not start to college until
i think that helped me be real serious about it
i ended up graduating with a three point six
i
that was hard cause i had two kids
and a family and everything else
i had a lot of different hats to wear all at the same time
i screwed myself up also
my parents never pushed me until my dad just said what are you going to do
i said i am going to go because i have not whipping butter the rest of my life
i went and i just took business
being as i was paying for it myself i just kept
you do not get into your major until your second or third year
i am going into my third year
i decided i do not want to do accounting anymore
right i thought my god i am paying for this myself
i switched to finance
i liked it better
i pulled myself from a two oh to a two five
in my senior year
i would have really liked to go on secondary ed with math education
it was just the fact i was paying for it myself
my wife was sort of in the same situation
she went to school to be a teacher just because she did not really know what else to go
she did not realize until she got to be a senior and was doing her student teaching that she did not like it
by then she had practically got her degree
None
if i would have went with the math i think i would have done a lot better because i was more interested
i knew that's what i wanted
i think a lot of kids that hold off a year or two
my gosh
i think you are right
i'm in an area where we can enjoy it year round
i've actually been out within the past couple of weeks
i've done both kinds i'm originally from the state of virginia and lived near virginia beach where we could surf cast and catch a lot of things in the ocean there
did you ever do the james river
the trout fishing is supposed to be legendary
the trout fishing is really beautiful
as i say the streams are eight ten fifteen feet wide and so forth
you stand on the edge and you cast out and you work from your feet most of the time there are a few lakes of course close
what do you like brookies or rainbows
tell you the truth i'm not picky
whatever fish is the specialist in that area i enjoy fishing for it
i try to
i haven't fished in several years i'll have to admit but when i do fish i do contact some of the local specialists so that i can then find out the type of lures that they use and where they fish and any unique techniques that would help you
we fly fish
right now it's bass and striped bass is the only thing that i go for down in texas
that's a pretty big fish
they've
they're pretty exciting when they're running
it's a salt water fish in fresh water environment
our streams here are replanted with fish about every year so that they have a pretty good idea of what the number of fish are in these various locations
they
this is of course x number of weeks or months before fishing season opens
april to october or something like that
what's a license cost
as i say it's been several years
the licenses weren't that expensive
i have probably a half a dozen different kinds of fishing poles and fly rods and so forth
i had been so busy in my work in these last few years that i haven't had time to fish
i'm going to be retiring at the end of december
i hope the next fishing season that i can sort of get back in and enjoy that
that was a really enjoyable thing for me to do
i have all sons so i think i'm probably going to be fishing for a long time
i just have one son and he lives out of the state now rather in the eastern corner of it
i don't think he has time to fish either
i'm passing it on to my children
is that right
my goodness
the disease i caught was simply because i was in the norfolk portsmouth area
people there
there's so much water around that you're either boating or you're fishing i fairly enjoyed at that time
i have a small aluminum boat here that
when i go on one of the large lakes that we have here i enjoy fishing for trout from that
i don't know about the lakes in central pennsylvania
there're two different size lakes about five six miles from state college
these aren't huge lakes from your point of view they are probably fifteen twenty acres maybe which here is a lot of water
do you have a home or apartment
we have a small backyard and small front yard i do basically the shrubbery and the planting and the weeding
he mows the lawn because the lawn mower is too heavy
it doesn't take us that long because our yard is so small
i try and do as much flowering as i can and that kind of stuff
that's nice
it takes about an hour with the two of us working to do the bushes and all of that sort of thing
the worst part is controlling the weeds
which i hate because we don't like to use a lot of the chemicals and because we have a dog and he's going to be out in the yard and who knows who he eats out there
we try not to use them but we end up using some anyway
if they go up
one year we did the edge of the house all the way up on the roof
i went up on the roof once and i'll never do it again
this year he got lazy so i said fine
that's about it
we have a nice tree in the front
we have an association that comes and mows everybody's front yard they keep hitting the tree with the lawn mower
every time you do that it kind of kills the tree for a while
that's kind of stunt its growth for just a while until we get it back going again
we started mowing our own lawn they were doing that
anyways i have a nice full tree now
we fill it with lights and that kind of thing
they also edged
they would edge into the shrubbery
gosh it was getting really bad
you still have to pay for it even though they're not going to do it
it's an association fee
is it real expensive
yes it's seventy a month
my goodness
i don't like
i just get really upset every time i make that check out
do they do other things for you all
they take care of the landscape
we live in a cul-de-sac
there is a island in the middle they care of that
there is a pool and they take care of the pool there is a pond
you're basically paying
the sprinkler system that
certain sharing areas have sprinkler systems
that way if someone moves out the entire neighborhood is mowed and watered and that kind of thing
you knew when you moved in you'd have to pay that didn't you
it went up what we pay
that's the bad thing
we just can't afford it anymore
they're
they take care of basically the front yards unless you don't want them to do it
do at a
only in the common areas and in the island
they don't do it in your yard
there is no restriction on what types of bushes you can have or anything like that
we've added bushes and shrubbery too
i ripped most of them out and put them somewhere in the back
put new ones out front
that was a lot of work
we put in a sprinkler system
it took so long
there is so many people that broke either their water main or their gas main doing it
it works great now that we've got it
we needed to because we're having some foundation trouble
you have to keep the area moist around the house or it makes it worse
we had an incentive there to do that
a friend of mine actually works for mcdonald douglas in the space station program
i get to find out a lot of information about what's going on there
it sure sounds like that's going to be a really viable program if it continues to be funded at current levels
they're going to be doing a lot of interesting things
i think one of the big things he's involved with is the micro gravity payloads
that has a direct impact on a lot of things that we really can't do down here on earth including some new pharmaceutical techniques
you're kidding
there's a big opportunity for us to explore what sorts of things you can do in a zero gravity environment
i suspect that we'll see a lot of gains from that
that's good because sometimes i wonder being a lay person out there not knowing exactly what's going on in space whether they're going ahead and doing things and whether or not
being
to me all this space exploration that we've done thus far has told us that there's no other place like earth that we can't live on mars
this is the place that we have to live
there's no other resource for us to look at other than here
it's kind of like to me
what
let's forget about the space program or whatever
we're always curious
we always need to know more things
to me it's kind of like let's try and clean up the air that we have here
mainly because
this is it
if we would have went into space and found mars a livable planet we probably would have
who would have cared about earth
it would have been another planet to kind of take over and continue on
that
when i look at the space program itself i think of it as being in terms of it's interesting to learn but it brings down the fact that this earth is it
it's it for us
unless technology makes the decision that we are all going to live in space or whatever
i would love to go into the space shuttle some day and just see the earth and the different planets and things like that
i think it would be very interesting to do but whether it would be feasible to do i don't know
perhaps we can find better techniques for doing things that we'd normally do down here that are damaging to the environment
that's true
i think of
they're trying to look at how things effect everything in trying to create an environment where they have an ocean and they have the lakes and then they have the desert part of it
they have an area that's more full of vegetation tropicals that kind of thing to kind of look at things and say environment wise this is where we're living
what effects it
how can we improve it and things like that
i think in space
i don't know how many people could live up in space for any length of time
just the way that we're affected by when it's cloudy out
it's cloudy for days
we don't see the sun
the people their moods are extreme
this is how i see people reacting
when is the sun going to come out
i wonder how somebody living up in space is going to be able to tolerate never seeing the sun
and never seeing light bright days
do you have any television programs that you watch regularly
this is kind of tough
i don't too often watch shows that are on on a regular bases
i don't really like some of them to tell you the truth
i don't thing they have any redeeming value
i watch things like sixty minutes
like on thursday nights at nine o'clock when i get home from aerobics i will watch knots landing
you will
just something like that for end of the evening type of thing
how about you
i watch
sometimes i will watch the network evening news program
i like that
i watch that a couple of times a week
it comes on at nine o'clock
i really don't have any situation comedies that i watch regularly
i have seen that murphy brown that comes on
it's kind of cute
i don't
there's a couple of those i've seen once in a while
i can't think of the name of the one that has the military fellow
he's playing a military part
i have seen it i think maybe once
it was on one time when i saw it
it it's pretty cute
i
in the morning they will like to watch eureka's castle it's called
i don't watch any daytime t v at all
i guess there's some things on channel thirteen that i watch pretty regularly
on saturdays they have a variety of things
a lot of times i record it and watch it some other time
they have programs on house repairs and
they have a calligraphy show
i do calligraphy so i watch that
that's nice
they have a lot of cooking shows
i'll just short of have it on sometimes to just sort of pick up little tidbits from those
i don't sit and watch them but i enjoy some of it especially if i'm cooking on a saturday evening or something
one of those kind of inspires me
i notice that since we moved here that we did get the cable t v
when the newspaper comes out on sunday i sometimes read through the movies that will be listed
i record some
we have just totally cut down
we never go to a video tape rental anymore because there's always plenty of things that we can record and watch and then record over something else
that's been really nice because if you decide one evening you would like to stay home and have a quiet evening and watch a movie then you have two or three saved
than other kinds of things
that's probably what i watch most frequently besides news programs is the movies
they have a couple of channels that are nostalgic older movies
i like those old ones
we have really enjoyed that
it's really nice not to be running out
it's so convenient at home
you can do it anytime you take the notion
i have really enjoyed that
there are
they want to see a particular program and they are either home watching it or definitely recording it
if i miss something big deal
things are repeated
so often that if i have seen just a program once chances are it'll be that exact same show
t v is something that we deliberately try not to get hung up on it
we don't want our kids to grow up thinking that that's what you do with your
it's something that we try doing
there's a lot of good children's programs that they could watch several hours every day
you could say that's a good program for them because it's educational
still you want them to go out and do other things
we probably exhausted that huh
i like that
i guess it's time to go
the economy
our soldiers going over
is that what
i think it's caused a lot of big difference between when people had gone to war before
compared to vietnam
i know that there was so much more support for the soldiers going over
even people that didn't agree with the war still seem to be able to separate that
and support the soldiers
i know that i've heard people say that when people that went to world war two
then in vietnam that was totally different
if you've served in desert storm you probably would be a good candidate
it would be a bonus for your
exactly
torn apart
we had people down the street that the guy was in the reserves and he was just about ready to go and they just had a new baby
she would have had to go back to work
i think she said their income would have dropped by two thirds
that's also a good reason why it
good that it ended as soon as it did
i think the biggest change that we've seen in my life or whatever lately is the economy
things are so tight
my husband hasn't gotten a raise in two years
it seems like everything is raising everything that can be cigarettes
not that i smoke but cigarettes stamps
it seems like ever-
they just raised the minimum wage today
that's not
that's the hardest thing for us
we've been trying to kind of maintain traditional lifestyle in the sense of meaning home
i'm trying to stay home as long as i can
every week
i could go out and be making money
that's a big stress i think
for the social changes in our family
i don't have any children or anything right now
i work as a news reporter in waco
i got to see
people were coming to me to ask me what's going on like i knew
i got to hear a lot of what the people thought about changes in the war and everything
that was pretty interesting
what other social changes in the past ten years
i know i really get pressure because i have a career also
i get a lot of pressure from my colleagues
why am i staying home
that's kind of a difference for us
i think there's more pressure on my husband to be more involved with the family
he's gotten a lot
in terms of his amount of hours at work nothing on that has lightened up
it's now he has the pressure too of being superdad and supercareer
even i think a lot of the movies we see now kind of play a good part in our changes
you see that they have the three men and a baby type movies
i think you know that
you have the women detectives now and different roles
we probably want to do that even more now
since the women's movement in the seventies
we've come a long way but i think it's still have a good ways to go
i know that i grew up in chicago in the sixties
was part
i think there's a lot of kind of myths that we've come a long way just in terms of our society
i think there's so much prejudice still there
it's kind of more covert now
i believe in this or i believe in that
i think there's still tremendous amount of prejudice
people think we're in the nineties we're beyond all that
like i say we've come a long way but we have twice as far to go
i don't think a lot of people realize the plight of a lot of people
you may be in good standing and everything may look hunky-dory to you
None
that you don't even see or know about
yeah
when i was growing up in chicago we were in a real ethnic neighborhood
there were people from all different nationalities
now we're kind of in lewisville miss white little suburbia
i don't even know anybody
from any place other than texas hardly
i grew up in brooklyn new york
i was just surrounded by black people
i'm black
that's where i lived
i feel lucky because i've almost lived around everyone
i went to u t to college
they have a lot of different people go there
i feel really enriched in that a lot of people don't get to see
some people have lived in lewisville all their life
and they don't get to see
they think the whole world
ours was international co-ed dorm
there were twelve hundred students
once we came here it was
it really is exciting
one guy practically roasted a goat in his dorm
my god
None
there's so many people who have never even gotten to do that
that's great
my sister was telling me she's going to the university of pennsylvania in philadelphia
she just met a girl from i think barbados or jamaica something
i mean this girl she had two outfits that she would just wear all the time
she got some kind of money from her government five hundred dollars
my sister had to take her shopping and show her what to wear show her how to match up colors
you to go and just witness this girl just coming to america type thing
of the change i think that i've seen probably in the past twenty years or whatever is now kids have to have so much
i even get caught up in it with our kids
people think they're kids have to have five
the latest cereal about th-
when i first moved here i was only thirteen but everyone had a car in school
i just couldn't belie-
i was from new york we road the bus
if you had a ca-
if you had a car there was nowhere to park it anyway
it's just
then we came here and they had parking lots in the schools
i couldn't understand it
all the kids had cars
they have to have a car
that was
you can afford to pay the insurance
it's good talking to you
we haven't really heard that much in the news lately about u s involvement in latin america since all this middle east crisis began
i haven't really paid that much attention since back in august when all of the news and all of the media began to focus in on iraq
the the last thing that i remember hearing that much about is the iran contra scandal that happened in the reagan presidency
historically we've always almost been like a big brother to the latin american area and almost used them
i feel
i think something will have to be done down there very soon about mexico and some of the other areas
with the persian gulf as you said it's just been very quiet
i keep pretty close tabs on the paper
you don't hardly see a
the only references that i have seen lately has been in part of
they made references to in the past how we have given arms to nicaragua and to other places in latin america and that those might turn around and haunt us someday
not to this large scale as iraq
whenever we give arms to people as we did and as we sold arms
and then it turn around and
i agree we're the largest munitions producer in the world
there's a lot of money to be made there
it's very difficult to cut it back to a level where it should be
it will come back to haunt us
i know when i spent
the time that i've studied in mexico there was a kind of a lot of resentment there towards america
about like you say using them yo-
our interest there is what profit we could make off of any kind of relationship with them
we weren't normally very interested in them
they have
other in most latin american countries there are a lot of the kind of problems that we've fought for in other countries
they have corruption
they don't have
there's just very few really modern cities
probably the biggest problem down there is that's the drug entry points
their economy is
several of the countries
especially columbia is so built on the drugs that our little war on drugs has really been laughable
it's just such a small amount
it doe-
it cuts off just a trickle
if we can't get a handle on that through some method i don't know whe-
that's right
that's just so much of the way that they make their money
so many communities have to have that for farming
they don't look at it so much as
as long as we're the largest consumer then
if we can cut back the usage then maybe it will have to go someplace else
i think it's really very sad that north of the border the united states and canada is so different
from south america
there's really a disparity between what i would call civilization of the countries
there has to be resentment built up
that's where leaders can use that whenever the opportune moment arises
it's really kind of sad
that we would go all the way to iraq and that we would be very concerned with the situation between jerusalem and israel and the middle east arab countries when we have a lot of problems right in our own back door
that's been the way it's always been
i guess we've kind of neglected latin america
that's really sad
i guess then i will go
thank you
i
i haven't been listing
i used to just listen to the rock stations but
i don't really know what too many of the most popular songs are unless they're in the news or something
i tend to listen to some of the older songs that were popular back when i was paying attention
i like some classical music and some of the pieces that have been around a while
i listen to a wide variety of music
every now and then country and western
i'll listen to some of the rock stations
i also like the the classic rock stations
some of the rock stations now are i guess the top forty stations or whatever
it gets kind of old
they play the same songs over and over
i just get kind of tired of all that
lots of times
i'll just play cassettes instead of listening to the radio
most of my cassettes
i guess i don't like hard rock
i have some rock and some jazz and a couple maybe one or two country and western some garth brooks
it's mainly just the light rock type stuff
i never really listened to it because i prefer to have i guess an established pattern of music to listen to
i
i
they tend to try to outdo each other with raciness i think
i'm not attracted to that at all
it made a big difference in my life not to have a radio that was easy access
now that i do have one i just don't automatically turn it on unless there's something i'm particularly listening to
if you go two or three years without having that
what i got the most exposure to it really changed my life-style and kept me from just having easy access to current music
i did like i say tend to go back to albums and cassettes and things that i already had purchased
we don't have a c d yet do you
i have so many albums and cassettes i feel like gosh i'm going to have to go out and buy a c d player and then start collecting c d
it just
i kind of decided to wait until it was around a while
they were really expensive
now you can get one for two or three dollars
i can do without it for a while
also they get better quality w-
they learn to have more features and things
without making them less expensive
we're kind of waiting to now
the price of cassettes has gone down because c d are so popular
a c d is a lot more expensive than a cassette ever was too
i can't imagine
you can't record on them and so they won't be as functional as a cassette player where if you heard something you could record it
if you wanted to record something to play out in your car or something
c d won't be nearly as handy
on my stereo i've got a turntable and then i've got a dual cassette
i can record off other cassettes
i never realized you couldn't record onto c-
i haven't really looked into it very much
i've never really looked at one very closely
that would be inconvenient because i have a cassette player in my car
one of these days when i get a new car maybe i guess all of them will probably have c d players by then
i'm not planning on doing that for a while
i'm going to stick with the cassettes and until they
she does have a c d player that she got for christmas
she's got the cassette so she can record
that's good
i can record some things from her and get cassettes and record off other ones or off the radio if i want to
i just haven't gone to c d yet
we haven't either
we like the idea of having great extra quality
i'm satisfied to just have what i've been used to not have to think about the great financial
i know one thing that has colored my music choice is when we had children i really started to think about what kind of television programs i was watching
i just didn't want them to be exposed to a lot of things
a lot of the songs have some lyrics that i just wasn't pleased with
they get worse and worse too
i really think we've tried to tone down our taste there to make our children not be exposed to so many negative things so early in life
that's amazing how when i was in college i used to have the stereo on all the time or i had on m t v or something
ever since i've been out of college i guess over the last several years i listen to the stereo less and less
now i will turn on
i'll turn that on while i'm in the shower and while i'm getting ready because there's really not much else i can do it's kind of boring standing there putting on makeup so i'll turn the radio on
i listen to it when i'm in the car driving to work because again there's nothing else going on
other than that i don't listen to the radio or even to my albums or cassettes or anything very often anymore
and put it on the turntable
i just don't bother to do it very much anymore
i know my husband he plays an instrument
he played in the band when he was in college and in high school he has a lot of all different kinds of music
he goes out of his way to play marching band music
or like you say jazz or classical to the children to give them some exposure to different kinds of music
i think that's really good because they're learning to like all different kinds
it's like a really small not a tuba but i th-
it's kind of like a small tuba but it's not the kind that sits up on your shoulder
it's a cross between a tuba and a horn
he has some real fond memories of marching band and concert band type activities
he thinks that would be good for the kids
i'm sure it is
i was a real good piano player
then i got interested in a lot of other things
i got real involved in many things
now i don't have a piano in my apartment or anything
i took guitar lessons i think for one or two years
that was about the same time i was taking piano
i got too busy in high school
i've been
she had a hard time getting a few folks
i thought all these t i have gone home
i guess
i do it a lot
my father and brother were in it
my brother's still in it
i had periods when i didn't do anything
in the last ten years my car doesn't go to a shop
there's hardly anything other than putting tires on that i'll do
i do essentially do it all
i don't know if there's anything specific
in fact i could advise people
i do it for fun really and to save money
i guess that's diversion
i've tried a few groups where you
i think sears is probably the best place
what i heard them tell other people was always right
when i sat there i dropped my car off for tires or something like that
i respect
they didn't do a great job of changing my transmission oil last time
when i did it the next time i realized the filter was loose and everything
i didn't like it
i'm just doing it all myself
that's the aggravating thing
i try to do as much as i can
i grew up on farm so i've got that take care of yourself attitude
i've done various things
i've got an eighty-three t bird
i've changed out heater core and
timing belts and things like that
i guess the last thing i took to anybody to have done was on my wife's car when we went in for inspection
it didn't quite pass
we had to have
that's a mustang with a two barrel carburetor on it
they had to do some adjustments on that and of course it had never been adjusted so they had to pull it off and pull all the plugs out to get to it
you like fords apparently huh
i'm kind of stuck on them right now i guess
yeah
we ran into some problems with having them work on that carburetor
they got everything tuned up right
i got it home
they had left the oil cap off and it was rubbing on a belt
it rubbed a notch in that
little things like that that really start to aggravate you
that's a lot of the reason i do my own stuff
i always wonder when you have little things like that happen why we don't inspect areas and guarantee it so to speak
we always fix things and put things in and walk away
thing like that with a car
there ought to be an inspector or quality insurance guy after an oil change
just in case they didn't put the oil in or whatever
i always wonder about that when someone does repairs or little things like that
anything that gets to be an assembly line type operation
you're always risking that
if there's too many people that get their hands on one little project you miss that overlap sometimes
and they miss things
i've had a hard time finding anybody i can trust
like you say transmissions and things like that
i'm not going to tear apart a automatic transmission and try rebuild it
it's real stressful to try to find anybody that i think's going to do me right
and have an idea of what's going on
you need to really
i do a lot of the simple things
i think i do most of the things better than the average person
you have fords and i have three chevys i worked my way into having the same engine
i'm
sold on small block chevy v-eights
i bought one car new
i almost accidentally got the next car although i was kind of looking for it when i got a used car with the same engine
then the truck i got next i definitely looked for the same engine
i buy filters three or four at a time
essentially the engines are different
the carburetors is the same
the course is two are eighties and one eighty-six
you can learn a lot that way
there's no way i could fix every car in the world
that's the three biggest things to me
if you don't have the special tools or
any more
the testers that
obviously if my car starts missing or something like that it's almost impossible to track that down any more without a diagnostics
the tools and the space to do it that can be a big problem if it's under carriage or something like that
then it's experience
you can look through a chilton's book or something and get an idea of how to go about it
you better figure on multiplying that time by at least by five or so
just by not knowing how to get to that one bolt or that one screw or whatever to get things apart
that was the biggest thing when i did the heater core in my t bird
the only reason i did it
the only ones i've ever heard good things about are the old lincolns and cadillacs where they had the little door underneath the hood
i had taken this in to have it done originally
it was tremend-
it was about seven hours labor
it was going to run about four hundred dollars or so
they looked it over and they thought they could patch it up a little bit and what not
this is your little water heater in there for
it was leaking inside the car
they did a little patch on it
it held for about four to six months
i finally went back in and started looking at it myself
it's a matter of tearing all the dash out and all that kind of stuff
it was not a seven hour labor job for me
i took one off my little buick i had
i pretty much took it loose on the inside
it came out from underneath the hood
this was
the only thing that sticks inside the engine compartment on this are the two hose fittings
i've never heard a good story about
course i broke mine
i'm always very careful when i change hoses on it
when i take those hoses i cut them off very gingerly
if you pull on that
i've always done that as a kid just yanked on it
they must have been stronger and heavier copper at the time
i broke one on my buick
i always remembered it was my own fault
i thought i'm going to carefully take those hoses off
that's what ended up being the real problem on this was the pipe wasn't busted
it had broken loose enough to where if it got hot
it spread out
just normal driving didn't do it
if it was an especially hot day the pressure would get high enough and it would start blowing the water out inside
i couldn't even
a week's time is worth
chevy it was a caprice air conditioning stopped
i just heard it
i went out there for five minutes
i just pushed on the wires
sure enough just pure dumb luck that the connection over by
sometimes you have dumb luck
i was
you could have taken something like that and thought the compressor's not working or it would have taken me all day probably if i didn't do that but sometimes you have some dumb luck if you have a little curiosity and you have enough knowledge to check things out
i know i feel bad for people who just when anything goes wrong a fuse they just have to take it
i know that's tough if you don't at least give it a shot
my one daughter was fairly interested
i really haven't gotten around to
i learned because i just learned
i'm going to do that
i told my daughters in college this year i said this summer we're definitely going to spend a little more time on the car
i said so you can learn the basics
not only from an economic standpoint just pure safety
if she can get yourself out of a bad situation without having to go to a phone booth and stand around and wait
it can save a lot of time and trouble
there's one expression i don't like the country expression if it ain't broke don't fix it
go ahead
i would like to talk about maybe college basketball
i'd like to see it turned back to the southwest conference down here
since we're supposed to talk about specific teams i would like to see them turned back to where the college player plays for four years and then they're not semi-pro and just go on and are stolen by the league in three years
i'd like to see them to be true athletes where they're taking a regular college course
i'd like to see
i
since you can talk for hours go ahead
if you like sports go right ahead with this one
i know like what you just said
purdue had to
their best player this year averaged twenty points a game they had to make him sit the bench and actually kicked him off the team because his grades even though they passed big ten standings and they passed n c double a did not pass purdue requirements
that's surprising that they have better requirements
he was treated like all the rest of students
their very best player
they probably lost over half their games by twenty points which is what he averaged
he had to sit
they've got three players top recruiting class this year that
they're going to have to be
the prep school they go to before they can play because they aren't smart enough
it's just sad
purdue even though they're one of the few schools that really stress academics they're suffering
i agree
i think that there's a lot of inconsistencies when some conference players come from outside of texas and play us here
they're obviously practicing sixty hours a week
there's no consistency
seems to me that purdue when they're trying
they all should be playing another team that has about twenty hours to practice a week
there are teams that practice sixty hours a
they're not going to class at all
that's what i mean by semi-pro
i think they ought to get rid of that
he didn't go to class and so they just said you can't make the grades
i'm all for the
baseball has a minor league system
i think that the football and basketball should let them go have a semi-pro team
i think i'd like to see college athletes
i don't like the pros at all
they're high scoring
there's no defense it seems
they just kind of score a hundred twenty five points hundred twenty-two
i don't really get much out of that
it is fun to watch some real disciplined teams play in college
i saw princeton i think it was or harvard play this year
they're all white
their starting guard had s a t scores of fifteen hundred
it was so funny to watch them play against the other teams
it was like they played so much smarter and more disciplined
i don't know
their style of play was so much different from the teams that just run and gun
that's so much fun to watch because they're pure amateurs and there's no money involved
i'd like to see athletes or fellow students like myself play the game
in fact i like amateur sports
i don't think that college football or basketball should have to be semi-pro
everybody should play
i'm kind of racist i guess when i say i like to see the white guys do well
again i'd just like to see the true student athlete
play basketball
i don't like to see the ones that have no intention of going to class
texas is usually not the best team
the other teams i'm sure practice a lot more
s m u down here in footballs and trying to get back to having true student athletes
that's what i think is a lot of fun
there's just so much pressure on the schools i think to win though
it's like if they don't win they don't get any money so the school suffers which is kind of bad
that's just how it always is
i always thought that university was for an education and then sports of course is part of the education
i don't know why the don't keep fencing and all that
they seem to be
that's not
i just think that amateur sports should stay in universities
it just seems so sad to have to only rely on college football
is that all they're going to have to make money
i didn't think that was the objective to make money
it seems like it is
it really is
you're a t i up in sherman
very good
certainly high school football and college football
again high school football is just so much fun to watch
not everybody plays of course but they're still
it's still
there's absolutely no money involved whatsoever
you know they're going to class
it's real amateur sports
have you heard of damon bailey
last year when he was in high school they drew a crowd of forty-one thousand for the state finals when he played
i never been in a football game in high school that had that many
that's pretty big
he's from indiana
he plays for indiana now
indiana him to be a lot bigger than pro basketball up there
the high school games that seems to be the big attraction and college
my office mate here earl he goes to all the maverick games
he loves that
he would be
this is a great question for him
he's got
he goes to a lot of the maverick games and everything
i can't get interested at all
i listen to him
occasionally i'll watch them on channel eleven
i can't
of pro anyway
they start
the last what five minutes they decide who's going to be the winner i guess
mavericks had two players this year that they got rid of last year
they both left this past year
both of them were on playoff teams
they benefitted tremendously by leaving the mavericks
sam perkins here he's one guy i did follow
he was
he never quite achieved the super stardom that he had in college
basketball they have a nice
what kind of garden do you have
we've tried having
i'm from chicago
the way that bugs and weeds grow down here is very different
we have tried several years in a row
we've given up between the fire ants the pill bugs the weeds the drought and a hundred and ten degree heat all summer
we just kind of decided to go with a few flowers and give up on the vegetable garden
we have really been frustrated by our gardening attempts here
if you really water a lot you can do it
when you have to pay for water it really gets to be an annoyance to have to water constantly
right now we're just
we just try to maintain the
that's the extent of contributing to our food supply
that's nice to have
what do you do up there
None
the peonies have been out for now about three weeks the roses have been blooming for two weeks
the grass is this lush green
of course i've got lots of weeds in mine because
i just keep looking at
i say jeez this is the first year it's been so perfect
my garden
boy that sounds wonderful
i'm going gee this can't
you'd have to
that's it
last year i think it was my peonies were budding in january
there was no way that was going to make it
sure enough we had really mild weather until i think it was may or something everything just got hit hard
yeah
it's interesting
i enjoy gardening
my husband does that thank goodness because that's not a pleasure for me
i just
i don't know whether it's little old ladies living there or what but you could just tell that they had a love affair with their gardens with beautiful wild flowers
i love the host of colors that just keep coming all year long
that's one thing that impressed me so much is no matter what size yard somebody had they had a beautiful garden in it
it could be
i do admire that but i haven't really put too much energy into it
they help you
that has put a crimp in my every activity other than diapers and laundry i'll tell you
that's nice
the peach tree is a start
it's been wonderful to have the peaches
we still have to spray some
we don't have to just asphyxiate ourself with the poison which is good
we've tried them
again it's just like the sun scorch
it's just
you really
that's really what makes the most sense
you don't have to use so much water
it really does the job
it's just amazing how hot and dry and for how long it gets out here
if you're not really committed to it
me i'm real committed to it for about a week and then i forget about it for a week
i go yeah i need to do something
maybe when i get older
i would assume too
you've got three or four months you're talking about
we don't have really a spring or a fall it just immediately heats up
that's one thing i miss about living up north as i remember the long springs and long falls and the cooler weather
we always had gardens when i was living in chicago
got my stepfather to put in a waterfall and a little pond in one corner
that was the most energy invested in anything in the whole time i ever knew him
i don't know what that says about it all
she used to love to do stuff like that
maybe when the boys get a little older we'll do some more planting
they like to see things grow
i think it would be fun for them
it sounds like you've got your hands full
it's not off the list
it's very therapeutic
i planted bulbs last fall on the side guard and when i went out there in the spring
the first day they came out the little one went and pulled all the flowers off
the flower petals were scattered all over the walk
i guess i could be thankful for that
good luck to you
have you ever organized a family reunion
we are going to have one on memorial day i guess
they have had one the last two years we go out to my dad's farm and spend the night
about ten
it is not that big
we have had sort of weekends like that too
i never thought of it really as a reunion
i sort of think of a reunion with all the extended family
some is in new york and north carolina
it gets
it is kind of hard to get everybody organized
is there someone
my dad has a house out there anyway
there is
he keeps food out there
he does not live there though
it is a country home
it sounds nice
all my grandparents are dead so
then an uncle is dead
the big family is a lot smaller that it used to be
we are all
they live up in sherman
all of his children live in the dallas area too
that is about it
we have
i was going to live in france for a year
my parents invited
we all got together for just a party
that was kind of fun
it was on new year's day
it was almost a celebration of the new year too at the same time
who was it
everybody flew in from all over the place for the weekend
it really sounded like it was fun
i am not quite sure what i would do
i think it would be fun to rent a big mansion or house someplace
that would be kind of fun
at least that way it is at nobody's house so no one person is responsible for everything
they do not have to clean up afterwards
do you have horses or anything at your dad's farm
i am sorry
does your dad have horses there
he does not really have any domestic livestock anyway
he leased to his neighbor for the cattle to feed on
he really does use it as a vacation home
it is not a farm that he has somebody else run for him or something like that
he has a garden and a lot of fruit trees and blueberry bushes and things
that sounds nice
there is wild blackberries there too
we used to go pick wild blackberries at my friend's property
we never got enough
i never had enough to really make more than a jar or something
it was not so worth it
they're kind of off and on it seems like
it is eighty acres
that is pretty big
here it would be a huge
most of it
that is where the ponds are and where everybody fishes
my uncle put some bass in his pond a few years ago
he put some crappie too
the bass
we have a little pond at his vacation home too
really little
they were having problems with too many goldfish because we had put some goldfish in
there were too many little goldfish
the big ones never got bigger
somebody suggested to get a bass
they went fishing and caught a bass near some place and put it in there and never saw it again
we do not know whether it is living
it is probably in there just burping goldfish
we started
we started with i think ten or twenty little feeder fish that i picked up for a dollar
no matter how many it was for a dollar
some of them are probably eight inches long
he wants your really big ones the ones that get to be a foot and a half long
there is a
you might put some yellow catfish in there
they get huge
they routinely use goldfish for bait for yellow catfish
we would want to put some small ones in so they do not eat the big guys the goldfish too
catfish do i think
we could try it
he was trying to catch them using little
there's little nets you can use to catch fish to use as feeder fish and things like that
it was really funny
one time he left the net in the pond
he would put some tuna fish or things in the middle of it to attract the fish
he left it in the middle of the pond
that night he came out and the trap was gone
it was a raccoon that had taken it
it was really funny
you could see that
you could see where the trap was dragged and things like that
they feed the catfish every couple of weeks
sometimes that is the best time to catch them
they will just come after anything then
you could catch a couple anyway during that time
mixed purina
it is catfish food
it is especially made for catfish
i do not know how much different it is from dog food but
it looks like purina high pro
it is the best time to take pictures
they come up to the top and you can see their whiskers come through the water
the big catfish just kind of vacuum the top of the water
i have never seen catfish except
i think i have seen once or twice in the museum
i have never seen them
they are really funny fish
when you catch them they make a kind of a burping growling sound at you
they try to hit you with their tails
the channel catfish get up to
okay how long in feet
that is only about three and a half feet long
from the time
they stay slender until they get to be eighteen inches long and then they start to widen out
we were up there one time and my daughter was fishing
i think that was when she was three
she caught a catfish by accident
she said here and she handed me her rod and reel
it swimmed wherever it wanted to
all righty
enjoy your weekend
i work with computers just like your son i actually do research in speech recognition part of the reason i'm participating in the project is to see how the stuff goes
i was working
actually i haven't worked for any large companies per se recently
hopefully the job that i will have will have lots of benefits namely lots of vacations not real good salary but lots of vacations
the one john works for seems to have good benefits
the pay is decent
where
one of the companies i was working for actually had very good health care benefits which these days i think are really important health care is so ridiculously expensive
we're paying our own insurance right now
i'm
we actually had a little baby i'm taking a little bit of a time off from work
i had a granddaughter
one thing that i'm very concerned with now is first of all health benefits
it's more important with a family our routine doctor's visits covered
my health insurance only covers the emergency care
i don't
that helps some
it's for each event
that's pretty high
that's right
it covers the emergency things but it doesn't cover if you get sick it doesn't cover doctor's visits things like that
five hundred dollars is a lot to come up with for each person to be able to start using your major medical too
she
course we live in a rural sort of setting where she works she has no benefits at all
her wage is not very good
it's the type of area we live in
probably the medical care is less expensive too
she has to pay for it herself they have to pay for their own insurance
i think that in general the doctor's fees are probably lower there
the insurance would cost lower
from what i've seen
i know that friends of mine had a baby up in boston their costs were about fifty percent of what it cost to have it in manhattan
they were at one of the better hospitals good doctors in boston
i was at one of the big hospitals in new york
that's a huge difference just between it's two big cities that i think of as somewhat comparable
i was pretty shocked at that
the other thing that i'm really concerned about
most companies don't have
some are starting to have is day care it would be really nice to be able to have someone that could watch my daughter at work
i'd go to work
if she were sick i could go down and see her if she needs to be fed whatever
it would be much more convenient
they have to take their two children to day care
it's
i really don't
getting them there and going to work and then picking them up and
your hours are
to me that
i suppose i should be concerned with life insurance and retirement plans
i don't know
i think those benefits you mentioned sometimes they're even more important than the wage itself
if you can get those benefits even
they come out to a much better benefit than an increase in your wage a lot of times
you're
certainly something like day care at the work place would make life so much simpler that it's worth paying having a lower salary
everything else being equal
your life would be so much easier
there's a question of quality of life also
if it was there you would really have a little more knowledge on what's going on probably with your child
you don't feel like you're a half hour away if something happened
unfortunately there aren't
one daughter works for m c i
where she works they don't have anything like that
pittsburgh's a big enough city too
i wouldn't be surprised if thing's like that didn't happen more in smaller communities before they happen in bigger ones
many times small companies offer better benefits in terms of quality of life than larger companies
one company had proposed to me that i could come back to work after having the baby any where between ten and forty hours a week
and call my own days call my own hours
they were very flexible that would be great
if you get two weeks off you get two weeks off and you're not allowed two weeks and one day
it all depends on what your position is there too
that's true in any company i think
i can't say i've never
i've maybe worked five years out of our married life out of the home the rest of the time i've been an
was that when you were
you have to take care of any benefits you want yourself
the same thing
my husband is unfortunately being paid as a consultant we tried to argue that he should get more salary for that than what he is
they
they refuse to give him more salary
they say they can't pay more than this and that and they're not allowed to pay him more than what his previous salary was and things like that times are rough now
it's new
it's harder to get the increases and things
a consultant really should be more knowledgeable than everybody else
he's been doing a long term
he's really sort of a temporary employee at a place
they pay him as a consultant but he doesn't get any health benefits
he doesn't get we don't care about retirement benefits
he doesn't get vacation benefits
he does a lot of things that get factored into somebody else's salary
really his salary should be twenty percent or thirty percent higher just based on that not including the fact that it's a long term commitment for the company and all that sort of stuff
they'll do it
are you
i see
that's neat
i'm a contract person at t i in fact involved with data switchboard do you work for t i
i've worked for them for several years twelve now i guess
you sound very young
have you seen any movies recently
i'm trying to think
did you
we saw dances with wolves have you seen that one
i have a hard time with movies that are real long
oddly enough i do too
i've heard a lot of good things about it
we both just thoroughly enjoyed it just really liked it i'm trying to think
we went to see a real funny one
my wife and i went and saw a couple of funny ones
we have not seen that
we saw the naked gun two and a half that was pretty funny
we saw
i haven't seen that one
it's i can't think of what that was called
through the summer
likes to rent them we watch a lot of them at home as they come out
i enjoyed that movie
i was real disappointed i'm a real big patrick swayze fan i was really disappointed in it
i don't think it was as funny as what i was anticipating
i guess i was expecting it to be kind of funny and it wasn't at all
it was
van damme
we just got through watching one with is it claude van damme and enjoyed it
it was of course one of the typical kicking fighting lots of blood
we enjoyed that
the one with jody foster did you see it
silence of the lambs
that was one that stayed with me for a month
i kept thinking about it
it's amazing
really when you stop and think about it anthony perkins didn't have that big a role in the movie and yet it was his character that was so intriguing
it was excellent
of course he's such a very good actor anyway i think he made the movie
i really did jody foster was good too but i think anthony perkins was the one that really made the movie
it
i thought she was good in that
i agr-
i haven't been
i saw her in the keys
i thought that was a pretty good movie
i thought she
i didn't see that one
that was pretty interesting movie
i did
it didn't scare me all that much
i don't like to go to movies to be scared
that's not why i go
that one was
that one very definitely kept you on the edge of the seats
in fact i want to rent it when it comes out for my husband to see
he didn't see it
he didn't he won't go see that
no i went with our daughter saw it with her and enjoyed it
i've seen it
we've rented it several times we just love it
in fact we have a ten year old grandson
it's pretty cute
i guess as far as comedies go probably my favorite is young frankenstein
my husband liked that he's a big gene wilder fan
gene wilder doesn't do that much for me
i'm a big mel brooks fan all his movies i really
i have seen it advertised
is that the one that's he's starring in
that came out early in the summer or something like that
blazing saddles
did you see that one that he made years and years ago about the sheriff blazing saddles
that's my husband's all time favorite i think
i like that one too but i thought young frankenstein was better
that had all kinds of things throughout the whole movie
i'm trying to think
we saw another one that we thought was really good early this summer that was a suspenseful movie
it's
for myself i'm personally against it
we seem to have a duality of in this country where most states in theory have it but do not use it
i'm for it
i think there are certain crimes that definitely call for it
i feel that child molestation and murder
i don't feel like they're a benefit to society in any way
of course texas has it but they very seldom put it into effect
instead all of our prisons are full of people on a lot of people on death row
texas uses it about as much as any other state
yeah which is not very often
here in maryland to the capital punishment law
people are sometimes sentenced to capital punishment but no one actually has the sentence carried out
i'd certainly
affair number in fact i think that it affected the sentence though capital punishment is available
the sentence of life without possibility of parole has become a common one and is being used much more
i don't know the exact numbers
yes
i know that we have
really in fact they're releasing people that are in there for not major crimes but robberies and assault and things like that
because they don't have room then they're coming back on the streets and of course doing it again
we're having problems in that way
i know that there are some cases that capital punishment does not fit the crime
there are extenuating circumstances on certain types but i have to say that i'm honestly for it almost that eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
you're certainly in the majority at least in this country
we are i guess the only one of the major western nations currently with capital punishment
i know they use it very
there are many reasons for it
they certainly have lower crime rates and lower murder rates
you wonder how they manage to do that
in part it's the nature of societies perhaps more homogenous society in many cases
arguably is because of welfare state benefits
we tend to be skeptical
england don't they have a fairly large welfare
there's no question that they have all kinds of cradle to grave programs welfare programs providing for everyone some way
i
i don't know
we have a lot of welfare programs
if both do and they tend to have less crime you wonder if that has anything to do with it then
is it
in our society people are brought up over here thinking that everybody owes them something
i think that idea is even more common in western europe
do you
that's interesting
i would not have said that
i'm not that familiar
i'm not that familiar with that
all i know is that for instance we were in germany in
we subscribe to people magazine and to time
of course i like the people magazine because it's gossipy and it's fast reading
the time of course is more newsworthy
it has more world affair type things of course
i will purchase a good housekeeping occasionally especially around the holiday time because of recipes and ideas and things like that do you subscribe to any magazines
for a while i haven't gotten any because i just find that i'm not reading what i'm getting because i have so much going on in my life
i found that i was wasting my money as much as i enjoy them when i do subscribe
i've gotten in the past the parents magazine and the housekeeping magazine
our children are grown i'm letting their mother read on the grandchildren
i found that after a couple of years of having a parents magazine it was getting repetitious
i kind of canceled it anyway for that reason
the housekeeping magazines i do like because like you say they have nice recipes in them and ideas but lately they've just been piling up on me
i figured it wasn't something i needed at this point in time
do you think that people subscribe to magazines as much as they used to
i
he's the type who will get the inc magazine and money magazine and all the financial type magazines
my husband does that
of course naturally wall street journal and or sports illustrated
i don't know
i know a few people leafing through them at the store you just don't hear people talk about them
i know years ago when my children were young and stuff i just loved ladies home journal mccall's good housekeeping
i took them all then i don't know what
in the seventies maybe late seventies they changed their format i haven't
some of those have had what i consider or what
i get the idea that they are maybe the more pricier type magazines as far as women's magazines
they seem just to be so chocked full of ads
they are
my sister takes town and country and vogue she sends them to me
there's really nothing in them but advertisements for very expensive clothes very expensive jewelry things that the average middle class citizen is not going to be purchasing
what i do is i flip through them and pitch them then
they're not something i take any length of time over
i have discovered that with my available time i would rather actually read a book than a magazine
yes
now i have certainly stopped subscribing as much as i used to
they get tons of magazines it seems they're always getting something in the mail
between reading to them and reading the newspaper
i have a book that i'm occasionally reading when i get a chance
i just don't get a chance for those newsy magazines the ones that are full of ads
i read them when i'm at a doctor's office or waiting on something like that
as i said i subscribe to people and to time
i will go through the time but usually not cover to cover
i like reading the passage of people or something
i do like the people magazine
it reminds me of the old time movie magazines when i was young that's one i really like that
it's quick reading
sometimes after i've worked all day and have things to do at night i just i want fluff
it's much more relaxing
it seems like we both kind of agree on the subject of magazines yeah
i think that probably i will end the call
i very seldom read a newspaper
mainly if i'm really wanting an in-depth thing i'll watch c n n
i find it one of the best
otherwise it's just one of the regular channels eight or five
where do you get yours
mostly from t v too
we do take the dallas morning news
once in a while i'll sit down and
not very often do i read the whole thing
i take the dallas morning news
my husband he reads it cover to cover
if he thinks there's something that i need to know about he'll say here you need to read this
i don't know
i kind of quit reading it several years ago when the kids were teenagers
if i wanted to read i wanted to read something light and relaxing and things like that
i coul-
it got so depressing
if there's something that i want to know more about or som-
i find that i do better with remembering it and everything if i watch the t v
they kind of capsize it and everything
i think sometimes it's maybe a little biased i-
you get the sensationalism as opposed to just pure facts
i wanted a little more detail
i guess you just want to know
with interest i found some people that were members of our church which was different
that made you even feel a little more kin
of the same type of church that we belong to
the same type of church
that made it a little more and that they were from utah also
that was interesting
i enjoy the news
i think our seven year old e- once in a while will sit down and watch it with us
i used to
i didn't used to
when my grandchildren have stayed over before and even maybe when our kids were younger one of the channels used to give brief inserts of news at a child's level
i thought that was very interesting
i thought that was very important for kids
they brought down something that had happened like if there was something going on in the war they would bring it down to a child's level in words that they could understand what was going on
i noticed that my grandchildren seemed to kind of enjoy that
he would particularly enjoy this
i think that's really interesting
i even understood it better
i have kind of a blas3e attitude about news and news reporting which is not good
do you have a certain station you like to watch when you watch it
channel five for some reason has always been
i don't know
i don't know
i thought it was very interesting
channel nine watching it when the murders were in killeen going on
they have that hour that nine to ten of an evening
we had the t v on
we were trying to catch all of it
they were showing some
i was watching
we switched over to channel eight
the difference in coverage was unbelievable
i can understand why they're kind of behind
channel eleven
that is if you want to go to bed
it's nice to watch that early news sometimes
the coverage wasn't near as good as when we switched over to channel eight
they didn't e-
would you like to begin or would you like me to start
i can start
i think one of the biggest improvements in women is that finally you're starting to see them get into management you're seeing them get elected to
not near enough
you're not seeing
i have a sister that's an attorney in oklahoma city
i know the company that she was with
the women didn't have near the levels that the men attorneys had
and were not given the same respect
i think you do see more and more women out there in politics too as mayors or in helping to maybe get some legislation passed to have women have more rights
i think still even with that whole thing with judge thomas you still felt like the woman was the one that you would maybe discredit first before the man
something the way they had the trial
i just think that it's still going to take another generation or so before before the women could really feel that they're really equal in the business world and that they work just as hard or harder
it's still
going from homemakers into corporate leaders is still a big step
i also think that women as homemakers are beginning to get more respect than they used to be
then it was almost like a put down particularly even by women in the work force
i think people are realizing that the roles women play in the home are very very important
it's getting the respect which is about time
i think also people are having children at a older age it's maybe
you maybe work for a few years
you have your first child
None
maybe people that are just working and think you just stay at home
then when they're in their thirties and have their first and second kid it's like they lose it
None
to those that have never worked and have stayed home with the kids kind of does your heart good
i know i stayed home with mine and didn't start working until mine were in high school
it kind of does me good
i think also one of the things that's really tremendous the fact that the fathers are so involved with families
which again i think helps a woman's role
my oldest is eleven
i've pretty much been home since brian was born
just recently i went back to work last school semester to tutor high school age students with learning disabilities
i was just out of the house two days a week i thought wow this is really hard
it was only two days
i was home before three
getting the baby to day care getting the kids off to school i still did everything i always do
my husband still got up and went to work it
i had to
i had my grandchildren for four days during soccer season i would work
i would have to get them picked
these women that are waiting until they're in their late thirties or early forties to have their first children i think are absolutely crazy
i know a lot of people
that's not considered really young these days
that's almost i have friends that have kids just starting kindergarten
they're forty years old
maybe a two year old at home
i think boy i'm in my thirt-
did you get to go to hawaii
we went six months after we were married
we just went to two islands
we also hit maui
of course the big one
with the big one i thought was very commercialized
the other two were just lovely
it was quiet and restful and so beautiful
it was rainy
we don't like to spend the money to go over there and sit on the beach anyway
it wasn't real rainy
we had a few showers but nothing that really got in the way with anything and just very brief ones
when
we went to nassau
my husband liked it better than he did hawaii
he didn't like oahu at all
he thought honolulu was just horrible
that was wonderful we both enjoyed it very much
i've been to nassau too
to tell you the truth i think i'd rather just go to the island
our son and daughter-in-law
i know they didn't like it
we have several friends that have been on and just love them
james and i like
did you
i went with my sister just a couple years ago
we both the first night just had to leave dinner
after that it got better
we just
it was a four day we were both ready to get off the boat
i think if we ever go it will only be for a three day
we've been real lucky
have you
the first time we went to london europe and touched a little bit of scotland
second time we went to munich germany and were there a week and loved
we were there in the fall before the snows started
it was wonderful
it was marvelous
we would love to go back there
we'd love to go back to london
just ten months
ten months
i would like to
she would like to go to spain
i would like to go to ireland
i don't know if i'd like to go there just from the problems
the there is uh-huh
is a little scary
i would still like to see it
i'd like to see
course there is a lot of places in the united states i still want to go to
have you been to yellowstone
i was there as a child and then we we went to california and came back through yellowstone with our kids
they loved it
i was in utah in salt lake city when i was a youngster
i've touched on that
i'm just about a half hour north of salt lake
it's at my husband works in salt lake
we're real close
that's a pretty city
we like it
we kind of like it
do you like to camp those kind of trips
now
you like the motels
None
we've gone past the camping stage
did you
we did a lot of camping out there in the smokeys
it was beautiful
our kids loved it and everything
we moved to
camping is not near as much fun
the kids were getting older and were involved in activities so the camping sort of went by the wayside
although our son loves to fish
our daughter and her husband are talking now about starting camping with their boys now that they have gotten older
i've been concerned about crime lately
it's really scary to listen to the news every night and uh-huh
i think we have a neighborhood watch
i haven't heard any more since
i don't really know
as far as personally doing something no
we've been trying to install some outside lights
we put up a fence in the backyard
mostly not so much thinking that we would deter someone to break in but that our children would be safe playing in the yard
i guess most of the crime that i'm concerned about generally is against my kids
i'm sure it is
to let them go play with someone because of what you hear about people getting picked up and everything
i have to spend a good deal of time watching them
we did install
mainly it was so when we pulled up the light would come on
also we have a boat back there we have neighborhood kids that like to get into mischief
we thought with that light it would maybe keep them from doing something
i don't believe there's been much trouble in our neighborhood
it does seem that there is a lot more here in plano of just bored teenagers
that's pretty much what it is kids that are bored like you say
they don't
course
you don't know if it's someone their teenagers know or is it just random crime
we've been real lucky that no one in my family anywhere that they live has been a victim of a serious crime
it's really scary to know that you can live a normal life and try to be a good citizen it doesn't mean you'll be safe
i guess i take little bit of
there's not so much of it completely innocent victims compared to
it is scary
i'm originally from chicago but i've been in this area in the lewisville area for about twenty-three years
has it been getting worse that you noticed or about the same
like i say
i don't think necessarily in this area here but just dallas in general
i think back of when i was younger and in my party days some of the things i did i wouldn't be caught dead like being out that late at night
i noticed that when
we moved here from houston not too long ago
of course we were interested in schools the schools in houston all have big tall fences around them
they're not really very safe it's been interesting to come to the plano area where the schools don't have fences at all
in houston there was the mentality that they weren't safe at school
that's been something that's been good in this area that you feel like there's not going to be too many knifings or shootings
anyway i guess i won't take up more of your ti-
i am new to texas
i don't even know what the law is
we've done away with our quote fair share number
that's right
different things
it's certain crimes capital crimes murder of course rape
it seems to be a disproportionate number of blacks that get into the system
the one thing that i think is really sad about it as i recall from the articles that i've read is that if people who have been there
they want
they're anxious for someone to be killed
maybe it just depends on how closely the crime
i don't know
a person personally
i think i would be
really if i had to say yes or no i guess i would say that i am in certain cases in favor of the death penalty
i don't know how we'd ever find out really whether it is or not
there is so many chances for appeal that it kee-
i just think
somehow i hoped that as a people we could be better than expecting
someone is calling for someone else to be killed
i suspect i would be a lot more favor of it if one of my children were brutally killed or something like that
like i say i think it depends on how personally affected you might be by it
there really are criminals that are hard-core and
that's right
i don't know
it's not to me personally
i do go to church and things
like you say if it hit you personally
closer at home you would feel differently
it's a tough tough question
i think the u s is one of the few countries that still do
i think there was only six or eight countries in the world that have capital punishment still
a lot of them had to have elected not to do so
i don't know what they do in place of it
maybe it's life in prisonment or something
i don't know how they handle it
i was surprised to learn that so few countries have capital punishment
it doesn't seem like very many people are really
but there's not very many people that actually do get killed
it seems like a of people live there
then through appeals
i know they do frequently
they cover it pretty heavily on television and the newspaper
that delays it for a few years just right off the bat
there's a lot of last minute
is it
that's fairly recent i don't know how recent but fairly recent in the state of texas
before that it was death by electrocution
which seems so awful
it's a little bit more humane
if you had to chose i am sure i would take the lethal injection
it's a tough question
i guess if i had to say yes or no i would say yes
i would have to lean toward capital punishment for certain crimes
do you think that we do it because we want it to deter crime
it's not because we don't want to pay for inmates to stay in prison
we hope that it will be some sort of deterrent or you know an eye for an eye type thing or something like that
some of the crimes are just so brutal and so useless
i notice that the crime rate was up in the dallas area
it's kind of been scary
you're hoping there is something that will cut down on that
you hate to have the dubious honor of being so high in statistics
i
have we been very very fortunate
we don't
how they would expect
you hear of people who have committed crimes and then they get out of jail and they go and they do the same thing again
you wonder why they can't just stop it
maybe you would
still i would hate to be on the jury that sentenced someone
would i
fortunately i have never been in that circumstance
i hope i never am like everybody else
i know when
we moved here i got a jury summons
just constantly it seemed
fortunately i had small children
i didn't have to go
it's not that
i think everyone should have to serve on the jury
it's a big responsibility
i would hate to have to hear any kind of case
anyway i sure have enjoyed talking to you about this although it has been difficult
it's a tough subject
i'd hate to decide it but i guess it's important
that we decide as a people what we're going to do
anyway you have a good day
thank you
patricia i was just about to get on my tread mill
i remembered that i didn't make a call last night
i thought i'd make one tonight
i have an exercise bicycle in my bedroom but it usually's holding clothes
sometimes she just flops them all over the seat
that's not why i got it
i was doing that on the exercise bike
i do that too
my legs
those are going away
that's real good
this one yeah
i hope so
you can believe that anyway right
my husband bought it because we'd never get out and go walking or anything
we go to the lake
we ski and swim in the summer
besides that
in bad weather you'd have to do something inside
my husband was just running out the door
i decided to do it
what subjects have you talked about
that's interesting
my goodness
she was
that would have been interesting
one night i talked to one guy
a couple of weeks later i talked to the guy's roommate in virginia about different things
that's neat
did you feel rewarded while you were doing it
how'd you find out about it
i don't know
i presume
they must have been asking
she saw it on the computer screen and they made copies of it
they wanted anybody
that's interesting
i couldn't understand
i thought it was an advertisement and they just were also called t i
if you work for t i you're supposed to get a prize is what i heard
if you don't work for them you're supposed to get cash
then on the letter it says cash or prize
the prizes are pretty nice
depending on how many calls i think three was the minimum
it went up to i don't know nine or ten
how many calls have you had
it sounds like a lot
some of the prizes are pretty nice
like what
i wish i had that booklet here
i think i do
they have some watches that look really nice
seems like too nice a prize for just nine calls isn't it
you will receive in the mail a numbered certificate for your calls and explanation how to redeem
this only goes up to f
i thought that was somewhere around nine
anyway it's got these beautiful watches on it
it has a clock radio that also plays tapes
then it's got some binoculars and some pretty brass lamps
got a food processor
it's not all stuff that t i makes
i haven't seen anything in here that t i makes the mister coffee the double mister coffee the two
and there's a phone in here that's hilarious
there's an attache case and cordless telephone
there's a card table doesn't have any chairs just a card table some more jewelry suitcases
have you seen those anniversary lamps where the little balls go around
i can't think
it's got a lot pages and pages
here's a calculator but it's not even made by t i
i believe it came in his mail
here's a camera and a dustbuster and some tools a lot of tools a man might like
you're bound to find something you want
here's more jewelry
there's even pictures and little porcelain things to put on a coffee table
here's some brass animals brass candlesticks
i'm sure you'd find something
None
do you know you have a ten minute time limit
that's okay
they come on and they tell you got five seconds to say good-bye
let's see
i never would go
i sit and study
i have really ballooned up since then
he's says i ought to join one of those that makes you go
the first one i joined they went out of business
they transferred it to another one that was really far away
we were going to do it
then forget that
the second time i was going to do it at richland college
we'd end up just smoking cigarettes and riding around like we couldn't find the place
my husband's just discouraged me on those things
if you can make yourself do the tread mill gosh that's a good workout
i got one of those jane fonda workout tapes that i dubbed from a friend
i don't have a baby anymore
i've got a step-daughter
there's where the money goes
me i'm going and my daughter janet in austin
i'll probably have to sell the prize i get
what are you doing
i'm going to be certified as an english teacher teach english as a second language
i didn't have to take any other exit test because i've been teaching for quite a while
i've heard they're terrible
they really don't help you a whole lot
i went to e t
i took one course through t w u
she's the only one that lives near by
that will be nice though
the rest live in
couple lives in pittsburg
one lives near d c
still sort of up in that general area of the country you can probably see them sometimes
the ones in pittsburg of course we see more often
what kind of recycling do you have in your area
they've been trying different things
one of the biggest problems seems to be they don't have anyplace to put some of the things that need recycled
right now we've recycled glass for years because we have a glass industry in our community
glass has been recycled for a long time
we have a cycling area set up here at our house
the boy scouts they've done that for years
the stores are recycling their plastic bags now
they have bins to collect those
the aluminum cans
they try to do the newspapers
they had to close their area down because they couldn't sell it
that didn't work
somebody told me that they were charging as much for it as they did for straw
the farmers would buy the straw if it's a similar price
let's see
mainly the glass the aluminum the plastics
it sounds like they're doing quite a bit
we're working hard on it because we're fighting also in our area a large hazardous waste incinerator which we do not want built
we would like industry to do more before they build these big huge incinerators
we just feel they should offer industry some incentives to do more reducing of their waste products and reusing
some of those companies that are doing it save money eventually
once they get established then it's a money saving thing
our company does some things all of which i couldn't even tell you about
what is t i
texas instruments
my son works for
go ahead
i was just curious as how you got hooked up with this speech type of thing
my son works for the federal government
he works in a computer laboratory
it was through him that
here at work each one of us has two trash baskets in our office
one of those is designed for any kind of paper products that they want to use for recycling
maybe you could tell me what is the difference between office paper waste and just newspapers
i guess i don't know specifically except that for the paper that they want to recycle they do not want any newspaper and things like candy wrappers or that type of thing
they don't want lunch sacks or brown envelopes phone books
there are a lot of kinds of things that they don't want but then any kind of computer paper letters booklets
it doesn't all have to be white
even some of those can have plastic tabs on them
it's hard to kind of figure out which things are the right ones
i'll frequently have to look at the list
they do that
we use different chemicals and things
i know
i don't know all the details
they're really on top of that
there probably some other things that i don't about because we're a real large company
i just don't have contact with them
in our city
i live in a suburb of dallas they have initiated a newspaper recycling whereby they pick it up from your alley one day a week and all you have to do is bundle it
all around dallas there are a lot of recycling centers where you can take things sometimes for money but most of those are real far away from where i live at any rate
it would be inconvenient in other words to
it's hasn't been very practical to get into a lot of those things
if they would make it something where they would pick it up at the curb or at least make it down the street and at the corner
type of thing
our grocery store like yours will take the plastic bags
they'll also take the paper bags back
you mentioned the glass type of stuff
the reason i ask you about that is years ago my dad used to work for knox glass in
knox is just over the hill here
they no longer are active
he worked for them for thirty-one years
for heaven's sake
he used to travel up there to knox quite a bit
i even did once when i was a child
for heaven's sake
None
we only live probably about fifteen twenty miles from knox
they had some pictures and things in there of knox
i guess that's about it as far as what goes on that i know about
they are more concerned
we're just real concerned about this incinerator because they want to put it right in between two of our main water sheds that feed the clarion river
we just don't want it anyplace
we feel that they should give businesses more incentives to do more recycling and more reduction and more reuse and all those things that could be done
we don't think some of the politicians are really interested in our best interests
it's been a real struggle and a hardship for a lot of people in our area that we've have been fighting against this thing in trying to have things changed
to make them more right
i think probably more people would participate if they just made it a little easier
like you say make it better for companies to do these things
just to deal with trash
we're going to pay for that whether we pay industry or
we've already paid industry for these super fund that's cleaning up
we all help to pay to have them haul it away from their place
where they put it now they found it's not a safe place
now they have to clean those up
it's our money that's cleaning this
now they want to put it in
that will make another hazardous dump eventually they'll have to do something with that
why not pay industry
and reduce it and not have as much of it
we don't need three quarters of
they think and probably they're right people buy it easier
i know people would be willing to do more like saving their newspapers and that if they had a place to take them
guess our city in picking them up must take them somewhere else
i don't that it's a big money
i've originated only a few
i've received quite a few
i only started doing it after i started getting calls and said heck
i started about a month ago
this is getting close to twenty here which is i think is about all our little gift book goes up to
i don't really know
i'm medical
you pushed the record button
i'm benefits
i'll tell you
it's hard to beat any of the benefits or salaries either
course there's a few things that i think i could do better if i was sitting up in the c e o's seat
i think jerry's doing a pretty good job as it goes
it's kind of
the ones that i think are the highest and important to me i hope i never have to use them really per se although i've used medical a little bit that one certainly is high
i worry that it's weakening rather than strengthening
i like to reverse that trend and say i'd like to get those to strengthen
then salary continuance i've never used that one
that's kind of like an insurance thing
like i say i worked for several different companies
there's nothing to compare with t i here
i really got caught up back in eighty-five
i wasn't with g s i but i was connected with oil
i say i wasn't connected with g s i
i got caught up in a layoff
course you get six months unemployment from the state what t i did for us is they fixed us up with an office with telephones access to long-distance computers a secretary to take messages for us or type letters
they had out of town newspapers
outside consultants
did they have an outside consultant like
they did have seminars every once in a while
course that was not restricted just to just us
the most important thing was that they had made up the difference between unemployment pay and seventy-five percent of my net pay
they then
i was able to not just exist
i lived just as comfortably as i did before i was laid off
they seem to be doing a good job of that
our organization builds those facilities over in park central now
i guess they've been using them for six months now
i've known several engineers that got laid off
they said
the much they learn over there after they've been laid off
he just learned like you
this was not a learning thing by any means
it was just
he said he learned so much
he thought he had a ph d in how to get a job after he was
for several months
course i went through this what about five years ago
i guess it may be one of the best that anyone's doing
that's one of those little extras that you don't see in the handbook
i have
of course i've been looking into it but since i'm only a yellow badger
what do you think of a pension that goes from one company to the other like a four o one account
i've been thinking about that for years
that's what i'm saying that pensions
just like you're saying you've only got so many years
and then just add the money together like you do with a four o one account
it's your account period
that sounds like a hell of an idea
i'm saying that's the question
i'm saying that pensions say in the year two thousand or more when social security goes away which it probably will
you work for a company seven years
what would be the difference between that and social security
social security's going to go to way i think
you can invest your own money
it's not paid for by the current
they may rebel and you won't have any social security where if your money was in your account you can never lose it
you don't have to depend on anybody to be putting that money in for you
i
i like the idea
course that's something like an i r a
instead of having a socialized pension it just would be really money that you and your company
i can see where they'd need to do something on that because the statistics are
you don't work for a company twenty years through no fault of your own
y-
that's what i've done
i've bounced around
not quite that often
yeah
i've got i guess fourteen now here at t i
i hope to make twenty-five which
they lay me off
you have a pension
then you'd have to try to get a pension in another one
again knock wood that i haven't used it
i
i'm not
knock wood
i have the h o m a
i like that a lot better than aetna
again i just
every time i needed it it's
fallen right in line for the minor things
doesn't it work you don't see anything until you spend the minimum
the dental is right away
i have the same dental you have
i don't have a deductible
drugs are okay
i'm on that plan where i take blood pressure medicine
if you take an allergy medicine anything you need a prescription for for more than six months you get it for used to be six bucks
that one i haven't heard about
that's a typical one that's in there
fact you may be able to take advantage of that
it's through baxter labs
do you buy your pills one at a time
turn in your forms
they're twelve dollars
or whatever the amount is
it's a lot cheaper
allergy medicine's really expensive
that blood pressure medicine is fairly expensive
maybe i'll tell you something you didn't know about in benefits
it's a very common thing
we discussed medical and dental
again a hope i never use that one
i don't know what else
say you get another week and
i only got fourteen years
i'll get another week when i hit fifteen
that's fair
it's reasonable
None
i'm here
i don't think i'll ever see a silver badge
i won't be around that long
the way things go i think i'm going to have to work till i'm seventy-five and when i retire get a part-time job
what do you think of our trial system
i don't really know what to think about it
i do know that they're not
i have noticed that that kind of stuff does seem to happen quite a bit
i don't even know what to do about that sort of thing
i think trial by jury it's a lot better than leaving it up to one person
i think the tape said something about changing it such that the
leaving sentencing up to the judge only
just sentencing not the trial itself
i think that judges are probably more informed as to
the general public doesn't know that if they're sentenced to life that they won't serve life
he'll be able to give them the maximum sentence in some cases there
i didn't hear them say that
they give that as an example of something that might happen ye-
i think if the entire trial was left to one person
i don't know
too many people can take vendettas out on people
or just
there are two people who say well he just looks guilty
that's true
that's a wonderful way to get off jury duty
someone says to you
when they ask you if you want to be on
they quickly let you off jury duty i hear
they know that you're biased
that's the way it works there
anyway i think that probably for having it
what about being unanimous
that's sort of a strange case because i wonder what happens when eleven people thinks someone's guilty and one person doesn't
one person thinks that they're not guilty
they can't decide for hours unless they convince that one person
then they consider it a hung jury i think
they have a retrial
i think they either have a retrial eventually or they call it a mistrial or something
i don't know much about that
i just know that
sometimes i think about it actually
i think what if i were that one person and i was completely convinced that this person wasn't guilty
you don't have to be really convinced that he's guilty
just if they can't prove he's guilty
what if eleven other people are saying one thing and you're the one person saying the other thing
would you give in
i wonder about those things or even if it's
i guess if they were to say it doesn't have to be unanimous
what's the cut off number seven five six six
how do you decide
is it
None
you've seen like these t v movies
one thing that i thought was pretty weird is how somebody can't be tried twice for the same crime
i've never quite understood that
i just think it's weird because i've saw of course soap operas
this one guy had framed himself to make it
then he set it up where it looked like somebody was trying to frame him
he was on trial for it
it came out that he was being framed
then he was found not guilty
th-
he couldn't be tried again
they can't do anything about it
i wonder if maybe
i don't know the law on that
if they have new evidence can they retry
can they bring you back
i saw it on l a law too
that's true
i wonder why that
there must be some sort of deep seeded reason for that
something like you can't be tried for the same trial because that would bias the jury or something
None
i'm sure that it's the lawyers
after the defendant defending the defendant's lawyer and the prosecuting attorney
i'm sure the prosecuting attorney could make a real good case if he knew all the details of the defendant's case
of the defense
there's also the issue of for instance very often you can't
when someone is on trial for something you can't bring up prior convictions
if they're on trial for rape you can't bring up the sexual assaults and stuff or whatever
if this man is accused of raping someone then i think that something like the fact that he sexually assaulted someone is a crucial bit of evidence
i
they're not allowed to do that
i often
i never understand
again having
i'm sure there are some deep seated reasons to
often times i wonder about rules like this
i'm sure that there are some reasons for good
that one does seem out of it though because you're allowed to show their character
if it shows that their character's capable of lesser thoughts like that and stuff
that led to that
that's what i think
i don't quite understand
you'll help out a little bit
a lot of the politics will pass laws and stuff that the general public wants
they'll be revoted and all that
that's very true
then again often times they don't as well
often times they don't
they just go
you've got people like who are lame ducks
they sort of don't care about anything and just want to go ahead an
i talked about this the other day
they won't say yes and they won't say no to certain issues just because they don't know what the public wants or the public's split on it
that
i have had that discussion before as well
i wonder about the politics of it all
most of it is politics
even in the courts they're all appointed
that's even another issue
should judges be appointed
often times i look at friends
we had a serial killer around here who killed eleven women
was that some guy that was attacking women jogging
and choking them
his name is arthur
did they have a t v movie about him
i'm sure they will
he was on some sort of news special though
he killed
he was just on trial maybe a year ago
how was he killing the women
he was strangling some of them
because he was
this is a very sad case
he was in prison for sexually assaulting two children
that's what i mean
they're able to do it again
he wasn't allowed back in the town where he had done this
he came to rochester instead
they realized later he had killed about between eleven and twelve women at least
way up north here
i'm originally from kentucky
still way up north sort of
i was up north too
that's one of the reasons i think judges should be the ones to sentence people
they do know
this man was sentenced to i think three life times
it was just horrible
it was televised and this and that
what they were pleading was they were pleading insanity
it's clear to me the man is insane
of course
he should be just locked up for life
they just need to do something with him
i don't know what you do with them at that point if you're that crazy
what struck me is they had a psychiatrist testifying for hours and hours
by the end i realized that maybe it would have been better if it wouldn't have been a jury of his peers but if they had a jury of psychiatrists instead
i don't think it's feasible
it would be an interesting thought if you're
it's supposed to be a jury of your peers
they couldn't have a bunch of psychotics up there
give them a bunch of psychotics but at least have a bunch of psychiatrists
just to look at him and decide from then
they would
what major changes have affected your life
i think that women working is the one that really affects me most strongly right now
women in general and also myself
it used to not really make a difference to me
at least i didn't think so
my mother worked
i kind of now wish that she hadn't
that she had stayed home
right now i'm kind of stuck because i'd like to have children
i'm not ready to do that because when i do have children i want to stay home
i'm having to try to figure out a way to be able to do that
in our society right now that's really something that's not respected
it's not easy to do at all
there's a great deal of sacrifice that has to be made on the part of a family if the wife is going to actually be a mother
that relates to the thing that strikes me the most
i'm sure you've labelled the cause because what strikes me the most in the changes in society is the way kids behave
i think that they have to be related
i was thinking it just
my complaint would be that i think that the kids in the neighborhood run wild
they destroy property
they steal each other's toys and stuff
there's just no respect for people or property
i guess when you stop to think of it these kids have probably been deprived of a lot of attention that they've needed all their lives
i know that in sweden what they have there it's really their medical plan but it also deals with this subject because if a woman is working and i think even if she's not and has a child the government subsidizes her to stay home and raise the child
for how many years
i don't know
until it
that's great
i think that that's a much much more viable solution
i was able to just go to a class and teach when my son was little
i'd be gone an hour and fifteen minutes or something at a stretch
yeah
nobody seemed to have a big problem with that
that's an interesting issue though
there's been so many
a question i would have is
i guess i'm being beyond the age of thinking of this problem
i think you put your finger on it when you said that they're not respected if they don't work because it seems to me that a lot of people i know women i know are doing very menial jobs in a certain sense certainly financially when i see the amount of clothes that they buy and how much it costs them to buy fast food on the way home i'm sure that they're not quote making money for the family on this probably you're right
when i think of this one friend who makes probably twenty thousand dollars a year i'm sure she spends at least that in clothes plus fast food every day and out to lunch every day
if she sat down and looked at it she'd be like god what am i doing this for
even though they don't have children they have relatives
the husband would certainly like a lot more attention
she wouldn't have to hire somebody to clean the house and do the gardening
i guess you're right
that's true
some people now it seems like are turning back toward actually trying to find out what they're in it for instead of just
it
it's just a place to go to visit to wear your nice clothes and to sit around and talk
i think a lot of people are really searching now to find out who they are and who god is and what all that really means now
that might be a positive change in society
it's beginning i think
among people i know i don't see a great
there are those people who have had serious questions all along and are sort of pursuing it the churches here are growing leaps and bounds
i thought it was more because of the very transient nature of the area and that people were going basically just as you said as a social to meet people and that
it's hard to judge
there are a lot of things changing i suppose
just the whole environment i find sort of
i wonder with all our chemicals and that and the foods we eat
young people that i know are getting very serious diseases
i guess that's always happened
it's just
maybe it's more unusual now when somebody quite young gets certain kinds of cancer
in the past maybe the same percentage got them
we didn't know it
i don't know
i guess we've sort of run dry a little bit
do you watch much t v
i watch in the evening with my kids
my children like to watch sesame street
that is not my favorite programs
we have only get two channels
i am not crazy about t v much
it kind of is an idiot box
sesame street is a good program because
i will let him watch that every once in a while
he has learned to count to twenty from that
there are shows that i like
i like good family shows
i let my kids watch things like little house on the prairie
the cosby show is kind of unrealistic as a family unless you live in upper class and have money
i think that sometimes the things they show on there though
the problems that their kids get into are good to show that they do have problems anyway
they also have a lot easier time disciplining their kids than real people do
like i said real life is not that easy
i watch a show that i like for entertainment
it is called the quantum leap
i love quantum leap
i like how he has to help with the people that he becomes
because it is not a show that he just becomes these people and then he lives there for a while and then he is gone
still my little boy he watches videotapes
he won't
it is a not really a good baby sitter
he is four years old
he just does not like to go out there by himself
i will let him watch the t v when i am wanting to get my house work done
other than that i do not like him glued to the t v all the time
i do not think it is healthy all the time either
my kids like to go play with their friends
i guess i do not mind too much when they do watch a little bit
there are shows that i really put my foot down on
we made the mis-
that is one of the worst
i do not let him watch it anymore because especially where they kill somebody it is just not good
it is just real violent
it is like they show bloody
things
they show it in slow motion
and everything like that
before in a western or something in the olden days
they were gone
it was
not like today
today it is really graphic
that is a fun show
it is cute
i really like that one
they have got the he man
i think
it sounds like we have the same tapes for our kids anyway
language and violence and sexual
i get kind of saying i am sorry kids this is
i think it is important that i see what they are watching
they do have those parental control things on the remote controls where you can block out what channels you do not want them to watch
i do not know because i do not have that
my father-in-law and them have that
they do not have any kids
they was told how to use that
still when the kids get older they learn how to break through that parental control
do they
it is i am hoping that he will grow up not really caring much for those movies because now we have got a lot of western tapes
i think that is a good show too
like the man from snowy river we have
he also likes star trek
star trek is good movies good shows
the series
i think not even the old one but the new one too
my little girl has mister spock's ears
that is not a problem anyway
it is fun
now i like everything mi-
not michael douglas
the man right now who has done bonanza and then he did little house on the prairie
michael landon
now there
i loved little house on the prairie especially when melissa gilbert grew up
it is
i liked that show because it portrayed i thought really well pioneer kind of days
that is about the only show i have seen where every time they sit down at the table they pray before they eat
i thought that was real neat
i do not
his parents are there
they have it before one of the church that comes on
it is a just this little dot
he will go out and get himself into trouble and come home
the parents will tell him that there is a verse in the bible that will help him with that
i have not seen that
it is
we will miss every once in a while
i will let kyle watch that
he just
i even like jot
i
let us see
it is twelve or ten down here
i will look and see
this is of the mornings
around nine or ten i think
i think it is before the first baptist in sherman airs
comes on before
we'll look
his name is jot
he has got a friend named cat
i think the dog is the only one that is not a dot
like i say they teach him stuff from the bible
i think it is just a real cute show
i am trying to get my little boy into reading like church books and things
we have got like noah's ark and lord is my shep-
he is getting to where he likes them
we got him a little jesus doll about a year ago
he has always kept that
i really like
that is a
like a song
they're worship through music kind of things
they are up to date
some of them are videos like music videos that go along with the songs about church and jesus
i
it's a christian songs
that sounds fun
i really like that
i turn that on sunday mornings
i do not
my kids do not have an
to
we have not camped in any of those places
we used to go to tyler state park and daingerfield
in texas that is where we camp basically
it has some really wonderful sights that are in the wooded areas
the facilities are quite nice
our children liked it quite well
they are quite a bit younger than
they
it was just a really nice place to camp
daingerfield is
i think that's a little bit further east and maybe south if i am remembering where that is
at any rate it was very nice as well
tyler we sort of got spoiled with i think
we had lived in michigan before we came here and had done a lot of camping in michigan
also we had done some camping in colorado in the mountains
my parents were real avid campers
my husband's parents were really avid campers as well
i guess we just kind of came by it naturally
how many does it sleep comfortably
there supposedly
they
sort of early on especially as our children got a little bit bigger we invested in some stacking cots that were like bunk beds
they were fold up cots
that really gave us a lot more floor space
gave us a place to stack things during the day
that was real nice
we
my in-laws also had a camper or a pop up tent one of those trailer tops
those are really nice too
a little more luxurious so to speak
do they have a kitchen in them
in fact it even had a little refrigerator and the whole business
you did not have to be hauling things out of the trunk of you car
that was nice
do you have plans for any other camping trips in the near future
maybe back to caddo or
purdis creek
i like bob sandlin too
there is not really camping
sometime i like to go to eisenhower up on lake texoma
we drove through it just one time when we were in that area
it's real lovely
it's really quite pretty
are you
do you have a favorite among all those that you have been to
from those three
just from when i have been an adult i like caddo the best
is it true that caddo lake is the only natural lake in the state of texas
i would
i would love to see what it looks like
it's not very deep
they did build a dam on it
it was there before they built the dam
i see
that might be some place where my husband and i can go
our children are both grown
it's just pretty much the two of us who do things
we thought we might take some weekend trips and maybe that would be a good place to go to and see what it looks like
i don't know
spring is probably the busiest time anywhere in texas
especially with
have some happy camping trips
right now we have one dog inside
she's an indoor dog
how long have you had them
the dog is probably about thirteen fourteen years old
the cats they might be as old
that's interesting because we have a simi-
we do have a dog
she is going to be thirteen this summer
is that right
she's a mix of cocker spaniel and poodle
that's what ours is
ours is black
she's been a really good companion for me
she's like a little shadow kind of
she's slowing down considerably
that's to be expected at
she's been a good dog to have
i don't know
everybody always says no more
i think animals are really important in the family
did you get yours as a pet for your chil-
i was wondering if you got your dog originally as a pet for them or just because you'd had dogs before
we had had a dog before
this one we bought by accident
a farmer called us and wanted us to call the dog catcher or somebody to come and get this puppy that
i said gee she sounds like a cute little dog
that's how we got her
that often happens that way
we had intentionally planned to get a dog
we had just moved into this house and decided to wait about a year and then we went out then and found one
she was so cute because
they were all over the place
she was real docile and
i thought
what was funny was that our daughter must have been
she just loved this little dog
i think she loved her too much because the dog has never been real comfortable with her
our son on the other hand who was about eleven at the time was not very interested in pets
as it turned out he and this dog have gotten to be really good pals
for heaven's sake
you just never know how that works out
they say it's real important for children to have pets because
nobody is going to reprimand them or
the nursing homes now they're finding that it's real important to take a pet into a nursing home
i have been reading and seeing about that on television
our one nursing home in has one
he kind of has free run of the place there is somebody takes care of him
he goes out people
real nice dog
it's funny how how pets can kind of take on a certain status in certain areas
that made me think of when our daughter was looking at colleges we visited a campus in saint louis
there were several dogs on the campus
they didn't appear to belong to anyone
i'm sure someone fed them
our guide that day said that one woman many many years ago had given a huge sum of money to the university on the condition that there be dogs just kind of left to roam around the campus
that's kind of great
it kind of made it seem more homey too
th-
it just kind of goes along with what you were saying
about the dog having sort of free run of the nursing home
i
in all our years of marriage
it's been sort of a a change for my husband because as a boy growing up his father had dogs
they were always hunting dogs
they were never allowed in the house
having a pet was a little bit different for him
we've had a lot of different pets
the kids had rabbits for pets
we also raised them for food
we've had a skunk for a pet
my golly
like she
you could never call her and she would come to you
their eyesight they can't see very far either
before we got her everybody said oh they're just like a cat
they're not
they use the litter box
that's really something
how long did you have that
how long
finally my children are the ones who said mom you've put up with that skunk long enough
i don't think she was there a week till the men built her a pen outside
my gosh
i thought i put up with that all those years
this is what it took finally
we've had cats
we had two siamese cats
one of them ran off
he i guess it was a male he ran off twice
the second time he never came back
we would see him several miles from our house
he got huge down there
he never came back
that's interesting
i wouldn't picture a siamese as being an outdoor cat
he wasn't a whole lot
he did go out sometimes
they ma-
the cats
the vet had told us they get strange
their cat was not a friendly cat
it was not a good
it did get strange
that was right
since they've moved to where they let the cat out
it has improved the personality
americans like me
whether i night not
i think that we're paying too much taxes including taxes in general or income tax
the other thing was do we get what we pay for
what is our opinion on that
are you prepared to talk
i guess so
i can just tell you a little bit about taxes in texas
i don't know of any other state does not have a state income tax right
we don't have a state income tax
we certainly make up for it in other ways here
for instance the local sales tax is eight and a quarter percent
we have a six percent sales tax
you have state income tax also
it's been
people here have this
it's starting to show in a lot of ways as far as things that are just totally under funded
i don't know if texas is ever going to be able to totally avoid having an income tax or not
i think eventually they're going to have to do it do you think you pay too much there
how do you feel about that
really interesting
the taxes
i don't know
we don't have tax on clothes do you
i know new york also has a sales tax on clothes i know a lot of kids going to college with me that lived in new york or out of state a lot of them would buy their clothes in pennsylvania just for the simple sake of not paying that
we don't have tax on groceries for instance
we don't have it necessarily on food
then there's other things that they nail you for it like health and beauty products
i should have delineated
it's the consumable food parts that we don't have to pay tax on
you really have to watch your bill
sometimes i think it's real interesting to look to see how many things that i buy in a grocery store which are not really edible groceries
that's when it really starts to add on
that is sort of a help
i don't know
it's just eight and a quarter just seems like an awfully lot of tax on any sale as far as i'm concerned
it's real interesting this last tax season
the last tax season i had just a part time job helping out in a tax office
the woman that owned the office was saying she'd had this business for probably seventeen or eighteen years
she was saying as the years have gone on there are fewer and fewer things that people can take off of their income tax
if you're not a home owner or if you haven't sold property or have something major like that it's just not much else you can do
she said it's really taken the fun out of doing taxes for people for her because she used to be real creative about helping them find ways of
accumulating receipts
really can't do it any more
i also was a student
i just graduated in may i graduated with a finance degree
that was the big joke the accountants or the people who found ways to cheat on your income tax
how interesting gosh
you are the same age as my daughter because she just graduated from college this year too
nevertheless i am a student and poor
it's been
i guess as far as people like our family we can feel like sometimes we pay more than our share as middle class americans with college age students
i don't know
i realize that we have graduated tax brackets
i think they should still go back
instead of putting the burden more on the middle class i think the burden should be put more on the wealthy
it seems like they still come out okay
yeah they always have the argument who's to say we don't work harder to get that
the ones that get the most pay do the least work
that the higher they get the
it seems like they must feel like they're paid for all of the years of experience or something or just the title sometimes
it doesn't seem fair
i know a lot of people do make money in good investments and things like that
i think that's a lot of luck and a lot of gambling and not a whole lot of work
i don't like that part of the finance whatsoever
like what i was saying about the social security that's real
it never bothered me until we started talking about it in my classes the more i think about it the more i think i'm paying in to something that i
granted i'm paying for my grandparents i'm never going to see that
what's left is not going to be worth anything in terms of how
i put in much more than that
i haven't heard much in recent years about social security
for a while there not too long ago they were saying that the whole system was going to be bankrupt before very long because so much was going out for programs that originally it was never intended to be used for
or you know programs just weren't in existence i
if you have talked about that in your classes in the last few years i'm sure that you have heard
i don't know
i guess
you got to look to what they put you have decent roads at least
you have to appreciate what you do get for them sometimes i guess it's worse
i'd rather be able to control my money as much as i do with what's left over taxes than to live in england or some countries where so much of it is socialized that you don't see any of that money at all i guess it's all relative
instead of thinking how much that i'm paying out i like to just look at it and say everyone else is doing it too
i live in the dallas texas area where there's a lot of pollution
i'm up in wisconsin my name is terry in the small town we don't
we're not that far from the city where there's tons of pollution
oh
before moving to wisconsin lived across from where they were gravel pits and also where they were making tar
we occasionally if the wind was blowing the right direction would get the smell of tar
it would
it was like miles away
just the idea of having that come across the way it did in the wind kind of made you know that there was a lot of pollution
that was just one small corporation that was doing the pollution of that
where we also lived too it was very close to a highway
got a lot of fumes from trucks and cars
you would literally see the pollution on your furniture
it was on your tables
it was dirty type of dust
it wasn't the typical dust that you get way out in the country for
i live in a small town now quite a ways from the twin cities about an hour away
i may dust once a week
that's all it needs versus every day when i lived in the city
i'd never thought about that being a cause
it comes right on through the screens
the only way that you could actually live in the city is to close your windows and have an air cleaner system right in your home that would take the air from the outside and clean the air before it would get into the house it was quite a dirty city
if you were well protected by trees which catch a lot of the pollution then you're fine
most of the time in the city you have lots of high rises you have lots of other things that are not catching the pollution
it's just going for miles and miles and miles
it's landing somewhere with the wind
i live in a suburb that doesn't have much vegetation trees it was all cotton fields
we don't have that advantage
ours i think is primarily cars where we don't carpool like we should an airport
i'm nineteen floors up i look out toward d f w international
there's just an awful brown haze all the time i can imagine it's even worse for people living over near the airport
our air quality in the twin cities is a lot better than what we've heard about california and maybe in the other areas
they were always talking about the air quality of today is this the ozone or whatever
it's kind of scary because the air is something we take for granted many people are too busy getting to work not thinking about okay i could have carpooled with a friend
even my husband was talking to some of the guys at work
he's fifteen miles away from work
he was talking wouldn't it be nice to carpool
the guy says it's too close
it wouldn't pay
exactly my husband says that's fine
it would save quite a bit on the wear and tear on cars and the gas
if they do they drive with one little buddy
at least it's with one person most of the time people are saying forget it
it's too much involvement yet
we're paying for it
i think of my daughter
i'm sure you think of your children
you kind of say to yourself what kind of future will they have when they think back and say my parents did have the choice to kind of make a difference maybe people are trying
they have to change attitudes
it seems to me that it's already so evident with our children having a lot more respiratory infections than we had growing up you can really see it
i had a chance to go to bolivia a couple years ago
of course there's no industry very little trash
they don't even have that much that they burn because they consume everything down to the thread
it amazed me
i just had totally forgotten how
i sell family products
i don't really dress up a whole lot
i work
i do contract work
i work with another c p a who just started his own practice i work with him a couple days a week when i go to his office or to other clients' offices then i'll dress up otherwise it's great being at home in jeans or shorts or whatever
that makes it pretty nice
it's kind of weird because before i used to work full time
it seemed like i was wearing a suit every day just about
you'd have to dress differently when you're working every day i think
it's
it's very nice
my dress up
what i wear depends on the weather
i know a lot of the avon representatives are portrayed as being very dressed up
i try to dress nice but for convenience because when the weather's bad when i go into the home i take off my shoes
i don't too often take off my coat even
i really don't have to dress up like you would like if you're in an office or something
i imagine that where you live you're in warm clothing quite a bit of the year
not actually because we really only have maybe three four months of i'd say warm weather
is that right
the rest gets into the cooler weather
i don't know
you all are waiting for that
for now we have a lot of ice and snow in the wintertime and cold weather
my daughter works all the time
she dresses
i think you have to spend more money on your clothing and that because you do have to have a good appearance to do a good job where you work
down here it's sunny most of the time
and usually warm
we had a few cool days this month
not anything i'm sure compared to what you've had so far
people are still wearing shorts
usually around halloween it starts getting cooler
you start breaking out a coat at that time
that lasts for a few months
did you find you wore slacks when you were working full time
did they wear more dresses and skirts
i think it was one of those things where it's not like someone came out and said you can't wear them
it was one of those understood things that you just wore a dress
not even a dressy slack suit even if it's all
not with what i did
sometimes the secretaries might even then you didn't see them wearing slacks too much
i really
i wouldn't have minded wearing those especially when it gets pretty cold
i didn't know if the trend changes if
i think it's one of those things where it's not viewed upon as being professional
look more like a woman
it's the men that make the rules
then you know why they make them then
we usually
skirt and blouse or suit or dress is what you see down here
it's nice with me working at home because i can wear pants
no one can see me unless i'm g-
yet you need to keep up an appearance for your husband too though at home
because that's i believe
i'm not going to put a skirt on just for him
you don't think you will
you'll be excused because considering everything
i look at homemaking as a job also
being a homemaker
i think sometimes we lose sight
by the fact that we don't sometimes watch our dress
what do you do there in lubbock as far as recycling is concerned
you know they actually started
i assumed it was t i wide
they started putting out at least recycling bins for the paper i've
computer paper different types of paper
i guess i need to put it on paper and turn it in
what would be more efficient about it
they have boxes located at certain areas throughout a module or down the hall
a lot of people aren't going to get up walk out of their offices and go there
where i use to work we had what we called tree boxes
they were recycled cardboard
you set it by your desk and as you got rid of a piece of paper you stuck it in there
when it filled up you called facilities whoever to come pick it up
they brought you another box
not only is it
i think more people would take advantage of it and use it
i think you save a lot of the cleaning service's time and effort and money that we are paying for them to empty the trash cans and combine it and bundle it and things like that now when it could all be done in one step kind of type thing
i was going to say cause i know i have right here a trash can for trash and a trash can for for paper on it
if i printed up something that i don't need it just chunk it in the paper
somebody still has to collect all that and bundle it together
whereas if you had a box that pretty soon it got full you close the box it's already bundled it's already done for you
you're saving a lot of time and effort
what else do they do in the dallas area
as far as t i is concerned i'm not sure
i have heard in residential situations
i have heard in residential situations like in plano that they are doing stuff like having recycle picked up where i guess the sanitation department as part of their responsibility picks up the recycled items as well the plastics and the paper
the only responsibility of the patron is to separate them
the
i guess the department takes them and does what they do with them
it doesn't cost the patron anything
doesn't really cost the department
they don't pay for the recycled items
i've been wanting to put like two of three bins right out my garage door where from the kitchen you know you can throw cans in one or the glass in the other
the even
that's kind of what i want to set up because we do go through aluminum cans
what kind of services do you have there in lubbock as far as
where can you take your recycle items
i lived in abilene for a
it was so hard to
if you you wanted to recycle you newspapers it was impossible
we can take oil like car oil recycled oil to
they have dump areas at the fire departments throughout town
i don't know that they yet have the facilities here to do the tin cans
i think they can do the plastics like the liter bottles things like that
i don't know
that's good
of the waste
i like to see
you drive through burger king now and the bags are recycled paper i feel like people are more aware of it or becoming more aware of it
maybe it's making an impact
do you tend to buy more recycled items if the pack says recycled and something else doesn't
i'm not as good about searching something out like that if i am there and the choice is there i would probably take the recycled product
that's just where i probably need to be a little more responsible citizen wise looking or searching those out because you figure if we as the citizens do that then the manufactures and producers will start packaging it that way
they are getting away from the styrofoam
discussing air pollution today i guess
give me your first impressions
i don't know
i think industries and companies provide a lot of it i guess with the oil burning over in kuwait and stuff that would have a lot of air pollution in it
puts a whole
that stuff going on over there
what part of pennsylvania are you in
i'm north of pittsburgh
it's amazing too with the oil wells burning over there that's the exact same stuff that's coming out of cars every day just in a little different grade i guess
in dallas we've just brought in a whole new set of requirements on inspections and things like that for cars because people just don't use mass transit and stuff in dallas
you see an awful lot of one person vehicles on the road during rush hours
there's a lot of industry around
it's
we have a steel mill and a couple refineries and stuff
i know there's a lot of air pollution going in there
they get fined whenever they do the air pollution the fine is nothing
like two hours of output or something like that
i grew up in south dakota
None
there were always e p a people what not were always telling us that farm chemicals and what not were destroying our water system and all that we just never saw the results
there was dust in the air during planting seasons and what not
that was all we ever saw
five years ago i moved to dallas
i suddenly started to understand what burning eyes and all that stuff is about that i'd always heard about
it's real depressing
in the morning sometime you can tell if it's a good day or a bad day by how far out from downtown you can be on the road and still not see it
my god
it's not
i don't think dallas is considered a real bad place for air pollution
you can tell the differences in the days when the haze is kind of yellowish gray instead of just being a foggy misty color it's a little disappointing sometimes you start to realize what you're breathing
i don't know what they can do to really prevent it
what
they fine the industries
that doesn't seem to stop them there i don't know what else they can do
it's that there really isn't a whole lot
None
i also believe that the earth is a kind of a self-regulating system
it will clean itself up eventually
the whole idea is not to push the limit too hard i guess let the natural systems take care of the problem as much as possible
i just don't understand what else anyone can do about it
it should probably be a big issue because it's doing a lot of damage
it's something
it's one of those things
it's so hard to measure what the damage is it's kind of like
i guess it's kind of like cigarette smoking
it could go on for years and years until they start to see some results and people can actually say yeah it's doing some damage and something's got to be done
there's a lot of things like that
you can pound on something for a long time before it finally breaks
until it breaks you don't really know that you were doing anything to it
i really don't know
that's
i think we both agree it's one of those deals that
i just think there's a lot of other problems right now we've done a lot to take care of it
i know where a couple of the mills that have
i know they put things on their stacks to filter the smoke and do all kinds of things
every now and then it breaks
you just have smoke going out into the air for a day or two until you can get it fixed
it's something we have tried to help
there's no doubt about it
i don't know if you ever happened to see some of the twenty twenty and what not about rumania and east germany when they first got pictures out of there about how some of their systems had been running for twenty and thirty years they had absolutely no regulations no controls whatsoever
they had destroyed entire forests and what not just because the air was so polluted
that's the kind of things that you don't see in this country
that's why i think that it's
i think it's all relative to the time and place
i think right now it's pretty much under control
you bet
amy it's been kind of overcast today and cloudy
i was really worried about it raining because there's been some dark clouds
None
you can't put it on if it's suppose to rain within forty-eight hours
i keep hearing the forecast it's going to rain it's going to rain it's going to rain
it really hasn't rained
several times in the last couple of weeks it has looked rainy that day and not done anything
we have a lot of trees in our yard
i probably
if it's an overcast day then the weather is pretty blah
i have two preschoolers a three year old and a two year old
if it's not nice and they can't go out it's really the pits
i bet
i appreciate it
that makes a big difference i
i'm working on a carnival that's going to be in a couple of weeks for our school
i'm thinking that this has been
it's been kind of scary
it's kind of been cloudy every day
i thought i'm just not anxious to have worry about the weather
my three and half year old he really wants
all winter long
i'm hoping that
it just seems like the weather around here goes so quickly from being winter to muggy and hot
it's just you never really have like nice cool sixty-five or seventy degree weather with sunshine
i miss the seasons that we used to get up there that you just don't have down here
i know in
we always had pretty nice four seasons
ex-
i like that
we moved here from houston in july
everyone kept saying you're going up north it's not going to be so hot
really yeah
it was extremely hot
the air conditioning was broke
the stress and the record heat
i was worried about every time we came to an intersection
i know my husband doesn't have air conditioning in his car and when he comes home from work during the summer he feels like he's burning like he's been baking for an hour
i know
i understand that this is kind of typical for this time of year that rainy season
i hate having to water so much around here
we never used to have to water our lawns in chicago it was always enough rain here and there here if you don't water it just looks awful
i just hate to spend the money just going down the drain and watering grass
that is awful it takes time
the kids they
they want to go out and run in it and get all muddy
you're going do i want a green lawn or a muddy feet
that adds to it traipse in and out with whatever the weather is like out there
i don't know
the nice thing i'm looking forward to is not having a hurricane season
we always had big concern about hurricanes
they're close enough to the coast
you had to have a supply like emergency supply on hand all the time during the hurricane season
it was pretty spooky
because you always have to think what's the weather doing
do we have enough
every time i store batteries i wind up going to use them and they're dead
now this is a little bit of relief although they still have warnings all the time around here for tornado season hurricanes and stuff
i don't really like tornadoes either
at least there isn't
i feel like i got rid of something
i've been worried about mostly with having
i have to keep the sun screen on them just constantly when they go outside because they say it's just so dangerous for little ones to get a bad sunburn
it is
i can't believe the record temperatures that were here last summer that
it was just unbelievably hot
i can't stand to be outside at all when it's like that
i just don't even want to go out of the house to get the mail even
we had our air conditioning break
we had to call somebody out to fix it because i couldn't take it more than a few hours without it on
i know
that would
None
it is
i hate having to leave the house closed up all the time
get some fresh air in the house
it feels good
i guess
have you been here during the real heavy heavy rains
i can't remember what time of year
no i remember
that sounds awful
i have seen those
it's has it like from one foot to four foot
i thought i would never buy a house with a flood gauge down the street
talk about asking for trouble
i've got some kids out on the trampoline i need to go look and see what they're doing
have a good day
you too
what is your latest experience with painting
my father would be painting and i'd ask him if i could
we didn't have to do any painting
the condominium we moved in before my husband went over and painted
the experience that i've had is that
he said it's going to be just about four hours
he said all i got done was the taping around
it looks so easy just slapping paint on
i had an addition put on
because i put these beautiful french doors in i decided okay i'll just have them paint this little room a little ten by ten dining area
he said i'll be done this afternoon pretty soon before you know it he's run into so many problems
it's just
it just took him so much longer
he was there to paint the french doors also
if you've ever painted french doors which my husband just finally said he wasn't going to do
then just
we got this painter
i just called him because i got a little ad out of the adcose or whatever in the mail and just got this painter person over here
he said yeah i can finish it in a day
i know
i go what makes you a professional
he just kept painting on those french doors
each little
he had to redo them like three times
it's just been painting yeah
hire a professional
that doesn't guarantee anything
it really
it was like
one had more blue to it
that can make a difference
they bring the little samples you've got like maybe five hundred
that's an exaggeration
there are just so many tints upon tints upon tints
you don't know what you to want to
by the time it's on i
selected what i thought was white
it was like you said it was blue cast to it
it looked awful on
that was the next problem
it was a major project getting the money together
we worked something out because he was kind of apologetic that it took so long
i don't recall my parents having that much trouble
they painted our rooms all the time
we just had brick on as accent on a certain area of our home
he had to paint the outside all the time
to us
we're going we're so glad we have a brick home all we have is like trim around the windows or something
we haven't gotten to the point where we're
you just get in there and do it yourself
we've done that the whole time we were in school like
so i want to get to the point where i could feel like i could just hire someone
it's not that easy
it's like it's
i don't even know if i would not even recommend this person again to anybody
i don't know if you get into the mind set where you just say i'll accept something or you just really have to get on their back
about things and working with what they say are professional painters
i tell you what the fumes that the paint gives off makes you wonder what these people do any-
the fumes are amazing
i don't think i could stay sane
working with all that
i know it's not lead based any more paints
they have to live with that every day in their clothes and everything
it does
that was not something that we had to pay for
they sent their painters in to repaint a corner of the ceiling and then repaint the whole ceiling
i think it's because they were accustomed to working in that
i couldn't imagine that they came in and painted it the whole ceiling just within a couple of hours
maybe there are some professionals out there
it does
for all that
i hope you have a nice day today
you take care
i guess it's getting to be lunch time
a lot of women are as knowledge about football as i am
i can understand that
i kind of like the cowboys too
i always enjoy watching dallas and pittsburgh together
it's probably closer to fort worth
it's in the same area
he bought a big horse farm out in a little town called roanoke texas
he pops up on the dallas scene quite often
he's such a motivator
primarily with the quarterbacks
i wished they could work something
what about the houston oilers
houston has had some wonderful talent down through the years
in the earlier years they really had some super teams
warren moon
is proving himself quite well right now
he's one of the few black quarterbacks that there are
he's no longer with the team
i hope they do better
i think they're still such a young team i think they still have a little bit to go before they reach the potential
if they even reach that potential again they may never reach that again
that's a tough
i don't know
basically everyone that was on the team then is gone now
then he just left
of course they had so many nice choices because their record was so lousy the last few years
quite a few of the
the guys they pick may never play a game
you never know
it's a gamble
they may get hurt or not be able to participate at that level if
who would you say is your favorite player or has ever been your favorite player
as far as dedication
of course there have been some other great ones too dick butkis and bradshaw
if i had to pick one i would probably pick sam huff as a matter of fact
that's really funny
i come from a large family
there's quite a few boys
that's kind of how i got in with the football
watch that watch nothing
at one time i could name all the players on the steelers
even when bradshaw was playing i don't know i didn't particularly care for him
of course a quarterback has a big ego
they have to have
they always think they can win which is the way it should be
they were good
i you couldn't deny that
i just didn't really care for either one of them
and stallworth and swan
i like watching on saturday afternoons when they'll have the best plays from the week or something
then i like watching their bloopers too
some of them a bit embarrassing
they make mistakes too i guess
especially i would say the receivers
it must just take a hundred percent concentration i guess because they know they're going to get hit
it's just a matter of how hard or where
what did you think of a couple years ago for the bears the refrigerator
knowing what
of course mike ditka was in dallas for years and years as coach knowing of his temperament i'm just surprised he ever kept the guy around
he's about a half hot head anyway such a temper
to me he's just so big and fat
i don't know
the guy is probably physically strong
i
i guess it's just like you say a mass that nobody can seem to get out of the way
as far as him scoring touch downs i think that was kind of weird
dallas has a guy his name is nate newton
he has a real weight problem too
he manages to still keep playing
they weigh him several times a year just to make sure he's not completely out of control
i guess most every team has someone like that
there are some really big guys playing in football
i guess you have to stay in the game i guess
who
other than dallas would you say that you have a favorite quarterback
the quarterback's seem to get most of the attention
i would have to say someone like montana i guess who's done so well for so many years
i enjoy watching him play
he's still performing
like you say warren moon's an excellent
he's very exciting to watch
i enjoy watching him also
what about marino
i never was a big fan
because he was the youngest quarterback there was wasn't he
he's a very young fellow
of course a quarterback can look so good if he's got a good supporting cast
i don't know
i just think marino will get better
his team's not as good as what it was when he went to the super bowl
they all do i guess
it's cyclical i guess
with age comes
yes very much so
that forces a lot of the guys to get out of the game
they're so young
they're retired
their so young still
i read not too long ago that the average professional career only lasts seven years
when you think about it that's really not a very long time of course
then you think about how many have been in there longer than that
if the average is seven years that means a lot of guys don't make it seven years
a lot of them would have to get out in just a couple
holy smokes
that's a pretty short career on average
of course they play their cards right and do some good investments
a lot of them don't unfortunately
what do you think of the l a raiders
used to the oakland
they're always branded as a bunch of outlaws
if their arrest record won't let them play anywhere else they seem to go to the raiders
that just may be perceived
perception
al davis he's a kind of strange character strange looking guy
they keeping talk about going
i'm not exactly sure
i wasn't really paying attention as to what particular parts of capital punishment we're supposed to talk about
it was basically what's your views on whether you thought there was certain cases that should be used that sort of thing
i don't know
i've always thought that any crime that intentionally where someone goes out and premeditatively takes another life would be the ones where i think that capital punishment would be necessary to keep that person from perhaps doing it again and even more so to get people on the outside who are professionals to realize that there's a very steep penalty to be paid when that's done
yeah
i believe in it too
we're not supposed to
i feel that it
on the premeditated murders i feel if it's beyond a doubt that you did it i would say go ahead and execute that person as well
it's the cases like sometimes you you hear of people that they say they went to jail falsely
you got that point well what if a mistake is made and you put someone to death that really didn't do it
i would say that for that many people to all of them agree that you did it and it was premeditated it would be kind of hard for
if the evidence wasn't overwhelming right
i
i think that should be likewise decided by the jury because i don't know i think a jury would be less likely to just send a man to death just for any reason
i'm not sure about pennsylvania whether we have it or not
it's not very often
i think maybe last year was the first time in like eighteen years or something like that that anyone from pennsylvania had gotten it
florida and louisiana i think and some of the
course they have such a crime problem because they have such a unemployment rate
None
then people tend towards crime
None
it's funny that
i said i think last year was the first time in like eighteen years for pennsylvania
for some reason i think that it was something like that
it surprised
even florida i know they have it
you don't really hear about it real often how many people
in florida seems like two or three times a year
you think that
if you think of how many premeditated murders are committed
compared to that and to how many people are being sent that doesn't seem like very many
course they have a requirement that every single appeal must be permitted
of course the attorneys
even if the case is open and closed
they go all the way up to the supreme court
they have to have every single appeal made open to them
it's sort of strange because
some of these guys are really violent son of sam killers and stuff like that
they
they get out
everyone knows they're not going to get out
they do it again
i don't
if it's beyond a doubt that someone did premeditate a murder then i think that someone should take their life also
would you draw the line there with just the premeditated murder
a lot of the other violent crimes i don't really feel that strongly about
although stiffer sentences and lessening the effects of parole
these guys are certainly not going to be
they're getting into drugs and fights and all that stuff in prison
i think that's its only purpose is to reduce the violence in the prisons so people behave themselves a little bit better if they think they're going to get off earlier
some of these guys just don't care
None
that's possible i guess
i don't know
where do you live in pennsylvania
i live in butler
i'm at college
because
that's sort of interesting to get opinions as to where different parts of the country are because the more grass root parts of the country tend to support capital punishment where the places that are less in contact with crime the more urban less
i'm in kind
that would be pushing it
this is definitely a college town
we're about two hours north of pittsburgh if that would help you out any
i've never heard of polk
it's an old university that turned into a place for the mentally retarded
i never heard of that
very old historical place there
i
most of the kids here i
just from dorm mates and stuff they'll say that they don't believe in it
then after i would say my point of view then they'll say yeah
da-
in that case maybe
i think people can be persuaded one way or another
i've never seriously ran into someone other than my priest who definitely says you can't take anyone's life
anyone that is so against it that you couldn't persuade them in any instance
it
you get certain circumstances where you hear about these people that have stolen kids and
done terrible things to them and killed them and that sort of thing
i don't want that person sharing the earth with me
that is just terrible
we had a case like that here
on the other hand people are saying that because the criminals know that the penalties can be very severe
there's less criminals that are turning themselves in or pleading whatever because they know that the judge if they find them guilty has the opportunity to sentence them for the death sentence
i look at that and say they should have thought about that beforehand
i'm just saying that that's what the client lawyers are saying
they're saying that more of my clients would have pleaded guilty if they would have gotten a light sentence instead of possibly having to get a death sentence because you can't plea bargain what the sentence is going to be
you can plea bargain what you're guilty of
that's something
i don't think that they deserve anything less
i don't know
we have to go through a trial then to prove the person's guilty
that costs money yeah
perhaps we can
perhaps we can't
the guy might get off
there's always a few of those people that lost their head or whatever
yeah
the guy like i said he just said that he took her
he won't admit that she died or whatever
he won't say where the body is because he knows the penalty's mandatory life sentences for murder
i read everything i guess
i like all kinds
in fact i was just reading a magazine now an automobile magazine
i like historical books time magazine newspaper how to do it type things
the novels yeah
i am not into soaps and all that stuff
i am not into novels at all really other than historical things
i am kind of a chore person
i am a fix it person
i would read all those kinds of things
figures what like those magazines you get through the mail
i read the engineering magazines
i am reading historical book now about russia during the czar's time and what it was like and everything
what about like those time books that they put out about ancient discoveries
th-
how they found out that ancient man performed brain surgery successfully
stuff like that
you mean the ancient astronauts things
i did not
some of that
is very interesting without question
i do not really know that they have the answers in those books
they make conclusions in them that may or may not be true
they are very interesting
that they have
i am a superficial buff
i like it if it is fun
i am kind of a hobbyist
i read all those things that
being an engineer all those books that would bore everybody else how to do things
when she ever there is something i say have you read the directions
i say engineers we are the few people in the world that read the directions yeah
we have got a book that says how do they do that
it answers everything
not everything
a lot of silly little questions
those are interesting
you like science things
i have not gotten them in a long time
what is that one that is on t v
that book national geographic is really a fascinating book
if you ever get those
that do not
i have not gotten them in years
they were kind of expensive
they have wonderful photographs and just amazing photographs that they have done
she would have to come home at night cut out different
she would have to cut out different colors
that is the best book to go through those national geographic
they
they are great
the photographers just got fantastic pictures in those things
i do like national geographic and stuff because like i said i like reading about i don't know animals
the sloth it fascinates me
it is just weird
i have not
was it any
we can talk about anything we want
i glance at all newspapers
i do like
since the re- since the economy is doing so bad i never have read the financial pages more often than now and trying to analyze and look for some good news in in there
for me there is no imme-
wh-
like i said i do not keep up on all that
i have only been more interested because of things are doing so bad and everything
i thought see if there is anything in there that would be positive
you always look for things with this terrible recession that we are in
it is
hopefully we will recover here
i know i heard bush say that we are bottoming out seem to be
that is bush saying that
he
i do not really know if any one person knows
what some of the problems are
there are some interesting things in the paper
i like ann landers
mainly i am a front page person
with the so much
with a family and everything there is just so much going on that i am more of a r-
it is easier to do when i do some chores
i know at t i they have most of the stuff on the printout don't they on the computer where you can read the daily news
every time i come in i will punch up
they call it t news and all that
i do get
even the last page is sport listings and different things and world news
None
you can read it in one minute
it is interesting with the computer to read the computer news and
i guess that is a source of reading
i hadn't thought about that in that respect
it just encouraged me to read it
it does have a good simple
again you can read it in a lot less than ten minutes
you can page through it in
i skip over some of that
it is
that is me with the newspaper
i read it so less
i watch so little t v i did not even know what the deal was with this
he is tycoon or something
yeah
i still do not know what the whole deal was with that
i guess because he was so rich
when you are that rich you always get into the paper whatever if you have a family problem whatever
he had a young girlfriend
he is well into his forties
i guess he got a young girlfriend who
every time you take
you are that rich you just get in the news immediately
which is tough
his business is going down the tubes so bad
he was essentially like you said a tycoon
donald trump had it all
he is now essentially bankrupt
h-
who knows
he was kind of an arrogant guy
i think the newsmen enjoyed writing about him on his way down
his wife seemed to be very smart and actually running some of his business
she was actually somewhat of a business partner of his did very well
ivana trump
they have been on all the news and everything in the papers and on barbara walters and everything else
i have got three kids
it is hard to watch t v
i know what you mean really
i have enjoyed talking to you
hang in there
good luck with those kids
have a good holiday
basically my husband and myself use the credit cards in regards to major purchases
other than that it's not something that we use a lot of
we may have only two or three versus i know a lot of people have up to a half a dozen or up to a dozen credit cards
ours are just major credit cards that we have and use only
is that like visa and mastercard
sears is pretty major with us simply because we do
they're real good with their appliance and stuff like that
we try to avoid them with a passion because of the percent of interest rate
if it's any large purchases you've got to kind of think about how much you're going to put down as far as payments on it so that you're not getting eighteen percent or twenty percent interest taken off
my husband and i do basically the same thing
we end up sneaking a few in there that surprise us
we do it mainly for the cash flow
what is that float
i often will keep track of what i've charged and sometimes deduct it from my checkbook already
you know
sometimes just
keep a list and make sure
especially around birthdays
if we go out to a restaurant just to float it
i don't know
my husband has a
if it's a business transaction a lot of times that's important too to keep a better receipt of it
anytime like a plane ticket or
the float for more than a hundred dollars seems real nice for that thirty
we haven't used that one too much
it's kind of fun
you always get these preapproved credit card things coming through
let's send you another credit card
it's preapproved for
you're such a wonderful person
that's to entice you to get more credit cards
we always laugh about that because it's quite a bit
you always constantly getting those preapproved stuff
do you have an annual fee on yours
ours is through a bank yeah
it just a
i can't see paying an annual fee for it
i almost
you're already paying them if you don't pay it off within that month interest anyway
it sounds like i'm being paged otherwise
one thing
i guess both of us are very much aware of the equality
it seems like women are just starting to really get some kind of equality not only in jobs but in the home where husbands are starting to help out a lot more than they ever did
it's not uncommon to see men doing dishes making supper or taking care of the kids
som-
the generation of my parents and my great grandmother they did everything
they took care of the family
i think that's changed just in the last generation
my husband is wonderful
it doesn't bother him at all to do the dishes
it doesn't bother him at all to do the laundry verses men from way back
if you did that you were henpecked or whatever
it's hard enough to be a woman out there trying to do everything and then kind of real light pay
it's kind of a neat thing to see as far as equality in the households
i think that's even going to get better
it will be
it doesn't matter if you want to be a nurse
it doesn't matter if you want to be the president
it doesn't matter if you want to be a lawyer or a doctor
i have always instilled into her
i think mothers are doing a really good job in raising their daughters to say hey you don't have to stay with nursing
as long as you go to school for it and get the education
i feel like to an extent that it is important for women who need to work or are in a position that they want to that they can do that
i also think it is important for them to be with the children
there's a certain part of me
i think there are some things that women just are designed to do better than men
there are some things that men are designed to do better than women
you know that's not
emotionally i think
women do a little bit
i think the gap is coming closer as what i've learned in just being out there
they get together
they talk about issues of marriage talk about manhood talk about what they didn't have with their fathers
it may be in the future that some men may be better parent or mothers than mothers themselves
i know of some mothers that i guess i'd rather be with the father because the father is maybe more understanding more low key more apt to be a better father than some mothers that i have seen that have been raised to develop whatever skills that they have
some of the men are developing very good too
it may come down to where it's individual basis where everybody is treated an as individual
i will go out and take care of the money making
it wouldn't matter if it's a woman or a man saying that
one of the frustrations that i have with the way things have developed is that it's difficult for a family to make a living on one income
you make sacrifices
it's
kind of like what my husband and myself are doing right now
we have a four bedroom split brick home in richardson
we bought it back in about nineteen seventy-three
we've seen it go up in value wise real well
it's probably typical of your neighborhood
it looks like all the others
i'm in plano just north of where you live
we live near coit and legacy in a relatively new development that just has gone in about two years ago
i know where that is yeah
my home is typical
it's a brick home
it's typical of the other homes in our neighborhood too
you're in the styles that they have started building in the last couple years with the real high ceilings
those are lovely
the one thing we did do instead of having a twenty foot living room ceiling
we just couldn't stand the wasted space
we had them
we had them level off our living room and dining room ceiling to nine feet so we could get bedrooms above
that way we sort of have the entryway that looks typical of the area
we don't have so much wasted space
we could get more bedrooms per square foot that way
have you found in talking to your neighbors that your utilities are quite a bit higher with those high ceilings
i would expect so
how many bedrooms do you have in your home
i have a master bedroom and a den on the main floor
upstairs i have three bedrooms
i have
i work in my home
how nice
it's not really a bedroom
it's the size of a three car garage
that's where i work
we just absolutely
it sounds like a real nice one
we're really proud of it
detroit this last time
we love it
i would imagine that you have found that the homes down here are a much better value down here
they're much
that's interesting
up north they just kind of throw them together because we had homes built in detroit also
they just didn't care
if the trim work didn't line up that's just what you get
that's interesting because i've heard so many people down here say that they don't feel like the quality of the homes are that good down here
that's interesting
the carpenter and painter and everybody the marble man were just there in the house everyday when we would come to check on it as it was being built
they'd say just look at this
None
that's good
it really made a difference
i know as i said our house is about seventeen years old
we've been very pleased with it
it is with the two children growing up and now three grandsons roaming through it
we like our neighborhood
has grown
the majority of the people keep up the neighborhood
that's very important
as i said it has risen in value
we bought back when housing was so low
now i- i-
we're still fine
i don't know with the e d s building and penny's and everything going in up on legacy we're hoping that brings in
we're just real close to where that is
right now there's a lot on the market for sale because of people having lost their jobs
that keeps prices down and value down
i'm sure the packs or
we love being where we are
basically i am a mother of a three year old
i kind of relate to trying to find a good day care because it's extremely hard thing to do to trust somebody else with your child trust their emotional and their safety and all the rest of that
i've been pretty selective
what i'm finding is with day cares that are like day care centers like for instance learning tree or kinder care and all of that
like nap time or whatever time because of parents' hours they are differ-
when i bring my daughter into such a system like that they only have one thing going on
that's nap time
whether they came there an hour before or they came right during that time
with that kind of a system my daughter just isn't likely to enjoy it if she has to good there immediately and lay down
home day care has been an option
i've looked into that
the only thing is you raise the question of if it's safe can you trust the people
you never know
i have an ex-sister-in-law that
currently has a child abuse case on a home baby-sitter
i think center day cares there's so many people coming in and out that you're better off if you're going to put a child into that type of system for eight hours it's fine
some children do real well that are at the age of four or five or children that have been in that kind of system for a while
home day care works well if it's an infant
if you want to have kind of a family structuring where there's a home that they can be provided because i've seen things at the day care where they can't keep up with all the kids
they're sick all the time
they're in a state of flux right now changing a great deal primarily because of the economic distress
even in that situation it seems to me from what i've read in the history of russia and different authors there has always been a paranoia
that's why they put a lot of people in prison for years and years
that's why they put a lot of people to death
stalin was a classical example i guess of that paranoia because he probably killed more russians than the russian army killed anybody else
they are desperate at this point in time to keep their country together
i could not foresee them severing what they have with the u s because they need us at this current time because of their financial situation
from what i've been hearing is the u s s r has been almost bankrupt for years it's people are desperate
there might be a revolution within the people
i don't think the u s would get involved with it because there's too close of ties to where i think they understand that gorbachev is trying to make a change and that we cannot run them like we run the u s and that they have to make their own independent decision
i guess i really have no fear at all of the u s s r verses
you get these small little places like iraq and all of that that might be something that i'd be more concerned about with nuclear weapons verses as big country of u s s r
i have no feelings that they would ever start a war with us because to them it would totally destroy their whole country because our technology is far advanced from what theirs is at this current time
sure
to them that would be a suicide
the russian people are not suicidal type of people
if you get the iraqis and iran which will do it for the country for the pleasure of doing whatever for their country they'll do it
i think you're right
the russian people i think are not that much different from us
you know i think
that it would be the leadership that i mistrust
she's on a stool that she can get up on yeah
it was really good talking to you
you have a good weekend
as far as universal health care i guess i'm all for it
i think it's time that we start looking at getting into that
health cost has continued to rise
i think there's people that to me it's the fundamental
it doesn't matter if you have money or all the money in the world
i think if they looked at it as a way of business helping out financially for universal health care and individuals helping out in some sort of way whether it be taxes or some how
the expenses right now for health care are just unreal
they really are even when you're not talking about surgery
we've got four children
in the past month
your constantly
it just can devastate your budget
i know a little bit about the european universal health care
there's some pros and cons
sometimes health care when you get into a universal system lacks in what would be considered
over like in poland where my father-in-law lived for years there their health care system is
no financial gains are available for doctors
they may just go into being a doctor just clearly just to be a doctor for the full reason
most people that go in to being a physician here in the u s do it for financial gain
they say jeez if i get into this area of dermatology i don't have to do this
i can
plastic surgery
if i become a heart specialist i'm going to make this kind of money
there's financial gains toward that
in a universal system i don't think there is a financial gain for the doctors
the quality i think goes down when you have a universal system
the only way they could do that is by having a real good quality check and also offering some kind of
i think anybody likes the ability to kind of get themselves financially situated
i guess that's the whole u s concept is to come here and
i don't know if you can have that with a universal system
maybe there's a way of working that out
i know that in poland in particular the doctors just go to do their job and that's it
there's no
that's sad because if that's the case if doctors aren't going in to be doctors to help people then maybe they shouldn't be in that area anyway
that might be one way of weeding out those that are greedy for the money and those that really want to help mankind
i think we have to head toward that way
we're going to have to do something because there's just too many people in the country that are uninsured you cannot
it's just
you're sixty some or fifty some years old you try to find insurance
i mean you're uninsurable
i know people that are paying two hundred three hundred dollars a month for insurance
how they can do it i have no idea
i know working for small corporations
health insurance myself it would cost for a family
this was back three four years ago to put my entire family up
this was working for like a med center health plan
it was like eighty dollars out of my paycheck
we pay that instead of a car payment
i'm driving a piece of junk
we do the same
it's
i think people are changing their viewpoints of
that's why if they don't go to a universal system something is going to happen
we're going to have a larger amount of people dying
what do you all do for camping
we don't do so much now
when i was a child we went regular old camping tents and everything like that
with our children we had a pop up tent camper
we used that to go camping
years ago we lived in oklahoma
we went to lake murray all the time
when we did it with our children we lived in tennessee
we went up to the smokeys which was just absolutely fantastic
i bet it was
along the
i think it was called white cloud or white mountain
did you all sleep in sleeping bags
did it get real cold at night
the camper had beds in it when we had that one
we had our bedding
that got kind of rough sometimes
we only did that once
since we've been married we go real often to colorado to the mountains
do you
we'll stay in cabins
and call that going camping
we're really not
the one time that i did go camping when i was about i guess sixteen or seventeen with my family
and went back seventeen miles back in the back where you couldn't even get a forest ranger if you tried to the tent for a week
at night it was so cold you thought you'd never feel your
the smell
the stars were just five feet above you
they were just right there
just beautiful
it was the most bonding most wonderful time
about the fourth day i thought if i don't get a hot tub and shave my legs i'm going to die
None
when we can go to a cabin as long as we've got running water i'm a little bit better off
yeah my husband and i he says his idea now of roughing it is the regency hyatt
i agree with him
our children are grown
that's true
i know that we liked it when our kids were teenagers because we got away from the t v and the phone
we got just strictly by ourselves
that's
we could
they can't believe that they could survive it
i know
once they're there they think it's kind of cool
they just thoroughly
enjoyed it
we would hike all day
mom did the whole pork and beans and the slice the potatoes and fry them outside and all the little stuff that we just were so amazed that she knew how to do
couldn't believe
i know that breakfast we'd have these big breakfasts cooked over this little coleman stove
it would just absolutely taste wonderful
daddy would always try to prove he could catch fish for breakfast we usually had a bite apiece
my goodness
i know that as a teenager growing up and going to lake murray there would be maybe twenty twenty-five of us because it would be all of my mother's family and all my cousins
is that hot camping
is that where you're hot like on a beach
is that
a lot of our friends will
we were in the woods
a lot of our friends will go to east texas in the summer and camp
i'm thinking how could you stand it
we didn't notice it back then
that was back before air-conditioning was so prevalent and all
it always rained on us
i like that
especially in the tent every afternoon it would rain you would get your book and just kind of cuddle up
i thought that was fun
i don't know
i remember one time some cousins were in a tent
it was married cousins
they had the tent
this frog strangler that we used to call them
it was kind of like a little little gully or trench or something
the water rushed down
they said they looked down and there went bud's boots
None
there went several things floating down this water
it was more fun
as i said it just rained
my folks had a cabin at one time at lake tenkiller
we went up there
it was never quite the same thing
in fact the more urban we get with the television and the cabin and the whole bit it loses it's flavor
it really does
i've gotten in the mood to go now
i know if i go home and say let's go camping my husband says you're crazy
listen i enjoyed talking with you
that is like my favorite hobby
i have been all over europe and a lot of the united states and hawaii
what has been your favorite trip do you think
i guess hawaii is one of my favorite places
no that is exciting
i have been several times
after the first time it is like anywhere
it loses that newness
mostly i travel through germany and switzerland
we have good friends in england
i have been there quite a bit
i just love it all
how about you
i have been to canada several times
that is about it for me
i am from denver growing up
my family is real into camping and four wheeling
several
i think maybe four summers in a row we spent our vacation time in the summer four wheeling through
every time my mother had
my mother had us do some studying of the area which we going to visit
we had to write reports about it during our vacation which was really fun
we each got to write little books
my fiancee is a very very good photographer
that is what she had originally gone to school to do was photography i am close to receiving my english degree as well as my graduate degree
we have thought very seriously of trying to incorporate travel into and writing a book about some portion of travel
we are hoping maybe within the next ten years to get to take a trip over to europe and take a trip from the northern portion of france down to the southern tip of spain
it is kind of a backward s shape trail that the pilgrims use to take back in the medieval times to see the relics in southern spain and in italy
we would like to take pictures of the gothic and romanesque monasteries and just take that journey all the way down and then right a book about it
it would be it is our big dream
it would be a lot fun
there is good and there is bad
my experience in italy was not my favorite for sure
su-
i flew into milan
my daughter is a twirling champion she had to perform over there in turin
we had to fly into milan
we got on the subway after so much trouble because the italians even if they speak english they do not want to let you know they gave us all the wrong directions there were just two of us
we sat there
we followed these kids with gym bags
we figured that must be the sports arena we lucked out
when we needed to go to the bathroom there was nothing but a whole in the ground
it was kind of a nightmare
i guess all of italy is not like that
where we were it certainly was
the hotel that we stayed in
it was beautiful
it was very far away on a bus
you always have a fun experience
it is great
i wonder have you ever been to a small town
it is actually about thirty minutes from salisbury
it is called bemerton
the reason i am curious i
the other place i would like to visit
i guess you heard our topic for today was clothing
about the same i dress for school
i am a graduate student
although i do a lot of
i do a lot of clinical work
when i do clinic work then i have to look my best
i am in the manufactures rep sales organization
my office is a small office
i am very casual and wear slacks and sports shirt and things like that then when i travel it is a little different situation
suits and sports coat tie and the whole bit
do you find that on the average do people give more credibility or less credibility to professionally dressed individual
i think in today's society there is more credibility to be quite honest i will always remember
my first job years ago thirty years ago twenty-nine years ago in fact was selling agricultural fertilizer
i worked for the smith douglas division of borden chemical
i sold manure
i would go out and call on farmers
i would always try to look my best wearing sport coats and things like that
i was calling on guys that wore bib overalls
one day i got up and thought i will just go casual and you know that i called on a guy wearing exactly that bib overalls
he sort of told me that he expected me to be professional he sort of expected me to dress as a professional it was sort of
i been aware of my dress ever since then and try to look my best
here again i dress casual quite a bit
if i call on just a normal little dealer of mine i might be casual
it depends
you don't
probably no
because today i believe you can get away with
then it depends on who you are calling on
you like your minister standing up in front of you with no tie he would be missing something
its' just different
unfortunately
i am a catholic
the people that go to my church
yet the way i was raised
as a youngster i use to always dress up all the time
i go to the church of christ
sometimes that really disappoints me
people just don't have that
they are afraid to go to church or afraid to go simply because they don't have the clothes to wear
i understand what you are saying there it's a very good point
what's the old saying you shouldn't judge a book by its cover
evaluation of an individual course all of it depends on the type of job responsibility you have
you certainly should not judge a book by its cover and or evaluate a person by that
that's it
what did you do about your last auto repair
might you say what kind of cars you have and so forth
larry my last one unfortunately was an expensive one because i had a brand new lincoln town car
a couple of ladies ran a stop light
they didn't run it
she hit me and did about eleven thousand dollars worth of damage to my car
that's still not enough for a total is it
it wasn't enough to total it
that's been my most expensive repair probably in the last year with the except of just service work because i buy a new car every two years
do you buy one every two years
i travel a lot
this last one i leased
i don't know
i leased it on a twenty-four month program
i'll probably go back to buying them because i don't care to lease them
just are there normal safety belts in it that you had
no sir
didn't go off
the street lights
you were hit in the side weren't you
you may need to be hit leaning towards the forward to activate it
it was
my doors were okay front and back it did right eleven thousand dollars in damage
i'm going to get
i'm relatively fortunate about that
here we somehow don't have many people run into us although at the beginning of each school season students move into town who are from big cities
they sort of drive kind of wild for about two three weeks then they finally settle down and
that takes the strain off of everyone that is driving a vehicle
i find that the most of the repairs i have to do here is body damage due to the salt that we have to put on the road to take care of us in the winter time
i have a sixty-nine cougar and a seventy-seven pontiac so forth
i have to
i drive a honda most of the time
once in a while we have to replace some of the plates in the bottom of it because it's rusted away
we had the same thing up there continuously salting the roads for snow
i had this cougar totally rebuilt to get some of the rusts that were in the fenders done and then it all repainted
i put the cover over it then to keep the ice and snow off
are you going to buy this next car
you going lease it again
i'm going to buy it larry
i'm going to be driving a car for longer
i usually drive a car for three years
last couple of cars i've only driven for two years
i'd leased this one for two years
i'll probably go back and buy one
this next car will probably be my retirement car
that's an awfully big one that one that you had that lincoln
no sir
not really no problem at all
we have two toyotas in the family one nissan
we have the lincoln
no problem there at all as far as finding parking places
it's convenient in that regard
that certainly would be a wonderful comfortable machine to take on long trips i'm very much aware of that
i travel
when i do take it it is very comfortable to drive
it's very quiet and very smooth riding machine
my wife's toyota is soon to be four years old
it doesn't even have thirty thousand miles on it
gosh been in such good shape that'll probably be an eight or ten year car
do you feel that
my personal perception of government and the way things are at this current time is that nobody can really be trusted
i don't feel that too many of the candidates are out there to be self-serving to the community
i think that they have their own wishes to be in the limelight and to kind of say hey i'm a public official i don't have to do certain things
they just stand out more involving themselves more and more with politics
it's really
after all the things that i've seen in the last ten years about government and now the overdrafts of checks before that it was the wonderful escapade that they had with the new god chief of
supreme court
i'm trying to think of his name and what they put him through in regards to
the sexual harassment that kind of thing and just to see our government react to that and then just little things that have added up where people have taken vacations on taxpayers' monies and things like that
i just think it's very corrupt and
it's always the rich person that gets into government that has the money to advertise the money to do this
there's no more abraham lincolns out there that can get into government even if they were poor
i know that's my personal viewpoint of things
doesn't wisconsin have a state medicare program or health program
they've already put through the health bill
it was passed
that is going to be a heavier tax burden on
i don't know if that was done out of just let's be the first state to do it or if it was done really for the needs of the people
right now every little state around here is thinking about we need to reform the health system
of course they think minnesota our neighbor passed a state law the health bill
it's kind of like we're the first to do it
i don't know if it's done because we want to be standing out as being innovative in the health system or whether it was done for a real good purpose to help people that can't afford health insurance that kind of thing
i think one of the biggest problems that we see in government today is a reflection of society in and of itself
that is we become so debt ridden and credit oriented instead of cash and carry or debt free therefore that puts a lot of undue pressure on municipalities state and federal governments
it sure does
i think it is reflecting
like you said i think society as a whole you can't expect
when we have t v and we have things that are kind of bombarded at us for immorality and this and this and this that we can expect somebody to come off that's going to be totally clean
down the line it does hurt
when somebody's corrupt and somebody's doing something it does hurt each individual of the society when you find out that somebody's done something or the overdraft policy or the other things that have occurred
what is
the thing is when a lot of things become acceptable practice it's hard to discern what has become muddy as to what is ethical and what is not ethical
someone blows the whistle and says this is not ethical and yes i did it too
that's exactly what happens in government
i hear that you're doing this
boy
exactly it's
there's no secrets in the government i don't think anymore
the mayor of dallas is steve bartlett
he also was a congressman
to congress
he had been in that position for years
he was elected mayor of dallas overwhelmingly
however if the vote was taken today the whole thing might change because he was part of that check kiting scam
None
i just got back from taking my little girl to her brownie meeting
we had a bag filled full of cans they've been recycling at their school
she wanted me to just wait and let her dump them off tomorrow
they were filled with beer cans
i hated to take a big old sack like a lawn bag full of them
they had tickets at their school that they recycle newspapers cans
i think that's all
they're taking the money that they earn
that's a good idea
they've got their bins that stay there
they've decorated real cute with a bunch of big old flowers and stuff
they're getting into it
that's good
i know
i live in a dorm
we recycle paper
i know that there's a glass plant up here
they recycle glass
we recycle old aluminum cans and all that kind of stuff
in each of the dorms you have a place for that
when our dorm
we get money for that
who decides what you do with it
we just keep it with the dorm
what do they do with it
we buy things for the dorm whatever the dorm needs
we have access to a microwave and an oven if we want to cook things
we buy like cooking equipment and stuff
we play games like board games
it's just different things whatever
whatever the dorm would want that's what we buy
i graduated from college in nineteen seventy-two
we were just not aware that this was a problem that we ever would need to recycle
a little different
i wanted to do this thing that you can get through target to recycle
my principal said since we're doing this thing called operation desert shield we're sending letters to all these servicemen and making video tapes and all that
the whole school
i could do it in the center
i just never got around to it
it's like a club
he had started this save the environment club
his mother is carrying this on
you can get the information to set it up and join
that'd be go-
you could start your own anyway
i don't really know any other recycling that they do
you're not having it picked up at your houses or anything
they're doing that here too now that i think about it
you have to pull out all the slicks
you have to wrap them up with string
i think that's all they're picking up
in minnesota they've got their bins where you put plastics and your bottles
i didn't know that
my brother-in-law lives in minnesota
they're are just nice plastic bins
you fill them up and put them out with your other trash
they pick them up
i never heard of that
not that i know of
you just feed your cans slowly into the slot
your money comes out every once in a while for however much poundage you've got
if you keep feeding it until the light goes off
my gosh
you get instant cash
they had one that i was putting my stuff in
i went to take some today
it was gone
i located another one today on the way to work
we have places where we go
what we do is we unload our cans
the belt separates the aluminum ones from the steel ones because it has a magnet on it
they weigh your aluminum cans
you get money for your aluminum cans
they don't give you for the other
now they're going to start giving us money for the other ones too
i know they're going
they're certain places where down there you can take your leaded cans
i don't know where they are
that's all i really know about recycling
i know we're saving our grocery bags now
kroger's doing it
i think skaggs
i've never seen any places that do
i know we reuse our grocery bags now
we take them back and use the ones that we have
we don't have any place that collects the grocery bags
i don't want to go with those canvas bags right now i'm sorry
they do that like
they go all the time
they had their little bags way back then and fill it up
they had this little bitty old teeny refrigerators
what are you going to do when you get out of college
that's why i did what i did
they had until the fifteenth of april to come up some formula that would be more equitable to different districts according to finances because the poor districts were getting less money so not as good an education
now they're trying to take some money away from the richer districts like the one that i'm in in dallas and make us pay our money to the smaller ones and make it more equitable
if they can't come up with something by the fifteenth then the state's supposed to decide the courts
something's got to be done
i don't know
other than that can you think of anything else we need to talk about
i can't think of anything on recycling
what about people from pennsylvania
i don't
probably a lot more civilized more refined than a lot of the people would be down here
you've been together a little bit longer than we have
i've never been there
i've never
let's see
she's into this
is it like a foreign exchange type student
up in t i out there
i got to
kind of neither
i'm a democrat
i was going to say if you're a republican boy we would really have a good time
i am division one
to answer that one before we get to our subject i always get a kick out of republicans who take credit for all the military hardware that was bought for the war and how successful it was though when it comes to the budget they say well the democrats control all the money
they're the ones wasting all the money
i always wondered how they can play the money either way they want
the subject go ahead
i think it's a stinking shame
i don't think it's over
i think that so many other things have taken over in the media
i think it was just plain greed
i think it was deregulation really when they said do anything you want banks
go ahead loan your money out
i believe more of it was just greed
he was a small businessman
he said that the banks were calling
the banks were calling and just looking for people to give their money away
yeah
there should be thousands of people in jail as far as i'm concerned
we've watched and watched t v and seen that a lot of these people were doing things not just playing in the gray and not just reselling property at a profit but financing the same property three and four times
the list goes on and on
i agree a hundred percent
of just the crimes committed
that was property
they lost a lot of money there
some of these big these rich people started to
he lost all of his money before he died
they were just buying property and buying all kinds of real estate and thinking that there was a bottomless pit
it always would increase
it always would be more than what you paid for it
they just never even got conservative with our money at all
everyone forgets that there are several of these people that are wanted by the federal government currently and are overseas where extradition is merely a funny american word
the reason that i said that is because i was going to blame all reaganomics for
when you opened up the bank deregulation without any controls i thought that was the philosophy
i thought that's not going to work
i knew that it wasn't going to work originally
it hasn't worked now
in theory a healthy economy has a lot of spending going on
if people are making money people can spend money
it'll generate taxes
i agree with that
there's got to be some control
apparently there was
the problem is
the problem with reaganomics is that the people at the top are the ones getting rich
for what they would cost
we weren't producing anything
i'm sorry we don't get into a real argument over it
i know
not high quality ones at that
i do have a lot of confidence in the american people and the economy and everything else
i feel bad when i see the inefficiency even here at t i
i think that the
it still
a lot of the workers don't understand that they need to put out the best that they can because it comes right back to them
with the japanese
when i
i work with a lot of mechanics
i just cannot understand why they're just happy to spend their time here rather than produce
they think that i'm paid anyway
it doesn't matter
i'm very tired of it all pays by the hour
i'm nonexempt
what does a nonexempt sound like
you're too informed
they're very not interested
i'm being a yankee i guess i'm letting my yankee come out
now maybe i'm not the typical nonexempt that you deal with
i am degreed though nonexempt
that's good
that's good that you're degreed
your time will come
i do not wish my time to come
do you do technician work or something
i did p c protection control work for
quality okay
about ten or twelve years
is really terrible
i'm management level facilities
when the cuts came three of us got bounced back
we're just
i'm covering weekends and nights now
i'm one of the manager reps
just we're essentially standby and problems all nights and weekends
being basically an engineer and liking doing installation work there's not any
there literally is no installation work going on
as far as our conversation goes i would really be interested to know how much of t i's problems now are related to
i think that not only t i but a lot of it when they talk about
i i have to admit i'm not as informed as them
there's something like about eighty six billion that they admit
i always double that
i figure if they claim that it's going to cost us eighty-six billion it's got to be twice as much because no one admits their mistakes
if that's true it may mean that two hundred billion dollar category that went down the tube somewhere
it really hurts me
one of our senior
here they're not really that high
are they pretty good up there
we're in the metroplex here
they lost several contracts
i don't know if you noticed yesterday you probably don't pay attention to the bell helicopter
they were going to have big award
secorski got it which was boeing secorski which is up in the north somewhere
i don't know how
also they do some of that in wichita kansas
i don't
t i was getting the electronics with bell
it was a double
two that t i was doing the electronics for them
they advertised that it was t i bell all of a sudden secorski got it yeah
i almost think there's some politics around here because the metroplex here in the dallas fort worth area with t i
general dynamics and l t v and bell have lost project after project
you realize
jean the subject is jury trials
should the jury recommend sentencing
my personal opinion
here lately it seems
up until a few years ago i guess there just too many liberals about and permitting too many
they just broaden the human rights to cover just about everybody i don't think those guilty of committing capital crimes should be permitted to go spend a few years in jail and be turned lose on parole
therefore i think juries should be able to recommend sentencing
it's for them to believe that somebody else could do the things that have been done
so many of us have led sheltered lives that when we sit in on a jury
i always assumed that that was why i was never called
that's possible
i was called up as an alternate once
i never made it to the jury
do they have such a thing now as a six man jury
i had never heard of such thing
i wondered if it was true
i just wondered
another question was a criminal case should the jury be unanimous on their decision
that i wasn't sure on either whether it should be unanimous or not
then again so many times you get one or two holdouts
it permits the criminal to get a retrial
that's not too bad in this sense because you might get someone in their that's a victim of circumstances that's happened and giving them another trial might give them additional time to prove their innocence
apparently there are
i
since my husband worked as a policeman i can't believe there are very many people that come to trial that are not guilty of some part of whatever they're accused of
i still have a little bit of a problem with that
i would suppose there are circumstances you're in the wrong place at the right time or know the wrong person at the right time
that's it
you just might resemble somebody
out here in texas we had a great miscarriage of justice
after nine years it was finally taken care of
a black man was accused simply because he resembled someone who held up a seven eleven i think it was
even though he had witnesses that said that he was at work
he had all sorts of character witnesses and what not
they said this happened during lunch time
he could have gotten away at lunch time and committed the robbery
after nine years
as a matter of fact they made a t v show about it after nine years they finally came up with evidence to prove that he was innocent
for heaven's sake
there's nine years of that man's life gone
that just was not fair
we bend over backwards protecting the guilty people the one's that are on trial
we often forget about the one the injustice has been done because i they still say our system is the best in the world
it's not the best system
it's the best one in the world
unfortunately we just have to put up with a lot of things
they try to solve them and everything
i don't know
i'm still rancled about their decision to permit burning of the flag
i think a lot of people are
the first amendment definitely says freedom of speech not freedom of action
that just rancles me
i swear if i ever saw somebody burning a flag i'd try to kill them i would
i don't know if i'd go that far
i happen to be a flag freak
i was in the service i was in korea i saw what the red in the flag represents
i think pride in our country and our flag is so important
i feel like if people don't like what our flag stands for they're welcome to go some place else
what they
how they'd like it under another flag
jean we seem to be of the same opinions here
do you think that's good like if a jury
passing sentence
yes
i think the jury should be able to recommend
that's what i was thinking they sometimes do
i know i'm always hearing that
the jury came in with a guilty verdict
they recommended
they recommend
the judge has the final decision on what does really happen yeah
of course the jury may not be completely aware of all the ramifications of a sentence
i think that's where a lot of people think boy they're getting put away for a long time
actually their chance course when
it depends on what they'd been guilty of and a lot of different things i guess
too many times they are permitted to go out on parole
there are bad ones that do slip back out and end up hurting somebody again
they say after three offenses its automatically life in prison
i think they ought to make it two offenses
i always thought there was wrong
it seemed like sometimes there's not a good
here again now there is where race seems to rear its ugly head so frequently
it's the best one we've got
let's put up with it i guess
it's been nice talking to you jack
i hope you have a real good day and week
let's hope neither one of us ever has to run into this subject we were discussing
where are you from
just here in dallas
okay because i talked to a professor in what was it north carolina who got the t i system
he gave to all his students
my daughter's even talked to
i've talked to several people from north carolina
people from virginia and all over yeah
i asked him about it
he says i think i'm the guy that gave it to all my students
that's why so many people are from this college
you first eve
the subject we're supposed to be talking about let's see is food
what would you cook let's see if you were giving a dinner party
the only reason why i may know a little bit about this is that i'm planning on having a barbecue pretty soon
to me that's the type of thing that i like to give in cooking for people
if he's cooking outside where it's cooler and you don't have to do all that much work you just slap on some food and slap on some barbecue sauce
i'm trying to think which is the best that i prefer
my wife doesn't like to have all that work on the very day that you're doing it
we haven't catered out very much
i always worry about the barbecue in that you have to be
i've made shish kabob which i like
i guess i'm thinking of the easy thing to do for having dinner
the breakfasts and the steaks
although i would like to experiment with the meals my mother made
i haven't gotten around to that yet
she was polish
she would make very economical meals
different rice and ham and things that
i would like to try that one day
she would make spaghetti with pork chops and special meat balls and everything
my wife
dinner parties are a lot of work
that's why i like the outdoor stuff a lot better
people can entertain themselves i think a great deal more when you have a barbecue especially when you have hot dogs and hamburgers and
nothing really fancy like your shish kabobs where you have to do a whole bunch of work
that
shish kabob is just because it only takes a few minutes to cook
far as getting out there and putting it on it only takes a few minutes
i'm thinking of the easy way rather than
i think you do a lot of work
even if people do bring over things you still do all the
housework and get everything prepared and utensils and just everything
my mother used to make an armenian rice dish
i'm thinking about special dishes
yeah
it was made out of rice and consume soup and bacon and onions
you'd simmer it all day long
it would
it was just wonderful
that's something that i would really like to try and find the recipe for
we used to have that at thanksgiving time
because you can put it on top of the stove and do this
there's so much broth and juice in there
that it has to soak up into the rice all day long in order for it to come out fluffy and nice
that was
when you were talking about the polish dishes some goulashes and things like that
that's what i thought about was that armenian rice dish
it probably will never taste as good as we remembered
back as we get older
we probably should try it to do that
the recipes are really interesting
we'll probably forget all about them
here i am talk about trying to make everything easy
something s-
i remember we were first married
we were living in new jersey
we were going over to my mother's house for christmas to have a meal
we were on the way over
she said i'm looking forward to a nice turkey
she had turkey a lot
that was surprising in the east
we always had ham
that's one thing als-
the hams just kind of go take it out of a can or a package sliced
the cans were cooked for hours and hours and were just wonderful
i'd like to try that too
you know what i found was at sam's wholesale stores
what they have is this honey baked ham
have you had any of those
i know about sam's
if you ever get a chance to buy one of those i think it was twenty dollars for i don't remember how many pounds it was
you cook it in the bag that they send it in
all the juices and everything are all sealed in
i tell you what it's never failed to come out tender and juicy
i haven't heard
and just delicious because i normally don't like ham because it's so salty
with this honey bake that they have that's the only one i have been able to find there at sam's warehouse
it slices great uh-huh
because we have a delivery guy that comes around that sells
i don't know
i see a can here a box here of gourmet choice
he delivers
it's a company that has a truck that comes around
they recently had hams
they have steaks and pirogies and all that stuff that
i wish i could tell you the name of the company
i don't know what it is
they recently had a ham that was supposed to be
it was boneless we tried it
it was fully cooked and everything
that sounds like it
that's the only ham i have found that i thoroughly thoroughly enjoy
i keep saying this to do the different things that we did
i would like to put one in the oven the old fashioned way and put it in there for hours and hours and see if
i don't think in my married life which is twenty-six years now we've never done that
i remember that when i was a kid
to have the ham cooking rather than that we just
ham is just something you have for breakfast occasionally
that's it
in the old days hams were the meal
i don't think we
i don't think so anymore not with more becoming more conscious of fat and cholesterol and all those good things
how have you changed your meals now
into that
my parents actually started it
getting
it's true
i think my parents are very unusual because we grew up in the south where you have all the biscuits and gravy and fried foods galore
gradually they started switching over to plain rice no gravy
it really is
they actually led us through it versus us teaching them the finer points
my mother has really high cholesterol
it was one of the reasons which started them off
they started doing this like in about the middle seventies
that's amazing
it's really neat
my wife's mother is the only grandparent left
of course i have too but not like hers
i always get after her about salt and everything else
she just will she's going to eat the same way she ate
she just tells more or less tells me to shut up
i like to
it's not the
i listen to larry newarth on the weekend
he talks about the chicken and the rice and everything else
throwing away peanut butter and all
the things not to eat ever
he's got me into making eggs without the yolk
try that sometime
when i make scrambled eggs now talking about a recipe
if i have four eggs not for me
if i'm making four eggs even for my daughter i'll take out all the yolks but one
it's fine
you don't miss it
in fact when i make eggs for myself if i fry them throw them in there i will almost hard fry them so i can not eat the yolk at all
you don't really miss it
you don't eat it at all
you get a bite at the most
for cholesterol i'm trying that
it has worked
i haven't gotten on the butter or not cholesterol margarine and all that
i don't know whether any of that is true
the one thing that keeps coming to mind to me is that
they keep letting out people that have these horrible records
maybe we need to have more prisons or use the old army bases and make them into prisons or something
it's definitely a big concern
every day it's all ar-
there's just rapes and murders and burglaries and everything all the time
you just can't get away from it no matter where you live
it's pretty scary
i'm from butler
i can't say that there's too much of that there
i know the bigger cities have problems with it
i really don't know what we can do about it
unless they start enforcing the
even some of the sentences just seem ridiculous
you hear about people six and seven times have committed burglaries
they're still only serving six months in prison
that's definitely something
they could have a more automatic sentence instead of having the judge having the choice of like from one month to ten years or something
that would be one thing that i think could help is having the laws be changed so that they were more stiff penalties and more automatic penalties for certain crimes
i don't know what they're going to do with the problem because it just keeps getting worse and worse
one things that they're saying now
are you in the work force
i'm a senior at clarion university
one of the things that i've heard so much about lately is the situations on campus where crime has gone up so much
apparently especially like in date rape many of the perpetrators seem to be getting off because the universities kind of cover up
they don't really
i've heard of a few case up here
i can't say that i've heard of any significant amount
then again you don't know how many girls are reporting them or not
one thing they could do is probably support people more reporting it
i'm sure it's still terribly traumatizing for people to report it
that's probably something else they could do
that's like as long as
it almost makes me feel in a way like making drugs legalized just to get all the money out of it and not have
these kids are
i can go out and work at burger king for four dollars an hour or whatever when i can make four hundred dollars a day selling drugs
that's certainly a big problem
you see now i would say that that's a bigger problem up here than even the date rape or anything
i'm not saying they're bad people
i would say that's a bigger problem
it ends up
even if it's just kind of like this social drug use you're still ending up supporting these big drug pin
huge amounts thousand and millions and millions of dollars are getting spent on higher and higher up
it's definitely got to do with crime
you hear about people selling their babies to get some crack
just
one of the things they're doing is they're prosecuting the women who are having these kids that are addicted to crack
they said some of the statistics show like one out of every ten babies being born in these public hospitals are
their moms are crack users
that's another way of looking at it is as the woman is being a criminal for doing that to her child
i don't know who's the victim there
the kids are the victim it seems like a lot of times the women are victims because they're addicted
it's a very complicated problem
i guess that's about all i have to say
i can't say that i just know that it's really bad in some areas
something's going to have to be done sooner
i don't know what they can do
basically i'm at home
i have two cats and my husband
my husband's great
i'm about forty and whatever
you're just a youngster then
it should be real interesting
you think we're ready
you want to start off
let's see
the changes i've seen in women's roles
since i am in the forty age i'm a fifties baby
from my mother's generation to my generation it's been a big change
i think you'll have to agree
since we were in sort of the ground level the bra burning of the sixties
we didn't really know what the agenda was going to be
i think it got off to a really radical
it has a radical fringe to it that i've sort of backed away from
they come in that way
to make a change you have to make a splash
to continue in that vein i think it got a little bit warped and off the track in several areas
i really do think that women have made a contribution to human beings to be human and what it's like and have feelings and emotions
it's okay
i think on the other hand i don't know that men have changed that much
in contrast to the women's changes the men stay steady
the women change around them
that is true
i think men are trying
they don't have a national organization of men
to help them out
what's changing them though is the economic situation
where it has to be a team partnership now
they both have to work they both have to raise the children
that i think has been the downfall of the last ten years
the me
the yuppiedom
the whatever it was the women didn't know how to go about doing the careers
they wanted to compete with men
that's wrong
i think they finally discovered that they don't want to be like men
they hurt themselves a little bit in that way
that's
they sort of threw the thing back another ten years
that they've had to restructure
i saw the greatest t-shirt the other day
i think men and women both have valuable assets to offer we shouldn't
there is great wonderment
we should respect that in each other
just sort of all swooshed into one channel sort of thing
it's viva la difference
someone said that i think that you can truly respect the other person
tom is just always saying what a mystery you are
that depends on what day of the month it is
i don't know
in terms of that i think we've got more of a sense of humor about each other and our roles
it's still a challenge being in a marriage and trying to figure out those roles
i think now when both are working they have a more of a chance of working together because they're starting out that way
that's a very different way to do
the woman doesn't start off at home
raising the kids and goes back into her career
really hard to really to get help
to get the work load shared
are you married
we have five children
my goodness
how do you mean that
okay
did you have boys girls
we have two girls and three boys
our baby girl just had a baby girl
how exiting
it's been real exciting
i tell you what
i just love the babies since i'm sort of in a medical situation where i can't do that it's
just the most important years of my life
that's a long eight years though
there have been major major adjustments
that's another story
my husband has
i couldn't ask for a better life
if this is the way it had to be
that has a lot to do with his strength and his just pitching in and his being able to all all ego aside do a lot of things that really
when i say men haven't changed i guess i should look at my own backyard sort
probably your role
the way you are also has changed though
compared to what it would have been twenty fifty years ago
boy
i would have had so
the changes that had to take place
where i couldn't do a lot of things and just adjusting to that
that was a major change
i guess
women i think are a whole sort of riding the course
they're got a little wobbly and a little shaky there
that's the only thing i worry about is the child's love and security
i think that's being damaged
we're going to see a generation of kids that are just going to be a little bit
i think
some women can do both
i wish they weren't so many
i wish they weren't role models for everybody
it really is yeah
when she can't the failure of that is
her life sort of falls apart
she doesn't know who she is
many have to work to make a go of it it seems
they say they do anyways
i think ones that don't have to the
i think it depends on what part of the country you're in
that could be
i would almost just say that because down here in the south a woman's role is
None
yeah
i think that
in terms of women staying home and being appreciated for their talents it's just like the way it has been for years
since the days of the pioneers around here
it's hard for her to watch her peers be appreciated i think sometimes
then i'm not there
i don't know that
i have women that do both
i see a little jealousy on the part of the woman what has two little boys
she has an au pair which is a live-in college kid working for her
she has her business in the back my other girlfriend that has just runs the whole household herself and just has two kids and goes crazy
i see i little bit of that
i always wish there was a balance
with the one and wish she could spend more time with her kids
the other gal i wish she could just get out of dodge
they're both
you're right about that
that's where the trouble lies
some people can adjust and have both do both well
others can't
how did your daughter do it
i have one daughter that works full-time
they seem to do fine
she has talked about quitting and staying home for a few years
then it's real hard because she's got an excellent job
i have a really great one that i make in the summertime because it's cool
it's just really pretty easy
i like that
the only thing you have to do is cook the rice that goes in it
you're supposed to do chicken
i just use those little cans of chicken
it makes it so much easier
you dump the rice
you put in fruit like pineapple and mandarin oranges and grape
i get my kids to do that
i don't have to do that
it really
you mix it all up with ye-
it's so simple
it tastes really good because it's cool in the summertime
it's really good
i like that one
like for memorial day we had some friends over
we just bought a brisket and marinated it overnight in one of those adolph's meat marinate
that sounds good
it was real good
people think they're eating steak or something
i don't usually just pass on any recipe that's got more than five or six steps to it because i just know i'll never take the time to do it
i do that a lot
i don't like to do that if it's real hot though
i don't know
i have a real thing about being hot in the summertime
i think when you heat your kitchen up it really makes a big difference
we don't entertain that often
when we do i'm like you i like it to be fast and easy
and something so that we can talk and not have to worry about being in the kitchen all the time
we don't entertain people from work or stuff often
it's usually kind of like you want to come over and they say what can we bring
it's real easy because you just make one or two things
everybody else brings something
i don't know if i could take the pressure of having to put on this really fancy dinner for someone
you see all that on t v
i could never be that person
i'm just not
i'm pretty laid back
i know a lady in my church
she does her own bread and does her own stuff
when she does food she really goes all out
i don't know how she can do it and be calm
i've been working
i'm not going to work anymore
how exciting
hopefully i think i'll enjoy cooking more when i don't have to work all day
by then it's eight thirty or nine o'clock at night
i usually start about six and cook and then eat at seven
cook at five and eat at six rather
my family and i we're a sit down together family
that's good
i like to be able to sit down after school and have them talk with me and my husband about what's happened
i think that was ingrained in me during my family time at home
we could learn to talk about things
i think that's good
since it's just the two of us it's
that happens to us sometimes too
sometimes if something is on that they want to watch i leave it on
we eat in the kitchen
their heads are always poking past the door
food is a real life-style kind of thing
some people don't like to do this
i like to cook with my kids
if they're going to have other kids over then then they help
we make real simple things those
i don't know if you've ever made them maybe not since you don't have kids yet but those jell-o gelatin things you can pick up with your fingers i can't think of what they call it
i've seen those in the magazines
the kids love to do that
finger food is a biggie with them
now one thing i wish i could find a better way to do are celery sticks and carrot sticks because they love to do that
it's just really hard
if you have to work with a knife i don't like that
that's
it's a hard one to have to prepare
they like that with the cool ranch dressing that goes along with that
that's a good way to get kids to eat vegetables too
my son's getting to be a real good cook
wow that's great
do you cook a breakfast every morning
not every morning
we usually have cold cereal or something like that
during wintertime when they're in school then i try to vary it so that we only eat that twice a week or something and then have when it's really cold i even cook oatmeal
they like it all right
sometimes we do something
we do eggo waffles and stuff like that
i try to
sometimes we do eggs if i get up early enough to do that
they don't like that
do they get rubbery
it depends
they will be a little harder
i don't like that
you have to just let it cook a little bit less than what it says in if you have a microwave book
you cook it a little bit less and then let it sit with a plate over the top
let it steam
stir it up
that turns out okay
it's funny 'cause if i turn them out on to a plate for them to take what they want
it's very deceiving 'cause if they see it with their eyes they go i don't want that
yet if they don't ever see it then it's like this tastes okay
she would make these fancy casseroles and hide it in there
we'd go this is really good
it may be an idea to think about cost
trying to find a jury so you can get a jury as far as they may say they're not biased
deep down they are against this person or whatever
i don't think it's such a bad idea to think about
that it
a judge would be more consistent from one case to the next and not depend so much on the emotions of a particular case but be able to put it in overall perspective
some of them do
some of them don't
this one
it seems to me that when i studied civics in school or stuff that the juries being involved in the sentencing wasn't so much
i'm trying to figure out whether i'm remembering wrong or whether that's by state
it's either guilty or not guilty
i guess
i don't know whether it's by state or whether there's been some
i certainly wouldn't be worried about that
i guess in terms of having a judge do it would seem to me to be more fair and unbiased
in terms of doing away with the unanimous jury i guess i would be a little more leery of that kind of a change in the trial system
that's just such a tradition that it's got to be a unanimous jury that i don't know where you'd draw the line anywhere else two-thirds or three-fourths or whatever
i certainly wouldn't feel comfortable with just a bare majority
that's kind of how i
in certain cases i can see them going just basically with a judge guilty or not guilty verdict simply from a judge in highly publicized cases versus the small maybe you did a crime that was burglary or whatever
it goes into the court case or whatever
it's not highly publicized
when you get into these highly publicized cases where everybody knows details whether it's through the national enquirer or whatever
it's the idea that person might initially have this thought jeez this person's guilty no matter what
i'm not going to listen to the facts and con their way into getting past the lawyers and getting through that
also there's aspect of cost
i'm not quite sure how much cost it does take for the judicial system to try and call a jury whether it's very costly or if it's something that's not costly or what
being that i'm not in that area i really don't know
i wonder if there is some big expense in trying to call a jury to trial and then having to pay whatever they have to pay if there's something that they have to pay
whether it's
it's not
i'm
i know it is where i work
i'm not sure that that's necessarily required by law that it has to be paid
i suspect that's a benefit of a bigger company
there are certainly some that wouldn't
i don't know if there's going to be solutions to the
now it's in pretty disastrous shape for sure
there's maybe some short-term things that they can do
it hurts everybody's pocket of course
i know that state has cutback raises for a year to help the state financial or whatever you might want to say to get better in a better condition
which state is that
state of minnesota
there's the potential that perhaps the u s budget might want to take a look at it's federal employees and take a look at saying let's freeze wages
everybody's doing it so it isn't like private business has had to do it
it might have to be something that they might consider doing that's got to be very short term
the only other avenue that i can think of is looking at where they're spending the money and not so much as saying we're spending too much in that area as perhaps looking at what is costing them the money
as for instance i think you probably remember the military getting caught with toilet seats that cost them four hundred five hundred dollars
it was just
it gives you a- idea that
there was people at stanford who were soaking the government using millions of dollars of research money for the president to buy beach homes or whatever it was
i think that maybe more widespread than we'd like to have think
the as far as
the conferences were nothing
they're getting paid for this
it was something more than just the conferences
they were using it as eating out
when you think about people taking vacations these big government officials taking descendants in
it's a real big crunch of course when they get caught then they're guilty of course
during that time i'm sure there's hundreds of thousands of people that are spending money that does not belong to them
that's right
i think that politicians talk a lot about waste i'm not sure that that's really that much of the problem
when you look at something like the gulf war it cost us god knows how much at a million dollars
i don't think it's ended up being
it gave people jobs i think it also cost quite a bit as far as because after they're done with the war a lot of things were no longer put to use
it was kind of like we'll do this during this point and time
after that they didn't want to do it anymore
a lot of things that are saying that they're no longer going to be doing for next wars that are coming up that they did for this one in getting rid of a lot of things
i don't know
it was good talking to you
have a good evening
i don't
you have children
we've had lots of them in the past
what have you had
we had a dog before we moved here
we couldn't bring her with us
we've had hamsters and fish and birds
you're going to have lots of pets with your children
he was fourteen years old
before that we had all dachshunds
i think my husband wants another dachshund
we're trying to debate because our children are grown
i don't know whether we really want to be tied down to a another dog
we do have a very loving cat that's kind of our baby
we like pets
they think we should have a dog
that's because they have a great dane
we
if it were just more peaceful with the little ones
any pet that i get from now on will definitely be spayed or neutered
i did
that's why we've never gotten a female in anything
our male cats we had
neutered right away
of course he doesn't know it
i do think that maybe we'll get a female next time and just have her spayed
a lot of times now when you buy them from the s p c a or from the humane societies or whatever their adoption includes their spaying
you know the safety factor and stuff
we enjoy having pets
i think they're a lot of company
when my mother lived with us the cat was really hers
he was kind of wild
our daughter found her and brought her to us
that cat walked in and walked right up to my mother and jumped up and curled up in her lap
she was the only one at first that could really hold him because he was really skittish
it was like he knew
he would sleep with her
he was a lot of company to her
and just love her
cats are usually so independent
this one he comes up
he crawls up next to my husband now
the cat would sleep
when everybody turned we all four of us
our cat would sleep with us
he hated that
when she'd walk on the couch along the back behind his head he hated that
i guess probably if we get another animal it probably wouldn't be a cat
it would definitely be an outdoor animal
because as i said our schnauzer was old
he was becoming incontinent
then i would just have messes in the house
i think that's one of the things that both of us are not wanting to start over with
it was new carpeting
it just really
that would
they just
it's grandpa's dog
he's really getting too old to take care of it
the dog messes all over the carpet
my daughter is just nine months old then she crawls on the carpet
the smell it's just really awful
that's one real drawback
i guess you'll do just about anything for your pet if you love them enough
we were trying to decide about putting him to sleep
he was getting so old and had other problems too
fortunately the decision was just taken away from us which made it a whole lot easier
again going through that because our animals are almost like our kids in some ways
you grieve just as much over them when they go as you would a child
our son and his wife and our daughter and her husband and the grandkids all say get a dog get a dog
i can tell my husband deep down he real-
you're in plano also
good to hear
that was good
that was it
good to hear
they're pretty good
they've got some good good players out there
you ready for new year's eve
should we start this so we can
i'm brian
okay nancy then i guess today's subject is benefits in the job other than salary
what do you feel are important to you or other people as crucial benefits
i'm a little different than other people because i don't have benefits with my job
i work
i find that it makes up for what i pay for insurance
i make enough money by the hour to make up for that
to compensate for some of the benefits
i have my freedom
that's an excellent
that is a benefit
it is to me
i'm just really not interested
i guess that's a good point
i do belong to a large corporation
that where i'm currently employed
there's some different things one that you've already mentioned is health insurance
i think through our health insurance that i can get better rates through a group plan as opposed to going out and getting health insurance on an individual basis because i had to do that at one time when i wasn't employed with a large corporation
that got to be somewhat expensive
i think one of the benefits i see is the group discount
especially if you have a family
that's one thing i do have
if i didn't have a family i don't think i would have as a male or as an individual in this stage of my life
i don't think i would have insurance
in my previous job i really enjoyed because they had what was called flex schedule where i could go and i could work nine hour days and have friday only work four hours i could do work four days a week at ten hours a day and have a three day weekend
and make my job flexible in that case
did you have to do it the same every week
yeah
i had to do that the same for about every quarter of the year
i was in a position of management i had responsibilities over people that i needed to make my schedule so that if i was not there i would have coverage by some other management personnel
i think that that was an excellent benefit that i really enjoyed
i don't have that in my current operation
you mentioned flexible work schedule
that's good
what other benefits do you think are important
i guess
retirement that kind of thing which i don't worry much about
that's who i am
that's an individual thing
with our current organization we do have a nice retirement package
also a nice thing that we have in our corporation is a profit sharing plan where we can participate in the profits of the company if we've been there a while and we're vested which means that we have an interest in the company that we can get some of the benefits of either the profit high times or in a sense suffer during the low times
also in one of my wife's companies where she worked they'd had a real nice profit sharing plan that
some of the t v shows i like to watch are mostly evening shows
for instance the one i'm looking forward to tonight is twenty twenty
i like to watch forty-eight hours
never miss that and sometimes prime time live
the week goes by
i don't think i
the sunday night movies i watch those kind of things but basically a lot of documentary things and what's going on and that kind of thing
i have a few favorite shows that i try not to miss
i like rosie o'neill
i've never seen that one
i've seen the previews for that
it's probably very much a woman's show
there's a new sitcom on that is tim allen's handyman
that's not what
we never miss that
we try not to miss that
we think it is
just part of it
i thought it was
it had such a good story too
the little boy the little one was trying to decide if there was a santa claus
that's right
the neighbor
it appeared that maybe it probably wasn't the neighbor
used to be on sunday nights now i can't figure out where they've moved it
on our public television they had a show at ten thirty that was a computer show
it showed the latest developments from all the computer companies
it's
unless you're really into computers and software you probably wouldn't be interested
i don't know
they covered everything from entertainment to spreadsheets and then also the hardware
you could see what the new developments were and what to look for
public television course doesn't have the commercials during the show
i like the frugal gourmet
i do too
i do too
i just seem to miss a lot of these programs
there's very few that my life would stop if i didn't catch
now i do
i watch two
one's a half-hour
one's an hour
they lead into each other
that's the bold and the beautiful and as the world turns
i've watched the as the world turns since i was a little girl
it's just
it's something i've done for the last probably twenty-five years
you get to come home and watch them
i don't have anyone else at home
i have freedom to watch whatever i want
i like
i like the comedies
i do like good movies
i subscribe to h b o
i can get some of the movies
we just canceled it last week because it seemed like it was so repetitious
i don't sleep a whole lot
i
None
you don't get good reception without cable
it doesn't cost that much more to have one of the pay channels
that's primarily why i have it right now
i thought when i got my v c r i'd probably drop it
that was years
say you did starters and bendix springs such as that on an old one
some that she had to label everything
None
they quit making it
it never did run right again
what were you replacing the starters and bendix on
a maverick and also a chrysler station wagon before that
did you replace just the bendix on the chrysler station wagon or the whole starter
they kept saying that's what chryslers did is they wore out starters
if they start real easy you just hit the key
it starts up when it's properly tuned up that starter will last for a long time
they built that starter so it would fit every v eight and all the slant sixes that they've built in thirty-five years
they've got a whole lot of torque
to do that they did it
they geared it down so the motor spins really fast so it's got to spin for very long
most places don't rebuild them with good enough bushings
it's
what are you driving now
my chrysler van
it's pretty maintenance free
at the beginning of the year last year drove a chevrolet cavalier station wagon
it didn't give me any trouble at all
rides or runs
it rides rough
i kind of
right now without getting some of the sportier models the four cylinders aren't real peppy
they're starting to change that out in the last couple of years too
i've driven one im-
in a month i think i put three oil coolers on it
every time i turned around i was having trouble with it
everything else i ever owned was american built mostly older cars
i've been a mechanic
i starting working my father's service station when i was about twelve
i've been around cars a lot but driven a lot of old pontiacs
my first three cars were seventy model pontiacs a g t o and a bonneville and a station wagon
till you got crazy with it
you get the four barrel all worked up
suddenly
long as you didn't spin the tires too much or spend too much time with the secondaries kicked in it it didn't do too bad on gas
do you think since they started with electronic ignition that it improves the way the car runs
it still had the points and condenser in it
i pulled that old points distributor out and got an h e i electronic distributor put into it
i really enjoy reading the newspaper
we get the daily dallas morning news
i try to look at it
do you have time to read the paper in the morning
not in the morning
if the
i have two children
if they go out to play or something i like to keep my eye on them so i'll maybe go outside and read the paper while they're playing or sit in a chair by the window or something
a lot of people don't take newspapers at all
we took the morning news for a while
we've been taking the times herald for ages
dog just ran off with my shoe
we switched the morning news
we found we couldn't read enough of it
by the time i got home and had time to read some
i guess the issue is beside the newspaper do you take any news magazines
i don't take time or newsweek or anything like that
i do like to watch c n n
it comes on at nine o'clock p m
i will turn that on while i'm doing some work
i can hear the news not have to sit right down and listen to it
did you hear what schwartzkopf had to say about pete arnett and the news coverage
yes i did hear that
i do try to keep that in mind that whenever you're reading a paper it usually has a particular flavor
any time magazine and even the news that
that's why i like some diversity the idea that we have time which we take from time to time
the problem is they call up and make this deal
we're taking that
we also hit the garland garland daily news
i guess it comes out sporadically like
i think what's interesting is that as difficult as it is or as much as they try they put some bias
it was interesting that they think that they're basically impartial
people accuse them of controlling the news he says we don't control the news we just report it the way it is
i would really say that that's not true because it seems like certain newspapers always espouse certain candidates
news stations always tell the story from a certain angle
that's why it's a good idea to get a wide variety of coverage so that you get a lot of different opinions
you'll have a variety to choose from
i thought that was particularly interesting in the gulf war that there were pieces of information that were apparently leaked just as a ploy
which was
i find that fascinating that
i listen to k r l d and k l i f the news talk radio
i actually listen to c n n radio
i really have gotten out of the habit of listening to the radio from any kind of even music
when i go to work i listen
it's how come he usually calls me sometimes
and says i just heard on the news that such and such happened if it's something really interesting
i'll know to keep an eye out for it
i've got out of the habit of listening to the radio
with your
if you're around the home though and can watch t v and read the paper the problem is that about twenty minutes of news radio or thirty minutes is
they start repeating everything
it's kind of a
that's what's interesting is the c n n
i'm trying to think if it's much local
i listen to a little of ninety point one
i'm inveterate switcher
i watch channel five
that has to be
i think channel eight is probably
i know dave fox
we're fairly new to the area
we're still shopping
from oklahoma city
apparently channel eight was way down
now they have turned it all around and done a pretty remarkable job
they've been some people move around
john chriswell is the
i don't know
do you seem to
i really think so
i noticed on channel eight that there's all of the anchors seem to be like white anglo saxon protestant type people
they all seem to be fairly similar
i kind of prefer some females
i like the anchors to be different kinds of people
i think that i like that
there i know john wylie price
he's been protesting
i prefer to have a little bit of variety like that because i think you're more likely to get
i think he has legitimate argument
you can
i grew up in alabama
i have some prejudices
i think that from a justice standpoint because we have the option of not watching that station
i'm totally in favor of affirmative action in some of the programs
i think that in some cases this should be some real opportunity and some diversity and this kind of thing
i think that dallas it turns out though from what i understand has quite good
and there for a few days and watch the news and think dallas really does have quite good news
i think channel eight is the number one a b c affiliate in the u s
we
all of the stations seem to be pretty good
we had a favorite
i did have a favorite channel that i usually tuned into for local news
you feel comfortable with them
in fact the guy that was on the weatherman on channel eight worked for me long time ago
twenty years or so even longer than that twenty-one twenty-three years ago or so twenty-four long time ago
shortly after we got here fourteen years ago
they had fired him because he was too t-
he didn't have the personality
that's interesting
that's what the t v stations do
i think
if we remember that they're out after the ratings
that really effects how they report the news
it's like the dale hansen on channel eight sometimes a little too cutesy
have you been on the conversation when they beeped you at ten minutes
good talking to you
are you a t i-er
are you at t i
you have to do the random drug testing
in fact with me it's not much to talk about
have you been participating in this
about ten or eleven calls
you got ten
you've passed me up
i think that they were surprised to find it so low
i think they were expecting to find the national average at t i
i think it was tremendously down
i think that when i was at t i of course we had all the information before they started
they said that a certain number of people that the heavy drug users would either quit or go in rehabilitation programs
i think that's what helps that in the warning that you have a drug program the people that are worried about it or are taking drugs actually go
usually a lot of them partake in some of the benefits of rehabilitation and everything
that's real beneficial for the company and the employee
our numbers have been way down
we had
we did have a couple of cases where the person said that they hadn't used anything
their test came back positive
normally we didn't retest them
there were a couple of people that we really thought that they were telling the truth
we retested them the next day
they came back negative the second time
that's the only thing i think that might be a little bit of a problem
at t i before they had the testing i've forgotten seems like it's a year ago september something like that they told us that the agency that did it was the one that did it for the government
of course that's critical just as the point that you brought up that whoever does your testing's got to be have a lot of quality control that they keep track of everything
they were not
i haven't heard of any
i'm not in personnel or anything
they say that there it's almost down to zero where people come back and say they are positive and they're not
that of course has got to be critical
i think that t i is latched themselves up with an established group
that would be good for any company that does it and not to have just a very casual thing
it's got to be with a first class totally independent agency not local of course
ours i think it was in the south somewhere
it wasn't even in dallas the one that did us
do they have a policy where they counsel people if they come back positive
do they fire them right away
they have one chance to then go in a program
you come back positive you have one chance to go in and go into they have a lot of rehabilitation both for alcohol and for drug use
they have an agency where you can go for personal problems financial or whatever
they don't
it's definitely trying to encourage people to rehabilitate
in fact again before you go that's why i said when they first started it they had a rehabilitation program in effect that said if you worried about this and you may have taken drugs go ahead and get rehabilitated first
they won't say anything about it
it's a weakness and all
all of us have weaknesses of one kind or another
i think that those people that have that and however they got into it
i always worry about the classical thing that you see on t v where the drug pushers give it to the kids for free and get them sucked in
they sell it to them
they slip it to them
i don't even have that much knowledge to know whether that would get them addicted or not
he works mostly with adolescents
you know a lot about that
most of the time it's they get into the wrong crowd first
they start a drug problem
i have pretty good luck or very good luck with my daughters so far
one's at home gets dozen calls a night
i'll let you go if you want to go ahead and take that
we're starting
i always say that i've learned so much more from them than i ever taught them
we're really excited about it
they're always over in someone else's house
we've been lucky that our house is usually the place where the kids could come
None
at least you see what's going on
you always have your house welcome then your children think that you're cool parents and all that
good luck with your expected baby there
thanks
my wife was talking in my ear
she reminded me to say that they're very cheap until they get to start driving
we have one of course i say in college driving and one going to drive this summer
kids cost you practically nothing because you always get so many things from your relatives and everything
you wait until they go and get a car
as they get older they cost practically nothing from one to five
slowly but surely starts to creep up when they start to
it's well worth it and everything
i don't have much to say about drug testing
you've done this ten times
i get cash
i just got it a week or so ago saying so many calls will be something a prize and everything
that great
what kind of cash
hope they follow through and everything
technically we're not supposed to talk about the phone calls while we're on them
i guess we better get off
wayne i've never done any auto repairs myself at all
i may have screwed in a little
i personally haven't done anything
maybe i've changed wiper blades or something
i have noticed since i got married that my husband he hates to do auto repairs
he would rather do them himself than to pay someone else
i guess he can't make himself pay someone to do the repairs when he knows how to do it
he'll do it
he hates the time that he takes
he has changed the brakes
he has done all of the tune-ups
the like that
recently he changed the steering mechanism in the car
he priced around
everyone wanted several hundred dollars for it
he thought i can get one in a junkyard
he did it
i guess he's been pretty good about keeping our cars up
what's your experience been like
i have a long experience with cars
when i was younger my brother had a corvette
i bought a corvette
when you have a corvette you more or less do all the work
i've done everything from build the motor from the bare block on up
i'm the same way as your husband is when it comes to my car i hate to go pay somebody good money
in fact i just this past weekend put new plugs in both my car an my wife's car
i pretty much try to troubleshoot and do everything i can do myself
i've gotten to the point in my life where i don't want to crawl underneath the car anymore
i don't know whether i've just reached a point
it's real rough in the winter time
i try to make sure that by the time fall runs around
that the car's in pretty good shape enough to last through the winter
springtime i usually end up giving them a tune-up and make sure that they're running well
it's like i had the muffler go out on my car shortly before it was required to go
in maryland they have emission tests
you're required to get your car and go through the emission test
my muffler of course starting going bad right before i was supposed to go to the emission test
i had to do that job
of course that was back in december when it's nice and cold outside
the thing was that i could do the job myself
the parts cost me roughly a hundred dollars
if i'd taken it someplace and have it done it was going to be three hundred twenty-five
who's got that extra two and a quarter
that's exactly the way he feels is that he really hates to spend the time
if he thinks it's going to be two hours it's four if whatever it always takes him twice as long
then when he's finished he always says now you owe me three hundred dollars
he thinks that he has the money that he can spend on something
he hasn't given it to someone else
he gets some satisfaction out of that although generally i think he does not look forward to or anticipate
he just isn't one of them
i don't mind it
there was a time when i had my corvette
of course i loved it
if
there's a lot other more important things i think i should be doing with my time
i have the same problem
you can tell him from me
it doesn't matter
i've had greasy fingernails for years
it still takes me twice as long as i think it's going to take to do the job
i think the difference is that when you own the car you take more care in what you're doing
you want to make sure that it's done right and put back together right
i've in the past i've had brake jobs done by someone that when i went back and looked at it some months later i'd find something drastically wrong with it
like a spring that was put in incorrectly which could have resulted in brakes failing and me having an accident
those kind of things
when you have a vehicle that's being used by other members of your family you don't want that kind of a situation to come up
it's very very difficult to find a mechanic these days that you can trust
he's about sixty miles from here
it
if i have something that's really major that i can't handle or feel i don't have the time to handle i'll take it to him to do it
you know that it's really has a bad reputation is to feel that people in general feel and have rightly so i think been cheated many times
i know once when we had a
once the muffler needed to be changed
he had looked at him himself
we saw a commercial for fourteen or twenty dollars or something for a change
he went in
when they quoted him a price they really wanted fifty or something
the car that the muffler people had at least my husband felt that they had damaged the muffler further
since then i don't think he's ever even seriously considered any kind of job he thought he could do himself
i know from his childhood he says that his father always buys and restores cars just as entertainment i guess
kelly growing up he felt like that was a good way on saturday's that he developed a good relationship with his father
they used car repairs kind of as a way to have something that they did together
he thought that turned out pretty good because it helped him to understand and be functional now
it helped him to have a close relationship
that's one way he looked at it
that's probably something that is good for both of them
i know that my older son i could never get him interested in cars
i couldn't
i just like
your not interested in cars
he just would not have anything to do with them
later on and like when he grew up got out of the house got his own car he didn't know how to do anything to it absolutely nothing
he couldn't even check the oil
that's how uninformed he was and disinterested
i guess there are some people out there like that
i always thought maybe if he took more of an interest and what i was doing
maybe we could have communicated better
yeah
i think that's great
i feel like i could myself do some things but that i have enough responsibility that if i have someone like my father when i was living at home and my husband that's willing to do it i go ahead and let them do it
i don't feel the need to be a feminist on that issue and say i can take care of my own things
i'm happy to let them run the cars because i have so many other responsibilities
i haven't tried to do a lot myself
i trained my wife in the hou- in doing things
in fact when i first transferred down to texas instruments back in nineteen eighty-seven
when i left here she had to change a set of plugs on the car
it was an interesting experience for her
she'd always assisted me and done some other things
for her to actually get in there and do it herself it was something a little different
it helps you feel i think comfortable with your car and feel like it's not so scary if your driving it and you might get stranded somewhere that you might think i've been under that hood
i know what's going on
i think it's important that everyone know basically how the darn engine works
i've been out with my sister before when her car died on the highway
i happened to be with her and managed to get her to the other side of the road because it was dark and all
what do you see coming in the future
my goodness
i don't know
i'm twenty-three
then i can tell you that roles have changed
they changed quite a bit
basically the choices
that's kind of the opposite of what it was in the sixties and early seventies
it was sort of just to go protest
just everybody be damned and live with some one
None
social morals were a little bit lacking
i know that in the early seventies i think women were the first people to make a move as far as individuals
before that a lot of people that wanted to protest were large groups like black people or just large large groups of people
the
it was more civil rights oriented
i think the women's movement kind of brought in individual lives where you had women's movements
you had gay movements
i think since then is when a lot of the women's roles have started to change
some of the other stuff that i think that changed it when i first got out of college fifteen years ago they were always saying if you were assertive you were a libber
you were aggressive not assertive and independent
in terms of the corporate community i've seen a big change in terms of men finally being quote unquote used to women
who are in controlling positions
in the corporate hierarchy
i think that's good
i think that you can just look at home life and see i've been talking to a lot of people about education and things
and what affects the school system
i think that a big thing that effects it is that the mother is not home anymore
like she used to be
she used to be kind of a rock
since everyone is going out and working now whether it be because of finances or just the economy
the mother's not there anymore
the children are
i think a lot of society is suffering
not to say that women shouldn't go out and do what they want to do
i think that
they're not quite used to it yet
that's i
the schools or the parents
i'm trying to think of what else
a lot of the things the demographics do
there are more
a lot of the things that brought feminism there are just more women in the demographics just generally
i'm the typical baby boomer
in terms of
when i was twenty-three the issues were either go to graduate school or get married
those were the general issues
we were talking about child care
he asked me if i had any kids
i said no i'm just twenty
i said no i'm just twenty-three
because i don't think of myself as needing to have children
the first thing he says is don't you miss that part of your life
i just
my mind just went
it really doesn't even occur to me right now to have children
i've been a married for eleven years
it just
just because i'm not sure if it's just me or women in general that are twenty-three right now because i'm really into my career
i'm trying to go somewhere and get there quick worry about because right now in my career i'm really starting out
it's going to take me a while to move up
i don't need anything kind of holding me back
you'll find that that's the other big thing that has changed in terms of
women don't feel like they need to get married anymore
i just at the time
i was at a point where it was like i didn't date
i just went out to have a good time
i didn't have to have male companionship
a lot of the friends that i had in school at that point who had gone back and gone to law school or m b a programs
which i also had done they were very sad
then by the time i got married
i guess that's a big change in terms of just the attachments that women feel like they need to have the dependency
it's just really not there anymore
that has to do with the women getting out and other women seeing other women
that's like i can do that
maybe
i don't know
my god
it's okay
i don't thi-
i just turned twenty-three
i'm still going my god i'm getting so old
me myself i just like to move really really quickly
None
anything
when the age creeps up where i'm twenty-three and twenty-four
i'm thinking my time is running out
i'm actually very very young
what you'll find is
i'm just now finally to a point where
i don't know why i didn't do it sooner
this is probably typical of the women's movement too
which is a complete i wouldn't say career change it's a subway
it's still is a different application
if you think about it i still can have another career
i've worked for over fifteen years in what i've done
when you're saying quick i think that's probably one thing that your generation coming up after mine
is thinking that they have to do everyth- sort of
i call it a chewing syndrome
they have rapidity of speech
you'll find that probably by the time your twenty-eight thirty if you haven't slowed down
it's just you find out that you're really not smelling the roses
i know that sounds trite
i think a lot of people probably feeling that way
i know i'm probably feeling that way because
whether i want to realize it or not everything on television is young
it is
you can't do this after twenty
everybody that's in the music business is starting out at fifteen
i feel like i'm old
it's like i sing
i would really love to become
a professional singer
i think i'm too old now
you're not
i'm twenty-three
everyone i've seen coming up they're fifteen
it's
i'm going i'm so old
i really have to always tell myself no you're not you're very young
it's ju-
it's
it's like us we're getting ready to do if possible for an adoption
i have friends that say why would you do that
why would you do that now at this point
it's just individual choices
i stopped comparing myself a long time ago to somebody who had
he just turned forty
that's like your mother
what you find is you don't compare the woman because you just get into trouble
what i was going to say about mothers is your mother probably just won't say it
my mother and her sisters are always saying to my cousins and i my female cousins
you girls are so lucky because quote unquote you have all these choices
my cousins and i go why couldn't you
that's why i say i feel really lucky right now because i'm not married and because i don't have children
even some days i'm looking for another job now
i get so depressed not because i can't find a job but because i can't figure out what i want to do
that's normal
i thi-
i'm lucky though because not a lot of people can sit there and go gee i don't know what to do
it's depressing too
None
what do you that you're
i'm a free-lance writer right now
what i'm doing is working at an electronics company
i'm also
i'm excited tomorrow i have a luncheon appointment with a perspective client to do
marketing communications for them
i'm a news reporter now
you are
what i'm looking for is something in i really don't want to stay in news
i would like to stay in journalism
i've been looking for something exactly like that jus-
those people probably won-
i went to u t at austin
i just happen to work at a waco station because
you in radio or television or news
broadcast news t v
my journalism degree is in
we just ate out had a big lunch because we both have been working late
we had italian
do you really like italian food
it's not my favorite
this isn't really excellent italian food
it's
i have to tell you this if i don't because you're in plano
my softball unit here
it's very good it's all of these run adult males
it's all the garlic bread and all the
that sounds really good
it wasn't too bad it really wasn't
i was more in the mood for french toast any way
do you have any favorite
are there just the two of you
when my husband and i go out we have four children
you're kidding
that makes a difference
we don't like to go there because that's the most expensive
we like to go to a pizza place where you can buy a pizza for one price and feed the whole family
at gatti's or something like that
when my husband and i go out we like to go somewhere with a little atmosphere
we usually head on down what's the freeway down here
six thirty-five
all along that freeway there are restaurant
one of our favorites is pappasito's
it always kills me cause i don't like the decorations so much
i love the food
it's probably the best tasting
the shredded beef the type of
i like to get that
it's a shrimp dish
i don't remember the name of it
it's rolled up into something
it's really good
it's a little bit with the meat market atmosphere
even though we don't have kids we've been married long enough to not be around that
i'm trying to think of what else we like to eat
the one thing i notice is it's just about dining out that you probably can relate to with four children and two of us getting ready to adopt we find prohibited
lunch today was eighteen dollars
i think that some of it's over priced
it is i don't know
go to the august moon which is down there
restaurant with the lions in the front
it's pretty good as far as chinese
chinese isn't my favorite
he likes it kind of
he heats us up a good fight
me i'm like i said seafood i'm
i like a lot of different ethnic foods
we haven't been in years down near presby
i had a meeting down there today
i saw that
i said gee i remember that they offer you authentic japanese feeding
i remember when we went
i had never had saki
if you're looking for a very
the girls wear kimonos and
how nice
if you're ever looking for that
what other kind of foods
i don't know
i like barbecue okay texas barbecue
have you ever been to i think it's called spring creek barbecue
my husband's going upstairs
he says free ice cream
it was wonderful
in fact if i could pick my restaurants on how their coffee is and how their french bread is and the butter and the desert
how are your kids at an age where they can contribute to what they want
do you still order for them
my two littlest
she's six months
my four year old he still
my other older two they can
they're kind of
my littlest girl she's still wants mcdonald's mcdonald's mcdonald's
every child that i even know that eats vegetables looked five years old still after a certain age realized that there is something called a mcdonald's
i'm telling you
it's kind of funny is sometimes we all want different things
there's a h avenue down here
we all get to go to our own little thing and drive through and get our own thing
we go to park over there so we can all have our own
that's all right as long as
i was going to say because with six people how do you
i can't even imagine trying to
five of them they're good
we're getting ready to
it's just on my mind
how nice
somebody said to me in terms of
you have to bring a formula
i said what's that
i said i'm
i think that that would make them drool any way
i guess are you is it a little bit of constricted because a lot of restaurants don't take
in terms of talking about restaurants a lot of restaurants how are they when you have children let alone three or four children
you have to be careful if you go to a restaurant that really is more adults
like we could probably take our oldest son and our oldest daughter
they know how to act
some restaurants are really trying to go for that atmosphere kind of thing
i've been in some places where they say they take children
i've just seen where the wait attendance the wait staff is rude
that always just bothered me
on the other hand sometimes the children or the adults are themselves
really pappasito's we love
it's on
is it tia's not tia's
that's mexican right across from on the dillard's side there
i can't think of it
it had white tablecloth
i think it was paper where you could write on them or something with crayons
i was shocked
the dish was dirty
where you felt
other then that i don't know we do our share of pizza eating too but more like go get it and carry it in cause we're too
i don't like strange people coming to my door
i've got selv-
i can't really think of any other places
you can always blame it on having children
i enjoyed talking to you
i guess
good luck
i don't really have a lot of concrete opinions
just what i know out of my peer group has gone through
none of it has been good
the ones that can afford to have live-in nannies
a lot of the other ones that have are professional
i'd say fifty percent of my peers in my circle of friends have tried it and then stopped working until they're going to get their children in kindergarten or first grade
i
what age child are you thinking in terms of
for yourselves
you're starting
after eleven years of marriage we are
it's happening now
we're just going through the process
the question is very appropriate
i'm not sure how strong the maternal instinct is going to be
did you put him in daycare
is he older now or younger
he's now eighteen and has completed a couple of years of university
he's out of daycare
that
i was working full-time when he was born
i was very lucky because i was a college professor
i was able to
it was walking distance from my apartment
i went up there
i sort of left him with a neighbor
i left him in a carry cot when he was very little
i said he doesn't need anything except look at him if he cries
don't pick him up and this sort of stuff
i was gone only an hour at a stretch or an hour and a half
that's wonderful
i was able to get his schedule just cooperated
i guess because of your profession
i'm in corporate communications
i've done free-lance writing in the past
what we're hoping is that
my husband thinks i can do it
i've just never worked out of a domestic base
i've always been in a corporate environment
i'm hoping that possibly i can do something where i can go flextime or part-time
if they don't have that
i think that's th- something that couples need in going into this
i don't know
i was out of the country when my son was little
the thing is if you have this flextime and that you might be able to do something similar to what i did
which is be there short times
later on when he was
this
we're talking about i went back to work or taught some classes a week after he was born
my goodness
that's when i was saying don't pick him up and stuff
then later what i did was i brought a woman into the house
she was supposed to help me a little bit with cooking and doing the baby's laundry and this sort of stuff
i also came home and sort of was able to see from a distance what she was doing
in a sense she carried him around a lot too much for my taste
it was constantly i don't want him
he might hurt himself
in a sense you see what i'm saying though
from a mother's standpoint in a way it was quote and unquote good objectivity
what he learned to do by the time he was two or so he would sit next to the desk where i was grading papers or writing lesson plans
he had asked for a paper and sort of scribble
he realized that there were quiet times
there were active times
he also learned that there were times that you had to be gone so you probably minimized
we're getting ready
you're far enough away now i can tell you
that's just
as in what twenty twenty we're real excited because we've just developed a contact
it's private
it's hospital
we're just very excited
what's the word i'm looking for
when you deal with issues like that in terms of family building through adoption and then you have people responding to you if you go through that why would you put them in daycare
that's silly
issues are being raised prematurely in my mind
i guess they're not because it's something i'll have to deal with sooner than later
what i've learned to do is just tune out everybody's opinion
i feel that if the child is healthy and as long as we make it feel secure i'd love to do something like with what you did
i don't think i could be dumper where i could take it from eight in the morning till nine at night or six at night and leave it there
maybe after two or three years old
i don't know
your kids need you
they need a schedule i think
what country were you in europe when you were
that's the same thing
i don't know how they are there
in eastern europe
it just seems the united states does not provide for either child care or elder care as i call it
we're just not set up for that
with the
i was just going to say i guess my sensitivities are much more with the to be at home
i had my grandmother with me from the time she was ninety-two until she died at ninety-seven
i think that's wonderful
that was recently after my son
yes
she was at home alone some of the time
still it was much better than being shipped to a daycare center
which is much my
i think we're too much towards it's somebody problem
shove them in some school for twelve hours a day
i agree with that
that's why i y-
you can probably empathize with this
in terms of what to do
i just don't think there is a good daycare system
my company i'm particularly fortunate that they're in tune with that
i've been at companies where the trend is or the definite mood is we made conscious decisions not to have children
that's sad
a couple like us building through adoption there it's almost radical to some people
what you just learn to do is tune everybody else out
i respect there are some women that i know that are divorced or on their own or in single parenting and men that they may have the need for child care like that
i agree with you that it's just i call it dumping
i think that certainly there is a role for this type of help
as long as one can supervise it and make it work into one's own schedule without it seeming like dumping or giving it the whole job to somebody else to take care of
it's in tandem then
i just
there are trade-offs too i think
one of the things that is a problem is in terms of compensation to some of the child care providers
it's just it's so low
yet the overall cost for somebody doing it on a daily or even a weekly basis it's prohibitive
some people that are not making more than twenty thousand a year
there seems to be an alternative in my neighborhood
is there are several mothers who stay home
they take
they take care of another child
i could name five or six people around my neighborhood that really do a good job on this
you might want to stay home one year
some other lady might want to stay home for a few years
my neighbor has an eighteen month old
she's at home part-time paralegal
i'm thinking
we get along fantastically
i'm thinking
that's the way you have to
is child care or that type of idea completely foreign to them
actually there was a daycare center where my son did go for a year
then he actually started kindergarten at age three
it wasn't like prekindergarten
he was ready to go to school at that point
they do have such facilities
for the most part with the extended family you can usually find somebody which is much like our neighbor sharing responsibility
also there aren't that many women who work
there was just a very big series about moslem women
there were enlightening things that broke some of my stereotypical thoughts
i was just real curious when you said middle east if you didn't mind me asking
i didn't mean israel
you assumed right
even if you did that's okay actually
at first thought when i said that not many people work i'm thinking she's going to because certainly in israel the women do work
my father came in right after world war two
he was too old
you were too young right
the one guy i worked with down in austin hated it
he was a lineman down there
while he was there he caught some kind of a strange disease
all his hair fell out
he had a hundred and five fever for a while
None
what about long lasting effects on him
i have talked with a number of vietnam veterans
i had no one directly related to me involved
my sister's husband was in vietnam
it really made a completely different man out of him
then another friend of mine went
he was in combat
he came back
he said okay that is it that is behind me i am going on with my life
he was a vietnam war veteran
he was in the navy though
most of the folks that i have met that were actually on the land or in combat still carry a lot of anger
i really do not think that we did those young men right
i think that desert storm
the armed forces did so much to agent orange
even now they take a free hand as far as medicine and how they treat the war casualties
or it is hanging by a thread they still can't put it back together now
what they do afterwards and how they rehabilitate you
one of the most troublesome things that i have encountered as a result is the incredible influx of southeast asians into this country since that conflict
not so
there is just such a surge of southeast asians
it has affected the culture of this country
it's about nine or ten percent now
the culture is changing
even ten years ago there were not that many
a lot of shops are operated by southeast asians
tends to cause our kids to really have to buckle down to keep up with them which is not bad
it might in the long run you can see where scholarships for example
even jobs jobs that would normally go to an american with a lesser education might be going to some of these people here
that is all a result of vietnam
you see a lot of men that were over there brought families back
it concerns me that there is probably a lot of mixed breed youngsters still there
i would be concerned or interested to find out how they are doing now
they are probably not doing very well at all
i know there is still people even in the dallas area
there are still people trying to get some member of their family back from vietnam
native vietnamese people
they were lost when they were little
they never did get back
i had not
that had not occurred to me
as is really a big waste because they didn't win
it spilled over into now i can't even think of the country
all they did is run and hide
they were not really fighting
it would have been the same as desert storm if all they had been fighting was north vietnam
i am not even sure who was involved more whether it was china or russia
they were pouring weapons in there and digging tunnels for them
there is no way that they could ever catch them
i think the terrain had a lot to do with the success of desert storm as opposed to that in vietnam
there is incredible cover in vietnam
you can't find much cover
they try to camouflage the top
i think even now and in vietnam they could probably have done a better job
None
the corps of engineers i think do a better job now like they did in desert storm
they had
he dug a bunch of moats and filled them with oil he set a lot of booby traps all along the way as they went
they had to blow them up or disarm them
they had to fill in little bridges all the way where he had made those moats
when you get into trouble like that in a place like vietnam you do tend to analyze the problems that you get into
you say never more
you overcome those problems
you are prepared next time
i think that is one of the reasons they have pretty much avoided getting involved in south america
look what happened when they were looking for noriega
they lost him for four hours when they were right on top of him
i know that
they lost a whole lot of the life they might have had
being entirely different people
they really need
everybody that has stood there
you stand there with a rifle and blow a piece of somebody apart
that has to affect you if you are human
i can't
they had to work all that anger out and the nightmares that come along with it
i do not really think that anybody can ever forget that
they can reason and try to adjust to why they were there
you see that is what the veterans are so angry about now
they say we're
that does not undo the ones that were done
that is what makes the veterans angry
i cannot blame them
i sure cannot blame them for being angry
on the other hand you can be angry about something for a very long time
you can say that is the way it is and go on with your life
it did
that was in the era when kennedy was president that they were afraid of everything
they initially got into it because of eisenhower
he did not want to be in it any more than what we started out in august with desert storm
it just blew up into the war
it has been that way for a very very long time though
that was many years ago
the asians historically have always had these kinds of wars going on
there has not been a lot of peace in that part of the world
i do not know
we should not have maybe gotten involved
if we did we certainly should have supported our people who were there
i am afraid that they were treated as castaways for the most part
i saw the movie
i think it did a good job depicting the temperament of the times
more than apocalypse now
dudley have we pretty well discussed the subject
i think so
my fianc3e works for the computers for the government
that's how he got it
who do you work for
you don't have any benefits at all to talk about
in interviewing have you ever discussed benefits with some of the potential employers
you normally just try to sell them on your aptitude and not how much vacation do i get
i'll tell you a little bit about what t i has as benefits
we do have
although they're tending to try to really cut costs more and more what they started with a few years ago is that they only would allow you to go to set hospitals in the area
they're hospitals that they're agreeing with t i that they'll be a certain rate for rooms and care and all that kind of stuff to keep costs down
it's almost like an h m o kind of thing that only certain doctors are you going to be allowed to go to and get the full coverage
we have some dental coverage now
you have to pay a little more to really get something worthwhile
if you didn't have the extra dental plus you only get like a third of your cost which can be kind of expensive with a crown
i pay
we do have pension although i've realized recently that the pension doesn't seem to be too good
i know when you first start out working you're not thinking about that
i like to think about that
we do have a new thing that they've started a few years ago
t i meets you half way up to a certain maximum
i put in a dollar they put in fifty cents
that grows pretty good
i think that will be more of something i can see of a pension than the regular pension plan
that's not always a real for sure kind of thing
especially with this one it kind of goes up and down
you hate to have it fluctuate
last year it was forty dollars a share
now this year it's thirty six dollars a share
you go i'm losing money
we ge- vacation normally after you're here for six months
you start to get five days every six months is kind of how they accrue it to you
it's one nice thing about t i is after you've been here for five years
that's nice
we get decent holidays
at thanksgiving we always get the two days off which is nice to make a nice long weekend
at christmas we always get two days at christmas
that's nice so you always get two days at christmas
a lot of people just take that week
i normally take that week somehow
you get the whole week at christmas time
i can just tell you like
there's twelve kids in my family
the dental was very important to my dad
i think they took the dental away now
None
it's just another telephone network
they took the dental away
now i think they're going to start getting into eye
i think
i think sometime last year or just recently they started to give some kind of eye coverage
you get discounts on glasses
i'm not quite sure there's certain places you can go to that have discounts for people that work here
you can get glasses and contacts and stuff through those particular stores or something like that
now for his pension he pretty much just has the stock
my fianc3e
like if he puts in a dollar they'll put in a dollar
he's only allowed i think i don't know if it's maybe five percent or something like that that he's allowed to put in
they'll match it
he works for the
he works for them
that's where he works
his vacation is really nice
he'll be getting three weeks vacation
of course it's for the government
he has all the holidays off
you get some extra ones
you get columbus day and veterans day
he seems to be very happy
he has all that
with his doctors and stuff they have a list of doctors that the employees can go to
it only costs a dollar as long as they go to that doctor
i think it works the same way with his prescriptions and stuff if he needs any
you have to go to certain ones
still that works out really nice
it
we're doing an h m o right now
when we go to get prescriptions it's five dollars
sometimes when you go the prescription
like my husband always takes which is kind of like contact stuff only better
that's a buck a capsule
if you've got thirty in there it normally comes out to about thirty-four dollars so when you pay five it's a pretty good savings
then there's other times that maybe the prescription wouldn't cost more than seven or eight dollars
you pay five anyhow
it isn't a
whether or not we like nursing homes
my grandmother owned and operated a nursing home for years
her mother
you are kidding
my mother also owned and operated a nursing home
and then went on back to school and became the director of nurses at a nursing home
my mother and my older sister both are geriatric nurses
for heaven's sake
i do know something
the motivation for grandmother entering the business
she needed company
opened a nursing home and initially started with eight ladies
it grew into a
then they
that is a nice attitude to go into
it seems like they must be waiting until it is a necessity there is no chance of good companionship or doing anything
that is not really true either
i think that is a stigma and an impression that has come from some few bad experiences
those who had bad experiences talk about them
those who do not may write
they do not talk a whole lot about that
what i mean is instead of maybe entering a nursing home
maybe other friends they wait until they are unable
that is because they wait until the children make those choices
she works for one here in dallas which is more a retirement village than it is a nursing home
these
i love watching these elderly people come they will come and tell her i am going for my
would you call down and have the van come around and take
they are very active and very enthusiastic
they have
or one of the lovely cafeterias
they have pink linen napkins for their dinners
i am certainly very much for a nursing home
i think when the parent gets old enough
if they could get this idea across though better than what it is
now my daddy's mother lived in a retirement village
she and her sister had side by side duplexes
they were there close
they did have the button that you could push the central office if you got into problems
they have security
you have that with anything
i would be willing to bet they are far less abused in a nursing home than they are in
we used our nursing home as
like when my sister was real bad before she died we took her the last month and a half
they were super with her
they were
now my grandmother
of course all of my folks lived to be very old my grandmother developed hodgkin's disease
when she was in her late seventies
a lot of people do that
yet it is not
it can become home to them
it depends upon the individual
we have had excellent experience with that
i did not put my husband in a nursing home when he became ill
i might like to be
i would like
i think you would shop for a nursing home just like you would shop for a church
do the best job you could in choosing one
you do not have the time to look
i have a cousin who is
he did fine
she made arrangements so that when she was gone
she did not want her other children burdened with his care
she has made arrangements that when she was gone that he would go into the nursing home
he adjusted very well
he has been there quite a long time
he don't know me usually
he goes wheeling down the hall to bingo
he has adjusted very well
one of the things i think that is most desirable for the elderly is routine
the only real problem with that in a nursing home is that the staff turns over
to get the dedication
that is sad because i think the health profession is one of the most critical
for some reason people resist the fact that they should be paid as well as businesses and that type of thing
i cannot imagine a more costly and a more better area to invest
there seems to be a resistance
as a matter of fact i do not see why they do not have children's programs in nursing homes
around here we have some the churches
take the children
this
i've probably personally take just two okay
that's because my mother-in-law takes every one they print and gives them to me
i get all of them
the one that i really especially enjoy
you may be familiar with it from wisconsin is called country
yes
i get that it has recipes in it
that's my very favorite
that's great
i actually take country living
it's a country magazine on house beautiful because i like that kind of stuff
decorating and getting ideas for a garden
in fact right before you called i was planning my tulips and putting them on blue print on where i'm going to put them
i'm really into that
i really get into magazines that are kind of basically into housing type things be decorating and gardening and recipes that kind of stuff
i'm pretty much in the same category as what you're looking at
we tried for a while to take a news magazine
we took newsweek i think we took it especially just during the war to kind of catch up on everything and have it be digested
we've kind of discontinued that right now we're going to start taking that u s news newspaper u s a today
i think with that what happens is it's interesting to read you kind of just put the magazine away
you never read it again unless there's some big article in there that you're going to keep for your kids
we saved the ones from the war and one from the earthquake
it sounds exactly like what we did we just saved everything we could for our daughter
that's pretty similar
you sound like you
i find that with these country magazines i keep going back to them getting ideas looking back and saying there was a flower garden in there that i would like to have some ideas i get a lot of ideas from them
you're right the leaves are beautiful
they are falling now
it just peaked last week
it was just gorgeous out here
the other thing about magazines the only thing i don't like is they really get heavily into advertising
it's fine
i'd rather almost have i know that part probably half their money comes from these people that are saying put my ad in your paper and i'll pay you or whatever
there's been some magazines i've looked at
it's a real turn off to see every other page
i think i opened vogue the other day or something it was just nothing uh-huh
i thought why buy this
what's the point
it's almost you could go into a store and get bombarded the same way
my number one pet peeve in a magazine is when they put the perfume in it because real often i don't like very heavy perfumes very often like in my bills also magazines and bills and they'll
pretty much like i said the magazines i've had better homes and garden
now i need a switch
i'm going back to gourmet cooking because i've had the magazine before back in nineteen eighty-six
i thought i'll give it a try again because you get tired of one magazine
you need to try a change
do you tear out of your magazines your recipes
do you keep it
and most of the time i tear them out
a lot of times if i got a chance to sit down at my typewriter i'll go ahead and type out recipes
what i usually do is i'll try it out in the magazine first and without tearing it out and then give it a
if we like it it becomes part of the recipe collection
that's a good idea
i'm going to pay attention more when i'm in the store to that country living i remember seeing the cover
back when i decorated the house with a lot of the little country primitive things the little pigs and the ducks and that that was the big rage here couple of years ago
i bought a lot of the country magazines it seems like when i put some of that away i quit buying it
i had forgotten the recipes i'm going to
that's what i just went through we just recently moved from minnesota to wisconsin
you don't want to part with any of them because there's one thing in each one
that's good
i ended up reducing them down to fifteen magazines out of hundreds
i just said there's one picture in there that
it really doesn't it's got to have more than that it's got to have some good ideas it's got to have everything
i just kind of went through
i find that most of the magazines i really like is around christmas time because
i know
basically i can tell you that i like just about every music there is except for real hard hard rock
i go from classical all the way to jazz and country and soft pop
i pretty much have a wide range of what i like
there isn't any particular music that i enjoy more than just listening to all kinds that's about it
it's pretty neat music that they came out with
there's certain types of country western i can't handle that twangy stuff
the old old stuff that came out i think it was hank williams
other than that i like pretty much everything
other than
lately with the new music that has come out some of the really good music they have the saxophone playing
it's so funny because you can take an instrument and forget what it really sounds like when it plays by itself
i can pretty much
it's all wet tiana
she slipped
yeah
i don't have interest of losing my ears
he said he's lost most of his hearing
it was good talking to you then
same here
scott let's talk about advice that we can offer a parent where the child is going to go to a university
i have some children
they're all quite young we want to plan for their education
we're saving right now
we're getting bonds and hopefully finances set aside so that they can choose a college that they want to
i'm in graduate school right now
in fact i'm selecting again for my p h d
it's a close subject right now
what do you use as a basis to determine which college or university you go to
for undergraduate my criteria were much different than for graduate school
when i wanted to go to an undergraduate institution i was looking for something that was rather small and easy to get around
i got to where i wanted to
that's good because i did quite a bit the same thing in my undergraduate work
i wanted to get a school that was small enough that was personable that you didn't have a lecture hall with about fifteen other students competing for the professor's attention i felt that i got a pretty good undergraduate
where did you go
i went to utah state university which is in logan utah the nice thing about it too is i knew that i wanted to get into business and that their college of business was accredited
known at least there in the state of utah and around the surrounding states and so forth
i feel like number one you also need to see what kind of name the
like you mentioned before the name the college and university can give you and another reason why i chose that was the finances
i wanted to make sure that i would be able to afford it that i wouldn't get through three years of the undergraduate work and have to leave
i did a lot of talking with friends with family with counselors at high school and also read some books on the subject at the library
it was kind of unusual because my two older brothers and i all went to three different universities depending on what our choice was
i felt very comfortable and good about that
do you worry any about being able
obviously you've taken precautions or measures to try and pay for your children's education
do you think that that's going to be enough
the way that tuition is increasing exponentially
all i can hope for is that i land a professorship at a nice heavy university
that's an excellent idea
one thing that we did and my parents and our family is that we weren't able to afford the kind of education that we all desired
my parents stressed that we get excellent grades so that we apply and try for scholarships scholarships were very beneficial in my case to help pay for my education because my parents couldn't
what the scholarship could not supply i was able to work for and save and get
also my brother he's a medical doctor right now
he had to
he's working to pay those off
i think that once you get past the initial stages of it that there's different options you can use
the student loans are good options
that's
as you're well aware that tuition's not
what do you think about a year or two of public service
i know it's hard for young people to think about giving up their carefree years people that i have known that have done that like from other countries especially
from germany and finland they have such a better more mature outlook on life
i think they're better people because of it
i know the church that i go to the young men give two years of their life when they turn nineteen
i really believe that the people that do that are better people that make our
i really agree with you
though i've never done that myself i was a basically an education major when i graduated from college
i accepted a job that at the time was just slightly above the poverty level to teach to very rural children in a very low income district
i spent a year teaching there i think it was probably one of my largest eye-opening experiences because i come from nice middle class white suburban home i did it for one reason i wanted
i wanted to stay close to where i was working on a masters degree but also because i just thought that it would be interesting to live some place else so totally different than my own up bringing i
it probably changed my political views
it changed my understanding of the world around me i think in fact if i had to do it all again i
after that you never think of it i guess because i paid for all of my college education myself i never thought about doing that because i had all these college loans i'd started paying back
so that was one reason why i never considered it
now that i'm further along and i'm still paying these college loans
i think realistically you can have your college loans delayed now because i had them delayed because i'm back in graduate school at thirty years old
i had them delayed because i'm back in graduate school and on that form it says if your joining the peace corps you can have them delayed i thought that was very interesting
i would have thought of that earlier
i probably would have done just like is that the mormon church
one of my neighbors did that in pittsburgh from pittsburgh
i thought that really
i think it would have been a very good experience for me
i think so
in a time after high school there's kind of a selfishness
teenagers in our country are kind of a year that parents don't look forward to and things like that
i think that it would help people to become
and to be more responsible when you're out on your own
i think we have such a need now
i taught
i think i was paid about nine thousand dollars to teach for the year i worked in a very rural school district
one of the things i taught was a computer class these kids every girl i taught except for one was pregnant
they were high school juniors
i just
there they came from poverty
it was the school district couldn't hire many people
i think in the sense that aspect of public service for education in some of the inner cities for just social workers in some of the inner cities and some of the rural areas where they just need advice on medical things
i never
i tell you sometimes i worry about things over seas because we have such problems right here in our own country
it would really
i don't
the people that i've known like from germany and finland that have done that they do military service which
still they have benefited from it
although i wouldn't want it to make people to go off to the military voluntarily
it has helped them
they are just a lot more mature
i know that my first couple of years of college were probably too carefree at the
at the end i had to be too serious
that's right
they just get so excited to be away from home
they do a lot of things to themselves that we really don't want our young people to be doing
i think this was a very interesting topic because it's something that we don't talk about in this country probably enough
None
we love our freedom and our freedom of choice and having people
our
like in our church it is your free to do that or not you're encouraged to do it because it helps you
of course we think it's helping other people
i think it is
i think people
i
i spend a lot of my time teaching college students i find great disgust in them in
they don't understand how other people live
they're preoccupied with
i think that's just having a good time
he always refers to it as short-term pleasure oriented
everything has to be an immediate reward
it has to be fun
i don't know how that would ever happen here
at least
they say
i think i have read recently that the bush administration has increased the funding for the peace corps
i guess because of the changes in eastern europe they've increased funding for the peace corps
i guess it's some of the peace dividend in the sense
some of the are the overseas programs
i have seen a big change i think in high school kids that my relatives
and friends that i know when i was in high school i had an idea of what i really wanted to do with what i was going to study
at least i had some interest in
a lot of the youth that i come in contact with they say i want to be a doctor i want to be a lawyer
they make a lot of money
they don't have a goal
how many
i guess i live near washington being in baltimore it's something like one in four people
i just sort of think that's ridiculous
with the great needs that we need today in science and biology and the problems we have with aids and cancer and how come everybody is a lawyer
not enough people want to do that for because of a service that they could provide
if you want to be a lawyer because you know that you can provide a service that people need because you have to have lawyers in this country but if you're just doing it because you think that's the best way to
i guess i better go
good luck to you
thank you very much
let's see
were we right in the middle east
i think what we did was good
i think we just should have stayed there longer and continued doing what we did do
you agree with schwartzkopf who says drive on into baghdad
it's almost like they're killing each other off
there is not going to be anything left of iraq at all
i don't think it would be good if we were to completely lose it
i just mean that the world in general
we've got to talk so it's just as well we argue
i don't know
i think we should have helped the innocent people in iraq out a little bit more
rather than just quitting where we did
i think that's almost impossible next to impossible
other political things that's going on
i heard president bush say that he wanted to improve the highways
i haven't really been keeping up with them
i really don't know what he said
he wanted to take the current secondary highway system and turn it into interstates like the rest of the country
wouldn't it be wonderful
i dropped the phone
okay
out here in the west a lot of our secondary roads are fifty-five we drive sixty-five
i last weekend went home to visit my parents
between here and west texas there was probably three and four hours at sixty-five miles an hour
i didn't realize that
you've never
i never seen the great
i'm a student
i'm paying for my own education
i come from a large family
we're never able to take vacations because there's twelve kids in the family
my college educa- thirty-six
virtually nothing else
i got my b s in general science
anyway i know nothing other than the west
in fact down in east texas where the company's located there's streams and water and things i don't understand trees and the gulf
it's really interesting
tell me about where you live
i'm originally from butler
that's about an hour away from where i am now
it's pretty windy and hilly
how high is the highest elevation
i couldn't even tell you
probably three thousand feet
i don't even know
right here in colorado springs where i live it's over six thousand foot
None
when i lived in texas every year i had to drive
i could have a feast of fresh seafood six eight twelve hours away
just for fresh
i'm really interested in the basic concept differences between west and east coast and the central parts of america
the farthest away from home
now when i was growing up in the panhandle of texas
look at your map later and see the town of amarillo fifty miles north of that up in the panhandle
my gosh
people buy jeans in town
we thought nothing at all of waking up in the morning hopping into your car grabbing the fishing poles and driving four hours
for me that's a long ways
even i'm in a little town right now
butler is about an hour north east of pittsburgh
that will give you some idea of where i'm at
i'm about two hours north east of pittsburgh
just this little town here is basically a college town
without the college here this town would be nothing
it's completely made up of fast food restaurants
in the summer when we co-
there's just no one around
are you working your way through college
i go home in the summer
i work in the summer
between what i make in the summer and student loans that's how i go to college
how neat
that's interesting
what do you plan to do with it
like i said my fiancee
savings and loans
my fiancee works down in d c
i'd actually like to work for a company rather than a bank or something
i'd rather work for a company and be their financial advisor or something
that would be great
let's see we're all excited in colorado springs
the new employer is in the city
we're expecting our local economy to
maybe not a boom but at least recover to where we can all hold regular forty hour jobs still
what would be the unemployment rate out there
unemployment runs approximately six percent
that's what it is here too
now under employment i would suspect to run closer to eighteen or twenty percent
the problem is that there are no good permanent full time jobs for people without a technical four year degree
they have a job that has nothing to do
i have five children all together
my oldest two are already out and about in the world
i have a set of twins that are fourteen my youngest is twelve
at any rate my first two children i didn't spend a whole lot of time with them
worked about fifty-one hours a week because i
i didn't get to spend as much time with them as i should have as i really wanted to
it was with all of them
it was more an impact i think on the oldest two
i don't think they noticed i wasn't around that much
with all the children around the house it's
i came out and was making as much money forty hours a week as i did fifty-one hours
i've tried to spend more time with the children since then
what i'm currently doing is taking a lot of time
we just started a thing where every other week we go to movies
every couple of weeks we will go to the movies because that's how often they change the
it's working out pretty well
we're spending more time together
in fact i found that i'm a lot closer with
i don't even know where he's at
he's taken off for parts unknown
yeah
my daughter
it's been difficult to try to find the time
i think it's important that we do because
i noticed parents not spending time with their
children and going out and doing things
i knew the kids next door were all into cocaine
it just
it was bad enough every place else
drugs in texas are extremely bad
i think it's kind of important that i nurture the relationship i have with my children now
i'm doing my best to keep that up
that's all you can do
what's been your experience
i was going to ask too does your wife work
she didn't up until the last six months
she worked a job until we moved to our new house
she quit that job because it was too inconvenient
she starts a new job tomorrow which should take her out of the house about four days a week
that sounds great
ours are all out of the nest
when they were growing up probably we had a lot of similar things like you had having the time
we're very active of course at church and boy scouting and girl scouts four h
those activities helped a lot in
we try to take a vacation with them every year camping of some sort something that wasn't expensive
our youngest is expecting her first baby
they're all out and on their own
we have one to get married yet
they'll all be married
they're all doing pretty good
one like i said lives in around maryland d c
one lives in connecticut
our baby lives just a mile over the hill
so we'll get to see her a little more than what we do the other ones
i've noticed another thing
he worked a full-time job and a part-time job
i never saw him
i didn't have much of a role model to go by
know to learn how to be a father and
i can't ever remember playing ball with my dad or
that does make a big difference
everybody's not father knows best
none of us are
we're not none of us like they portray it on those shows
mean the capability to create children doesn't necessarily mean you have the the mental capacity to raise them
our daughter she's our second oldest she's the only other one that has children
she works full time
i have mixed feelings about that
i don't know if she'd be happy to stay at home
yet on the other hand i've got the mixed feelings that i think you should be at home with your children
they seem to give quality time to those children when they are together
None
i don't know
i don't think i ever would have had what it would take to work full time and raise a family
it's not easy
i've helped out extremely
i can't say
i've helped out
as you know with five children it takes a lot of work
now i work for texas instruments
i'm in computers
a lot of the people i've talked to work for for the same
i've
prior to that i worked in a food store
wor-
it was a smart move to make
every time something new came up i was explaining it to them
you recognized this and
was able to
i started back to school
that's why i
if you're working if you're taking twelve credits at night and you're working fifty-one hours a week there's not much time left to spend with
it puts a strain on everybody your wife and your family
the only thing you can remember is to
because it's very easy to go your own direction when you're working so hard and going to school too
it all paid off
that's wonderful
i got my degree and got the better paying job
i think as a family we're a lot better off
it sounds to me like you're doing well
he's been retired for three years now
my goal is to try to retire by the time i'm fifty-five
he made it at fifty
he went at fifty
he still works part time at other thing same job as he was doing only he's retired and doing it independently
but nevertheless retired
did you want to go first then
i can
i don't own my home
i rent my home
we aren't sure we're going to buy a house yet because we don't know if we're going to be staying here
in texas
i think as far as our home it's in a small residential area
it's kind of more of a country setting
it's nothing
it's just a typical home with three bedrooms two story type home
i think as far as if it's for put it into standards of what other homes are around here it would be just about fitting right into the middle part of where the homes are
there's a river across from us which has more elaborate homes
where we can view the river from that distance there's still homes within our area that are pretty typical of what our home is
it's pretty much that type of home
our house we're renting it from an individual who bought it
he lives in korea
he's owns eight or nine properties near here
the houses around here there's five houses on my street for sale right now
which is just in trouble
they're not very expensive either
we
it's the rambler style
we have two living areas and a dining room and a big kitchen
one of our bedrooms is really small
we've made that into a den because we only have one child
that was our best way of going with the small bedrooms because they are making bedrooms smaller and smaller
None
that sounds great
i don't know if we need to talk any more or whatever
have you done this before
about three times before
have you
i've gotten several calls
None
i don't have to wait until somebody calls me even though i have a feeling what's going to happen is i'll probably get tons of calls sooner or later
i've talked to some people from cleveland
i did talk to someone else who lives here in the same city i do
that was kind of interesting
they're sure getting their people out
it was nice to talk to you anyway
you take it easy gail
for as far as i would think probably the worst substance that's probably
started to say the
what causes the most air pollution is probably the car whether or not they'll ever get into huge transit systems into big cities where people would all travel on a high speed train
that's what we're finding here where we're at in minneapolis area is that people don't want to carpool that there are inconveniences to that
maybe you don't like the person you would want to carpool with that kind of thing
it's kind of a thing where i think the majority of the people do not carpool
i'm in texas very few people carpool the people that i know don't want to because they never know for sure what time they're going to leave their job they never know when they want to run out and do an errand at noon
if somebody gets sick and it's not the other person and they want to go home and that one person's got the car then they're stuck
people don't want to give it up now i think we've made great strides in changing a lot of that by going to the unleaded gasoline
other than that i don't know
my other line is ringing we're going to ignore it
close to five minutes i believe
five minutes okay
you're in minneapolis
is the pollution really bad up there
no
we have quite a bit
those are natural there is starting to
they just put in a strict law that as of every year when you get your license tabs you have to have your car inspected to see if it's releasing any lead into the air or other pollutants
if that's the case then you have to get your car fixed
that's the way it has gotten here
we have just had that law i think about a year maybe a year and a half here in texas i think it's a good idea because a lot of people still want to drive the older cars which you can't blame them for that if they are polluting the air they do need to have them fixed there's a big move especially in the industrial part in texas right now of controlling the c f c that the big manufacturing companies are producing into the air they're having to change the type of products they use they can't use
i have a friend that's in the air conditioning heating business they have to pay a penalty for every ounce or pound of this certain type of freon that they use in the air conditioning systems therefore the individual every time they have a service call if they have an old unit that's still using this twenty-two freon or whatever it costs them three times as much to get it fixed if you have a new high efficiency system that uses the new type of freons that do not release as many c f c into the atmosphere it doesn't cost as much so eventually people are going to have to go to newer systems
sure the other thing when you're talking about freon with cars air conditioning i'm sure over there it's a necessity versus something up here we can live without it
it's uncomfortable this year my husband recharged our freon because it needed to be done
one of the cans
i don't know if there was something wrong with it or his directions weren't quite fully instructed onto that
i was thinking how many other people sure
if you take it into a service station
they want to charge you forty dollars just for freon which only costs you about three dollars i have this feeling that freon probably will increase in price because it is something that people will have to take into consideration and say that's right there
i think it's like three or four dollars a can it takes about four to five cans to fill up a air conditioning unit in a car
i thought about that
my husband even was kind of woozy after that because i'm sure he breathed it
of course in the
i just think the way that things are going that it would be good for young people to go ahead and dedicate themselves to at least something
i know the mormon religion they require two years of missionary service right
i think it would be good for all young people to be able to do something like that so that i just feel it would be good for them to do that
i thought it would be good too
i did not think it would be good that they all do something like the peace corps because not all young people would have what it takes to go like that because i think it takes a certain person to be able to do something like that
there's a lot of other public service things that could be done
even in our home towns there's a lot of public service things that they could do drug rehabilitation and alcohol and just helping old people and helping cripple just helping somebody else i think that art of giving is something that we don't have very much any more
are they actually
why did they call it a proposal
i think they just gave it a title is this not something that's in legislation or in work some yeah
it's just a topic
there's so many kids who have so much money and so much free time and nothing to do and nothing to give their time to
they don't even have a direction to give their time to
i think it would be really good for people to be able to give their time in some kind of public service even in our government as aids to congress people yeah
it'd be really good i think
people that have received sentences in jail they have to go out and do public service activities which to me is good
this is something that is it's character building learning how to give to others and being less selfish
i think sometimes it gives you a better picture of what some of the other people live like what some of the other parts of the world are like or even other parts of the neighborhood some of the people how they live
i agree with you
i think young people are so focused just on themselves and their activities and whose going out with whom et cetera that to get a taste of what the real world is actually about doing that public service would be great
that's one thing that's hard with young people you can't tell them how things are they have to see for themselves now of course this might be after they've gone through their teen years
i would think so like right after high school even if it was that summer right after high school three months
of course they've already gone through the period of time where they need more direction their teenage years and that they really sometimes need a little better direction to go and something
course now peace corps that couldn't be done of course until they were done with school
something that was outside of school yeah
right after you graduate from high school because a lot of people are just gee whiz what do i do now if they're not focused on going to college
having that gung ho plan that's setting their life goals
to me that would be the greatest time for teenagers to do that would be right after they graduated from high school
as for its being required
like i said now all young people should be able to do something
not all certainly would be geared to even the mormon boys that go out not all of them go
it's disaster if they don't go
some of them are not
they're just not made to do that type of thing they just aren't able to do it
yeah
like i said requiring it would be
what's things that you look for when you go out to dinner
i just like a nice quiet nice atmosphere and of course good food
that sounds pretty
that's always a concern but just a nice quiet easy place maybe candlelight something just to relax because i don't really go out to dinner that much
we don't go out to dinner that much either
we try to get out maybe once every month and a half or something like that
i definitely want to go to a place that's nice and clean
i've been to some that's been terrible
you see cockroaches crawling around and
i try to get one that's nice and clean
i like good food and good service
where you don't feel rushed you can just relax and stay as long as you want
is there some nice places to go to eat in plano
we have quite a bit between us and there
it's about ten miles there is all kinds of restaurants
i had one that was a favorite for a long time
it changed hands and doubled the prices
it finally went out of business
it was really nice
that sounds beautiful
you could just really relax there and enjoy it
it's gone
we have
we have only one restaurant that's kind of nice
they have prime rib on weekends they have about six miles from here is called a little city called wesley
they have a wesley hotel there that they serve food
the atmosphere there is really really nice
that's nice
if we really want to something different we go to modesto which is like twenty minutes away
we don't have any fast foods here in this small city
i have a son
he's grown up
i have a twelve year old that would eat a happy meal every night
now's she's graduated to two cheeseburgers
mcdonald's is definitely at the top of her list
i hate these places
all the kids seem to love mcdonald's don't they
i don't think there's an ounce of
we have all kinds of fast foods everywhere around it's tempting when you come home from work
you're tired
you just are tempted to give in to that
it costs a lot of money to do it too
it adds up
it's not healthy
i really got into that habit for a while
i got out of it again because i just felt like it was just too unhealthy
let's see what else can we talk about
it's foggy and cold here
i came from iowa when i was sixteen i've lived out in california for a long long time
you like it
we used to have a lot more restaurants to go to there
then i quit work and everything
i bought a house
that would be fun
right in chinatown so we went to lots of chinese restaurants
they were really good
i really miss them
i just like to go in there and have a nice chinese dinner once in a while
as far as missing living there no
it's close enough if i wanted to go there to san francisco for dinner or something why an hour and fifteen minutes we could be there and have dinner and then come on back
have you ever been to california
i have a twenty-one year old daughter in college there she is a world champion twirler her coach is in california
she went there for six years
i went out a lot with her
yeah
i love it
we tug back and forth who's going to move
i think he's going to move because i'm the person with more to lose here
i have my twelve year old in school she's happy
i have my house
i have too much to lose
i have to admit that we just moved to plano recently and that i hadn't voted in an election yet
although i did go down and register and i
what's been your voting experience
i
personally i've been very diligent until recent years
for the issues
i also feel guilty not knowing and not going the extra mile myself and studying out the issues and studying out the candidates
i have felt since i've been here that i haven't known what the issues were because it was a new community
you really do have to study to get yourself up to par with what is truly going on that takes a lot of research
people today are very busy
that is an excuse because we are always invo-
i know i'm heavily involved in other things to take time out and study the issues in depth would take quite a bit of time i don't have the time to devote to that you hopefully find you want the candidates that are running to be honest and aboveboard
unfortunately they are not
it's really a dilemma that we find ourselves in i believe
it is a task that is to me kind of overwhelming
i also feel especially in the presidential elections that since we're back on the old system of electoral votes and that your vote doesn't necessarily elect president
it's kind of
it's hard to feel like one person
i know that it's important
i feel guilty that i haven't done that here haven't taken the time
i know that people can make a difference
it's hard to face the corruption like you say and to know what you're up against
it makes me feel bad that
i am thankful for the
i hope that i will make a better difference
i haven't done that so far
i know that when you're in a smaller community
i live in mesquite when we have a local election for our mayor and so forth they really give a lot of information in the local newspaper not in the bigger city dallas newspaper
they just give it a small portion of the newspaper
the local newspaper really goes into quite a bit of history about the candidate they raise two sides
there's a pro and a con side you can really feel comfortable in evaluating that candidate by that method
i feel pretty confident about the way it's put forth
i wouldn't say that about the
they've got people that are running that are admitted criminals and admitted
i'm sorry
i don't believe in them turning a new leaf unless they have the lord that has done that to them
without the lord they can't do it
it's not very likely
it seems like th-
i believe that the voice that initialized this call asked about if we thought that it should be something that should be put into action
should the government make it universal or something like that
i would be committed to that becau-
you would be in favor of it
i know that there are many countries that are very successful with the operation of the government providing that plan
do they have options on like choices of doctors and that type of thing
i'm not sure how their program is run
i know it has been successful
i would really have to read the history of the country that has fared very well with it
i'd like to see the data on that
if you didn't have any choice in who you go to
or to change even if you didn't approve or didn't think you were getting good service
absolutely that the choice would be yours if you felt that you weren't being given the proper guidelines for your health that you should be able to make a choice there
i have a friend that their boy has been sick for several months
they just have found out what's the trouble
they have gone through one two three four five doctors and then a team of doctors
they finally determined what the problem was
the expense of that yes
that something like that i thought if you couldn't change or look elsewhere for help
i don't know how that program works if you can do that
i would think that they would have that as part of the benefit to the health care program that you would indeed have a choice that you could select that individual yourself
i'm sure that they would have a history of each doctor and hopefully that they would have their accreditations there too
i guess that's primarily was one of my thoughts because you know how government is
those guidelines have to be set up
i think they should be voted on by the public
it would
of course they would give a full plan of what their intentions would be
i think that's primary if they were going to have a universal health care plan
that they would have all the facts and the figures and what it would mean to each individual family or an individual perhaps being single
i'm not sure what else that we could address on health care other than the fact i think the eyes and the ears and the whole self should be included in all of that
dental eye care and
i wouldn't want to have to go for a private doctor for anything and not be covered by the program
i know where my son works they have an option right now where they can have their own physician
they can choose one that their company has elected that costs them less if they take the doctor that the company has selected
does he have an option if he doesn't care for the personality
only to the point that he could go to somebody at his own expense
i see
otherwise he has to take the physician and the hospital that the company has chosen as the one they have taken
there again he's gotten good service
if he's pleased with it i guess that's the bottom line
i would be afraid of what would happen if you had a personality conflict or something
there's always that opposite story there
that's the first i've really known anybody that works for somebody that they had that option to make the choice of what kind of hospitalization they wanted to take
it's quite different from when i was under doctor's care that's for sure
i'm very thankful that i'm not
we live in a rural area up here
what part of pennsylvania do you live in
are you familiar with any of the area that all
i have a brother that lives there
near philadelphia
that's a ways away
we live in clarion county
we have a cousin that lives in philadelphia
i'm a former michiganian
i suppose really our situation here is even different that it is in more populated areas as far as the doctors that are available
we've been pretty fortunate
that is the fields that are opening up are just phenomenal
look at the aids case that's a whole new field in itself
it's an auto immune deficiency it sure is a dilly one
they just don't seem to be
there's guidelines that people have to follow
if they're determined to have their cigarettes and the other carcinogenic causing items then how do you teach them
a lot of them don't do these things even
it doesn't seem to matter
it rea-
i really believe our environment have a lot to do with it
they say second hand smoke and that is worse than smoking
what do you do
you just have to ban the smoking to their little room that they want to
i haven't ever had that problem as far as that goes
i can't take any credit for not smoking even
it's a bad habit tha-
it was nice talking with you
you have a good day
you do the same
we'll be i guess talking around the country
kate where do you like to eat out
we really like the mexican food here in texas we try and go around to different mexican restaurants trying them out
tia's is probably our favorite restaurant there
i think they have one of the best services that we really like it
it's where skillman curves into forest lane it's real good mexican food
another real good one is rafael's down on mckinney avenue
that
we haven't explored too many places
lot of the big name brand i guess chains yeah
we've tried places down by the collin creek mall
the alvarez
we tried what was across the street el paso's el chico's or something
el chico's or el fenix one
something like that
i like tia's better than i do el chico's or el fenix
much better
mother mesquite's is one of our favorites
then fajitas are one of my
i like it better than just about anything they make very good fajitas there in their own homemade flour tortillas that are just absolutely wonderful
i know
i tell you what
they're excellent food
what else do you like
i love seafood i notice they have the louisiana purchase
razzoo's has opened up down close to six thirty-five
i haven't eaten there
the service has always been so strange every time i've been in there
mostly it's been at lunch time i hear at night though they have the outdoor bar
that's it's really kind of lively
it's really good all their blackened grill stuff
for the spicy we like atchafalaya's out on belt line in addison it's a good restaurant
that sounds great
for one of the best fish restaurants in town is either vincent's there in plano or i believe it's a rusty scupper over on dallas parkway in addison which is absolutely wonderful
they have every kind of fish that you could imagine you'd want the atmosphere is wonderful too
i have children and work
we can eat a lot of fast food
fast food i can understand that
we had a lot of mcdonalds when they were first coming out
i know
i'm so sick of mcdonalds
we used to eat there all the time
now we branch out at this wendy's or
and cheap too
the kids they've got those expensive tastes
they like tia's
they can sit down and all that good kind of stuff
they're just spoiled rotten
we love to eat out
we usually eat out generally two or three times a week
it's just my husband and i
it's either t v dinners at home or we go out to eat
i would much rather go out to eat than t v dinners
me too
i know that i just work
i'm just tired when i get home
i just don't feel like cooking
on the weekends there's always things to do
we like to go out to lunch on saturdays especially
we've been there twice both times the food just didn't quite settle with me i don't know what it was
now that's surprising because normally they're real good
i love
i like because even if they're crowded they're fast service
don't have to wait forever for a table
we also like owens country sausa-
i haven't been there befo-
i went to one i think in ohio or somewhere up there
i've never been to that one here
have you been to applebee's
we like applebee's
i really like that too
that was
it's fun
i like up there in plano that country steak house
i've been there twice
we go for the salad bar
i've been very lucky
i go to work early
that's nice
my mom comes over in the morning and gets her ready for her school or just hangs by while she gets ready drives her to school
i'm very very lucky
how old does a child have to be before you get to stop making arrangements for him i wonder
i could do it now
she gets lonely in the morning
i feel better
she has a crazy father out there somewhere that i just don't let her out of my sight
you never know
it's nice for them not to be alone
she feels that way
we have a neighbor on the next block that she could always walk over there and go to school with
we just feel better doing it this way
we were about to stop one day this year
her father called the school and made all kinds of threats
we didn't stop
even though she's twelve she's still a kid
you got to be careful
i'm glad you have that opportunity to have your mom
i'm glad too
i have two kids five and six a girl and a boy
so far i haven't had to make a lot of child care arrangements for them because i'm at home now full time
when i was going to school i would go to school a time that my husband when he was at home that we would just switch back and forth like that
it's really scary
i would really hate to be in a position to have to find child care
i would too because even though a place can look pretty good on the outside we're finding out now that it's not always on the inside i just don't know what i would do if i had to do that
they provide child care
of course they charge for it at least all the nurses can leave their children
they're always watching them
they feel a little better than if they dropped them off somewhere on the way
that's nice
i know that i have done some babysitting myself
i know how i felt as a provider of child care that even though you're taking care of someone else's child and you're forcing yourself to treat them equally and better usually better than your own it's not the same
that's right
it made me realize that no one will love your child as much as you and your mother
and the family
no one will look out after them
so far i think my preference would be rather than to have a big day care
what is that kinder care and things like that
it was hard to treat her equally with my child
they played together
they were good friends
you said you tend to go more for the other one's side just because you are responsible
it got hard
it just wasn't the same as when they were just playing as friends because she had to be there every day
i stopped that after a year because it was difficult to balance it
i know when i pick my kids up from school they want to come home
i would hate for them to have be picked up by a day care and be taken to another large group situation
i think my preference if i had to find day care would be a small someone that i knew
i know that some parents they both do have to work
a lot of people where i live are working just because they want bigger and better
i would never do that
i just never would do it
that's true because even now when they're gone to school it seems like there's just not enough time left over
by the time they have to eat and have homework and they want some free time
there's just not enough time in the day to do anything good quality for them
that's really
i really haven't thought about the topic of drug testing
just off the top of my head i don't think i see much wrong with it
if i owned a company and i wanted to make sure that it was run smoothly and that the people that i had coming in were trust worthy et cetera and so on i think i would probably do the random testing just to insure that my company runs safely and smoothly
i also haven't thought too much about it
i suspect it very much depends upon the job
if it's not affecting someone's performance then i'm not sure if it's a problem
if it's a position where it could potentially affect
if
if someone's working on heavy machinery
or say driving trucks or city buses or something like that
then that is something that affects the community
if you're drinking or on drugs or whatever you're driving a city bus you taking several lives in your hands
if you're a computer operator there's really no big deal
i think
for me i think that drug testing it follows the path that society is going in
it's just where society is right now
something we have to cope with
i think the drug testing is something that the drug users have to cope with
in that respect i think it may help a lot
i think it may be hopefully push people away from drug use
if they no that
of course i'm not sure what the time span is
if i used drugs last week and i had a job interview that i wouldn't use drugs the day before or something
they wouldn't even see it
i don't know what the limits are
i don't actually know how long those things stay in the system
i've heard some things will stay there for six months
you get flashbacks for forever
i guess so
there must be something
people get these little flashback things
i don't really know
i don't use any drugs
i'm pretty i guess decisive about that
if you actually used drugs at all
i'm at most a social drinker
it's never a problem
the only thing i would hate is if i were to go and
it's kind of the same thing with the lie detector test
people that
don't have anything to hide
there are some things that just aren't peoples business
that
i think that a lot of people have trouble with that
i can understand that
that's really
None
do you worry about this or that
what about the rights
they would rather have it private
especially in the case of drinking
if someone is something more than a social drinker shall we say yet they're not an alcoholic what do you do
i took a lie detector once
i didn't mind it
i was just offended by some of the questions i guess
there was one question do you like your mother
i was going
those are just
those are to get the shock value out of you
just to see
i'm a graduate student in psych
we sort of figure out
i know a little bit about that kind of stuff
what they're trying to do there is they want to sort of get a base line measure for you
how is it that when you see these things
None
None
with them they have no idea if you're just sort of jumping
i guess i don't know some people have probably killed their mothers
i guess so
i guess i don't know what actually happens if you have killed your mother
i don't think that you killed your mother though
i don't think there are some people
in society a lot of people are taking drugs
they take a lie detector test or a drug test or whatever
the stuff that happened to them five years ago comes up
it spoils their chances for just making it a little better
when they might be actually trying to
that's it could blow things right away for them
they could walk in and say look i did do drugs a year ago
i'm off them for a year now
it will show up positive
i would probably bring something in showing that i had been to such and such hospital for help or
whatever it is that they do
although then they can't legally discriminate i think on the basis
i don't really know
i don't
it's an interesting topic that i never actually thought about
the other day we had talked about capital punishment
i really really hadn't thought about it
i think about it because i hear about it
i hadn't had to sit down and well what do i think about it
that's kind of like today
i'm kind of in the middle on that one
these are tough
i think that's real good
i think we pay too much in taxes
i think they waste what we pay
i think they waste all the money that we pay
i don't know how you feel
that particular state had an occupational income tax but no sales tax
what you find out is one evil is the same as the other
here there's no occupational tax
it's a heavy sales tax
they get you coming and going
now it's even higher in dallas county
i know it's just
the man said and that's eight percent
it's really kind of sad
i don't know how in terms of when you all do your federal
it just seems like if you're strictly middle income it seems like you get hit the worst
because at some point it goes up to thirty-three percent
the people that make five hundred thousand dollars and higher than that they don't have to pay
sometimes they have to pay even less taxes
i don't know somehow get a
i thought you were going to say something
the things that we can't
don't make that kind of money
if they're in business and they're making money
they're making money then they should pay taxes then
just somehow it doesn't seem
you
you look at like that country singer what's his name willie nelson
i was reading about him in the paper i said he knew he was making money
he didn't look that stupid
why didn't he pay his taxes
in a way it's almost like he had so much debt that filing bankruptcy was a way to get out of all of it
do you file federal or joint income tax
None
do you feel like you get hit by too much
i'm single again
it's a lot worse for single people because they pay the same amount as the people that make the same amount of money and they're married
right now we don't own any property
we're in the same
we're in the same kind of
if you have like x point five children and earn you kind of get hit with
it doesn't even pay for me to earn a good wage because
there's actually less tax implication if i don't work full time compared to what my husband does
it's kind of hard
if both of the spouses work then you get a tax credit for that
yeah otherwise you're just
if you have kids you get seven hundred fifty dollars or something
it's two thousand now
it is
that's not too bad
then you get a child care exemption
it's not enough you know
you pay from fifty to a hundred dollars a week in child care they only give you i think it's about five or ten percent of that
my goodness
it's not even
it was nice talking to you
you are
are you really
the south hills area beaver county well originally beaver county
where are you from
clarion county
we live out in the country
we have two children that live in pittsburgh
i'm talking to you from dallas right now
you are
do you work for texas instruments then
how about you
my son works for a computer
place that needed this
federal company
that's okay
you have a big
that's a
we have a big old farmhouse that we've remodeled
it had been of course a farm
is it a working farm
is it
that's probably what i would
None
we don't farm
None
we lived in minneapolis for about five years
we originally lived in dallas
we met and got married actually married in pittsburgh
that's not what they want to hear on this call at any rate we came back here with
my husband was transferred around up to minnesota and now back to texas with t i we're leasing a two story town home in a section of dallas they call north dallas
it's near a little town called plano
it's not little any more
he's living now up in maryland
he
that's why we're not sure we want to buy down here because we lived up north long enough to appreciate the
minneapolis-saint paul is very clean in terms of
in terms of housing down here you really have your pick
it's just everything's overpriced for the economy
it's terrible
we're in a leased town home
it's nine hundred a month
i'm not surprised
you know what
if you get anything under five hundred you get into what they call high density living the big apartment complexes i just have no tolerance for that
the people think the income is really great in some of those areas
when they sit down and look at what it costs to live
they're done up fairly nice
the town home we're in i don't know how we
it's like a duplex
a two by two they call it like in pittsburgh
it's nice
the girl bought it for a hundred and ten
now she can't sell it
our neighbors
prices have come down on the homes the duplexes
our neighbors the attached on the other side they're very nice thank god
my heaven
i know up in connecticut the same thing happened
None
it's really really bad
we like our area
it's an old house and everything
where is clarion county in relation to
we're considering moving to pennsylvania
it's really not that far
are you going up toward
you're not that far north then
you're really not too bad
was it a home that you've had for quite a few years
that you've
we've been here since sixty-six
then you have
we have fifty acres
pardon me
towns keep creeping closer and closer
i think that that's
this has to do with homes indirectly
i can remember when upper saint clair was out in
now
that's okay
we live about ten miles from probably three or four not large towns but reasonable
sub-
substantially
do you like living in an older home and restoring it like that
we don't want to do too much more
golly
how many rooms do you think
we have four rooms downstairs and a pantry upstairs we have a bath
that's large if your children aren't at home any more
it really isn't too big yet
we li-
they've all moved
we've got
this town house is pretty big
it's got three bedrooms two and a half baths it's really nice
it sounds like a good buy
i would never buy it
leasing it is fine
it's just again the privacy
we had a house in minneapolis that was on three acres
my husband was raised on a working farm near dayt-
that makes a big difference
he said
he's slowly getting me to not feel isolated if we move to where there's more land
yet you can have your friends
that's kind of what
his parents have land that they retired to about a hundred miles out of atlanta in georgia
it is too far south for me
they have one of the
they built one of these
it's just beautiful
it's like a custom it's not like what i would think of when i think of old log cabins
it's modern
it's country it's
i don't
what else about housing except it's
pittsburgh's housing economy i think it's holding it's own
what sections are they in
in the mount lebanon area
the one boy the house they bought is completely livable
the other one needs more work done
they have two children too
they bought what they could afford
they've been in their house probably about twelve years now it's
they're going to start to see their return on their investment very soon
it's a beautiful home
my brother lives
he lives all in that same area going from mount lebanon
the neighborhoods are stable
you do when you mo-
when we first got married
we moved once a year usually
my goodness
after they had to start paying to move us
that's why we're at a point now we're adopting
we have been married ten plus years
what happens is you just realize that once you get to a certain age the next house that you get
we're considering pennsylvania
we're just kind of toying with what exactly where we want to be
i disagree with that
they buy a place
they just hate the area
the economy here in dallas it's steady
it's still not going up
i just refuse to buy it if i know i'm not going to be there for at least five years
my brother they're having trouble selling their home
i'm sure
there you can go down a street
here he told you this every other house if it's been foreclosed on even big executives it's really
it's hard to sell the properties
they thought they were getting a great deal because they could get a five hundred thousand dollar home with they call it zero lot lines no property
it would make you ill to see this
i mean it would probably be like your house on a half a city block in pittsburgh or something
i couldn't handle that
that's
it's across the way
it's landscaped and all that with azaleas
it's still not that private
i get tired sometimes mowing
you have a rider
i do get tired of that
i don't know
your kids have
to tell you the truth i think that if you can keep that way kind of like a homestead
when i'm at home since
i'll say i'm a homemaker since that's my basic thing
in the summertime i wear cotton tops
in the winter i wear sweaters
i do that
when i go out for meetings
i have a couple of pantsuits because those are real in at this time
that's basically what i do
i think our tastes are fairly similar
i'm a scientist
that technically
i suppose i could get away with extremely casual clothes
for the most part i don't
a pantsuit of one sort or another
i guess dress it up with a very nice black jacket when i have visitors or have to give talks
that sounds nice
it said the seasons
do you change much through the season
i guess this summer i wore some fairly nice jeans more than i have in previous seasons
no
i tend to use the same things because actually our offices are very cold in summer
i don't know whether they think by freezing them up overnight then they can save electricity during the day or something
i'm not a clothes horse in the sense that some of my friends
i guess although in as i recall the stereotype of secretaries was overdress over kill sort of in a sense the people i know who spend the most on clothes are secretaries
although the fact that most of the ones i know are in the government and they're not meeting the public i find it a little bit strange that their priorities would be to spend this money here
i suppose if you were more a receptionist and meeting the public and it was the image of your company at stake perhaps you would have to dress up
i don't have the resources to just go out and buy buy buy anyway
my don't change dramatically over the years
basically i'm a pretty much the same
in the wintertime i change to the sweaters
it's not a whole lot of change for me either
especially when i go to the meetings and wear the dresses
i enjoy that
it just wouldn't be smart for me to do that in my home with my children
i have to
i have given seminars before in creative writing and things like that
i don't know if they consider that a job
i don't really get paid for that often
when i do that then i think i become more businesslike
it doesn't really change my clothing style
you can look businesslike in a the same pant suit you would wear for other things
i'm really glad about that pant suits are popular because i'm allergic to many of the synthetics
i used to have a problem when i was working in a restaurant while i was in college and had to dress up and nylons and things like that would just give me a terrible rash
otherwise i guess we're both pretty practical
it's been great talking to you
have a good day
i'm certainly under the influence of the idea that the government needs to have less control on what the citizens do
i do see this as something that definitely needs to be taken care of
whether that should be put in the hands of the corporation or the hands of the government is a different question i think as far as i'm concerned
in other words i am in favor of drug testing
i was drug tested when i came to my job here at t i
None
i think that the corporations should do all that
they should have drug screening before they hire an employee
any time that an employee
if they're coming to late work all the time and especially if they're on the line or any kind of sensitive job where if they made a mistake it would cost a lot of money or people's lives
i agree with you
i would even think that i could in theory take that a step further and say anybody in any job if the corporation felt like b-
this is why drugs are
i mean it's what drives crime
it's what drives any sort of pain and discomfort in the world or in america i think is somewhat driven by drugs
i think that were corporations and private industry to take command in this situation that maybe we might have some control over that
we
if you can't work
course that might up crime when people go in and steal your television and ste- and sell it just because they can't work anymore
you got to have a safe work place
you're definitely right
that you can't have it any other way
None
if it's a policeman and he's working with the public and has a gun in his holster or even if it's a guy at mcdonald's cooking a burger i think
what do you think
what percentage of corporations and private industry do you think use drug testing
i think it's more frequent now
because all the jobs that i've applied for have mentioned some type of drug screening
i work at sears
i just do warehouse work
did they give you drug testing
now they issued a statement about that about three months ago
are they going to begin spontaneous drug testing
not that i know of
it was more about all the people's problems
they've been laying off a lot of people
they sent out the employee assistance cards for anyone that had any sort of drug problem or work related problem
family problems
i know they have a lot of drug problems
what do you think about
something that kind of concerns me is you and i are tested for whatever work we happen to do
because they're hypocritical
they talk against drugs they get caught
whether it's drugs or any other kind of
like the money laundering scams all that was drug related
that cost us the country billions of dollars
i can't see how we can expect the people working in america to put any trust into our political officials if they don't
just doesn't make sense
i have a couple of credit cards and use them
we try not to
we use credit cards also if we want to get an extended warranty on an item that we're purchasing
that's an idea
yes
basically we use it mainly when we're traveling or out of state or somewhere where they don't take out of state checks when we're traveling some
we do use them
we try not to
he's one who believes in credit cards
he uses them quite a bit
he likes that
well that's a good thing because lot of people don't pay at the end of the month they just pay the minimum required balance
that's when you get into expenses
you get in over your head
say i'm going to buy this when it's good and on sale
i can go ahead and pay for it when i get my check at the end of the month
sometimes you do come on bargains and that
it's really useful
some places won't take personal checks or cash even they would take a credit card
how are the laws in pennsylvania as regard not the laws but the credit card rates in pennsylvania
we don't deal where they do that
we go to places where they don't charge extra
the gas stations more
we just try to avoid the ones that do that
we just don't go there because there's enough other ones around that don't charge you anything
extra to me credit cards are the same as cash
so that the end of the month or when you get your credit card bill are you saying that that way you're not left stranded and high and dry
you're one of the i guess good faithful shoppers that don't get into a problem when it comes to budgeting their money
i can't say we never have
now we have at times made payments
we try not to
i think that there's a great advantage to a credit card in those situations
because sometimes there's times when you maybe couldn't take advantage of something with a credit card you can
do you have multiple credit cards
do you find that advantageous
i think we're narrowing it down
like i said my husband likes them
we have quite a few
when you get down to the nitty gritty there's probably three that we use most of the time
we're actually in the same boat
we like to use three basic credit cards
we don't have an awful lot of expenses or surprises when it comes the end of the month
do you find that you get an awful lot of credit card applications through the mail
three times a week
it's not every week
you do get them
i really don't like it the charges that
we try to look at that also
the annual fee
what they charge per year to use our money they're charging us to spend our money
i'm not real crazy about that
we try to look at that also
there is the basic annual fee for the credit card plus they charge any where from seventeen to twenty-three percent based upon what the state will allow
did you hear the questions that the lady brought up
such as how much time
how many do you have
we have
we see them at least once a week
we see our son and his wife
we baby-sit quite frequently
we're a fairly close-knit family
of course with the holidays and everything
you're very fortunate
my oldest daughter lives in amsterdam holland
it's kind of hard for us to visit with them as much as i'd like to
because one thing we do have together is we're both musicians
she is a concert harpsichordist
her husband builds forte pianos
that's why they're over there
i have a son who lives in
i get to see him maybe once every three months
we've lost
i'd like to have an everyday contact with children as well as you do for that matter
young my youngest daughter lives in new jersey
you don't get to see any of yours very often
i don't hardly get to see any of them
she works in these
they're really both
what activities do you do with your children when you are together
most the time
right now it's football season
our daughter is a big cowboy fan
my husband
she watches that
i play with the grandchildren
like last weekend there's the soviet space exhibit is here in dallas
it ends
in january
she and the three boys and my husband and i went over into fort worth to see the space exhibit
this sunday
it's been here for quite some time
it's very interesting
it's been very well done
next sunday they're coming over after the cowboy game
we're going to go take the boys to see christmas lights and go to a santa's village
when our son's over we have a pool
he and his wife come and a lot of their friends
we have cookouts on sunday
that sounds like you have really wonderful activities that keep you together
we do a lot with our kids
we always have
we're very family oriented
that's wonderful
the kids seem to enjoy being with us
their friends enjoy being with us
that keeps us very very young with all these young people passing in and out and eating
seems like i've
it does
they all end up spending the night christmas eve night so that
they're all
have christmas dinner with us and then go to other in-laws and things
we see a lot of them
we enjoy christmas eve night because they all start arriving by about eleven o'clock
we open presents about five o'clock christmas
None
my sister and her husband are coming down
there's going to be eleven of us for christmas
you seem to be making out all right
what do you think of the current trends of how other people spend time with their children and so forth
i think the trends are going back to spending more time with families
i think parents are definitely spending more and more time
i don't think they're leaving them with baby-sitters
i think family quality time is becoming much more important than it was there for about i don't know eight or nine years
of course i find now that i spend more time with my grandchildren in detail
i know more about them and watch their growth and how they improve and learn much more so than my own kids
when your own children are growing up you just take them for granted
you go ahead and do your thing
i'm going to have difficulty with this topic
what kinds of things do you and your family do
we go out and fly kites
we go fishing
we go to movies
we go out to the farm
she likes to pick flowers and look at birds
then your kind family is probably pretty rare now a days
i'm divorced
None
we color a lot
i read her stories
whether their parents are together or divorced they don't spend enough time together
i think that contributes to a lot of why society is going downhill right now is because the basic family unit is being destroyed
i think that when you spend a lot of time with each other you communicate a lot
the communication helps just build your family
to me that's pretty rare
whenever i do have children i'm going to try as hard as i can to see that we spend a lot of time together
that's good sometimes because you need to get away
i don't think you should spend too much time outside at the detriment of losing the family unit
then you never get to know them either
as i understand it
kids these days are growing up so much faster
once they hit ten or eleven or twelve you've pretty much lost them
do you think that your family is pretty rare in that you do a lot of things or just the relationship between you and your daughter
i really do because i don't see many others
whenever we go to the park or something sometimes on the weekdays we'll see other families
not usually on the weekends
what do you think is the key to just bringing the american family back together
i think they can turn off the t v for one thing
and go out and do stuff
she always likes to do things whenever the t v off
she'll forget about the t v completely
i think that's the first thing a lot of people do
i know i'm guilty of it
i came in from work today
i like to watch 'em
i think that's that is a big problem the television
it's too static
there's no thinking involved no motion
i think that's another reason why people are so health conscious now is because america's becoming really a couch potato society
people aren't doing anything just sitting around no thinking involved
i think people are trying to get out of that
there's a lot of
that people are starting to look out for cholesterol and things like that trying to get out and workout more often and jog and walk and different things like that
that's probably good
that's also something family oriented that everyone can do
when she was here last summer we played tennis
she hasn't brought her tennis racquet over lately
how old is she
she has
we just been hitting the ball on the ground
then we kick the ball
it was very nice talking to you
you like to fish
i like to fish
there's a lot of lakes around here
are there many lakes up there
we have the great lakes
we're in what's called the finger lake region of new york
these are real good for bass fishing and so forth
we have actually quite a lot of variety
there's
we have large mouth small mouth sort of musky pike stuff like that
all sorts of fun stuff like that
we have a pretty large bass masters tournament actually takes place right on lake ontario every year
that's a lot of fun
what do you like to go for
it's
i hardly ever catch one
they have a tail race over in lake lavon when they open up the dam and let out water they wash down the fish
you catch that white bass and crappie out of there
we have some friends who live on the lake the lake it just seems is completely filled with bass to the point where normally you
in this particular lake we went out with some friends once
every time you tossed the line in you pull up a five six seven inch minimum bass
usually you pull up
it's a real enjoyable experience to go fishing there because we pull up bass after bass
during perch season as well you pull up a lot of
probably during perch season the perch will run in very large schools
what they'll do is j-
you'll be sort of boating around
they'll be boating around
they'll hit a school of perches in the middle when they do you can just drop the lines in and just pull them in one at
they just drop it in
what do you catch perch on
they
according to them when the perch are running you can catch them on just about anything
i've
she told me that they will sometimes use corn or anything
they'll hit because they're just sort of surrounded these large schools
some fish steal it off the hook sometimes
the other day i was fishing with bread
there's a college across the street they
it's full of carp i caught a carp on a about what size is that i think it was a number two treble hook
it's huge
its mouth was full of hooks
he was in a bad way
it's
it's it was sixteen inches long
that's a nice size carp
i think it was about a pound and a half
all they're good for is the fight
boy they really don't want to come out of the water
they zip through the water
how your line goes i thought that i wasn't going to be able to get it in because the one i hooked just about ten minutes before when i tried to raise it out of the water it fell off
it wasn't hooked very well
i got it that far
i figured that
that counts
he laughed when it fell off
i said that's a quick release right there
do you eat the fish that you catch
are you more of a sport fisherman
catfish yeah
i haven't eaten anything else
there's some
my uncle has a pond upstream
there's a lot of crappie in there now
i think he's the only one that's that's caught a big enough crappie to eat
the catfish there's hundreds of them from like two to six pounds and that
you can just
i don't actually like fish
when i fish it's more for sport than anything else
if
when you have to look in their eyes and hit them in the head or whatever that's what you do with a catfish because you have to sever their spinal cord
be careful you don't get stung
have you ever tried deep sea fishing
not yet
my brother went off the coast of maine
he said that it was just like that
they were throwing hell benders or some other kind of treble hook lure
each time they bring them in they'd have at least one
sometimes they've had one on every hook
i was out in florida with a friend a while ago
we would go and just drop two or three hooked rig as well down off a boat
the captain had some kind of sonar in the boat he'd maneuver us into a school of fish
you just drop it in
you get one or two at a shot
it was a like twenty dollars for six hours of fishing on some big charter boat
they'll clean your fish on a tip basis for you if you want
this is
this was for a large
we weren't all related just thirty people off the shop in the boat there
this is great because i think it was nineteen dollars for five hours and twenty dollars for six hours or something
you'd get to go out there for six hours and get a nice suntan and bring along some lunch
i don't know if it's been five minutes yet or not
i'm relatively satisfied with the benefits i have
i think that our health insurance is terribly expensive
that's my major complaints i guess
a lot of times they turn down your claims
that leaves you paying for all of it
maybe that it's not understood what should be covered and what isn't
it's the type that if you go to a certain doctor then you just pay ten dollars
the insurance pays the rest of the bill
if you go outside you get seventy thirty
what i found recently is what they've been doing is they poll somehow the area
they have what they consider a justifiable price for the area where your doctor is located based on zip code
recently when we had a claim they didn't pay the eighty-five percent they paid much lower
when i called they said oh well that's because your doctor is charging much more than the norm for the area
i was really surprised because either there aren't that many of that type of doctor within that zip code so that two doctors could balance each other out or their statistics aren't very accurate
they're probably doing it to their benefit anyway
it's difficult
what about other benefits
i work for sears
that's about the only real benefit you have is health insurance
you have vacation
everybody gets vacation
t i and some other places they have recreational facilities
they have a driving range and weight room
i think they even have a swimming pool i don't know if they have any tennis courts or anything like that
to me vacation
different places have different amounts of vacation i would assume
the leniency with which they let you take leave without pay perhaps or um
some places just sort of believe you
ours is based on number of days
people try to build them up in case they really do get seriously ill
otherwise i'm not aware of any problems with the benefits around here
maybe that covers the topic then
i don't know the working conditions if you could include that in benefits
some places don't compensate you for the hazards that you have to work under
maybe not really a benefit either would be the allowing you to use the telephone for personal calls
i suppose some places are more stringent about that than others
maybe arriving late or something like that
how they enforce the rules
other than that i don't have much feeling
since like i said i don't have a big problem with them
workmen's comp is a big thing now in texas because how much it costs the employers a lot of them are going to their own insurance now
it reduces some of the length of the benefits i don't know besides that
i noticed right off that was a year less than what the state was allowing
i didn't know that somebody could avoid workmen's compensation
they still have to pay it
they buy their own instead of going through the state
i see
apparently it costs less that way
i suppose that whenever companies can avoid benefits it's to the benefit of the company
i would think they would get a much greater turnover
that people would be dissatisfied
that's what i think
they should be able to judge their benefits on how happy their employees are
how much profit they're making
have everybody be unhappy and have a constant turnover of people
sure the payroll is lower that way
i would assume that the productivity is way down also
if they have to train a new employee every six months then i don't see how they can save money
once they once they get somebody good they ought to hang onto them
thank you for calling
she lives in utah
i guess we're going to talk about children today
you ready
they're all out on their own
do you want to start first
do you work
i know that it's very difficult to find good help sometimes when you want your children to be taken care of
there's a
there's a big controversy whether they should have to have a law to have them certified or not
there's pros and cons on both side of that if they were then you kind of know that they had to go through some kind of testing
or some kind of something to get an okay seal
most of the problems we hear
maybe we don't hear about the other ones though that could be
the individual incidence or something
usually when i have someone tend
he's plenty big enough then
he's very good
None
they did a good job
i've never had to leave them in a day care center
i've been very lucky just be able to stay home
i worked four years one time
my last two children were both entering high school age
they were of course gone while i was working
it wasn't a problem i saw
i stayed home the rest of the time
i didn't have that problem either
i
they've been in day care
it's difficult
yet she's the type of person that i don't know if she'd be happy staying at home
some people aren't
she surprised me though
she's done a lot of things that i never thought she would do
None
they've used the day care most of the time
she also had a small child she brought with her
it did not work out at all
she thought it was going to
the lady called
her baby wasn't very old at the time and said she was having trouble
this baby
she was having problems with her
she called and said things were okay settled down and was all right
my daughter decided to call them and check
things weren't okay
her one son was watching the soapies
the baby was in his crib with the door shut just screaming his heart out
the baby-sitter was in the kitchen with her baby
that ended that
she was most upset over finding this
they kind of had decided that the day care was better
the age groups are separated
nannies have been an option
i know that at day care they have more of a routine like maybe in
story time
this one has been particularly nice
they would tell the parents what they did that day
if they said anything or did anything
it kind of kept them
on people that had been in that day care but was no longer there
they wouldn't have nothing to worry about saying
if there was a problem they would i think be more ready to tell you what it was
i think so because if they were still there they might not
how do you judge other than from what others have what you see the cleanliness and that type of thing
usually they aren't at that age
None
it would be real difficult to find one and decide
i know about three years ago i tended some children
i wondered if i would have to be certified
whether they'd just bring them
we got to where we were just friends
if there was a problem
we'd sit down
it never happened
things worked out okay
their kids played with my kids
it worked out well
it worked out good
i've decided i'm going to baby-sit my
i sell avon and stanley products
i've got that worked out
he's going to deliver my products
i'll do my orders and that by phone
that will be great
i think i'll enjoy doing
i think i'll enjoy
i guess i kind of miss having a baby around
the grandparents i always hear it's always fun when you can send them home at the end of the day instead of
they do say you enjoy them more
somebody said if they knew grandchildren where so much fun they would have had them first
my husband's mother lives right over here
she takes care of them sometimes
just is a lovely lady
i've always appreciated when she's sat with them
always said she would not let me baby-sit because you do hear grandparents complaining because they're stuck with their grandchildren so much
the ones that complain a lot are the first
i do have some opinions
go ahead
i know that they're real cautious about letting middle eastern people into the country now because of all the terrorism
i hadn't thought about that
what all do you know about it
i just have an opinion
i thought the terrorism thing was overstated
maybe it is or isn't i suppose
everyone's afraid of how the war was going to go and everything
i told her no
there wasn't
i'm concerned that we don't have enough controls
i think that the asian gangsters that we've let in here
the guys from cuba there's a lot of criminals down in florida that we've let in from cuba that fidel pushed off on us
the last
out of all the asians we brought in there's a tremendous criminal element that we let in from asia
i think that there's got to be some sort of controls over that
this asia mafia thing is getting out of hand
i don't even know what our controls are
i don't even know what if we have any guidelines at all on immigration
i always thought that we did
i don't know what they are right now
i don't think there's much of one because i'm sure all the people from cuba have been released from that camp that they were in
it's just like australia most of them were criminals from cuba i think that was just an attempt that fidel castro to undermine the united states to some extent
he just released and got rid of all his criminals and sent them to us
it's almost the same thing from asia because
i do have some sympathy with
i think that we need to do something with the immigration of back and forth across mexico i'm sympathetic
i don't know what the answer is
i'm sympathetic certainly with that that they want to come over here
i guess hundreds of thousands come over every year to work
if they have jobs i hear the story that they're taking away american jobs
i don't know
i'm sympathetic
i don't have an answer
i think that we should have good relations with mexico
that's not really exactly immigration
it isn't
owe the children education and all that
i guess it's what they
the mexican kids get a good education along the way
maybe that's a benefit to everybody
a lot of the mexican people just cross the border during the daytime to come over here and work they have green cards
like you said a lot of
most of them are working in janitorial positions
i don't know
like you said i don't know how much they're taking from the work force
of course you mentioned the language
i feel so bad that we here in texas or certainly the southern part of the united states california texas and all that why our kids don't speak fluid spanish by junior high as well as us so that we wouldn't have the language barrier certainly
that is a shame that we have this tremendous border of mexico
in europe they speak their french and all
they go out of their way to try to speak their neighbor's language so they can understand
we don't really even make an effort to speak spanish
i feel bad about that
that's one reason that i did it is because whenever you travel anywhere near the border there more and more people speak spanish
i do have some spanish books
i've always
every year i say i'm going to try to speak some newcomers language
how much money they're putting into it
my wife says how much the federal government is putting into it immigration
it's basically on the
it's more
the immigration is tied in with drug trafficking
they have to watch out who comes in
they're always finding drugs on the most
a dog found it the other day on the border
i think that certainly is a problem
they didn't say to talk about that
that is
you know they're redoing that and going to make it a national museum
since all of us had ancestors that came over that way
not all
i guess if you go back far enough you came over on a boat originally
a lot of us have grandparents
i'm sure they came over through ellis island
we all immigrants one way or another
one of the things that really gets to me about the mexicans is that once they have children over here their children are american citizens then
then they'll ship the parents back
that leaves the children without any parents
i don't understand whose rule is that
they just follow the rule no matter
that doesn't seem fair to the children
you would think they could at least get a visa or something until they get citizenship
they granted them amnesty if they could prove they'd been here five years
a lot of them had been
some of them moved back and forth
most of them don't ever want to go back to mexico
you could see why
i think most like especially the celebrities and everything they have to get a green card if they going to do any kind of work in movies and such
most of them have temporary visas
i guess you can get work visas pretty easily
as long it's like
it's a kind of a bad example
when rafael septien took the job with the cowboys they had to offer his job to any other applicant that could do it
so that
that's the thing with the jobs
of course no one beat him out
he just ruined his own career
yeah
it's still interesting after all this time that we're probably one of the few countries that people are still desperately trying to immigrate to
although i guess europe now that the communism is falling apart that maybe there'll won't be that much of a rush to get out of all the communist countries
i guess poland now is noncommunist
maybe not
maybe immigration from europe to here will slowly change
maybe it'll even out like trade
so many people will immigrate here at the year two thousand
maybe it will average out
it doesn't seem so far
there are other job opportunities
in europe that there aren't here even
like orchestra players can find a job sometimes
i'm a trumpet player
i don't any more
i was a music major for a while
i had a trumpet teacher that played in the mexico city symphony
he had to have a work visa there
of course they had a lot of musicians from other countries in the mexico city symphony
i think three out of the four other people in the trumpet section are from mexico now
i think i don't know one of the conductors is from another country
eduardo mana's from mexico
he had to
i haven't really lived in a lot of big cities
i'm living in dallas now
i don't really have a lot of experience with air pollution
i know when i lived down in houston on the outskirts of houston there were some towns like pasadena that had oil refineries
if you would drive by there on your way to the beach or something
it always smelled really bad
i live out in the country
that part is good
we're maybe one hundred miles from pittsburgh
right now in our area were fighting against a toxic waste incinerator
it won't be too for from where we live
everybody really has been fighting against it because we do not want it
we don't want one any place
we would like the industry to do more to take care of the waste products before they turn to incineration because we feel that the small percentage that they're going to be putting into the air is too much
it's just so bad that there is just so much going into the air
the little bit you say that there putting in here and there and everywhere it all adds up they're
all the problems in the middle east
that has to be terrible over there
it's just why are we doing this to ourselves
what really amazes me about that pasadena area and the oil refineries
between the freeway and the oil refinery you would see a neighborhood
you just thought it's obvious that there's a lot going up in the air there
what comes up must come down
we're breathing it all the time
how if they have all of those
toxicity there's signs around saying how dangerous it is
here you are living
i figure we're paying to take care of this toxic waste no matter who does it
they have shown some of the industries have been real good at doing their part in reducing the amount that they have
they've reused some of it
that they've shown that to begin with apparently it does cost more
once they get started it saves them money in the end
it cuts down on the end product that has to be dealt with some other way
if they would all
that's what we want done
we want industry to take more responsibility in taking care of it
individual companies and things are so selfish
their desires to save a few dollars and that
it's the money
even the incinerator the money and the income that they're going to make off this is just astronomical
have you ever visited los angeles or any place it's kind of known that it has pollution in it's air
we went as far as las vegas
we should have gone the whole way over
we didn't
i understand that
she said how wonderful it was to be able to look into the sky and see some of the things that she saw
what about in new york
i've been to new york
i have family there
it's kind of northwest part of pennsylvania
it's very lush and pretty
back in the east
i'm thirty-one
you're young
these
we have some people who say this isn't going to affect me this air pollution
older people
they think they're far enough away from something
they don't realize these things are going to affect everybody
if you're older it's not going to affect you that way
you have children
everybody is going to be affected by it
we all need to be willing to help pay a little bit
i've heard some people grumble about their cars passing their emission tests
how it's more expensive and things
i thought it's so much better
we don't have that here yet
you don't
i have read that it has really helped where where the population is greater
that it has made a difference
i really think it must
think about how many automobiles there are
each is putting out
we have a car
one of our cars is an older car
every time you start it from the tail pipe it makes a black spot
you know that is a sign
all cars are doing that
it's really polluting the air
it's causing of lot of the real terrible suffering like cancer
like i said i think you have to pay for it no matter what you do you with it because it's industry
they find out this dump doesn't work
we have to clean this up and move it someplace else
we're paying to have our air polluted and our water streams polluted
the one area they want to put the incinerator is right in the middle of the two water sheds that feed clarion river
it just boggles our mind that they can consider even putting it there because
it will
it's just hard to think that they could allow them to do things like this
i've really enjoyed the conversation
instead of waiting until it directly affects me like you say
you have a good day
you too
okay do you have young children
one is two
the other one's four
this is my first year of staying home
then you are familiar with it
i have grandchildren
i know two of them have gone to preschool
i know what the experience my daughter has faced with that
the
i felt that i need to move on with them
i found another baby-sitter
she was wonderful
it just seemed like it was so hard to find really good child care
it was in home child care
both times
i worked in the child care centers
i wasn't really happy with the particular one that i was working in
i just always had a fear about child care centers
that's why i put them in home day care
i just decided that i was just missing a lot of their time whether they were so little
i couldn't get off of work as often as i wanted to when they were ill
i just decided it was probably best just to stay home for a while until they were a little more
i could go back to work
i know that in raising my children i was fortunate
i know my daughter
she has three
to have three in day care even though one of them's in school full time one of them's in kindergarten
it's so expensive
i'm glad that she gets to stay home so that she can then participate with what's going on in their life
bosses don't always seem to understand getting off to go to christmas programs in the middle of the day or something
i know that one of the day cares it's a well-known chain she was not at all happy with
there was too many children per person
the middle grandson went there as a preschool thing
she was wanting him actually to start getting a certain amount of learning and training and stuff
not just there
i think he went five mornings a week if i remember correctly
it was supposed to be a base
starting to learn the colors and learning to associate with children so that when he went to school and stuff
she was most unhappy with it
she pulled him out of that one and put him in a another one that was excellent
it was like a little kindergarten
they had hot lunches
they had classes that one class they'd do art
it was really a very excellent one
how old was he
it helped him the first one he went to a church preschool that was very good
it was a excellent
my little boy goes to the methodist in garland
does he
the church ones seem to be very well run
i've heard that the methodist ones are excellent
i just assumed that most churches going by experience there that they were good
i didn't know that
i just know that first united methodist of richardson was just a great program
this is first united methodist in garland that he goes to
i'm real happy with that
that's a
are you enjoying staying home
i taught for richardson school district i taught early childhood
i really enjoyed it
it was taking a lot of my time
i noticed i was spending less and less time with them
it just seemed like they were sick more often i just couldn't get the time off to
isn't it very hard to teach young children and then come home and deal with young children
i felt
could you tell me what you think contributes most to air pollution
it's hard to say
while it's certainly the case that things like automobiles and factories pollute a lot if you look at how much pollution is say kicked up by an active volcano it's certainly less than clear that anything man can do in this sort of scale of things has much effect at all
you talked about volcanos
i'm not sure how many active volcanos there are now and what the amount of material that they do put into the atmosphere
i think probably the greatest cause is vehicles
do you live right in the city itself
i certainly work near a city
can you notice
it's
it's mainly farms and no heavy industry
i see
it's in the north
i live up in the northeast corner
attleboro sits in just over the line
there isn't a lot of heavy industry
we get an occasional
it depends which way the winds blowing from boston cause we're forty miles south of boston
we'll pick up that
i've noticed over the past say maybe five or six years
i notice that the fly patterns now of the jets are getting bigger
they're swinging wider so that now they are coming over our homes
it seems like we're catching all that residue
other than that we don't have the emissions
from the power plants
you mean from the coal
one of our biggest electrical plants in rhode island uses coal to
there doesn't seem to be much emission from them
i'm not sure about the rest of the country
it's interesting
in order to keep with the e p a standards which tend to be visible what's coming out of your smokestack they do all their emissions at night
people get up
is that right
they've got this black ash on their cars
which seems to be
i really think that if the e p a had anything on the ball they'd go in there with a few phosphorous grenades light up the sky photograph the emissions at that point and
there must be some of the larger plants up around one hundred twenty-eight
we've got reports that
during the night seems like they'd blow off their stacks from
they do that at night too because
employees been complaining that the cars have been pitted and spots all over them
you're right
they could do something about that i guess
how are your lakes
they've been getting cleaner
yeah
i'm not sure how much the water pollution is directly related to the air pollution other than acid rain
that's what i was
the stuff i've read recently in technology review basically indicates that acid rain may be a little bit overstated that a lot of the die off they've seen in forests may not really be due to acid rain at all
didn't they just have an article on
upstate new york somewhere
they thought that was more beneficial because some of it does soak in
some of it runs off right away in to the streams and rivers
some of the fish were supposedly making a comeback
i read that recently somewhere
i can't remember where
i thought it was up there
that's interesting because new hampshire
and parts of vermont they showed pictures of extensive tree damage that they attributed to acid rain
you kind of think it's something else then
that's what the environmentalists were claiming in this article
they didn't say what though
they just said they thought acid rains contribution may be less than was previously suspected that it may be other natural things at work
natural disease
it's less than clear
i don't know
what do you think we can i guess as individuals or as a group do about air pollution
we can demand more efficient automobiles for one thing
i still think that's one of our major causes of pollutants
how we go about that it's a little bit difficult
i think it's up to individuals too to ask automakers for less pollutant vehicles
i think you need a vehicle something like ralph nader nader's raiders or a a r p which has a lot of members
if you can get those types of groups
i remember reading an article that said it's the older polluters
the twelve and fifteen year old cars contribute ninety percent
the new cars is hardly anything
how about all the trucks and buses that are out there
when was the last time you saw a truck that didn't belch smoke or
doesn't that just mean they're out of tune
i'm not really sure
you think that the trucking industry is that incompetent that they wouldn't
fuel is one of their biggest costs
you would
diesel engines
it
they do generate a lot of soot
at least that kind of particulate comes out of the air pretty quickly
we could also push for legislation for rapid transit systems
only because we got used to single person single car
we could that
air pollution
the united states and canada is going into some types of agreements to limit what's being given out by power plants
that's helping
what do you think about a device a meter right on a tail pipe
you pay the tax based on how much you polluted
that's an idea
don't say that too loud though because every city and town will have a meter on your
it just means if you don't pollute or you pollute very little you don't have to pay any tax
you just buy one of these things
it
maybe you could probably devise them so it slowly closed off your tail pipe
the less you pollute the longer the devise lasts
if you pollute a lot then it closed off your tail pipe
you couldn't start your car anymore
that's an interesting concept
it's
i guess the difficulty would be that somebody could obviously just take it right off the tail pipe again
you probably would have to build it right into the muffler or something
i was going to say
it could be installed like a catalytic converter
i guess you could take those off too
mufflers would be a little more obvious if you took that off
not unless it was built into every muffler
if you was talking about something which was more or less universal that busses and any kind of vehicle
had to pay a pollution tax this would penalize the heavy polluters and not penalize the light polluters
that's quite a concept
you should pursue that i think or patent it
it shouldn't be too hard to do something like that
that's a thought
that will solve a lot of problems
i don't know if you approached the automobile industry if they would be too keen on installing something like that
a proposal to i guess the proper authorities
you might generate some yeah
that's a good idea
other than that i'm not sure what individuals can do other than like i said get involved through a group or an organization
what are your music interests
just about any kind of music except acid rock
i don't care
i grew up with country and western
i'm pretty diversified too
i don't like acid rock either
None
it was country music
when i
our cable doesn't
it was tremendous
he is a
i appreciate his too
his mus-
he's from ireland isn't he
it was mostly all irish tunes
they had a band with him that had a harpist and another flute and then a guy that played the bagpipes plus the tin whistle
and a couple of violins and drum
they played all the irish jigs and so forth
he is really good
i come from a musical background
i've played flute and piano
i have a big appreciation for music
i'm getting now to the age where i don't like much of the new stuff that's coming out
i love to just lay back on the couch and turn a good instrumental on and just close my eyes and listen
that's nice to do that is
i'm getting well versed in kiddy music
i've never played an instrument in my life
i could never do that
i've done that at church too
let's see
what kind of music do you not like
like i say the acid rock
i don't care for rap music either
that's not music
it's not music
it's just talking in a beat
it's not exciting at all
it doesn't give you relaxation
i like orchestra music too like the
boston pops or anything
are they good
i have
we went and saw les miserables the music in that was fantastic
i've heard that that is a really
it
it was out at the state fair music hall
it was well worth the price
i bet it was
i really bet it was
is that the only musical
just ever so often a real good one like that one
that would be nice
i went and saw i think it was sugar babies
i don't know what that's about
that was the one with mickey rooney
what's that not real old
i know who you're talking about
that was
i remember that being here a few years ago
the last country music
my parents still really like country
they like the oak ridge boys and the statler brothers
my parents
my husband likes country music real well
he likes some of the new groups like shenandoah
i think they're a bit over exposed
i
of tire- get tired of every other song being alabama on the
i've never cared for hank
i never have figured out how he won entertainer of the year for about
we watch those award shows too
i just don't care for him
i guess probably my favorite all time country and western song or singer is probably eddy arnold
is it
i think i know who that is
i think my parents
i had about a hundred and fifty old seventy-eight r p m records of country and western
smiley burnette i don't know if you were old enough to remember
he played in the old western movies
he was the sidekick of gene autry i believe they
i think his name in the movie was froggy
i've never seen a gene autry movie
i took them up here to collectors records and was able to get a little money for them
my mother and dad use to own a restaurant
they had a nickelodeon of course in the restaurant
that wou-
when they would come and change the records the guy would give her the old records that's where i got my
that would be great if they weren't too worn out
you'd think there would be
the problem is most of the record players now will not play them because
that's true
you have to have that particular kind of needle they
just won't play on a modern day phonograph
that's a shame
you see seventy-eights
a lot at record stores
i'm sure you could find old players for them
that would cost a fortune
of course they just don't have the quality of records nowadays either because
you get that scratchy sound
those things were big and thick weren't they
the ones you buy
they're just so thin and
they're not meant to last
neither are tapes
we buy cassette tapes
machines will eat them
the best bet these days are compact disk
i guess the old country and western music you
that's all you had to listen to was the
there's too much t v now the radio is more exciting
really than television
your imagination i- kept
what day was that on
can you recall
seems like it was on a friday
what do you think about the idea of kids having to do public service work for a year
i think it's a pretty good idea
i think they should either do that or afford some time to the military or helping elderly people
i think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that could use some help
i think that before we expend all our young talent overseas and helping other countries we ought to perhaps give a little bit of our help to our own folks at home
i'm not sure that that's not a bad idea
the military for a year or two
i agree with you
what i'm thinking about is back
the parents kind of pushed them to join the boy scouts
they did do a lot of public service activities
these days they're not
parents aren't encouraging their kids to do things like that
when i was in the girl scouts we did a lot of public service things because that's just part of the scouting and
i really think that both the boy scouts and girl scouts is two excellent organizations
kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that
they don't follow it at all
i don't know what the high rank is for the gals
i
there's not
they're just not
they lose interest
when they young adults
i like to see
of course there's third world countries that can use all kind of help
there's a lot that can be done right here in this country
i think
i'm
i'm not so sure that helping overseas would be such a hot idea for a lot of young people
since there is much that needs to be done here
i think that we need to really address what we've done here
perhaps even a six month tour overseas that gives them much broader outlook
it's been really good
hopefully we'll have other good topic maybe another call someday
i don't really have too much more to say on this topic i guess
i agree with you
i guess we both agree that it's a good thing
you take care
i don't know
i've had mixed emotions i guess when i listen to the radio and watch t v about the different things that are happening
i'm against it
on the same token i went out and purchased a gun just because i wanted the right to do that
i have a rifle in the house
the ammunition is probably so old i'm afraid to use it
i bought it for target practicing and also because i wanted a weapon
how do you feel about it
i think down here in texas they don't have a waiting period on handguns
i think they need that
i have a pistol
i have a twenty-two or a twelve gauge shotgun
i do like to have my guns
i don't know if i'll ever use it
like you my bullets to my little pistol's probably about three years old
my gun hasn't been shot in a year or two
up in new england where i'm from you had to get a permit before you could buy any ammunition
i thought that was really good
i think if they
takes two weeks for that system to process your request not as a gun permit but to buy ammunition
i agree
i think one of the things that needs to happen is to stop the impulse buyer from buying it quickly and
if someone's really determined to pick up a firearm
you can get them really cheap
i had a waiting period on my pistol because i was down in tennessee
and they had a waiting period
we bought it there
that wasn't too bad
if you're going to go buy something of that nature i think you're going to have some idea as to what you're going to do with it
in other words you don't have a need to go buy a gun to go shoot it the next day
at times i think they ought to have a waiting period on all firearms
i do too because
i don't know
at least ours does
it's
you have a little thing on top of the barrel where you turn it
the spread changes
i guess it doesn't have any automatic features to it
the further away i get the wider the shot gets from the target
the closer that i get the tighter that it gets
my husband had a police gun at one time
i shot
it just a li-
i forget
since we moved
the clubs that we've got around here are kind of expensive
it's well worth it
you can go down and shoot up against a sand bag and some targets and have competition
i've never really joined a club because i haven't got the time not because i haven't got the desire
there's an annual membership fee that's fairly high
there's an initiation fee that you have to pay because of first time member
the whole process can cost you a hundred fifty dollars to join the club
you have to pay for the ammunition in any tournaments that you would join in
that's what my husband
it
he went mostly just to shoot at paper targets
they used speed and accuracy and all that
i think that the gun clubs serve a useful purpose
in fact i'd like to see somehow they tie the legislation into not only when you buy a weapon you have to show that you've gone to school or gone to some class to know how to handle that weapon
it
you give him a license because he waited nine days
he could not only shoot himself
he could mishandle a weapon leave it at home and let a child get at it
we was living on a navy base down in memphis
this one guy decided to play lonesome cowboy or something
he was twirling his gun around and shot himself in his foot
i can't remember what the term was going around
about private citizens selling a weapons
if you wanted to sell your pistol to me
do you believe there ought to be legislation guiding the buyer and the seller
do you believe that you ought to be able to sell your system
that's a hard one because we did that
i think there ought to be some rule against it
i'll
isn't there a way to deregister yourself after you register a gun
i have
i've kept it the one gun that was in my name
the rifle that i've got is not registered
i don't know why i never registered it
the
the
my husband has a thing
if they go to
it's just like the social security system
once they gave everybody a number
now they're making you get one at birth
once they have your number they have your identification
if you try to do anything like not identify yourself to the government they know who you are
that's true
they know how much money you make a week to probably your
i've lost my train of thought
the soc-
you were talking about what the federal government knows about people
they probably know everything from half the time what time you go to the bathroom
that's a little bit extreme
they could know anything and everything about you
i'd like to have my gun
if they go to banning them i'd lose my gun
we wouldn't lose our shotgun
we're wanting to get a couple of more that no one knows about
i don't
do you find it difficult picking up guns that are not registered
i can buy some today if i wanted to
just put up the money
you can look in the
it's a bargain thing
you go and always see guns in there
there's no waiting period on that
it took us all of twelve hours
i'm sure it'd be even less for somebody with a good gun
i think the federal government is really far away from control
i don't believe in
i shouldn't probably say control
i would like to see them have a monitoring capability so that they know who has what weapons
i agree with you there
we could look at our paychecks and see how much control they have
i can't complain too much
i don't know if its their proposal or one that's being seriously kicked around
i've always felt for a long time that i think that all young kids ought to do a stint primarily in the military
they have it mandatory for at least the young men
you take israel everybody does
teaches a lot
i went in the service when i was eighteen
and stayed in for ten years
did a lot of growing up
that's how he put himself through school basically
he didn't have a chance to
he had to do something to
he did
he was very successful
my parents wanted to send me to college
i was dead set against it
i had wanderlust
i got in
after wasting the first six years partying and everything else i decided uh-huh time to settle down and do something
i started to work on my education
course my job was such that i couldn't do it as much as i wanted still i ended up going two semesters when i got out just to get my degree
i've been in school ever since
there's other kinds of service to the country that could be done
if you don't like
working in the national parks
working clean up the roadsides i've always felt that people on welfare should be required to spend
None
all this money that we're throwing away to pay people to go out and do things when we're paying all these welfare recipients
if they're able-bodied people i don't see any problem at all with having them go out there and if nothing else get a group of them together and take them around to old folks places and let them cut the yards paint the houses
None
his sole job was just tracking down people who were getting benefits and able-bodied
he had all kinds of horror stories
these guys go down there and get their unemployment checks
back in those days they also use to give
i have a hard time dealing with that
what i hear one time that he said that if the money that goes into welfare each year was to be given directly to the people without all the middle people in the government bureaucracy each person would receive like forty-five thousand dollars
i was astounded
you think about the layer of bureaucracy between the money and the recipient
somebody's taking that away
there's easily probably six or seven times that amount being spent on the bureaucracy
it's totally ridiculous
i started out when i first got in graduate school
quite honestly i just got so fed up with it i just couldn't stand it any more
this is the kind of thing you look at
when you're writing up budgets you wonder okay how much money do we need
you need x number dollars for the recipients
you need x number dollars to administer the program
just ridiculous
there's got to be a different way
it'll never happen
these people out here getting that money are big voting blocks
i think there ought to be some kind of assistance as far as
i would limit it strictly to something like tuition assistance
they'll help the country eventually too
that's only going to help
look at the statistics
it's sad
we've got the lowest rates of the civilized countries in science and math
what are we becoming
now we're not going to do it because everybody is beating us at the game
they did it better than we do
on the other hand we kind of lose out
i think that if young people had service to the country might give them more ambition
it can be good for them too
even the greedy kids that we've got now
god you go to the mall
you see fourteen year old kids flaunting money because the parents give them money to go down and play video games all night for what
i'll teach them something good
you know why they do it is so they can get them out of the house
that's my other complaint
they've relinquished their parenting
as a substitute teacher for a year i can say yes
i talked with somebody else about that another time
when i's in graduate school working on my master's degree in math i was teaching as part of the program
i just love teaching
that's probably the most fun i had
it helped me out because i learned things and learned how to do things differently
when come time to get out of school i thought boy i'd like to teach
for what
i don't want to live in a little one bedroom apartment the rest of my life
that's a sad thing to think
that's kind of selfish on my part
i admit that
in a way it is
you have to look out for yourself
that's some-
when we pay garbage men more than we pay teachers
yeah
i have a great deal of admiration for these people who can go out there and do that
there's a sense of priorities here too
we need
when it gets right down to it
one's import-
on the other hand you take a garbage man in new york city starts out at twenty-six thousand dollars
i bet you there's a whole bunch of homeless people up there who would take that job for thirteen thousand dollars a year
my other pet peeve is unions
it's ridiculous the way unions have gone
they served a good function
they served a good function
there are enough laws on the books now that unions are outdated
they're only there to perpetuate their own power structure
they
they were having a hard time
they told the strikers there look
else we're going to be out of business
they wouldn't come back
they went bankrupt
they all lost their jobs
it's like
that's really what happened to the steel industry in this country
so many times you had the coal miners and steel workers going out at the same time
that took care of that industry i'll tell you
detroit worked awfully hard on stopping car manufacturing in this country
they're trying to do that now with the imports
we've never caught up
i don't think we ever will
here it is
we've got to go into partnership with the japanese to build cars
back to the original subject
you could organize something just within your community
that's a great idea
i think they ought to take them and i don't know just have sort of like a manpower pool and say okay look
what's wrong with it or if anything is wrong with it and what we can do about it what should be done about it
one thing that pops into my mind real quick is about the funding of the school system right now
evidently that's a big problem
it's amazing
i always thought that teachers never got paid nearly enough
to be doing what they're doing
when i was in college i enjoyed teaching
i did some teaching part-time
i really enjoyed that
i wouldn't want to go teach high school or junior high
it just all the problems
lord yeah
you talk about stress and pressure
they're being paid probably half what most people being paid
we're paying basketball people millions of dollars a year for what
they poof it off do like tarpley
i
what gets me is i can't believe that our state legislature can't come up with some kind of workable means to have funds for the school
it's
do you have little kids or what
i have a sister that's a school teacher
my wife and i have a three year old almost four and a two year old
we're looking at the older one going to school next year not this coming fall but the year after that
it's getting close
we're thinking about that
they going be taught something
we're going to be involved in our child's education
because i guess we don't trust the school system which is very sad
if it doesn't start at home it's not going to go anywhere
we're going to try to teach him good values because when they get to upper level school and they start teaching them hey if you can play football or basketball that's what's important not if you can read or write or understand some science
give me a break
that's bogus
one thing my wife and i've talked about are private schools
whether we would want to invest in private schools as they're growing up because just in the dallas area we're not real comfortable with the public schools
dallas school district just recently got an advised status because of their low quality schooling
we were hoping the school districts going to be good for resale value and
i can definitely see on down the road where we do have kids and are getting to that age that's going to be a definite concern
you talked before about the school funding
i think what's going to have to happen is there's going to have to be tuition for grade school and junior high and high school kids
that's the only way they're going to fund it because if they start raising taxes for property people are going to throw a fit
that's
i don't think any politician's going to do that
the only thing they would think of would be tuition
that's going to affect the people that are having kids in school of course which is probably the only fair thing to do
it will be hard for those that people that have in school because they have to pay out even more
it's going to really hurt the middle class people i think
because they're the ones that will probably have to carry the brunt of the load
most of the problems with kids in school carrying guns and knives and everything
good grief what's
that's just unbelievable to me
when i was in junior high and high school that never happened
we didn't even think about it
now what do we have now
got kids that either got a magnum gun school
good grief
i'd be afraid to b- teaching or even being a student
think what's it going to be like for my oldest son when he goes to school
i'm afraid for him to go
there again you can't hold them back
you want to encourage them to be active and everything in school
with all the peer pressure that's going on with all the negative things it's a tough environment to be growing up in
that was
i graduated high school in nineteen seventy-nine
it's lot different now
what's it going to be like in another twelve years when my oldest son is in high school
i'm afraid to even think about it
yeah that is a scary thought
i don't know
i guess what you have to do is just keep encouraging them and try to be open with them so that you can deal with the problems as they come up
you got to be your child's best friend i guess
even when they're a teenager and they are kind of standoffish
still you got to be their best friend because when they've got problems who they going to go to their friends that are dealing drugs or your parents
if they go to their friends dealing drugs they're going to be in even worse shape
the schools don't really encourage to stay away from that
maybe i'm wrong because i haven't been in that kind of environment for a long time
it just is amazing
of course if i say this is a good value someone else is going to stand up and say no
the a c l u is going to get after them and have a lawsuit
which is going to take twenty years to resolve
i think you touched on it
that's where they get the deep rooted values
that's about right
then you just have to hope and pray that everything works out okay
i got to be going
hey i appreciate the call
have a good life
this is quite a long distance
how come you don't have any now
i live in an apartment building
it's just not feasible
i'd love to have a dog
i've got a little doggy that i've had quite a long time
she's a poodle
a toy poodle
i got my mom a teacup little mutt
it's funny how i acquired this animal
when i was married my ex-wife had said that she had a friend who had a little puppy that she needed
the woman needed someone to baby-sit
this is what she had told the kids
she even told me that
after the two week period was up she then informed me that the woman no longer wanted the little puppy and wanted to know if we wanted to keep it
for sure
after you had an animal for a
i've had this dog now for sixteen years
she's been a lot of company
she's however getting a little old
things are starting to fail
i live alone now
she stays in the house all day while i go to work
she's been holding herself pretty well up until recently where she's been having accidents in the house because she either is losing control or she forgets where she is
i find a little present on the floor
she's usually pretty good
my mother has one that's
it's teacup
it's
just i e-
the way my mom's presence countenance is just for having a puppy
having this dog
possibly four
it's really made such a difference for her
i really would like to
i'm a disabled person i'm unable to really take care of a pet
if that weren't so i would certainly have one
i just
you might want to get yourself an animal that doesn't require much attention like a cat
i typically am not a cat person
i have a friend that has on occasion brought her cat over for me to keep
this cat is like no other cat i have ever seen
it would sleep on my chest
it's just a great cat
my personal preference is a dog
i don't know that i would ever want a cat
i like cats
you don't own cats
they're affectionate
they own you or
grant you with you their presence
when i come home in the evenings my dog greets me at the door
i don't know that a cat would do that
she knew whether to quietly come up to me or to just run and knock me over
she really could pick up on my mood the way i walked in the door
it was uncanny
i think in a way we're able to read each other pretty well because she knows when i'm upset and i know when she's not feeling good too
i know when she has an accident i know she's not doing it on purpose
when she was younger she used to do that to get even with me
some people might not believe that
i do
if i put her in a room all by herself and close the door and leave her there for a few hours because i was going out she would break something or rip up the carpet or do something just to let me know that she was unhappy with what i did
i had that cat that i mentioned alfie
one morning the first thing you do is you get up and you feed this cat something and you make sure that it can get to its litter box
for some reason during the night the door was not quite wide enough for it to get through
the next morning when my roommate got up and did not feed it right away it decided that it was going to protest
it jumped up on my bed and anointed my blanket
for me looking at me eye to eye
it was about two years ago she got sick on me
i took her to the vet's because she wasn't eating and she wasn't able to jump
she lost all her activity
she stayed there for one day
the doctor called me up and said she had a low white cell count and that she was dying and suggested that i take her to a animal hospital
i took his suggestion
i took the dog to the dog hospital there
they said they'd keep her there for three days
she ended staying there five days at a hundred and something dollars a day because she was in intensive care
the vet sent me a bill for what he did
then she recouped
she got sick on me again
i brought her to a different vet this time
i told the vet what medication i had given her and everything
he gave me the same medication that i gave her the last time
she was okay
she's been okay every since
that's great
the problem is if someone would have came up to me and said it's going to cost you five hundred dollars to keep your dog alive
what they do is is they say it's going to cost twenty dollars for tests and forty dollars for this
it creeps up on you
you don't know that
you don't know what it's going to until it's all over
to give you an example my mom had an elderly cat who whoever evidently got a hold of it
the cat got sick
she took the cat to the vet
she had the cat there for two days
the cat died
the doctor had called her up and said your cat died
you owe me this bill
by the way do you want me to bury the cat
it cost her three hundred dollars
she didn't get the cat back
they had to pay for all the medical bills that the cat ran up plus the burial expenses
that was kind of a surprise
even the
they claimed they did the best that they could have
then the cat died
i'm looking for another cat for them
i've got a little kitten that's still just being born right now
another five or six weeks
that will make their day
i think it will
they're both in their seventies and the cat although it's a little bit of work for them sometimes it turns out to be a pleasant experience for them
i think they enjoy that
for cats anyway
the same here
you take care
what do you do to exercise
i weight train three days on and one day off
i ride bicycles
i play basketball couple times a week
that's what i do
i guess i bicycle
the amount varies
i guess a play softball one night a week
i backpack a lot over the summer
that's about the extent of it
i don't do any of those things particularly for exercise
i guess the bicycling is the one thing i'll sort of do if i feel like i need to go exercise
i do it mostly for fun
what do you ride a bunch of hills or pretty flat
it varies
out near my house is pretty hilly
sometimes i bike to work which is about a fifteen mile trip each way
that's mostly flat
about forty-five fifty minutes
how does that work out with storing your bike and showering and all that
basically i work on a campus
i can store my bike in my office and walk across the campus to the gym use the shower there it's enough of a pain that i did it consistently one year
i would commute every day
it just became such a pain
we're talking forty-five fifty minutes for biking
and sometimes longer if you had adverse wind and then another half an hour to cool down and take a shower and all this kind of stuff
it was a big hunk of the day
of course another hour to get back home
i've been doing that less and concentrating more on light biking when i get home on the evening and then some more on the weekends
i guess mostly i bike on my own
though i haven't gone on any extended trips with it
actually my wife just got me into it
i did an internship at the institute for aerobics research in dallas
i learned all the health benefits of
all i did was weights and aerobic exercise
my wife got me into the aerobic exercise and said you really need to do it
once i got into this internship i learned all the physiological advantages to it
i began a program i don't know probably three or four weeks ago
i did my first bike rally this saturday
i did forty miles
that's the longest i've ever ridden so far
i usually fifteen or twenty
it was kind of hilly
it was pretty tough
i'm looking at doing a lot more of it because my wife is really into it
i see
i kind of held her back a little bit this weekend
she wanted to stay with me
are you think of doing any centuries or
that would be cool sometime if i could work up to that
i just wondered if you were going to do that mostly or more like
one's more just
that's
i may do that sometime
it's kind of funny
i was just reading through a bicycle magazine and going through all the different tours coming up
around texas you got about five or six
that's nice
i didn't know that until i came down here and
i lived in indiana all my life
you may say see one or two guys on a bicycle above the age of fifteen or something other than that it's nothing up there like it is down here
generally in the midwest it seems to be much less
maybe it's because of the winters
or maybe just because there's a lot more flat lands out in the west
it makes biking a better alternative for transportation
there's a lot of bikers around here
it's really neat
there are a lot of resources a lot of magazines and stuff
little texas bicyclist is a little newspaper that comes out every month
just go to the bike shop and pick it up
it's got all the rides coming up
i guess i'm going to be busy about every saturday this summer
that's terrific
how long have you been biking
i guess as an adult for just about the past three years or so
i guess last time i did it before that was college which was about ten years ago
yeah
i guess i just never really thought about it much for a while until i suddenly discovered all my friends were basically biking a lot
i thought i'd try it too
have you ever had a blood workup done recently or since you've been biking
from what i understand it really improves your cholesterol
that's great
i've definitely noticed it's had a good effect on my resting pulse
it gets it down to about forty
that's hard-core
there are some people
they've got a mountain bike
with the big knobby tires
i don't do that
i pretty much lay off for the winter
i was thinking of getting rollers for the last winter because it will help your balance when you're indoor training
i just more or less stocked an exercise bike and that kind of thing
winters are kind of a problem
i'm more or less out of shape now that i've been biking i guess this year for just a couple of weeks
up here
it's pretty good
the main thing i guess for me is just to enjoy it because once it starts seeming like exercise and a chore
you change up your routes a lot and keep a
i try to go someplace pretty different every week
i rotate around about four different routes from my house
i'll sometimes come in the school
it's nice riding to school because it's all along a canal path
it's along the erie canal up here
what school is it
university of rochester
it's fairly picturesque
it's a good ride
got a guy that rides a hundred and fifty miles a week
that's motivating
it was good talking to you
good talking to you
keep up the good work
far as crime in the cities i'm sure like in yours it's pretty bad
probably the biggest thing we've got going now is the robberies
i don't actually live in the city
i'd probably say that's roughly right
crimes against property seem to outnumber crimes against life
i think with the current war on drugs and all this kind of stuff i'd say probably the police department would claim the number one crimes are probably solicitation of prostitution and sale of drugs
probably right if you look at it from that stand point
is there anything that you particularly are concerned with in your particular area as far as security and that sort of thing
where i live now it's not so bad
i can basically leave my front door unlocked and not have to worry about it
i do have friends that live in the city
i think that they get a lot of fallout from this war on drug thing just because there are crack houses on their street and stuff like this
do you live in a real small town or out in the country
how far out from the city do you
i live in a little suburb which i guess from dallas is twelve miles or so it's pretty congested
it doesn't really feel like you're in the country
our major crimes in our immediate town is probably house robberies and very few instances of alcohol drugs reported
right now our neighborhood is running about eighty percent of the homeowners have been robbed
sometime during their existence in that neighborhood
since that time everybody's got some sort of burglar system or burglar alarms and including the outer perimeter type devices
it's cut back considerably
it just shifts it from our neighborhood to another neighborhood to other neighborhood
it still remains city wide pretty high
are there any theories on why this is happening
i would say the majority of it's happening during the day between probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon
most families are young
both people are working
they're happening during the hours they're gone from work
i would say that's probably their prime motivation
they'll stock your house and look at your pattern and then go from there
they're professionals
they classify most of them as professionals
you get a few of them that are a little bit sloppier just taking just junk items that they can just get ten to twenty bucks for real quick
probably the biggest items that you get in our neighborhood would be the high classed automobiles
the mercedes volvos things that they can get big dollars for and the jewelry are the major targets
very few penny ante stuff
what do you think can be done to reduce that sort of crime
the police force for one
i think they could definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use
right now i think we are about thirty thousand people
there's only eight officers that patrol for that amount of people which is not very many
that's going to tend to
it seems to me that sort of approach will tend to simply make the cost of committing the crime slightly higher
course in our particular state we have the prison overcrowding whatever
they're giving the early release
it's
i think what they need to do is stop building more jails and start giving stiffer sentences
for the
you think that would be a deterrent
that would certainly be a deterrent
not necessarily give in to their human rights desires
if they're overcrowded just keep cramming them in there till they just suffocate
what about an innocent person who happens to have been found guilty
i think they'd have to go to extra measures to make sure a person's guilty in a lot of cases
course i know you can't be a hundred percent foolproof
you'd rather see it harder to convict somebody
to convict somebody
those convicted especially of murder and major crimes
to reach the life sentences and death penalties and follow-through with that
especially in the case of murder i know in my case my wife and daughter were kidnapped
my goodness
during a house robbery back in eighty-five the individuals got caught
two counts of kidnapping the forty-five to the head just the mental anguish and the whole nine yards the guy only got five years
he was out within two months because of the parole system
what
did you sue him under the civil system
you could probably sue him for mental anguish or something right
the insurance companies and all that tried to go after him
they said he has no job
there's nothing that he has that you could go after
makes you wish that still had indentured servitude for this sort of thing
very seld-
they give the guy a job in prison and make him pay his damn debt
you don't
None
they been in jail before
they've been released several times which is another
deal i hate to see
basically the guy commits three major crimes
i think that's re-
we're out fifteen thousand dollars
the guy gets out in two months
he goes out and commits it again
what
what deterrent does he really have
i think in our particular neighborhood vigilantism is becoming a real possibility
my god
we've had a couple instances where break ins where the people have actually shot the people return offenders have
they've actually waited for them where they've robbed particular neighborhood
then other people will wait up and wait for somebody to do something else try to take it in their own hands
nevertheless
i think people are just getting fed up and saying you can't arrest all of us
you can get some of us
we're beginning to see more and more of that
that's a deterrent too if you think the home owner might be armed right and awake here you break in
you're going to get shot
that's certainly a possibility in
we have had a few cases where the guy has broken in during the middle of the night and gotten himself shot to death
it helps for a while then just another different set of people come in
most of the people are transients from outside of the state
i would say probably eighty percent of them that are caught they're from places like up in oklahoma and louisiana arkansas across the border
people who don't readily read the newspapers in our town or whatever it's not many from the local communities
it's a problem
i think that the court systems need to be more stiffer in their penalties
giving the police agencies a little bit more jurisdiction over what they do when they catch these people
i tend to agree with you
i think what i would like to see is number one completely getting rid of these victimless crimes and worry about these things where people are getting hurt
i think one of the big things that you can do to increase deterrence is if someone is found guilty of a felony level offense they lose their citizenship
they lose their constitutional rights
just a lot of things that we're trying to worry about protecting these people from we just don't protect them
i know in my wife's case they made her feel like the criminal
i think that's ridiculous
they went to all
since then we have painted the bedroom
i painted the outside of my house and one bathroom
i have that problem with the ceiling the blown ceiling
where you get around the edge
that is hard
i asked janice or somebody recently how you do that when you paint the ceilings where you have got that textured stuff that they have special rollers that are real soft and furry that you paint that with
how do you get the edge though
the straight edge
i see
we use a two inch brush on a slant that mostly does it even though you still make mistakes
are you going to paint the outside of your house too
the people that own the house they pay for anything like that that we do
as far as the materials
i am thinking i am going to change it to something
that will be nice
or two tone
i have a problem
we can't paint the chimney
you have got to get one of those ladders
that is what he
he has finished everything except the chimney
we did too
it's just too high
the only thing i would consider a professional maybe doing that
our house in new mexico it was stucco
we had all this trim to paint and lots of it
we did basically seventy-five percent of the house
then i was afraid to do the eaves way up high and stuff
i hired this man to come in and do it a young kid
he came with his own raf-
those where you built a rafter thing
i know what you are talking about scaffold
i think he charged me a hundred dollars to finish up
literally i wouldn't have done it with the scaffolds because all the places that i had left for him were above huge humongous cactus if he fell he was dead
he knew that
that was worth it getting a professional for that
he cleaned up my mess
other than that it was pretty easy doing it ourself and caulking it and everything ourself
you think
we did two heavy coats over it
then that way you are assured you did a good job than you are if you hire someone to do it
that friend of mine that painted his house out there in your neighborhood he went i guess to buy his paint yet he bought seventeen gallons
anyway when he checked out
they only charged him for one gallon of paint thirteen bucks or something
my word
he had already carried a ladder outside and told her that
she wrung all that stuff up and made a mistake on the price of the paint she had to start all over again when he got outside he noticed his receipt was thirteen ninety-nine or something
my word
he saw
that was really worth it painting his own house
it was over two hundred dollars worth of free stuff
my word
my word
he really saved in that way
i think we are going to do another bathroom
i think i will probably just do it in a roller
rollers are so messy
i know
it's the textured wall
a little paintbrush
None
gun control seems to be a rather timely topic with all that's going on legislation wise
the interesting scale that they assigned it the one being a banned and ten being no regulations or totally free
i don't mind regulating the guns
i would certainly call for a ban on certain types
the wisdom as to which types that's going to be a debate forever i would assume
the method of controlling it that's all into how much money you want to put into the controls
one point that was made in the
the representative stood up and said we can check a guy's credit card instantly
we don't want to check his background
of course those are two different issues as far as privacy goes
there still the technology exists to check it if they want
it's kind of a
you've got the group of people that decide that there's no particular reason to have them at all
you got to balance those against the ones that say there is some sport to it
i guess i would fall more in the realm that i like the sport issue of it
i could give it up without too much trouble
it costs a bit to do finding ranges and things like that
i have shot a variety of guns for a number of years
it's just not like golf or whatever
there are other things that you could go do
i don't see the joy of shooting as that much of a driving factor
i don't have that problem
boy you can get them on either side
just like you say
i guess i'd have to place myself probably seven or eight
that
two or three
we had a neighbor child that was killed by another child because they had a gun in the house
the father kept the bullets in a separate place
the little boy was five years old and was intelligent enough to
he knew where both places were loaded the gun
they were playing cowboys and indians
he shot the other little boy right between the eyes
it destroyed two families in just that instant
a lot of people say that they need it for protection
then that
if you live anywhere real close that
the safety is
we have never had a gun in the house with my children growing up
i
once knew a fellow that had had been a policeman
he said that if you pull a gun on a robber he's going to assume that you know how to use it well
he's going to try to shoot first
if not
then usually they
they
i'm when my handicapped son is not at home i'm by myself
there's
the rare
the very few of those burglaries actually occur in such a way that you knew the guy was coming
had time to do anything about it
i don't have that problem
n r as claim that the the constitutional the right to bear arms and that whole statement
i don't see it as that that difficult of a
you have a earn a right
there's all sorts of arguments there i don't even want to worry about what the original intent was
we change our rights with our social status
they can be taken away by a man
i know
even here where i work we have a gun club
of course those people are very avid
i can't see why any o- on the street citizen should be able to be allowed to have a machine gun
when you were talking about maybe what kind of guns that would be hard to decide
there are a few guns that just are not sport
None
i think they should have at least some control over over those things
when you were speaking about how they can check up on credit cards
i understand about the privacy act everything
why can't they check to see if the person who is applying for this gun has had a record or not
if they do
course the argument with the people in the gun club is that the people that are going to get guns are the ones that are going to steal them anyway
it's not going to be that they're buying them
it it is a hard question
it's very difficult to legislate crooks or however you want to word it it's
this may be a never ending topic
i'd better let you go
thanks for talking
is that right
that helped out a little bit i think
he tends to go into a lot of detail sometimes
i don't think he was truthful in a lot of what he did in texas
i wasn't sure how credible he was
is that right
what do you think we've gained from the spaceflights
this going to the moon seemed to be a exciting adventure
i don't know that it really benefitted mankind that much
is that right
i've actually worked for the company that has been blamed for the challenger disaster morton thiakol
that's been kind of a real negative feeling here
is it was very unfortunate thing that occurred there
we live in utah
great
i'm in dallas
that's how we got hooked up to the program was her husband works for penney's there
no my last name is skidmore
her husband's name is his last name is weight
you probably know a lot about it
i wasn't sure that they were blaming that space disaster on one company
they were
there was
apparently the specifications for the joints
they were not to perform in cold weather
apparently there was definitely a joint that did not
if you've ever seen the size of those motors that put them into space
they're as long as a football field practically and about twelve foot in diameter
there is a lot of thrust to get that much weight up in the air
this book was interesting though
talked about how a lot of the problems they have to overcome to
it's a very complex situation to go into space
the thing that he went into quite a bit of detail about how much of a problem it is to re-enter the earth's atmosphere
they have to come in at just the right angle
if you come in at the wrong angle what happens is they bounce off and go back into space if they come into it at a different angle there is so much friction that it burns them up
i saw some of those early space capsules at smithsonian
you could see the scorch on them
they had though piles you could see how hot it got because it was still the scorch on them which was quite interesting
go ahead
i've i've never i've never seen an actual capsule
i've seen more of the motors that they produced out there
these were the ones that john glenn went up in and the old old ones
people have commented how they were surprised at how small they were
they just
looked pretty confining
the whole thing was small
you actually put it on
i thought there was some medical benefits that we have learned from space
did he go into that in the book
not really
i know one thing they've mentioned that i didn't get from the book by the way
it talked about
they're able to manufacture different kinds of crystals and ball bearings and things like that in a zero gravity state that they turned out being nearly perfect as far as a ball bearing goes
i'm not sure you have to go to outer space to achieve that zero gravity
that's true
do you think we should continue to support it at the level
i thought probably one of the things they were doing that they didn't tell us was spying
i think those satellites or not satellites but the spaceflights could really spy
with russia's demise i didn't know if we should continue to support it at the current level
i think they have cut it back to be honest with you
from the glory days when they did the apollo shots to the moon
i appreciate having the satellites
that's certainly made it nice for other purpose
we don't i know that's certainly helped a lot in that regard
the topic's about government
i'm not altogether sure that that's my best topic
i i think people tend to think that the government is not corrupt
that's what i would like to think
i i think that the last part of that question was particularly interesting about how much unethical behavior can be made illegal because it seems to me that when
maybe that's what is happening
maybe so many things have become public with the media over the past ten to twenty years that it becomes more evident
perhaps things that we didn't think of before and just concentrated on the lawmaking or the results that would be seen in public works or bills that are passed or et cetera like that we were just not exposed to the personal lives of these persons
i couldn't help thinking when that last part of the question came about how many things can we actually put a legal code on
you start prying in people's private lives you ruin their lives as well as
sometimes i don't even know how much of a difference it really makes
i guess in some cases we care about what they did in the past sometimes i don't know i think it gets in the way of the better judgment
just because you did something in the past doesn't mean he's not a good enough person to be a politician
i i agree with that and also that if the results that they're putting out and what they actually seem to be accomplishing by legitimate means is what's going to the public then they'll pay for their private life in their own private conscience
when it becomes public though it becomes scandalous
that's that's the thing that
things that you don't know do do not worm their way around and influence other people or perhaps lead other people astray
people could say they do it
i guess
as soon as things do get public there is that terrible concern
sometimes i ask myself what are people doing that are in the media when somebody comes up to office
i guess it's what sells newspapers
as far as myself having any particular personal knowledge or insight into politics or politicians i'm not terribly involved in it
i try to do whatever i can on the little local area
i i- it just is not one of the things that i have placed a lot of my particular time and effort into
i always feel very outside
i just kind of read the paper follow up on peop- just keep an eye on what's going on i don't really play an active role in any kind of politics
i'm not in there
i'm not one of those volunteers that's down at headquarters and whatever although i admire the people that do that
they certainly do get inside information of course the better you know a person that might be affiliated with that kind of thing the more you can trust their judgment and their insight
the media insight as you said
a golden retriever
that's one of my favorite kinds of dogs
he just had his fourth birthday
we got him when he was about eight weeks old
he's pretty okay
he just went to the vet yesterday to get his shots and everything
they put him on the scale
he's up to ninety four now
he's not a real tall dog for a golden retriever
it's just me and my wife
he's kind of our temporary substitute for having kids
we have a cat who's also about four years old
he also sheds a lot
we hope to get a golden retriever someday
we figure we'll get the kids and then the dog
have you ever had a retriever before
my husband had one when he was growing up
i find that they're good around other animals like cats and other dogs
is your dog an inside and outdoors
we're kind of in not a real busy neighborhood but more so than i'd want him to be out too much
he doesn't like it if we tie him outside
when it comes to being alone
if you give him the freedom to walk around and go wherever he wants he likes that
he does not like to be tied outside
he'll just bark and bark and bark
when he gets outside does he run away and then eventually come back
he's taken to the training pretty well
he knows where our yard is
we have a pretty small yard
he seems to know the boundaries
he usually is good about staying within them
our next door neighbors have a dog too
she is good friends with my dog
he often gets to smelling her scent and will go over there to sniff around and stuff
if i catch him i call him
he comes back
he's pretty good about taking to commands and things
i trained him on my own
this is the first dog i've had all my own as an adult
we've had dogs when i was a kid
this is the first one that i took in
i wasn't sure if i'd be able to get it all right the first time
he seems to have picked it up pretty well
just firm tone of voice and those sorts of things
i see other people out there
they hit their dogs and try to
those horrible collars that they put on them with invisible fencing
it's a system you can put in your yard where you bury these little transducers or emitters in your yard at the perimeter
they wear a collar with a special little attachment on it
if they get too close to that perimeter it zaps them
a friend of mine at work here said that he tried it with his dog
he wanted to see what he was subjecting his dog to
he held on to the collar
he walked out to the perimeter
i don't take too well to those sorts of training techniques
is your cat an indoor cat or an outdoor cat
yeah he's indoor and all declawed because i know the average life span of an outdoor cat is eighteen months
that and also just getting hit i guess or getting beat up
the average life span of an indoor cat is eighteen years
what kind of climate do you have
we just moved recently
now we're in the dallas area
it's very nice
i guess i am
it just seems kind of funny that this is a topic of discussion
i do some woodworking myself
in fact i'm in the middle of a project right now making a bed for my son
what kind of pine
it's it's plywood face i guess
i cut it out in the shape of a crayon box
i painted about eight different colors
the crayons that are sticking up it will be the headboard
he'll be delighted
it got delayed for a little bit because of work
now i've got to jump back in and finish the
i've got it all cut out
it's all
i've got to go a second layer with the yellow
do you have powered
i did jigsaw and the regular straight saw for some of it
to do th- the turn cut
how about yourself
i am interested in woodworking
our local schools have adult education in the evening i use their tools a- an- and some of their guidance
i'm very handy
if i touch it it turns into something us-
what type of art do you focus on
i'm very
my projects had to do with acrylic painting
i'm really interested in the crafts
i kind of
once i get really pretty good at something i want to try something else
i get good enough to sell it or have people say wow
it's like the thrill is gone
let's do something else
i'm signed up for a class in pottery making
you have a m f a in what division of art
i actually have a masters of art
it's in art education
i'm a licensed teacher
jobs being what they are i substitute teach that way i have time for my kids too
i've been fortunate that i can afford to work part-time
they're cutting back
i don't go in all that often
i've been real interested in some of those cute country kind of things
i see stuff in craft galleries for five hundred dollars
i say no
None
i make it
i love to cook
that's great
i saw a silver necklace that had these little teeny weeny silver spatulas and and knife and a fork and all kinds of stuff i went
i signed up for class because then again you get someone to guide you
you get the tools you don't feel like buying
i made a necklace that i saw in a gallery for three hundred twenty dollars
it didn't
if it cost me twenty dollars
i
then i saw one of these country looking wood watermelons
the watermelon the red with the seeds painted in
i got two six foot inch thick boards turned into a watermelon
cutting that wedge out was no joke
i'm sure
the teacher was one of these negative people
that's dangerous
i'm going how about this way
i want to do that
we did get the wedge cut out by building some kind of a cradle for it
you used a handsaw or a backsaw
the instructions in the book i had said use a coping saw
there's no coping saw big enough for a fourteen inch wide watermelon and
we built a cradle for it
we got one cut out on the radial saw
getting the other one out without the slice now flying in your face was something you had to think about
did you cut a quarter wedge in this
i'd say it's about an eighth
jus-
i'm envisioning a watermelon like a log
what i've seen of this kind before is you have the
 yeah
 yeah
 okay
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 yes
 uh-huh
 so do we
 yeah
 right
 that is a really pretty state park
 uh-huh
 i'm not sure
 i'm actually in the air division
 it's a similar thing
 i have in the past
 
 you buy something on credit
  yeah 
 no
 and always kind of thought that too  kind of an extra buffer 
 i'm sure the people love golf up there like they do down here
 true
 we still have a lot to see though
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
 it just breaks my heart to see these poor little old dogs wandering the streets looking starved
 yeah
 oh
 okay
 yeah
 yeah
 yes
 right
 well that uh that i think may go on a lot
 uh-huh
 not
 right
 yeah
 yeah
  to  a certain extent
 oh
 diagram
 yeah
 yeah
 
 up until his death
 do you think there's very many really good day-care centers around your area
 yeah
  yeah 
 we're renting a house
 
 yeah
 yeah
 no
 i hope you get better
  uh-huh 
 everything all parts of the food
 right
 can't say it
  right 
 no
 with a baggy sweatshirt
 how'd you do that
 i'm going to check that
 okay
 it's usually not a one time accidental thing i don't think
 uh-huh
 i still believe i get very fed up with government sometimes
 uh-huh
 it's all the dirt i have
 so which is fine you know
 uh-huh
 
 right
 we'll see you
 that is
  wren 
 you must have some of their lines memorized
 uh-huh
 twelve children
 i was going to say you didn't have the typical
 yeah
 yeah
 i found that out
 yeah
 i'm not in the middle of anything
 okay
 yeah
 yeah
 oh really
 yeah
 i do too
 yeah
 they eat it one to two meals everyday in north africa
 i like that
 was c n n
 right
 a little bit better than some of the others
 yeah
 a ring at all
 yeah
 yeah
  yeah
 uh-huh
 warren moon's an  excellent
 yeah
 uh-huh
 oh shoot
 yeah
 they were just covered with them
 right
 all right
 
 yeah
 how do people in texas deal with dallas houston and san antonio
 i've noticed that
 exactly
 uh-huh
 me too
 uh-huh
 whereas it would have been
 the engine blew up
 okay
  right 
 
 that's true
 
 it's just a point that i have observed that we
 
 uh-huh
 we need rain really bad
 yeah
 yeah    
 he was raised in the south
 you probably have some friends that have television
 my god i can't imagine
 i'm trying to think what else is on television
 right
 yeah
  okay 
 uh-huh
 i really like   a lot
 the grass was dead everywhere
 
 when we had our larger cars we didn't mind uh keeping them up
 uh-huh
 those were not good cars
 yeah
 i'm not really expecting to get anything out of it
 
 yeah
 as long as it's not used to delay the trial so much
 that's true
 uh-huh
 right
  i'm a historian 
  golly 
 the language barriers
 if something is out of style i do not really care
 one is bad enough
 uh-huh
  yeah 
 not
 do i have kids
 y-
 i guess it just couldn't handle
 they do yes
 those people down there don't really
 uh-huh
 yeah
 no
 for which if they would just pay me enough money i would be willing to consider
 i've got a lot of
 sure
 interestingly   in honduras
 we've all got to do it right now
 gone are the days of those things they use-
 i don't know
 that has broadened so much also
 exactly
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 a girl
 like i say i've made a couple of calls to texas and just talked to all different kinds of people
 oh
 i try to keep it pretty reasonable
 yes
 yeah
 no
 yes
 it was just a total fiasco
 really
 uh-huh
 there was no trees where i was from in amarillo
 yeah
 lubbock is
 uh-huh
 be interesting to see when as mexico develops industrially whether you know without
 yeah
 it depends on the state you live actually
 we're sort of like the middle east peace talks ourselves
 i haven't
 yeah
  uh-huh 
 i do too
 really
 yeah
 uh-huh
 right
 seems like it takes so long between conviction and carrying out the penalty that i don't see that it makes any difference to sentence anybody
 makes a lot of difference
 that's exactly right
 yeah
 i do cringe when i hear some of the problems we've had
 not at all
 even to watch it
 uh-huh
 yeah
 i haven't read his book
 six seven and eight
 i wasn't
 i don't know what it was
 yeah
 okay
 you
 yeah
 exactly
 all within in an hour
  yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 so we've got four cars for our five licensed drivers
 yeah
 yeah
 i see
 uh-huh
 they bring home notes that say they have to get a good night's sleep and eat right in the morning before
 right
 the one
 have you ever had them just come up in different places
 how long have you been in raleigh
 yeah
 uh-huh
  please come back to work 
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 i think it was 
 let me push the button
 sure
 just a little bit of begging will
 yeah
 they made a little patio area where they can go outside
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
  no kidding 
 they have a fish that's called an oyster cracker
 yeah
 uh-huh
 right
 yeah
 young mothers
 
 if i start into something and i really enjoy what i'm reading
 uh-huh
 i wasn't in central america
 we're fixing to get in the car
  i couldn't help myself 
 we got it at a little bit of an incline
 
 to be a lot of fun
 i hate to see that
 in my car and let someone else check the oil even
 uh-huh
 no
 have you ever camped on sand
 what
 just the volume makes a big difference
  uh-huh 
 right 
 that's four each
 it really is
 they like to be outside as much as possible
 uh-huh
 i got to shovel it all lots of fun
 i've even had some of them
 uh-huh 
 the same in some of the areas around here
 right
 yeah
 the first one i got
 yeah
 i just hope it doesn't go up any more
 that's true
 
  that's  really sad
  right
 right
 because there's just not enough of me to drive them around everywhere
 the men that are out there fixing power lines are tested a lot
 yeah
 levels of it the one from seventeen hundred til say the end of the civil war
 you're not old
 yeah
 yeah
 frank e
 yes sir
 right
 okay
 i'm just teasing
 yeah
 it's something
 it's so comfortable
 that's right
 right
 there was a high error rate in the analysis of drug results
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
  lawry's  prime rib
 or something like that
  right 
 more especially where you are
 i know
 i did
 uh-huh
 okay
 yeah
 yeah
 bleachers
 cocoon
 uh-huh
 seems like a nice place to go
 when i was a couple of years ago involved in some pretrial stuff and
 it's just i don't have a trailer hitch on my car anymore
 you're buying these knock offs
 uh-huh
 i said no turkey is only for thanksgiving
 uh-huh
 when i was growing up we had cats
 we still have lots of little goldfish
 yes
 yeah
 i think they will probably win one or two more games than they did this year
  to  really be camping
 one is in ninth grade
 yeah 
 that's true
  chairmen 
 d-
 i
 yeah
 little baby kittens dropped and stuff
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 
 i had one lady one time
 uh-huh
 yes
 i said
 i'm not saying just give them money
 that seems to be the norm of most movies
 i just want to kill her
 yeah
 uh-huh
  you  must have come to washington at least once
 that's the whole thing
 right
 he needs to get outside and play
 uh-huh
 oh
  somewhere  on one afternoon
 i don't know where i really come down on it
 
 
 i'm not quite sure
 uh-huh 
 yeah
 okay
 boy that's pretty good
 i don't have one
 my voice you mean
 i now have grandchildren
 i know i really
 exactly
 
 do they time this thing for us
 
 uh-huh

 right
 i like to know where it's going to
 uh-huh

 uh-huh
 in utah
 that's computer stuff
 i imagine
 that's when i was in the elementary school years
 uh-huh
 you're kidding
 i have
 uh-huh
 yeah
 i'm actually working on a data base at home just to keep track of things nothing special
  uh-huh 
 what division you all in
 uh-huh
 you may never get the truth
 yeah
 it's probably true
 uh-huh
 yeah
 i like country and western
 yes
 yeah
 wasn't that what part of the lottery is going to go for if we approve it
 uh-huh
 he had my vote double
 home from work
 right
  know 
 yeah
 yeah
 definitely
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 okay
 okay
 your first ones you mean it
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 right
 do you have a sam's wholesale warehouse up there
 this was yanked
 yeah
  right
 uh-huh
 it's kind of an easy thing to talk about
 okay
 that's where i picked it up
  uh-huh
 right
 yes
 you can't get in there
 with a
 the jeezer music as i call it
 you didn't have to mix paint then right
 yes
 i didn't know that
 yeah
 it's good to have a partner
 uh-huh
 we've had a real nice mild spring
 uh-huh
 they fought individually
 they have some wonderful camping areas there
 we do
 do you work
 in the dallas area
 uh-huh
 they said
 i think the kids need some time to play
 the whole lot i'm sitting on is roughly half an acre
 yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 we don't get to go that often
 south padre
 yeah
 we'll catch our news that way
 yeah
 that's funny
   i had no idea 
 i don't go to east texas
 no
 yeah
 i like cows too
 uh-huh
 who do you work for
 yeah
  a lot  of people are
 yeah
 uh-huh
 we- the the middle girl doesn't get a whole lot of attention
 yeah
 yeah
 i think it was like
 as well as hot lunch
 take them off
 yeah
 
 flimsy
 i don't know
 right
 he brought it home
 if you could come up with a device that's the thing
 which is a shame
 i guess you'd have to call them great men in some sense
 that was poor quality i think
 uh-huh
 like you're judging us
 i work for t i
 uh-huh
 right
 everybody in the country is preapproved i think
 it was really
 i found about it on the network
  uh-huh 
 yeah
  i don't know 
 yeah
  right 
 yeah
 okay
 maybe supply some arms or something
 i can you understand that
 do they have many buildings that have security there
 yeah
 
 it is so safe there that you can leave your purse on the subway
 i live in atlanta also
 uh-huh
 i go to a few games
 that's not real surprising
 smell the continuous
 that's part of that propaganda thing
 and colorado springs
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
 the woodworking
 it in a million years to do it myself
 it's
 i'm jealous
 really
  yeah
 yeah
 no
 uh-huh
 yeah
 you're amazed at how much that adds up
 uh-huh
 yeah
  enough  to
 parents and children husbands and wives
 how about your
 i kn-
 that's true
 right
 i can't
 uh-huh
 at that stage of life you only have so much money left
 i don't have
 i'll let you lead out
 right
 that's right
 yeah
 too
 owens
 the car all the time
 it was a really cute little kid too
 they're like
 yeah
 
 really
 yeah
 i mainly play the guitar a lot
  from  acid rain
 uh-huh
 i wouldn't want to look at them
  uh-huh 
 yeah
 we used to camp a lot with our
 yeah
 right
 ye-
  wow that's good 
 they can come from all over the city
  uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 
 there are a number of good movies like that
 do you have children
 but
 yeah
 yeah
 not only can it be fun
 i know
 my goodness
 it's
 it would be hard
 i think they're a little bit biased sometimes
  little  value just in whatever you do
 what about you guys
 was it bad
 right
 that i think is my invasion privacy because it's the government
 i agree
 do you have children
 i'm like  god  
 yeah
 like if you order something through a mail order catalog
 you mean in cable
  yeah 
 yeah
 yeah
 i got it right on the tip of my tongue and can't say it helen something
 uh-huh
  right 
 uh-huh
 yeah
  
 i do too
 i don't know if i have anything handy
 for some reason i just couldn't do it
  i think  it was sixty eighty
 right
 uh-huh
 whoops
 go right to personnel
 uh-huh
 he never really got in a game never did a whole lot
 no
 yes
 uh-huh
 oh
 yeah
  god i  can't believe we moved out of an apartment and had this much stuff
 right
 uh-huh
 oh
 i've
 wow
 uh-huh
 yeah
 you got to take them for walks
 i'm kind of old fashioned i guess that way
 uh-huh
 and raise my children
 a keeshonden
 you're not too surprised on much of anything
 yeah
 yeah
 it's just
 uh-huh
  yeah 
 and then people the the wrong people will just fight their way
 do you
 that's right
 and you got the cars
 yeah
 yeah
 central
 that's
 is she of alzheimer's or something like that
 uh-huh
 yeah
 that's probably what i'll try and look for whenever i do have
 uh-huh
 my husband does
 it'd be nice to be a pro golfer
 interesting
 
 
 the store and come home and sit down and watch it
 was that good
 i think it's a little harsh to say that they should have to spend a year or two
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 you just do it and be done with it and don't worry about it
 yeah
 okay
 about five or six years ago my dad  who plays every now and then took me out with him
 more of that
 what we have
 uh-huh
 i was going to say it must have been wal-mart
 well i've heard this one theory that if that if a kid commits a crime that uh instead of the prosecuting the kid they prosecute the parent
  right 
 yes
 you bet
 they're not cutting in any other corner
 that we can't improve these things
 it was really suspenseful
 okay
 i understand we're supposed to talk about spaceflight
 then you're that much farther ahead
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
  that makes sense 
 yeah
 go out to the nursing home help guide some craft programs perhaps work on some
  right 
 yeah
 yeah
 there were places where she could actually take her
 yeah
 i have heard it is
 just
 yeah
 uh-huh
 that's true
 uh-huh
 yeah
 and you wanted to go back some
 
 okay
 
 go ahead
 right
 i do
  uh-huh
 for some reason they put a bathroom light switch in the hallway
  did you 
 yeah
 uh-huh
 that's easy
 where are you from originally
 it's it's pretty tough that way
 yeah
 uh-huh
 
 well it's a matter of name recognition
 
 i know
 uh-huh
 it was funny
 sure
 i work at texas instruments
 yeah
 that's right
 bu-
 wow
 i love that
 no
 uh-huh
 right
 right
 yeah
 yeah
 yes
 like i said if we don't have we also set aside money for entertainment
 the eagles yeah
 is texas one of them
 yes
 they just used things
 it's just as boring
 right
 all right
 have you ever killed your mother
  uh-huh 
 it wouldn't be perfect
 sometimes called the dismal science
 i try to
 c o u s c o u s
 that's really nice
 it was really enjoyable
 yeah
 i never learned
 yeah
 
 uh-huh
 yeah 
 exactly
 
 it's not just random people
 how about you
 yeah
 uh-huh
 that's one i can watch
 that is one solution to it
 right
 now particulates would come from trash burning or incineration or something like that here in dallas
 oh
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 i was going to read while it was on
 uh-huh
 well pretty soon it's going to get to the point where no one is going to be able to afford to send their kids to college or to do go to college
  yeah 
 yep
 disposal is a problem
 it's loud and repetitious without having a great deal of meaning
 
 but she just wants to be able to have that freedom
 it's hard to say
 how do you like it out there
 uh-huh
 i think so
 uh-huh
 
 yeah
 it's really neat
 boy that's a good deal
 right
 uh-huh
 yeah
 just life in general
 right
 yeah
 yeah
 it sounds like you have a baby there
 it's just if you really want the majority of the people to vote then give them a couple of days
 i guess my husband got a letter at the office
 you don't
 uh-huh
  okay 
 yes
 uh-huh
 that should be a lot of fun
 and i don't know that's true or not
  that  it was a virus
 yeah
 i don't know
 uh-huh
 i have seven cats
 yes
 uh-huh
 what
  uh-huh 
 there are those teams that play in professional national football league
 i don't like it
 yeah
 that's why they want them there because them somebody takes care of them all day
 
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 hearing anyway
 four or five years
 
 she had injured her back and needed a walking partner
 yeah
  uh-huh 
   no  
  uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 i don't
 that gives me plenty of exercise
 absolutely
 i need a hole there
 yes
 i see
 that gets
 uh-huh
 hi
 
 that is for sure
 it
 i almost never watch television as a matter of course
 i was just thinking
 i do
 i think it was just rare
 uh-huh
 
 uh-huh
 that's why i was thinking it couldn't be just a totally funny part
  bye-bye 
 uh-huh
 yeah
 
 i went to
 yeah
 we do a few things
 yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 aspen
 yeah
 definitely agree with that
 you'd think it would carry mostly religious
  he may never have  all those motor skills back
 it was also extremely difficult to stay awake sometimes because there was so many witnesses
 right
 i think that's really important
 oh
 our community doesn't really have any organized recycling drive
 uh-huh
 there is a lot of crime
 i was born in new mexico
 it's a little more understandable under the circumstances i guess
 i have a four year old and a three year old
 no
 i think we realize it's failed
 okay
 wow
 sure
 yes
 okay
 yeah
 did not know that
 ten
 
 uh-huh
 yes
 yeah
 or is it like
 he is in the navy
 it is
 okay
  yeah 
 we like them around
 sure
 yeah
 yeah
 i hope to get up there
  some of the scuds 
 
  just started shooting people 
 i think so too
 
 
 yeah
 they use freon twenty-two in air conditioning systems in houses and the like and heat pumps
 i don't have a headache any more
 even i would kind of like to go
 yeah
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 reba mcintire is a little too country for me
 we've got methadone programs where people who desperately want to get off drugs can't  get onto the program 
 it's wonderful
 
 we've only been in i think it's science place two
 you have pets i understand a couple of them
 no shirt or anything
 i think twenty thirty years ago a lot of women
 oh
 right
 uh-huh
 in my day we talked quietly behind our hands about people that we suspected might be
 he says i'm following the orders of my president
 i think it
 that's right
 oh
  yeah 
 uh-huh
 
  yeah 
 right
 it was a cadillac
 
 uh-huh
 i
 i had two cars there for a while
 yeah
 what kind
 
 what
 right
 huh-uh
 uh-huh
 absolutely
 uh-huh
 we didn't have to go with sleeping bags
 yeah
 
 that
 yeah
 right
 yeah
 yeah
 nursing is
 that
 uh-huh
 are you familiar with that
 they're really happy that i don't cook anymore
 uh-huh
  usually if you  can find somebody
 okay
 my god i think it would be next year is what i'd read
 
 television sure makes child rearing easy on you
 it's too cold
 i stayed
 i love seafood
 that one kid that becca likes he has aids
 i guess the first time i played golf has been probably about eight or ten years ago now when i was in college
 i think we put too much on politicians
 right
 isn't  that funny
 pretty good
 you know
 no
 i like his movies
 my husband went to is in graduate school actually right now
 right
 uh-huh
 pork barrel politics
 you had to come home and  clean before you could  even do anything probably
 yeah
 that's right
 i may
 it is it is
 that's what she plans to do
 right
 it is
 i am actually a junior
 uh-huh
 i lived
 uh-huh
 that's right
 yes
  yeah
 she got about two thousand dollars worth
 yeah
 i am one of those crazy people that reads the directions
 yeah
 it didn't sound
 are you there
 uh-huh
 yeah
 it's god's country
 social lives and so forth
  i was  in toledo last summer
 ye-
 exactly
 yeah
 uh-huh
 it's not a lot
 i'm five three
 it's beautiful
 
 and glass
 right
 i know two of my daughters had to have that
  right 
 
 yeah
 yeah
 
 yeah
  
 not too far away
 okay
 need to teach them good values
 they're the ones that probably are paying the highest
 had watching them
 yeah
 oh
 type of deal
 n-
 that's what i remember from living up north is that you'd get everything set and then you'd have a frost
 i
 yes
 that'll encourage me to always go since i spent that much money
 
 uh-huh
 reverse that trend at that point
 oh
 i looked conser-
 e d s has eight years
 right
 sure
 when does it become detrimental to our family to the point that you have to consider that as opposed to considering her current circumstances
 uh-huh
 yeah
 
 
 i grew up about the same time you did
 look how young she is
  yeah 
 uh-huh
 i imagine
 right
 
 this is the neat thing about the place we ended up at
  right 
 right
 
 uh-huh
 it was totally irr- 
 now there might be now
  
 i
 jim hart was playing
 start up
 okay
 yeah 
 they don't really pay a whole lot of attention to buffers
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
 they've got three daughters
 now they have gotten this wonderful idea of not taking out as much taxes
 isn't that bad
 i guess you could consider that a hobby
  yeah 
  children 
 
 ready to go
 yes
 the headlines on the news or whatever is someone says they found a cure for aids
 we're going to have a baby this summer
 we've gotten out a time or two on a rented basis
 yeah
 uh-huh
 oh yeah
 that's the bad thing there is that we spent so much money
 just from the heat of it all
 bye
 i see
 uh-huh
 i guess it'd be best if you knew each person and what they stood for and why and everything
 uh-huh
 you're almost looked down upon if you don't try to do all of these things
 uh-huh
 no
 i understand
 right
 
 uh-huh
 yeah
  altogether
 bye-bye
 i i think
  uh-huh 
 that's true
 everywhere you went there was sand
 i work at n c n b now
 you always have the lack of funds
 ford products
 it really is
 it does indeed
 city water has chlorine in it
 yeah
 right
 that is hard
 that's what we're doing
 uh-huh
 sure
 
 right
 i've
 yeah
 you lost an investment
 i think at t i it took five years
 okay
 what a dead place
 
 is he still around
 i'd like to go just sight see a little bit sometime
  yeah 
 oh
 uh-huh
 i hope you have kids just like yourself
 yeah
 right yeah
 
 but they don't have
 you understand what i am saying
 my dad is a farmer
 i
 uh-huh
 i play a lot of racquetball
 okay
 right
 i know
 my grand mamma died a couple of years ago so but he's you know
 there's a lot of things that they don't do in school anymore
 uh-huh
 the judicial system is aimed at the citizens
 it's a euphonium
   yeah
 it is for me
 i don't
 uh-huh
 yeah
 life is to interesting to read fiction
 yeah
 no
 uh
 yeah
 i've talked to
  uh-huh 
 they had five or six servants you know and and a lot of expensive uh holdings and all that
 yes
 uh-huh
 ye-
  as mexicans
 uh-huh
 yeah
 you guys sure want to be out of range
  however you  come to that conclusion
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
 yeah
 it's like let's see if we can get her to run up her bills
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 
 do you know anything about  that 
 i don't work at t i
 great
 to give it  a little more body 
 if it's life and a day then he's not eligible for parole
 i won-
 of history
 it was
 i went
 was i supposed to do something
 to a parent
 yeah
 it's a good experience
 we're in a recession here
  we've never  even seen that
 uh-huh
 
 you want to be around for the crisis and things like that
 oh
 right
 yeah
 uh-huh
 go ahead
 this was when the peace corps first are started
 uh-huh
 yeah
 drove it right to the shop
 right
 okay
 now a friend of mine who was studying social work here in philadelphia worked for an adult day care program for mostly for patient's with alzheimer
 like some member of the family gets the flu or whatever
 i just get aggravated about it
 we just couldn't leave without it
  uh-huh 
 telephone pioneers of america
 maybe they're burnt out or
 we're tired of doing it though
 have you just started doing this
  no
 it was terrible
 i never heard   
 exactly
 nowhere near that expensive
 huh
 yes
 uh-huh
 
 yeah
 you probably have nice big pine
 but uh
 uh-huh
 i see
 i might just donate my little one to the scout troop and let them
 white
  yeah 
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 no
 
 it sounds like we've covered all the bases
 and it you know
 
 what do you think about that
 no
 yeah
 right
 tried to get fondue and white wine
 yeah
 yeah
 do you have friends there
  that sounds good 
 
 yeah
 she's a
  yeah 
 boy
 uh-huh
 we've been sort of opera fans for a few years now
 you hate to  get rid of it because you know how much you spent on them
 yeah
 yeah
 i don't do any drugs
 
 uh-huh
 i just took grades one through six
 uh-huh
 i enjoyed talking to you
 seriously
 in education
 i see
 are you involved in the legal system at all
 yeah
 already
 it's not bad yeah
  bye 
 they get so heavy they kind of weigh it down
   i guess this is what you call a natural end
 so many people are moving back into those old houses and are restoring them
 that's right
 my goodness
 i am sort of rereading it
 okay
 no
 
 because it seems uh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 it was made back in the early sixties
 uh-huh
  i'm with  the f b i
 okay
 one was still in diapers when i started baby-sitting
 absolutely
 that's discouraging if you own property
  yes 
 and she'd been
 obstinate
 that's it
 i just read one about grace kelley
 well the oth- the other instance i think of their inability to to handle things the cholera
 
 houston
 uh-huh
  how   about that 
 regardless of the racial makeup
 okay
 uh-huh
  people just 
  uh-huh 
 is it
 some kids are really having it
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 it's not getting any better
 i have a pretty good mathematical concept for what's involved
 oh
 right
 that's okay
 what i hate is
  right 
 uh-huh
 right
 uh-huh
 no
 that's right
 uh-huh
 yeah
 do you have children in
 you don't think so
 how are we doing in recycling
 boom
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 no
 utah is a pretty state from what i remember of it
 uh-huh
 bye-bye
 same to you
 no
 that's basically eastern european jewish food
 true
 no
 we are this weekend going to go see dance with wolves
 that's a big deal in texas too
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 yes
 
 
 i don't think they like the fact that i have one either
 you have
 i've noticed people doing that down here too
 if you like wildlife it's a fabulous vacation
 uh-huh
 they
 bye-bye
  yeah
 i understand that
  uh-huh
 yeah
 my baby-sitter would take them and then pick them up
 i'm from utah area
 now grapes are the ones that you have to pull all that off
 yeah
 okay
 my goodness
 right
 if you want to play tennis or racquetball
 are you married at all
 uh-huh
 and i remembered seeing some of these things coming through at rush hour even with the tee
 but
 i had very flexible hours
 yeah
 um
 it sounds wonderful
 i just tell the credit card company don't pay the charge
 so it was it was you know the best
 uh-huh
 no
   that could be 
 yeah
 uh-huh
 i don't blame you not nowadays
 not really
 yeah
 uh-huh
 the others were hand me downs through the families
  yeah
 and we've been in a drought for the last five years
 
 yeah
 yeah
  huh-uh 
 when they were growing up
 
 you never know
 
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
  going to 
 she's gorgeous
 uh-huh
 slow down a little bit
 
 they stay up until all hours of the night
 i'm pretty sure he was this past season
 so it's it's always nice to see people that like each other
  uh-huh 
 you may get a cold snap or two or some rain or something like we've been getting in december
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 i was cau-
 right
 is it
 in dallas yet
  it's time to  replace it
 uh-huh
 something my husband
 you're right
 yes
 
 that's a good point
 right
 i'm in a book club
 i never did that
 shrivels up and dies
 it's called the christian music station or something like that
 huh-uh
 uh-huh
 yeah
  yeah 
 they've got sixty or so of iraq's planes
 you've got to see it especially since you have a german
 even the bench warmer i would
 which is everybody that i know
  the take 
 the golden delicious were fantastic this year
 
 right
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 you work for five six seven
 i've never been to texas
 wayne's world hey man

 how many kids do you have
  right 
 yeah
 they were just pressed aluminum
 i know
 oh
 do you exercise a lot
 it's a special occasion

 not yet at all
 that's great
 the thing about when it gets hot here is i don't like the humidity
 yes
  bye now 
 right
 uh-huh
 stupid
 green
 not right now
  yeah 
 which ones
 oh
 yeah
 yeah
 right
 the only gripe i have is performance
 it was very very difficult
 uh-huh
 i don't have any friends that have the disease
 i i
 i'm sure there's a lot of people that have had
 yeah
 uh-huh
 you talked about thanksgiving there are interesting meals at different times
 
 let's talk about the baby
 that would be even
 i'm not real familiar with that
 yeah
 yeah
  oh 
 okay
 right
 right
 yeah
 neither one of us do
 that same house here would probably cost three-quarters of a million dollars
 uh-huh
 i know
 they don't take any stands on anything
 uh-huh
 what
 
 you too
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 i
 yeah
 all he saw was my hair
 now they go to a state college
 yeah
 i don't know
 yeah
 i felt like we roughed it then
 yeah
 
  i 
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 that's for sure
 they just totally wrote it off their book
 yeah
 i agree
 use different words instead i think
 
 okay
 i know a woman who's just wonderful at that
 that is true
  we- 
 well i agree with the boredom of the election process
  right 
 yeah
  by  the thought that i have to support
 oh
 it's a crystal
 okay
 and uh you know i- i was amazed cause i'd pick up a local paper and i'd read about all of these you know really interesting things going on
 that's what i would do too
 
 okay
 good luck in your car hunting
 it didn't show me anything
 put a little bitty portable computer in there and a plasma display
 uh-huh
 no
 uh-huh
 you too
 do you all just sort of chip in and help out with stuff when you are there
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 right
 you've been to the city
 
  nay

 yeah
 
 excuse me
 she was my favorite character on there
 uh-huh
 that's true
 my husband wants to go into medical school and be a neurosurgeon
 uh-huh
 yes
 yeah
 uh-huh
 yeah
 debates would come up up there in massachusetts and you know in that area over uh air pollution
 uh-huh
 right
 yes
 exactly
 if it was it would probably have to be a pattern
 not this bill
 yes
 uh-huh
  i think so 
 uh-huh
 yeah
 really
 every morning
 how high are the taxes going to be when my children are my age
 she said it's getting too big for us to take care of
  too much of a  difference
 yeah
 we just went ahead and laid them down
 yeah
 they could go visit them during the day
 i was just saying that way
 uh-huh
 everything had a little bit of curry in it
 you are very very much aware of what goes on
 i
 i watched all three games of that
 he doesn't really like mine let alone another one
 nice talking to you
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 really
 uh-huh
 yeah
 
 yeah
 in denver
 yeah
 it's hard to know what the good movies are anymore
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 it's very successful for some of
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 they say
 when you're too old to do anything else go play golf
 
  on his 
 that's what i heard
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 if you get junk mail on a regular basis from any particular company you can

 that's what i've heard yeah
 yes
 yeah
 i'm real

  i don't know
 how about you

 we stayed right on the same track with each other
 they not only give me a demonstrator but the hardware as well as the software
  uh-huh 
 uh-huh
  it's a  hard question
 really
 lawn mower broke
 we both have older cars
   i went to metropolitan a couple of years ago
 uh-huh
 it's kind of scary
 oh
 
 did you read tom clancy's a clear and present danger
 
 she always lived here in the south
 that would be wonderful
 yeah
 i don't know who that guy is
 
 yeah
 right
 if enough of the public
 yeah
 yeah
 you have a good day
 i
 who do you think
 uh-huh
 yeah
  uh-huh 
 yeah
 one place i think i didn't take her
 right
 i can go ahead and start
 they had a free day  at kindercare 
 both my mother's parents and my father's parents were immigrants
 no
 uh-huh
 but not
 you almost have
 yeah
 it can be very educational
 uh-huh
 he learns from the older boys too
 you just have to go once a year
 uh-huh
 i am
 they couldn't put anything in it hardly
 
 the only trouble is that you can afford to go anywhere
 yeah
 uh-huh
   so much more to learn now that it really makes it more difficult i would think
 yeah
 that's exactly the kind of thing i would have said
 uh-huh
 they really impress me
 that by doing that we'll be free
 yeah
 i don't think they're in a conspiracy
 that you'd heard or that you owned an album of
 yeah
 rather than a home
 uh-huh
 what is that sound
 uh-huh
  what  is your problem
 it was really very official
 you know at least you get out of here at three
 marvelous
 uh-huh
 purple buddy
 yeah
 i still watch cartoons sometimes every once in a while
 yeah
 yes
 okay
 everything here
 it took that long
 yeah
 generally then i dress you know nicer
 yeah
 organizations to do
 it might be advantageous to do that
 yeah
 i guess i'd would like to see somebody like yeltsin to get more power
 i think we ought to worry about our own species
 a big le baron
 right
 paper just seems so innocuous
 yeah
 yeah
 no
 they're kind of low to the ground after driving the explorer
 it
  yeah
 yeah
 i think that's where they hit most of us
 ooh you took on a
 right
 i have
 and you got to have it
 uh-huh
 to minnesota
 oh
 huh-uh
 they're
 yeah 
 isn't that interesting
 
 yeah
 yes
 we put them out for people
 walk down the street and
 it sure is
 right
 my immediate reaction is that it's some sort of strange phone message
 that's right
 matter of fact if anything she's worse
 they really are
 yeah
 oh
 right
 what
 so
 yeah
 but we're still experiencing a very uneven
 what is it
 yeah
 yeah
 
 that's just great
 uh-huh
 yes
 yeah
 i hardly drive
 after it came out
 oh
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 do you think most states have that
 uh-huh
 depend
 oh
 sensors and things like that
 in new hampshire
 oh
  right 
 
  okay
 uh-huh
 i didn't realize it would melt so easily
 there's so many different ways to catch fish
 sure 
 pets get like that don't they 
 i think it worked out very very well
 there you go
 yeah
 uh-huh
 cold or something
 that was another funny thing
 right
  it's just so well done
 yeah
 that just bugs me to death
 yeah
 there's a little more craziness down there
 i said a few things to him when i got home
 do you
 yeah
 yeah
  yeah 
 oh
 yeah
 it's going to be a short conversation because i agree with you
 it certainly does
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 right
 so do we
 uh-huh
 gosh
  i wish i were dealing with baudelaire 
 boy i have  to hunt them down
 the drug problem that's another one
 you can tell
 ye-
 absolutely
 
 is that what you're saying
 with
  uh-huh 
 no
 uh-huh
 it's more spirited  
 that's an excellent movie
 some i guess like
 i'm a student
 it is
 uh-huh
 yep
 uh-huh
 you did that recently too uh
 huh
 it's a sad story
 i'm for anything that cleans up the air or the water or or or anything
 mister mom
 uh-huh
 yeah
 but i think the hardest thing to do is whenever you've got a person who's mentally very alert and active and their body just hasn't kept up with them and i think that's in a way it's more some an area where some of the day care uh
 right
 grass
 yeah
 it was a le baron with everything on it
 
 and and just very happy to get that
 
 they definitely do
 what can they do about the oil burning over in kuwait
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 i'm a summer person i like the heat
 they're usually more afraid of you than you are of them usually
 uh-huh
  right 
 it's true
 uh-huh
  uh-huh 
 it's really ridiculous
  uh-huh 
 
 uh-huh
 if you'll take lessons the first thing they put in your hand is an iron
 now they're down into the hundreds nineties
 it was horrible
 yeah
 okay
 oh
 yeah
 but it took our total time
 yeah
 i've
 huh-uh
 yeah
  a  difference
 right
 i think it's going to
 uh-huh
 no
 uh-huh
 sure
 i know
 uh-huh
 that's sort of like what truman had
 that's very true
 i thought that was a real unusual thing
 simple as that
 it's one thing to send grass there
 exactly
 it's completely trivial to for instance listen in on someone's car phone or walk around phone since they're just radio signals
 uh-huh
 that's okay
  magic 
 
 
 people donate more money
 she knows something right that she  
 have you been sailing
 yeah
 yeah
 we have that here too
 it's beautiful
 i work for t i
 my wife and i feel that we never have a moment that we can call our own
 you're not kidding
 yeah
 yeah
  bye-bye 
 it's too
 you
  uh-huh
 i know
 uh-huh
 i don't know
 an
 yeah
 
 right
 yeah
 and and c- came  
 our house is kind of on a little hill
 where did you go to school
 yeah
 you know
 agreed
 sure
 yeah
 she thinks it's wonderful
  you're  going to have on extra expenses for car
 is that how they do it at t i maybe
 okay
 uh-huh
 usually in the week i'm  
 yeah
 yes
 yeah
 right yeah
 it was fairly expensive though
 they were very good
 yeah
 that's
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 me too
 yeah
 my next oldest daughter that's in college in california is a world twirling champion
 uh-huh
 really
 that sounds good
 personally
 like when you're in a bad part of italy or something
 
 it's when
 i don't live in a house
 
 i grew up in oak cliff
 uh-huh
 that didn't last long  
 she had to label everything
 what would happen if the   required young people to do service to the country
 yeah
 yeah
 which was a chocolate sack
 we just have the basic right now
 good
 i'll probably talk to you again
 yeah
 
 yeah
 do you do a lot of camping
  then the only advise passed  down is don't go to georgia tech
 i agree
 good
 it all depends on what i'm fishing for and the time of day
 yeah
 i don't know now
 yeah
 you can
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 of course it wasn't sunny like it is here
 right
 what do you have
 this isn't for me
 yeah
 i know
 yeah
 
 yeah
 are full and there is nowhere else to put our garbage
 i don't either
 wow
 do you have any children
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 huh
 uh-huh
 yeah
 i like people like neil diamond and
 what about you
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 it's lazy
 yeah
 maybe they gave up that right when they committed the crimes
 uh-huh
 what was that
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 um there's a large minority population
 they were fourteen pounds and
 uh-huh
 that's right
 sorry about my mind
 they do
 it takes a lot of training and a lot of abuse to get a dog to really  respond 
 uh-huh
 i would love to
 uh-huh
 different times
 
 
 i saw on one of the talk shows this woman judge i believe from florida
 oh well actually yes
  uh-huh 
 it's it's the uh ongoing acid rain problem
 yes
 we-
 i guess so
 yeah
 the thing that worries me about that is that if you just raise salaries across the board you're going to be
 right
 yes
 uh-huh
 
 yeah
 okay
 
 i thought he was great
  yeah
 more so supported them when they got home
 he ought to be able to perform
 many more deaths have occurred in and dealing with coal plants then ever around nuclear plants
 i see
 as a crime free zone any longer
 but it seems to be getting worse and worse
 you won't even
 yeah
 yeah
 that's a
 oh
 that's about all i have
 you will not pay your bill at the end of the month
  right 
 one of these twelve by forty-eight's that got repoed
 they've been there eight years
 i work for  n i s t 
 
 okay
 no
 uh-huh
 their room and board
 some evenings are worse than others
 right
 yeah
 no earthly idea
 joe pros
 just because of exactly what you said
 uh-huh
 i really can't get into that
 i just bought a car
 i just don't see the designer's
 no
 uh-huh
 i don't know
  yeah 
 they're people who farm on the hillside and then leave the hillside to another hillside and farm on that hillside
 it's fairly easy and fast
 yeah
 because we have to go down uh once a year here in maryland and get out car's exhaust systems checked for emission content
 
 right
 yeah
  i don't know 
   temporary
 i don't know
 you don't have to put it down
 uh-huh
 yeah
  i have been just  so happy
 i don't know
 oh
 he tried to make bagels one time
 uh-huh
 
 depends on what you consider expensive
 there's too many lawsuits
 are we picking him up every saturday
 exactly
 do you like to make your own guacamole
 yeah
 boy he's a big one
 have you
 uh-huh
 yeah
 people would always bring them when they go to the countries
 oh
 yeah
 okay
 like you say you bowl
 yeah
 uh-huh
 i'm not sure how we get that
 we couldn't find a place to camp
 i see what you're saying
 right
 i got one at work that i bought for one of the guys there at work
 yeah
 in the summers
 right
 boy i tell you
 rugby is definitely big in college
 yeah
 he might see it one day
 that's true
 yes
 do you have the overcrowding in your prisons that we are facing down here
 yeah
 that's right
 yeah
 i had rather do other things
 coronary cholesterol and chlorine
 hold on one second
  uh-huh 
 
 i didn't realize that there were groups that go in like that
 life is  so much more enjoyable
 
  bye-bye 
 yeah
 it just really gets way
 major
 okay
 they withhold what they're supposed to and at the end of the year it's not enough
 huh
 i know
 
 you do it
 okay
 they just don't care
 i don't want to go there
 i sure don't
 right
 it's a scream
 i appreciate it
 or something like that
 just about any kind of music
 uh we've got
 right
 quantum leap
 yeah
 it's more high tech
 uh-huh
 she'd much rather be here with me
  i think so too 
 
 he may uh-huh
 oh
 uh-huh
 yeah
 is that right
 last weekend we went to six flags saturday
 okay
 uh-huh
 be-
 i just i think it's a bigger risk than
 you could take a little longer  and  just watch a little bit more i guess
 
 they're dealt with
 he didn't have a problem with reading
 yeah
 really
 it is interesting
 that sounds good
 uh-huh
 
 no
 yeah
 yeah
 in the salt water
  i've  got some onions out
 and i d- drive uh
 yeah
 i'll bet
 right
 i just like willie nelson i guess because he's such a character
 i'm a graduate student
 it's real easy to get isolated in your own little community
 i don't want to have to mess with it
 i'm wondering with the boom down here
 where do you live
 that's correct
 yeah
  in politics 
 uh the causes of crime
 
 it really is
 
 uh-huh
 i'd like to start sewing again
 my goodness
 sure
 all things being equal yes
 i have friends that pay about nine hundred dollars for a town house in
 those people that i know
 i really like
 uh-huh
 
 uh-huh
 right
 yeah
 
 the numbers
 uh-huh
 there has been so much work done already
 right
 why don't you start
 uh-huh
 okay
 let's see
 yeah
 when did you first come to texas
 it makes it so much lighter
 uh-huh
 i'm doing fine
 yes
 everybody should be able to have surgeries that will save their lives or things that will make their life more comfortable verses than just the rich people that can afford to pay or to work for corporations that have wonderful health benefits
 my grandparents and all my relatives are from wisconsin
 my friend had a v w rabbit
 uh-huh
 
 i've heard too many people say i hate it here
  yeah
 yeah
 right
 that's true
 right
 or what you read
 it's too late then
 yeah
 is that true
 a nifty idea
 by the  campsite it's so
 no
 but we just talked a lot
 that's right
  to worry about it 
 those milk cartons take up so much room
 uh-huh
 she was in the house
 you've got to work for a living
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 do forestry work
 uh cause they clean the uh the lenses for cameras
 because they're boring
 no
 they do intimidate
 uh-huh
 you feel invigorated
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 seems that way yeah
 that's true
 yeah
 yeah
 used to go on
 well i know of number of people that are in the in the uh school district an- down in in uh san antonio
 yeah
 yeah
 sounds good
 uh-huh
 that's possible
 they
 yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 yeah
 i don't know what that is
 that's the one i was thinking of
 we wanted it to be as authentic as possible
 huh
 if you're going to go to a college where student faculty ratio is three and four hundred to one i don't think you're going to have as meaningful of a college experience as if you're down to the thirty to forty to one
 yeah
 it was interesting
 okay
 they love to play with kids
 yeah
 bye-bye
 yeah
 we managed to get to one
 uh-huh
 yes
 it
 you take a look at the output at the same time
  no 
 we are
 no
 too bad the mavericks couldn't get him
 yeah
 yes
 that is right
 we like that
 what branch were you in
 yes
 really
 it's really sad
 uh-huh
 right
 yeah
 uh-huh
 right
 do we get enough news or something like  that 
 that's right
 right
  uh-huh 
  yeah
 uh-huh
 and fievel goes west
 what
 for about four weeks
 yeah
 okay
 does he
 yeah
 yeah
 our house in castroville was the first one too
 some years back
 i don't know why
 yeah
 sure
  yeah 
 i'm just taking the other side so we'll have a discussion here
 yeah
 really
 i don't think it had to do to with woman running against man
 how has it been this week for you
 yeah
 there are some smart ones out there
 that's right
 i've never been past ohio
 and yet there's
 uh-huh
 huh-uh
 i know they asked in the topic for ideas on how to control crime
 and she'll be wearing my clothes
 uh-huh
  bye
 i don't
 that's true
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 i
 yeah
 course they keep saying the weather's going to change and we're going to have more florida type weather up here
 yeah
  uh-huh 
 management
 
 good good prices good good food there
 yeah
 indeed i found myself restricting my viewing to a couple of hours a day one in the morning and one in the evening
 uh-huh
 i hear of one every now and then
 yeah
 yes
 yeah
 yeah
 
 they're about three hours away if you go due north
 i'll fix the porch up with pumpkins for halloween and christmas
 
  have  you done anything like that
 yeah
 right
 yeah
 that's changing
 there's
 plano
 what ages are they
 yeah
 i guess that's it
 i did the dance step when i lived up in michigan
 that's right
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 where we are not allowed to
 
 it was
 yeah
  uh-huh 
 yeah
 i do that also
 the
 yes he is
 
 yeah
  yeah
 it was really nice
 yeah
 i grew up in michigan
  yeah 
 yeah
 what would we like to say
 that one
  yeah 
 uh-huh
 so you listen to kind of church music gospel
 i don't know what he's going to be in austin
 uh-huh
 yeah
 this is pretty well where l b j and audelia skillman cross
 which is i think what they also don't know
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 they have done a beautiful job
 some of them in the penal system
 right
 i read that half where she was in her later years
 didn't you
 that will go down and come up easily
  wow 
 because they're enclosed
 i don't believe in hunting
 to commute to work
 uh-huh
  uh-huh 
 me too
 that must be tough
 
 we're from the north
 i've been on a few juries
 yeah
 most of the area where we live in most of the kids have cars
 yeah
 right
 die
 i get tired of newspaper littering the garage
 
 i don't know what new york does about theirs
 yeah
 yes
 which has made us as lot more stable
 
 yeah
 right
 i don't know how else to explain it
 but uh then don't
 yeah
 i think
 uh-huh
 i was trying to get my children quiet for a minute
 yeah
 i don't think there's very much of a threat there today
 someone could be sentenced to thirty-five years
 yeah
 
 have i
 i have a younger daughter now
 it really was
 they had left her on the bus closed up all afternoon
 it's not quite that simple
 i read the wall street journal
 uh-huh
 
 we're supposed to talk about lawn and garden
 right
  down there 
 yeah
 then we decided to have kids
 that's really true
 yeah
  and  parking it and sitting inside and watching t v
 blacksburg
 he didn't apply to any school further
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 that's because he's probably doing what i do worrying about
 i think our five minutes is about up anyhow
 i've never done that one before
 yeah
 yeah
 very much
 
  yeah 
 that's right
 looking for arrowheads and
 how do you feel
 it's just like a sesame street
 i can't complain about it because i haven't used it
 yes
 
 that's your weekend
 i guess we're  the same age then
 yeah
 
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 yeah
 because i didn't take it in right away and let a whole year go by
 i really was surprised when it ended so quickly
 
 right
 that's true
 it sure is
 no
 wow
 yeah
 me too
  yeah 
 uh-huh
 do you have brothers
 that's true
 right
 so uh
  uh-huh 
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 you still can see well
 no
 it's a
 a matter of fact he's never seen without his jacket to the suit on buttoned
 they're blurred
 i'm pretty simple right now
 yeah
 what my husband had very strong feelings
 that's true
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 it was fun
 all the sounds of the karate chops flying through the air
  yes 
 yeah
 okay
 no
 uh-huh
 she had a son that was epileptic from birth
 bye-bye
 yeah
 that's really about it
   really
 she doesn't mind when we cover up her eyes
 where do you live
  
 a-
 i think they're looking after their own self preservation more than they're actually looking after the good of the country
 
 yeah
 oh
 uh-huh
 yeah
 that's right
 and so the drain on the family
 you don't see things thrown away
 yeah
 that's pretty neat
 uh-huh
 what kind of wok do you have
 back on the italian we went to some place across from collin creek mall that absolutely putrid for italian food
 i
 right right
 
 
 he will get up
 do you know how to use them in your life or to influence
 then they should be  
 you're talking when you think about price it's several thousand dollars lower than the comparable honda or nissan or something along those lines
 yeah
  i'm  originally from pennsylvania
 yes
 that's pretty out there
 okay
 you think i could spend my money
 i really came to love san diego and feel very
 uh-huh
  uh-huh 
 i'm not real sure what the
 my family was real liberal
 but i just don't trust people now
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
  yeah 
 yeah
 uh-huh
  tourist  attraction
 very well because now the adults are more aware of it
 it's hard on the car
 it was great talking with you
  foreign  aid
 i think that would be interesting
 and they they do some pretty good news
 i read that too
 right
 anything extra
 nice talking with you too
 we pay five percent sales tax
 uh-huh
 exactly
 yeah
 that
 yeah
 yeah
 that's great
 i know it
 nobody can have this many relatives
 something that we can just cook in a hurry after we get off work
 
 uh-huh
 i imagine
 huh
 no
 there was too many people too many
 i agree
 i can't remember how far in advance we reserved
 then they need to be watched carefully
 yeah
  uh-huh 
 who
 the quantities what are good for you what isn't
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
  you know something
 uh-huh
 yeah
 
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
  yeah 
 i've got two little ones
 jeez
 oh
 those are the ones that i really really hate too
 no
 yeah
 that sounds good
 yeah
 we have kroger but not a skaggs
  right 
 yeah
 uh-huh
 yeah
 right
 nothing
 no
 which was different
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 and that's his station so i call it the jeezer music
 as long as i have a shower nearby i'm fine
 did you get the booklet on how to get the gifts and all
 i don't know
 
 it was good talking to you
 yeah
 yeah
  that  come
 yes
 bye-bye
 uh-huh
 yeah
 women have come into the work force in the last twenty thirty years
 gosh
 you look at all these candidates that want to become president
 uh-huh
  that  sounds great
 i was never into those movies either
 yeah
 that's true
 really
 taxes
 have you seen the mov-
 i think it
 we haven't seen that one
 yeah
  huh 
 yeah
 yeah
 so i think you can have both
 good luck in your car buying
 yeah
 that's right
 yeah
 we haven't
 uh-huh
 and black and white
 uh-huh
 they're
 yeah
 yeah
  rome new york 
 right
  uh-huh 
 yeah
 you mean the clocks
 i think then you have to replace it with other things
 
 yeah
 thanks
 yeah
 i see
 uh-huh
 that's the
 finance
 that's what you're saying
 yeah
 i don't think it's something that people really think about either
 
 it'll be comfortable
 uh-huh
 some sort of program or
 uh-huh
 they weren't like any of the mexican american or black people i had gone to school with
 uh-huh
 bye bye
 yeah
 yes
 really
 i don't know whether uh you classify the skylark and the calais as
 still need a little bit of space
 me
 that's great
 i think i look better
 i know
  which  i would like to see rather than so many kids getting out of school
 i
 they liked it
 oh
 i have never played in any tournament except just a scramble
 yeah
 yes
 uh-huh
 yeah
 we camp year round
 do you know
 exactly
 
 i like that kind of stuff
 we- because i she loves she's one of those that loves th- outside
 yeah
 
 um
 uh-huh
 let's see
 yeah
 yeah
 i don't think that many by the builder that built this house
   sure  
 uh-huh
 yes
 yeah
 the last one was back down to lubbock texas
 uh-huh
 wow
 i tried the news magazines like time newsweek u s news and world report
 people are too different
 no
 it's fun
 how long does it keep
 i can't
 i measured it one time
 which she doesn't allow them to watch the soapies
 
 uh-huh
 yeah
 i was smarter than most of the people that i was working for
 i'm a former t i-er
 yeah
 radio
 uh-huh
 yeah
 sure
 is all we paid for cars in those days
  okay 
 no
 that's frightening too
 uh-huh
  i get  through
 right
 yeah
 
 right
 sure
 right
 
 yeah
 i know
  that's 
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 right
 but uh
 about the last thing i did
 
 we live out in the country
 instead of
 yeah
 sure
 you essentially need to have someone taking care of the person full-time
 yeah
 you did it manually
 it really would
 for the dorm
 yeah
 hundred miles due east of here
 has affected you personally
 isn't it amazing that somebody can write that many books
 it seems like you could see it through about three layers of paint
 yeah
 have you been down there
 i read usually that kind of stuff
 it's just
 yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
  nobody talks about it 
 yeah
 where are you from in california
 no
 that's real important to little kids
 yeah
 i had to cut some of the sides down
 uh-huh
 where do you work
 they're real good
 yeah
 it's very pleasant
 
 and they take their girls
 it can get very expensive
 yeah
  something new 
 right
 
 uh-huh
 and i said no somebody
 was it hard when you first came
 uh-huh
 it has taken on a more profound
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 upstate new york
 that's right
 huh-uh
 
 yeah
 i don't recall that they have any female anchors
 to the heat
 yes
 uh-huh
 to be able to use it or a day during the week or something
 right
 i have got to hit it
 uh-huh
 you know what i mean
 really
  i know how that goes 
 yeah
 nowadays with the way the income tax i think housing is strictly to itemize
 are you a t i
 no
 some danielle steel
 how far west have you been
 i don't think so
 yeah
 exactly
 it's a big problem
 uh-huh
 i was a photographer before
 wow
 yeah
 yeah
  you've got to
 yeah
 
  because we're  both originally from this part of the country
 speaking of that i think terminator two is supposed to be out

 uh-huh
 
 uh-huh
 something sweet
 i never made one for myself though
 yeah
 
 yeah
 here we go
 come in handy
 congress woman

 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 
 it's one of the few times i wanted more news than
  huh 
 right
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 i am
 don't answer your phone hello
 i guess
 i hope you know more about it than i do
 uh-huh
 first thing i did was turn the tv on

 i think that's difficult on them
 uh-huh
 yeah
 right
  i
 oh
 oh
 how about you
 yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 i don't even know who won the pennant last year
 
 uh-huh
 what do you do there
 do you wish you
 yeah
 yeah
 no
 i don't even know the name of the river there
 
 that is such a nice thing
 there's nothing wrong with that
 bring it home and
 within our family we have said
 
 you do
 as well as a lot of the explosives we were running into
 i check the scores the next morning
 yeah 
 uh-huh
 and and for campaign that's it
 right
 uh-huh
 i can't think of what school he went to
 it's just when you
 i guess that's when it was
 you never think about that do you
 uh-huh
 i think if i had to come home and then go somewhere i'd never make it
 kind of like the cowboys
 are you familiar with it
 sure
 uh-huh
 i tend to eat expensive food
 they're cute
 big boom
 it's very sophisticated
 uh-huh
  yeah 
 i used to watch
 yeah
  yeah 
 that's neat isn't it
  yep 
  uh-huh 
 oh
 and uh it it was prev- she she did pretty well
 i mean you know if i was setting up a daycare there would be so many needs you would have to customize your service to
 yeah
 uh-huh
 lot of places have tho-
 yeah
 they'd be ready to vote 
 why not
 you need metal instead of plastic
 yeah
 yes
 the school thing might be changing
 oh okay
 i guess i'm the one just supporting most of the others
 i wish i did
 yeah
 getting to see the same women every morning
 yeah
 uh-huh
 called gondolas
 there's less of a sense of privacy
 yeah
 yeah
 we could not find anything that had any kind of redeeming value in it
 i would say no
 right
 yeah
 public school
 right
 yet your absolutely right
 right
  good talking to you 
 it's
 yeah
 i don't know
 uh-huh
  stuff up 
 it was kind of sad
 yeah
 yeah
 
 no
 uh-huh
 there okay
 i think that it's time that we concentrate more on what's going on within our own borders than what's going on in the middle east
 yeah
 yeah
 it was it was the funniest thing
 are you a bible fan too
 that would be my answer of an easy way to get these guys out of there for twenty years
 what's amazing is some of them have been on death row for a number of years
 i've never
 kind of cuts your possibilities for the flower beds
 yeah
 yeah
 i can't remember exactly what it was
  uh-huh 
 
 they're really trying to get you into that situation because they know they've really got you then
 uh-huh
 yeah
 those are fascinating to me
 
 it doesn't
 it's just
 yeah
 yeah
  yeah 
 she never really had a chance to work
 i enjoy them to a degree
 yes
 if him and his wife weren't getting along
 uh-huh
 
 i know
 i guess i take it for granted kind of because i just
 they're testing that
 
 right
 yeah
 uh-huh
 bye
 oh
  it  is obvious
 uh our children are both uh basically adults
 right
     shock you
 that's their marketing
 uh-huh
 
 there's a couple now that i tend to want to watch
 uh-huh
 yeah
 that is right
 really
 right
 years ago it would have been fine
 it's free
 right
 he's a very considerate person

 behind us
 oh
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 okay
 worked at a camp there

 no
 the snow up here is really kind of starting to melt now
 right
 in fact it puts it out on tuesdays and thursdays
 you have a bonus
 yeah
 uh-huh
 do you
 tends to tends to strap only the legitimate people
 uh-huh
 all right
 i guess that would be good
 yeah
 yeah
 you can make laws against corruption
 uh-huh
 hi
 yeah
 you look very odd in the water
 yeah
 they keep on dying
 when i married i thought i'd be married the rest of my life
 
 right
 i think it would be that
 they are my favorite team too
 yeah
 sure
 he ended up with about three sets of tools in order to work on that fool thing
 gosh
 yeah
 hi
 for like groceries we say about this much per week
 my parents live in boston
 really
 uh-huh
 if i ever decide to tune it in again
 
 very much so
 they never
 so i'll be faced with having to return that product and uh hoping that uh you know that they will accept it
  yeah 
 no
  uh-huh 
 right
 not personally
  that is good 
 it's not going to be wholesale because of the cost
 that they make
 that's another one of my favorites
 
 no
 uh-huh
 bagels and lox
 uh-huh
 where they have to be working all the time
  uh-huh
 right
 uh-huh
  yeah
 that's   what i'm  saying
 right
   had-  
 i think you know i think in a lot of ways the law is good because it tries to to protect you know the people who are in the states
 that would be fun
 uh-huh
 we just recently moved to texas
 they never had some of the more fun classes i guess  
 yeah
 right
  yeah 
 uh-huh
 have to agree with you
 it is
 yeah
  uh-huh 
 they're even dark

 yeah
 really 
 they have some nice stuff down there
 we are seeing that here as well
  uh-huh

 uh-huh
 it's got three bedrooms going along one side and the living room and kitchen on the other
 i knit sometimes
 it's just hard to make yourself go
 
 about the weather
 yes
  uh-huh 
 there's no
 yeah
 uh buicks and chevrolets
 exactly
 do you have any other further comments
 what i find is that they're highly structured highly organized almost too rigid for the children if you bring a child in at a certain time
 do you hate your mother
 nothing seems quite as good
  yeah
 bye-bye
 here name is lori bird
 i think tha- mile a minute
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 i do plan my clothes a week in advance
 i just still have need for the four bedrooms just having company from time to time
 for each hole they win they get the money for it
 i don't know
 yeah
 
 yeah
 the the competition i- in a lot of ways is is wonderful just because you can choose your doctor
  yeah 
 uh-huh
 i have
 it's just like you say

 yes
 they do
 are gone
 right
 uh-huh
 yeah
 what kind of things have you read

 what that's exactly what's happening in my family
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
 not really
 keep forgetting how big states are out there sometimes
 yeah
 yes
 uh-huh
 it is
 yes
 that's true
 uh-huh
 i grew up on him
 oh
 i've enjoyed it
 if he's got a knife or whatever that can throw it at you
 sometimes i come home from work
 yes
 it certainly is frightening
 uh-huh
 gosh
 yeah
 i'm real jealous when i hear that somebody has a grandma around because we don't
  girls  were there in the morning
 me too
 we haven't had to look very carefully for child care
  uh-huh 
 vociferously
 yep
 wow
 right
  that  do
 oh
 they just moved on
 yeah
 i didn't much care  for the first one
 we're talking about capital punishment
 and spare the economy
 i guess we should talk about giving advice though
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
  really don't  need to
 it's eight and a quarter i think
  yeah 
  no 
 everybody was watching c n n
 yeah
 yeah
 no
 sure
 yeah
 uh-huh
 yeah
 i've just received some
 where do you live
 it just goes straight in there
 that was the one place where i was also able to do weight training
 mostly oldsmobiles
 you know how that is
 i'm not that up on the policy of ways
 no matter where you were you stopped and sat down and watched it
 where you from 
 yeah
 there's nothing in it you don't know
 they get loans and grants and scholarships and stuff like that
 no
 yeah
 are you from boston
 yeah
 if you give up then you can come live in our country
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 why didn't it work last time
  yeah
 she would go her way
 we just try not to pay any more in than we have to
 and mostly just movies when there's a good movie on
 in what way
  when you have  fish au gratin
 bye
 i have
 i think it was romain drive or romain street or something there in los angeles
 uh-huh
  because  you can't wear them here
 yeah
 uh-huh
 you do not have to give a telephone number
 yeah
 throw them in the back
 they're real fat little white things
 yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 right
 i presume that i do
 i think that's a nice gesture on the kuwaiti government part to do that
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 i
 i know it
 right
 we've never really been rained on the few times we've gone
 uh-huh
 call them the new orleans ain'ts any more
 uh-huh
 high
 
 it puts   a whole in your money bag
 really
 
 yeah
 yeah
 what about you
 i was so irritated
 and we read in the newspaper southern part of texas i guess flooded out
 our son-in-law is from panama
 exactly
 exactly
 i just had a baby
 i think it's a hundred years
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 i had my school do it
 right
 i didn't say that
 i'm satisfied with the vacation
 i can't hear them
 our last daughter she did not want to go to school
 absolutely
  yeah 
 my husband is a hunter fisherman outdoorsman marlboro type person who had to have a sporting dog
 yeah
 right
 yeah
 right
 uh-huh
  you do it 
 i certainly don't remember my parents running me here and there and supporting me in all these things
 i'm willing to pay for that for my children
 yeah
 there's nowhere that you can go that you would have to be afraid
 yeah
 yeah
 
 certainly
  what does he charge me 
 type of thing
 i would think so if you only have one bathroom for three bedrooms
 yeah
 great nancy
 i don't know what my kids see any more
 uh-huh
 i saw that
 uh-huh
 okay
 but i do know of a way to get around the computer generated calls
 right
 i know what you mean
 i don't think there's been a magazine as they used to be even good housekeeping i don't
 
 yeah
 uh-huh
  right 
 his medical through his company
 i can't remember what the name of them   are either
 that sucks
 uh-huh
 she doesn't believe in the woman working unless she has to
 i didn't happen to see that
 oh uh
 
 yeah
 i know
 right
 i
 at no charge for a whole year that you will use it
 
 and my husband is a little bit of a male chauvinist
 i know there's not any food that you can get
 one of my favorite movies it's not one that i haven't seen
 yeah
 that's the word float
  yeah 
 uh-huh
 yeah
 i had one
 what's your view
 how far can you go with that one
 they've got a lot of special needs
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 sure
 it must be in
 i'm originally from oklahoma
  yeah
 uh-huh
 yes
 yeah
 i think we have too
 
  is that right 
 we do as a matter of fact
 you bet
 yeah
 uh-huh
 i am not a member of the national rifle association
 no
 they're twins born on the bicentennial
 it's a pretty nice neighborhood
 my husband would like to live there
 uh-huh
  uh-huh 
 roast marshmallows
 me too
 that's a good feeling
 uh-huh
 my children i have five children
 yeah
  because  i know she's going to have to face that
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 okay
 what color is your dog
  yeah 
 right
 you just felt gee if i weren't here
 
 i think we're lucky to have as good a coverage as we have i really do
 uh-huh
 one of these days we'll get down there although
 yes
 yeah
 we got that
 oh
 they ought to make them very reasonably  do something  outrageous to them
 he had a blue one before
 yeah
 yeah
 nice talking to you linda
 i know
 now i know another reason why i'm not going to get a c d player for a while
 yeah
 bye-bye
 that's true
 i think you could recover from a pistol but not from a shotgun
 i work for the government in washington
  uh-huh 
 wow
 you just
 that's a good size fish
 
 uh-huh
 yeah
 every year
 i'm fascinated by that
 most of the time
 and one thing she's trying to instill in kids um besides just reading and writing are just some the golden rules
 can you tell much difference between the local radio t v stations
 where'd you get the car
  his life  isn't worth very much then
 which most of them probably aren't
 uh-huh
 it's like they were using them as friends when we were having the conflict
 what's that
 yeah
 yeah
 okay
 i don't know
 sure
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
 knowing
 no
 let's see
 that's right
 i hate the eight and a half percent sales tax
  deed  for deed that
 they really ought to change the name i think in indianapolis
 they are
 that's one of the worst
 just more facts would be nice
 yeah
 i don't think they can
  uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 right
  right 
 i didn't like the way it ended though
 
 right
 sure
 uh-huh
 
 uh-huh
 yeah
 i think  that's  generally speaking pretty true
 although it is not killing that many people now it still has the opportunity to get out of control and become a huge problem
 who's going to come and build me a fence too
 oh
 i would say about ten or fifteen years ago i
 yeah
 yeah
 okay
 have you read that
 i think so too
 really
 i went to europe nineteen seventy-three
 yeah
 except for time in service
 yeah
 i've only made
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 huh-uh
 you really don't
  uh-huh 
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh

 yes
 yeah
 he really is good

 uh-huh
 and and tell your wife i hope we i get her again sometime too
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 yeah
 that's about it
 i don't think i've read it
 yeah
 sometimes i think they carry it a little bit too far
 that's the kind of things  that throw you off
 i'm supposed to ask you how do you make use of your credit cards
 right
 uh-huh
 they're always wanting to go on a diet or something
 i'm glad that you're in the business
 yes
 i don't think it would
 i think most people are aware at least now common knowledge is that
 the
 yeah
 have you heard of that
 okay
 i
 right
 but we have been looking at these red chevro-
 
 how can you afford all of this
 the bedrooms are a little bit small except the master bedroom's a little bigger
 yes
 i have no idea
 
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 that's true
 uh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 do you have that where you live
 right
 uh-huh
  uh-huh 
 right
 it was supposed to be two dollars an hour for two kids
 it was just crazy enough for th-
 huh-uh
 that's
 
 we're hoping it takes off again
 it does
 you are talking about p o w or missing in actions
 yeah
 several people were supposed to bring
 it must be a somewhat different environment from a regular college
 right
 uh-huh
 what part of the country are you from
 yeah
 yeah
 
 yeah
 i will not read my lips or whatever
 
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
 right
 i was hoping he was going to get best actor
 no
  wow
 inside
 
 right
 right
 i haven't heard much lately
 i went around the trim
 uh-huh
 yeah
 that's right
 uh-huh
 yeah
 it is
 nina and cliff
 uh-huh
 bye-bye
 yeah
 wow
 yeah
 a lot of work
 yeah
 i know
 uh-huh
 right
 they actually show you what duckwork and things
 just never given back
 someone came home
 uh-huh
 right
 what is the woodward book you are referring to
 french horn is absolutely wonderful instrument
 it seems like we are doing it here forever
  a six  person jury could have decided either way of course
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 now i mean now there's i heard that they were going to start calling on saturdays or some-
 we go in
 anyone that would use chemical weapons to fight his own people
 yeah
 yeah
 all over the place
 banking
 yeah
 don't get a lot of particulates
 they go to jail
 
 i know
 that's a long time
 
 huh-uh
  uh-huh 
 for me
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
 we live in a little small town
 no
 the ninety-eight
 uh-huh
 yes
 uh-huh
 that's right
 you think you're getting your money's worth
 you all don't have any other children around there
 right
 uh-huh
 i had
 that's right
 
 uh-huh
  
  you get to 
 they need money so much because they're constantly having to  run 
  oh
 because it looked so formidable
 just start not even
 uh-huh
 two years
 do you do needlepoint also and cross stitching
 yeah
 
 yeah
 uh-huh
 i had to put my bifocals on to see it
 that's one of those few that i do watch when the television is on
  huh 
 we do oil well services
 yeah
 right
 yes
 it's  
 yeah
 my job kind of hinders me from exercising
 good
 are you a player
 have you ever been to biffin's
 that's true
 we're getting to where
 yeah
 
 it was aerobics and lifting weights three nights a week
 me too
  bye bye 
  yeah 
 let me turn off my stereo here
 yeah
 that's neat
 yeah that's true
 uh-huh
 it really does
 and they can show you the records they've gotten all their maintenance on schedule and everything like that
  yes 
 uh-huh
 right
 
 that's another bias
 
 they been trying these people now for twenty-two years ever since i was a child
 
 it doesn't pay well
 especially as rainy as it's been in the last couple of years
 bye-bye
 uh-huh
 of course my family and i
 it's going to look like
 some of my suits i haven't put on for
 i think i will enjoy cooking more when i am not working when i do not get home until five-thirty or six and i have to cook and clean up
 right
  yeah 
 yes
 that might help a little bit especially in some places
 no
  yeah 
 i get a kick out of that
 i
 
 
 uh-huh
 huh-uh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 
 as a matter of fact i prefer public television
  yeah
 actually seventeen now
 uh-huh
 hi cynthia
 few women in the class
 then a then a doctor type job
 yeah
 that's true
 uh-huh
 
 let somebody get something out of it
 i'm a government employee
 i took  a lot of my 
 
 i like to watch rock and roll videos and any kind of  videos 
 they were floating around
 uh-huh
 boy what a help that is
  and  training
 yeah
 no
 no
 that's true
 everybody's spayed
  that is neat 
 uh-huh
 oh
 that
  you  should just put down the basics and put n a where you don't want to answer
 that's true
 very much
 
 yes
 that they that they like pick on th- the advanced students and pay more attention to them
 right
 i'm living in that dorm
 yeah
 sure
 up on blocks
 yeah
 i miss it
 even the religious organizations
 all local
 yeah
 yeah
 i don't think i'd go to work without a bulletproof vest on myself  
 a lot of things
 you actually have to go up there
 yeah
 uh-huh
 bye-bye
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 yeah
 he does it every day like a ritual
 yeah
 huh
 uh-huh
 which is most unfortunate because we all lose out
 
 yeah
 of course
 uh-huh
 it was like we can't take it back
 we just couldn't
 yeah
 sure
 it gives it a little tang
  if it 
 yeah
 i think that was probably the last movie i've seen too
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 more than just seriously
 uh-huh
 atlanta and dallas are almost identical in every way weather and everything
 did i reach the dallas area
 okay
 to look through my things and not trust me
 uh-huh
 as far as brokers all i get calls from brokers in new york
 
 just to imagine that one day they're just going to turn around and someone is going to say we don't like you and start attacking again
 
 no
 
 i like that
 and for three months
 he's going to be working for chevron
 
 yeah
 i know i have to do more aerobics
 everybody
 okay
 
 right
 yeah
 have you seen the debit cards where they actually debit your account when you
 nope
  right 
 uh-huh
 right
 i think maybe more information should be given out about it
  and watch it on  monday night
 good
 i agree
 i know
 we have blueberries blackberries
 in fact this morning i was almost late for work because i'm almost at the end of this book
 not really because i'm listed in the phone book
 yeah
 right
 basically
 yeah
 we play r b i baseball on nintendo
 what was wrong with her was she not attractive enough did she not take good enough care of her man to keep his interest
 have you
 we have a separate area for the garden
 i'm a
 okay
  uh-huh 
 oh
 it carried over
  it's like  nothing to them
 yeah
 yeah
  i have a younger brother like that
  i  could possibly do it
 did someone just come up with this design
 when the
 good buddies
  uh-huh 
 either
 my son's in a performance tonight
 right
 uh-huh
 i'm saying that's how it was perceived
 which is not always true
 oh
 uh-huh
 in fact a lot of people will ride outside in the snow
 right
 that's the way
 yeah
 and the interest to the children
 uh-huh
 
 and then come home and get back into regular clothes again
 uh-huh
 yeah
 we had to call the insurance company
 no
 another problem is you're going to keep the smarter people in the system too long paying the wages they do
 right
 yeah
 no
 married
 yeah
 this was in louisiana
 i'm that way about a lot of different shows
 i didn't know we had one either
 yes
 
 yeah
 oh yes
 okay this person is taking drugs
 yeah
 what area of lakes do you like
 what are some of your favorite foods
  uh-huh 
 uh-huh
  uh-huh 
 as a matter of fact i can tell you something about that
 what i have always identified is i am basically good with money
  right 
  the thing
 uh-huh
 as we visited we were involved every weekend in just helping them redo this and refinish that
 uh-huh
 we'll start them inside
 yeah
 i'm still a full size person
 uh-huh
 oh
 yeah
 right
 uh-huh
 
 yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
 that's just it
 yeah
 what do you want to do
 uh-huh
 
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 right
  yeah  
 yes
 yeah
 yeah
 
 uh-huh
 gorgeous leaves and trees and all the lakes and the mountains and things
  but there's so many more people 
 i just finished james michener's texas book
 
 we wound up selling the house
 right
 you wonder about that sometimes
 uh-huh
 i think that was good
 i like the old-timey ones
  uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 really
 i'm sure that's true
 yeah
 i wonder
  it's like
  yeah
 i'm trying to get out
 i'm from new jersey originally
 
 and they would buy a plot of land and contractors and builders
 
 isn't that terrible
 yeah
 and so
 uh-huh
  that  would make me happy though
 yeah
 okay
 yeah
 yeah
  uh-huh 
  okay
 yeah
 i know
 yeah
 they're putting in fifty sixty hours a week
 you mean
  i think that's true
 i thought that was just great
 boy
 the standard old tuna fish
 absolutely
 right
 that
 yeah
 huh-uh
 
 and the uranium
 uh-huh
 yeah
 uh-huh
 i know that both of mine have probably learned quite a bit from there
 yeah
 eighty-six
 you only have to check in with the office once or twice a week
 how old is she
 that's why
 yeah
 
 right
 or
 i think that's just part of their overall educational process is to get out and see and do things
 yeah
 really
 that is true
 i think the greed of the eighties got
 uh-huh
 it's making me hungry for them
 oh
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 they're hos-
 yes
 i think they're wonderful
 it does every
 
 pardon me
 what's your favorite thing to cook if you're having a dinner party
 uh-huh
 he's small

 yeah
 not at all
 oh
 i wanted to be a p e teacher
 i do too
 in central america
 okay
  
 
 i've
 i know some senators

 it's only getting worse exponentially it seems
 yeah
 yeah
 i'm in lubbock texas
 
 bye-bye
 you too
 yes ma'am
 yeah
 if it ever touched my fam-
 
 yeah
 do you think they should have the right to send them to be tested
 as a civilian that's never been attached to any form of the military
 yeah
 yeah
 okay
 yeah
 we do that too
  doctor seuss 
 i don't know
 that's right
 yes 
 
 yeah
 uh-huh
 i was led to believe that if you weren't t i that you get money

 yeah
 no
 uh-huh
 not too challenging to the brain
 yeah
 nobody told me that it was all fake
 that was
 do you think the verdict should be completely unanimous by the jury

 uh-huh
 did they give you a number to call
 we don't need to back talk
