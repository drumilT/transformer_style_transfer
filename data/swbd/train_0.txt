what kind of experience do you do you have then with child care
i guess i think uh i wonder if that worked
you might try uh
and see if it uh
i well i don't remember
i guess i guess we can start uh
i don't i don't have any kids
i uh my sister has a she just had a baby
and she was worrying about going back to work and what she was going to do with him and the different
but i used to work and when i had two children
but i don't envy anybody who's in that
but does your sister live in a big community
it's a it's a fairly large community
she uh got real lucky though
he had a boss who uh moved into a larger office and she's able to take her baby to work with her
and it's a small office that she works in and uh it's a it's a legal firm office
and it's just one lawyer and so she's the only one really that takes care of the office
and so they have an extra room and everything for the baby
so it works out pretty good for her
i i know a lot of people around here sometimes have like mothers or grandmothers that take care of their kids
and but the community i'm in is not a real large one
so there are a lot of people who babysit in their homes that you know
so it's fairly safe
so but uh
i i d- don't feel comfortable about leaving my kids in a big day care center but simply because there's so many kids and so many
and uh you know colds and things like that
but and they're expensive
or they just watch them and let them play and things like that
and you and you don't always even know if it's it's going to be the right place or not
because after i guess after he you know gets to a certain age she's going to have to take him to a day care
when when he's not when she can't keep control of him
and he starts crawling
it would be nice to have him around but uh seems like you know
you know at the wrong time
well when you have kids will you work
i don't know that's something i've considered uh
actually i teach my kids at home
so i'm here all the time
oh so they don't go to school
is it like uh
oh what's that called
it's uh correspondence school
some states uh say that you have to be a certified teacher in order to do that
and i'm not a certified teacher
but i you know but my kids are only elementary grades levels right now
so they haven't been to public schools at all
and so you know my oldest he was
and then my youngest two have never been
but we don't
so you've never had
well uh does the company you work for test for drugs
actually uh they just recently started a policy of testing drugs which was kind of interesting
because w- when i went to work for them uh they didn't do that
but uh since then they've they've started a drug testing policy not because of their own uh convictions but because the clients of our company are requests that we do that
we're not being tested for drugs at all uh
our policies and procedures manual uh the furthest it goes about drugs is in the kind of the miscellaneous section or it's reasons for immediate dismissal
so that's pretty general
but uh i work for an environmental management firm and i'm an engineer there
but i do go on a lot of hazardous waste sites
but i don't operate any machinery
now people for our company that do operate machinery like drill rigs and things like that are under a a medical monitoring program
because they're at a higher risk of exposure
and blood screening is part of that
and i i think that drugs
but it's not their exclusive
it's just part it's just something that turns up in the other parameters that they test for
but i think it's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have to exercise some quick judgment in the field
well it's actually uh
so a lot of our clients are oil companies big oil companies
and they go out to
so the clients are very concerned that you know the engineers who go out there are adhering to their drug policy because they're on their their you know territory and everything
but the thing that's interesting is that i w- i'm an engineer and a software engineer
and i work in the software uh house
and everybody there you know are all software engineers
they've never you know they never go out to the the oil rigs or anything
and yet we're getting we're subjected to this policy you know the same one that uh th- all the engineers have to to
well a little different actually
but uh you know we have to go through the same thing
and it's but it's uh it's a little different i guess than
and then if you get injured on the job if you like trip and fall or something uh they give you a drug test right away
but a lot of people were really upset with the policy at first
and tha- they didn't find any problem with that you know
we that's been an a an issue uh in our company even though we don't have the random or even regular drug screening
and people will just get
i mean i've
and i have many a time called him to come get me you know
and uh uh but y- you know they don't think twice about serving beer by the keg
but uh i think drug testing
and i i don't know
i guess i k- i think it's got some relevance
but i think its relevance is pretty limited
i mean i think you know
it's really it's really bizarre
uh particularly like where we are you know
there was a story of a woman last year who who actually did slip on the ice and and like sprained her ankle
and she she was a personnel secretary
and i don't know
i you know i have a lot of mixed feelings about on the one hand it's like if you know
they're they should be able to make it as a continue of employment in some sense
and you know it's like you're i mean employments are contractual by nature anyway but uh i had an experience when i was interviewing for a job that where i had to uh uh do a drug test
and and it's it was kind of a long story
but it was it was just an incredibly humiliating experience what i went through
and it amounted to uh going in uh before any of these interviews
i'm going in for like interviews
and they flew me out to chicago
and and uh before i went into any of the interviews uh they took me to the doctor to give me a physical
they said it was going to be a physical you know
and uh actually bec- beforehand they told me they were going to uh do drug screening
but i had forgotten about that
and so basically i'd already peed off in that morning
and and when i got in there i didn't i wasn't like able to give a full sample
and so they made me sit and wait for forty-five minutes drink a whole ton of water before
and the and the the procedure is utterly humiliating
and then he examines you
uh the question was kind of interesting to me because i was just trying to put together a uh long term financial plan and monthly budget
the only thing i do now is uh put the data into quicken
and uh i've considered using it once myself
but i decided that the amount of information that would have to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date
so i i kind of gave up on the idea of using quicken at least for now
um i've found it's the only reliable way to keep a check book balanced actually because what will happen is my wife will write a few checks and then well uh uh not bother to total it and then it comes in to doing all the arithmetic
so it really helps with that
well it's similar problems
but uh we just have the one check book
and occasionally we will get behind like you say
well how to you handle that the long range or medium range planning on finances
well actually we haven't had to uh until just recently
i guess we've got a a daughter who is eighteen months and another one on the way
so we needed to start doing more of that just for uh you know saving for college and things like that
we tried a way try to put away two and four thousand a year just for that
well that's pretty good if you can do that
and we haven't really put much away for her college up to this point
but uh we're to the point now where our financial income is enough that we can consider putting some away for college
so we are going to be starting a regular payroll deduction in the fall
and then the money that i will be making this summer we'll be putting away for the college fund
um sounds good
i guess we're we're just at the point uh
and then you know now we're just going on the one income
so it's a lot more interesting trying to uh
find some extra payroll deductions is probably the only way we will be able to uh do it
you know kind of enforce the savings
but uh it will be interesting to see
well our situation is just a little bit kind of the opposite of that cause my wife was not working for some time and was going to school and just recently uh took on a full time job well almost full time
so it's only recently that we've had the money where we could start putting away large sums of it for uh long range goals like college and sickness and travel and that kind of thing
but uh uh i was just curious what uh part of the country
uh cincinnati actually
i was kind of wondering if they would be collecting people with uh the western accents or something like that
i don't know how many people are uh getting involved in this
but uh well that's interesting
i'm uh uh actually uh i was kind of interested if you found out about the study by uh reading telecom digest
or was there another
uh a colleague of mine at uh work got some information over uh the computer network called internet
and he just forwarded that on to me
and uh it sounded like it would be an interesting project to participate in
so i sent back mail
it will be interesting to see what it would be interesting to see how the data base
so well i guess we're talking about the experiment
uh probably need to try to get back on the topic
but uh it's hard to talk about finances without without getting to uh dollar figures i guess you know
well what other long range goals do you have besides college
uh well i think either my wife or i would like to pursue advanced degrees at some point uh i guess we will have to factor that in if we are not working for employers that happen to fund that
it seems like every year my employer just gives back you know a little bit your tuition reimbursement
i mean they use to reimburse one hundred percent
and now it's uh now it's reimbursement depending on the grade you get in class
and uh it's a real shame from what we had before uh because we're
uh actually i lived over in europe for a couple of years
and in germany they don't have the jury system
what they do is they have uh three judges basically
and you get up there
and the prosecuting attorney presents his evidence
and your defense attorney presents their evidence
and those three guys take the evidence go off figure it out and then come back and say whether you're guilty or not
i mean when you have a man that's signed a a a statement saying he's guilty
we have a a family called all day family
and what they've done is they've bought mercedes after mercedes after mercedes is what they've done
i mean uh uh i would have to look at it
i- if they did it with the uh just the judges the police have to do a lot better job of making sure that their evidence is airtight
because the judges sitting in that kind of stuff day after day they know all the procedures
you can't use this as uh evidence you know because it was either illegally obtained or whatever
and you know you wouldn't have this uh uh theatrics where the lawyer jumps up and presents it to the to the jury
and then the judge says oh no
d- disregard that
any jury's not going to disregard the evidence you know
uh that's true
i i i think our judicial system is attorney welfare myself
i i hold it in the utmost contempt
the uh d- my favorite is the police department
because you and i we have work schedules
and if they do catch them they don't get any monetary gain out of it whereas us we write a check
so where do you think they target their efforts
leave the details up to somebody else huh
i think to begin with you would h- you would have
like here in atlanta area our crime rate is just astronomical
yet you go out on the streets
and they're giving speeding tickets
well you know uh talking about the lawyers you know what might very well do uh cause a uh a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that is to set the fees for cases
it's kind of like do it do it in the similar vein similar like uh v c r or television repair
if you take your t v in a lot of these t v repair places will say well i'll repair your t v for a hundred dollars
and if he gets in there and starts rooting around and finds something in there that's really tremendously wrong with it then he eats it
he he repairs it gives it back to you and takes your hundred dollars
now if he comes in and says you know i'll repair your your v c r or somebody else's v c r for a hundred dollars gets in there
so maybe if we did that with the lawyers so that you know whether it's a murder case or a you know a civil uh somebody suing somebody else you get x dollars for that case
and that's it
because when you get the most heinous of crimes have you ever noticed you always get the most renowned defense attorney
and here's this bum that didn't have a job and he's got a attorney that you and i could never afford
um y- well you you know
and you're talking to the other half that's paying for it
you know that's it it's it's amazing
and and when you stop and look at it i mean the judges th- they're all former lawyers
well that's another problem
i mean they're they're totally and morally bankrupt without any ethics whatsoever
and with that type person running it i mean you you could expect that you
do you know anyone that uh is is in a nursing home or has ever been in one
but i my grandparents were looking into it before
so i know what they've said
well i'm trying to think
my uh uh wife's grandmother had alzheimer's
and they were going to put her into a a nursing home
and uh they when they put her in she had all kinds of trouble
and the nursing home made them come
oh they thought it was too much of a bother
i mean she sort of went you know bananas
and they couldn't couldn't deal with her
so i guess you need to uh know whether it's a you know a no deposit no return kind of thing whether
if they're equipped too to handle the kind of patients you're going to have you know put in there too
because i know my grandparents wanted to have some independence still
but they wanted to be independent as well
my grandmother actually was in a a nursing home that uh
there was a retirement hotel and then a uh
so for uh the first few years she had her own apartment and you know made her own meals sometimes but could could also go and eat someplace else
and then uh as she became less able to take care of herself then she moved into this other part that was able to uh provide full-time care
and uh she didn't have to do anything anymore
but my experience has been that most people that move into nursing homes die very quickly
and that's som-
i don't know whether that's because they you know sort of give up hope once they get in there or what the the reason is
but i think the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home is only like six months or something
well a lot of it's probably to do with the fact that people go to it because they need help
so they're already ill before they go
if if you can take care of yourself at all or have someone that can take care of you then you stay where you are
or people send you there as a last resort
so that was their thinking
and also so they could find someplace that they enjoyed while they still had choices to make
and of course you can't just sit around and wait
and the money is also another issue how you're going to pay for it
and i guess it's not exactly fair for the younger family members to have to put it in their savings
i mean it is kind of fair
but it's also not fair because they have their own children to raise
so it's another problem
and you probably if it were you you probably wouldn't want someone choosing a place for you to live based on lowest price
so it it's just so complicated anymore i think
and with medicine being the way it is you're extending life where sometimes the quality of living has gone down
and they're not necessarily enjoying life anymore
well maybe that's the purpose of the nursing home is to have them go someplace where they can see that it's not worth continuing
and cause like if your spouse died all alone it'd be nice to go someplace with people similar to you
i've known quite a few people that have uh gone to retirement communities
but here in california and in ari-
uh so what do you think uh about putting the elderly in a nursing home
well i think that it it varies on on the individual basis
uh sometimes it is there is no alternative
uh you do not have uh uh family available or family that's uh
you may not even have family that is uh uh in you know who are around
so sometimes it's not an alternative
and i think uh but i think also sometimes it can be uh a benefit if it's for a short time
sometimes in a nursing home uh especially if if it's after an acute illness
or to rehab after uh an illness
sometimes you know sometimes the nursing homes are good for uh just short periods of time
because too often the acute hospitals will are sending them out much faster than what they're
so so there is some good to it
uh sometimes too it's used as a dumb job
you know the fam- well the families do not necessarily
and they don't want to take the responsibility
so they will put them in a nursing home
so you see uh
and it depends on how how sick the person is too what you're capable of like if you have a family to take care of you know of your own
but uh to the best of my ability i'd like to do it until it gets impossible
it's there's not a choice it's because it's not economically feasible even to put them in a nursing home
but i think nursing homes can be good
you know you need to check them out ahead of time
and then there's also some that are set up for specialties uh i know some
unfortunately some elderly have to go to or have i guess it's alzheimer's or where they wonder or or uh
and you need a special nursing home for that
you need one that has a unit that's locked where they are not able to get out and roam around and you need people who are trained for that type of problem
so so there's different types of nursing homes i think
well my uh grandmother's not really in a nursing home but a retirement home that also has a nursing home sort of attached to it
and then she decided that uh she's eighty five years old that eventually you know she she doesn't want her family taking care of her and being a burden
and uh she really enjoys it right now
gives her a little bit of her own independence but she still has uh a security there
and then there's also uh sort of a wing for those people that do get sick
and what i like about it and i think she likes about it is that she knows everybody there now
and then so if she ever does become ill uh it will be like family around her
and i i've seen some of them like that too
and also they have a lot of uh activities going on for the ones who are more active
so it's not sort of like uh uh a sick place
and she travels
and uh it's in in the very in the mountains
and it's beautiful
oh definitely it's
i i think i think the uh i think that the decision that needs to be made though on nursing home has to be a joint one between the uh elderly uh person who's
and sometimes the choices because of the nature of the illness when they're
so uh do you happen to be working for a large firm
well it's about three hundred and fifty people
but it's big enough
and they have a they don't have any kind of pension plan where they contribute anything
and i wish they did
you know they have a four o one k
but i put all the money into it
uh i work for a fairly large company
we don't have four o k- one k plan stuff like that
but we do have like retirement
and then the rest is whatever you want to put in if you put more than that or something like that
oh that's a pretty good deal
now how long does it take for your contribution to vest
god i don't know
i'm sure it's not till like twenty-five years thirty years
it's like hundred bucks a a month or something for a family
huh well i guess what we have is like a f- what they call a flex benefits plan where you you get like a certain amount of dollars
and then you spend it on a cafeteria of whatever you want or need
otherwise you can uh
we have one of those use it or lose it plans too where uh they'll basically pay for uh you know child care type uh expenses
i can send in a uh can send in a request for payment
and they'll uh and they'll send me you know a check for the amount they withheld
that's pretty good you know
it's uh it saves a third off on taxes or something
well it depends on which company you work for
i know that like the the the one plan that everyone seems to be in in my place is uh you know you uh think you call it plan d
it's like fifteen hundred dollars
but if you go for the other ones you're paying too much money for them because it's unlikely if you're f- relatively uh healthy then it's really unlikely that you'd use that much amount of money you know
so the- it you know someone did start a cost benefit analysis
and ends up the best is to take a high deductible and and take a loss what- whatever it happens to be if you happen to be a healthy individual
uh on the other hand you know i i had a similar had a similar health plan
and uh one of my kids was in a car accident
and uh i had wound up having to pay for you know a bunch of doctor visits and stuff out of my pocket because of you know no no insurance policy happened to cover it which is
you mean not even your your your car insurance
well it it got all screwed up because i had a high deductible on the health insurance no fault here
and and i had a high deductible on the
and then s- you know we just goofed up the medical insurance and the car insurance and stuff and
uh well i don't know
i think other than health insurance i think uh you know an extra week of uh
and then every every year they give you an extra day until you've got four weeks
oh that's nice
we don't get them till till your seventh year of service till you get an extra week
especially in the kind of engineering job i'm in you know companies don't stay afloat that long
and and they
but now they don't
so you work for bell or something like that
it's the bell corps which is uh
so i don't know
it's it's uh no longer
so that's what
and and now they don't uh
all that stuff huh
but they no no longer
uh hearing a lo-
there's always they're always laying people off which is another benefit that you can have other than salary is trade that off for security
is it i mean does it
they must have pretty good severance though huh
oh i don't know
we don't we haven't been doing layoffs
we've been doing uh down sizing with uh getting rid of extra layers of management
and uh i don't know what they do for those people
mean the the the management they get rid of
there's too many manage too many chiefs and not enough indians
oh they they put
well have you ever served on a jury
but i had to beg off from the duty
well i was called
and then i was not chosen
well i was i was uh originally chosen primarily i think because i was a young fellow
and they tend to view the younger fellows as more likely to hand down a guilty verdict
but they saw it
but uh back to the issue is uh
but there too there are also cases in which i feel a majority rule might be acceptable particularly i think in civil cases
in criminal cases i'd like to see the unani- unanimity remain
but in civil cases i think a majority rule by by jury would be sufficient
well uh could you give me an example of a case where you think that
well in a criminal case say one in which you know there is like say assault or some such i think there ought to be a unanimous uh vote because by law and by constitution there must be proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this
and in civil law there you know is such a thing as like let's say uh
well i mean i think
are you just trying to say that criminal cases are more uh tangible
like for instance say uh
and also too i think i'm i'm tempering this and the fact that the consequences are much more uh serious in a criminal case
well do you think that that in a civil case if there was majority rule that it would be easy for someone to be set up
um well i really can't say for certain truth be known
uh as it stands there's there's many ways and means by which a person can be set up both uh in a civil uh civil and criminal case
i mean the uh documentary the thin blue line pretty much demonstrated that
you know i don't know for if you're familiar with that or not
a uh fellow
and uh so he served out his his sentence until it was discovered by a fellow who was making a documentary called the thin blue line that this guy had basically gotten railroaded through the judicial system
and he was exonerated
well i mean i think that there are many cases in our judicial system where justice is not served
and i also think just like you were talking about before why you were chosen to be on a jury that uh the just the process of picking jurors is not always objective
oh certainly not
but they're really looking for someone who will pretty much fulfill the lawyers' desires
you know the
because you get up
you know each attorney can use that as much as they like
or i think it's a limit now
but they pretty much go through that
and then you have to give a reason to the court why you can't serve
so but onto the thing uh i was never aware that juries had any say on recommending sentencing
so i guess it starts recording now
i don't know really know that much about the recycling in this area that we're in
and i'm not real familiar with uh anything that
fact as far as i know the school doesn't have any kind of programs or anything out here and uh or the grocery store or anything
and they started off recycling by uh putting the
i guess the uh city is has bought the big green trash cans
and uh we they have a recycling truck that comes around now
and you separate your glass and paper and uh aluminum
and you set it out
and they pick it up
and it it works real neat
i'm we're originally from another state
and i know in the state we were from that they did that t- similar type thing
the city brought ought you know set tr- separate trash cans
and you separated your stuff
and you put it in there
and they took it you know
did they did they like on bottles did they give you a so many cents back for for cans
they they started after we moved down here
and so i i'm not really familiar
i just know that uh my in-laws up in up in oklahoma that's how they do you know they pick it up
but i don't know if they get a get anything back on it
or do you get money for it
i just i noticed it
so you don't see too many thrown out around the
you know all kinds of bottles they they they really charge people to i guess when you purchase them and and then when you turn them back in
i n- i remember the old days as a kid where bottle was a nickel
and now now most of them are throwaway
so maybe that's one thing they can do
uh i bought some cokes the other day in the br- the little bottles you know
and i think the bottles were like i know they were at least ten cents apiece
and uh and they were like it was like two dollars and something for the bottles
you know i was like god almighty
it's pretty dangerous out there you know when they fall over
but but it's uh it's quite
they say that the green glass now that there's a big glut of green the green glass
well out in this area they really don't have anything
now i know that like minyard's and places like that around like arlington and fort worth and a lot of those grocery stores they have like four different bins out front
uh different colors for different things and and things like that
but i i do know some of these places were doing that
and they discontinued them because people were coming and dumping their trash in them
they they really don't
uh there's too much labor involved i guess to separate the stuff
it it can be
selecting you know clean junk as they say
well who wants to clean their junk before they throw it away
well it was nice talking to you
oh i think i think two or three minutes is fine
well it was nice talking to you
and i i guess i'll do this for i was doing this for actually i was going to do it for my son so that he could uh he he's in high school so that he could make some money
uh but then it has my name on it
so i'm like okay
well we're doing it for a church choir
oh are you
oh that's interesting
well thank you
so have you heard about saturns
i haven't been over uh to a dealer to look at them although i did see something in tonight's paper that said that their uh reliability is rated to be equal to that of the i guess the japanese cars
ooh that's great
actually that's kind of the type of car that i i'm thinking about we might get
saturns you can't go to a dealer unless you go to a a saturn dealer
this this offshoot of g m
and uh supposedly they've got great customer
uh yet i don't know wh- whether i would buy saturn or not at this point
my card and uh desires tend to be pretty picky
and so uh
well like what
well let's see
i li- i like cars that are designed with with human beings in mind
and that's not just the driver and the passenger
but that's the person who's working on it
cause i do al- almost all my own maintenance and uh those types of things
and i found that while you can find some cars that are comfortable to ride in uh finding a ca- car anymore that's that's fairly easy for me to work on it's just not very eas- it's not very
and uh yo-
and i and i do the work on most of the work on that myself
and when i look at modern cars and stuff like that i just say i will never do that with the modern cars
and it's so complicated too
and i say boy you know
i i'd have to almost go take a class or something like that
and i find that for a normal you know everyday things it's really very easy to work on
and so uh you know i'm kind of spoiled
and uh i really liked working on it uh cause it was pretty easy too
so i'm kind of uh biased in that
and you know i want a car that i can work on because i think it just costs too much even to get the oil changed anymore
and that's kind of that's that's probably one thing i'd look at
actually the car one of the cars we'd most like to get would be the new ninety-one ford taurus cause they're actually one of the cheaper cars that have dual side air bags
i've driven some uh tauruses over the last couple of years when i've been on business trips
uh as rental cars
and i've always been very impressed
i think it's very
uh reasonable performance
and this is out in california where
uh i've been real impressed with that
and i didn't realize that they were putting dual uh air bags in that car now
or excuse me the ninety-twos
oh i think that that's excellent
but the thing is that it's twenty thousand dollars
actually my my wife and i are actually thinking contemplating buying a new car in the next year and a half or so
so we're actually been looking around and thinking about things
we'd like to get like a
oh i don't know
a dealer return type thing on a ninety-two and ninety-three or something like that you know
see if we
that that would be a good deal to go with
and the other thing we're looking at is the saturns too
because they looked really nice
what do you what do you looking for in in those
what what attracts you to the saturns
or or of course we've already talked you know
but wh- what kind of things are you looking for
well the saturns you can get air bags in them
but one of the the two things that
the the i'd say the most important thing is a car that's not going to fall apart that doesn't have problems
and you just get so depressed for the u s auto makers when you do that
because you see the reliability and the types of problems they have
and the other one is
so those two things
and then you know
what is your uh community uh currently doing with regard to recycling
uh basically they're just uh having various recycling uh bins uh located for uh trash pickup
some some local communities are very active in that uh in that respect
and they do have bins set up
but i live in a a metropolitan area
and uh they're not uh too inclined to do something as aggressive as that
well here they and
uh live in an apartment complex
and they only have one set of recycling bins one or two sets as opposed to a set at each of the dumpsters
so a lot of the people who live up front don't bother to recycle because you know it's too far to carry the stuff to the other bins
i i know a lot i think a lot of uh the the issues with regard to recycling are that uh people have to be motivated to do to do
and and i think that and i know massachusetts has
and we have had a bottle bill for quite a few years now
and the majority of the incentive in recycling bottles probably believe it or not is just to get the extra nickel at the uh the store and not uh
where people aren't really you know eco conscious it's just the fact that it's something they have to do
and i'm not going to throw a bottle away
but uh people need to be more conscious of it
they th- here they're trying to push through a bill
and a lot of people are against it
and it's going to create a lot more work for the uh the stores that sell you know sodas and stuff
because they want to implement a refund on cans and on plastic bottles and everything
it didn't it it took awhile for that bill to be passed up here as far as recycling bottles and cans
but and it's been pretty successful
and people notice it as far as uh highways being uh you know
people would dr- have a drink of soda
instead of throwing out the window they they keep the bottle
but more importantly it's recycling reusable materials back into uh
and that's the big thing i think that th- they try to promote
i think here if they uh instead of just you know requiring that you put put out the trash and stuff if they could get some kind of rebate those people who do put the stuff out uh you know and separate it have lower collection fee or something may encourage people to separate
th- there definitely has to be a motivation factor
and i know that at w- where i work
and there's a big push on for recycling uh paper materials you know computer output paper and also to decrease the amount of uh styrofoam usage because of the uh
and and they're very proactive
and uh matter of fact they give you discounts if you use
so so i- i- it's incentives like that that get people people more conscious of it
i think that's that's what they need to do be more proactive like that
uh i know uh i believe it was last year that they actually collected the old phone books
uh usually have them come from you know projects to collect old ones
and phone books are a large volume of annual
they they just
matter of fact that that reminded me of an article i saw in the pa-
the local schools you could send your phone book to your uh to with your kid to school
and what they'll do is they'll recycle it
because there was an article or a story done awhile ago that uh
a guy went to a d- a landfill dug down five feet and and pulled up a phone book from like nineteen sixty
because they don't they don't degrade over such a period of time
well part of the problem with recycling them in the past has been the covers are made with a clay based paper
and they used to have to take out all the uh pages and then cut the spine off to be able to recycle them
now i think they've come up with some way of uh pulling the glue out
how about uh let's see about ten years ago
uh what do you think was different ten years ago from now
they they did more things together
uh they ate dinner at the table together
uh the parents usually took out time uh you know more time than they do now to come with the children and just spend the day doing a family activity
uh although i'm not a mother i i still think that uh a lot has changed since ten years ago
uh what do you think about that
well uh actually ten years from today seems rather short
and uh i don't know
it leaves leaves a lot of time out for family and things like that
but i think that has a lot to do with economic situation
what about like as far as uh social changes in the individual
um it depends
uh it's hard to say because i think people were busy ten twenty
well how how old are you
so there's maybe a five year gap between us
i just i think that things were a bit were have been busy all along
it's just a matter where priorities are at placed
and that uh usually as far as families are concerned there used to be just one person working and usually the other parent was home
and now uh it's pretty much an economic necessity of for most in most places for both parents to work
do you think it's an economic c- necessity
or do you think that we're we're uh all trying to keep up with a certain standard of living
but i do think
i mean do you think
people really need two cars and a house in the suburbs or
but then there are a lot of people that that don't have that
and then there th- is is that other group that is working to maintain a standard of living that uh they think is is surviving
uh but i
yo- so you think it's
i'm saying that the uh the group that is just trying to survive from day to day where both parents are working is more of the majority than the than the people that have the higher standard of living
because if you look at economics across this country and statistics on who has the money and who the decreasing uh middle class in this country i think that that's in my opinion the case
i mean i have met people that uh both that
and then sometimes i i often uh find that maybe there's so many different things available to us yo- a microwave a v c r a answering machine a you know a special a dishwasher uh a refrigerator and some of those items um for the for the uh
well i guess we're sticking more to social changes
but uh people want all of that
and not all of those are necessities
so they're trying to
i say they uh
probably the best things to do is is tie them with a rope and throw them in the water
a a good a good southern solution
uh so uh how do you how do you feel
th- that's of course being facetious
uh i don't know
the the things they asked to talk about were whether the uh whether the judge should be the one that does the uh sentencing
and seems to me that that's i think that's the way it's done now
uh at least
uh it seems to me that the judge does it
and i i think that's probably all right in that they you know maybe know what the the norm is for a particular thing
and i guess also what the system will absorb
possibly though on uh capital cases like maybe the death penalty uh i'm kind of undecided on that whether the judge should have the sole
i mean he could have like a personal prejudice
you know judges are people like everybody else even though they're they're supposed to be impartial
but maybe uh
and i think that may i that may be an exception as well
because i think that
doesn't the jury decide on the death penalty rather than than the judge
i i think that's i think that's the way it is
uh whether they they decide whether or not they uh
and uh there's a big uproar going on right now uh the uh governor you know has been trying to decide whether he's going to commute it or not
you know it's someone who had uh
it's just like if you've got like a dog that's running wild and biting people put it to sleep you know
just get it out you know
it's not able to fit in you know
uh i guess
if somebody gets the death penalty they're they're judged guilty
and if not you know don't don't let them sit up there on death row for you know
but i guess there have been several cases where people have been executed by mistake
oh i'm sure
and you'd hate to be one of those
the other thing they asked about was whether uh uh the verdict should be required to be unanimous
which again i think is the way it is now that all the all verdicts
well maybe not
i think in like uh lesser cases it's like ten out of twelve or five out of six whatever
how ever many is on sitting on a jury
i t- i believe that's the way it is
but i'm pretty sure you're correct on capital cases uh
and that there's one juror that is is uh different than the other eleven
and they say they're hopelessly deadlocked
and the judge told them
that that's probably an expensive trial uh
you know i'm not sure there's a number
it's probably like thirty forty thousand dollars a day
maybe they could go with a with a nine hundred number and have people dial in and give their uh vote
that's that's been so long i've prac- practically forgot who noriega was you know
my uh cousin is a f b i agent down in miami
she's not involved in that that case
but she does
well have you ever served on a jury
but i i haven't
but i uh never uh got selected for a jury
and they had some guy that was uh defending himself
so we're uh our discussion's about uh the care of the elderly
you know what what uh what do you think is important
uh i don't know how how old you are
but if you had if you had uh parents say or or or th- grandparents whatever it is uh who were ready
who who you thought might benefit from a nursing home what do you think you would look for
uh well i actually my dad's my dad's almost ninety
and he lives by himself
and he's in good shape
uh but uh some friends of mine have uh gone through this
i think i'd look for a home where they got a lot of attention and uh where they did some things to try to keep them um mentally alive
and where there was uh caring and compassionate where there were caring and compassionate people uh operating it
well my uh uh my wife's grandmother is in a nursing home in uh minnesota
and we go there uh once a year
we see we tend to see her there cause we're in boston
so we're pretty far away
and it seems uh
i mean the the environment there i don't know too much about it
but it it seems nice enough
uh it it's hard
at least half of the residents i would say are not not mentally sound
so it's hard to tell how much of that rubs off on those who are struggling to r- to retain uh clarity say uh you know
well i i don- i don't know
we we also my wife and i uh uh volunteer to go to a uh nursing home that's just a mile from our house
we uh she goes more often than i
we used to go once a month once every two months to visit some of the patients there
and we'd take we have a two year old son
and so we sometimes we'd take him with us
and uh there i would say it's the same thing
it's it's a nice uh relatively nice environment
but again um it must be depressing for the people who who are who are just e- e- essentially not able to take care of themselves in their own house but but certainly uh certainly have ar- ar- are have retained all of their uh mental skills and so on
it's must be depressing to to walk walk the halls and see an- and see all these other people who really don't know where they are
i think they're relatively re- respectful yeah and and concerned that in as much as they can be
i i think sometimes you know i've noticed uh people asking for uh some of the patients asking for things uh just repetitively and but things that are not reasonable
and so at some level the the the uh
i'm sure that the that the uh the staff l- learn what's normal for this person
and so it looks to me like maybe their not catering to this person's needs is really because this person is just you know is just in a state where they don't really need what they think they need you know
it it's possible
i was thinking also that there'd be there could be a fair burn out factor um in just having to respond to people's needs where the needs are sometimes depending on the person not going to be what we would perceive of as rational need
i'll tell you one thing though that'll that that i i saw that was really nice
we used to see a husband and wife in there uh together
and they were in the same room which not all husband and wives were
but these two were
and when you walked into their room they had brought all their furniture from their house and so
so it gives them a sense of identity
and it didn't look like uh you know how yo- you you walk into some rooms
and there's it's completely generic
and that's it
but this room on the other hand you know they got rid of all of the sort of standard issue beds and dressers and this and that
and they had all their stuff from their house
and it looked like uh i- i- it must have been
and it must also give them a sense of uh uh security and and uh and and you know s- s- uh
i i think part of what you're saying matches what i h- have read
i used to initially think that the only people who went into such residences were people who uh were adequately deficient in their abilities uh physical or mental that they couldn't take care of themselves
but i also know a couple of people whose parents have gone into such things because i think they provide um a lot of social activities
uh the one of my friend's parents who went in because she had largely lost her abilities
and she was in there for awhile when they were away on vacation
that that's that's new to me
well i think it i think t- it was sort of on the grounds that they were considering whether she would live there
and i feel like the whole vocabulary of this is very loaded if you think of words like like put her in there
and there there's so much
uh so your you i guess you're probably in the same uh same situation uh we're in
our our kids are grown up
but uh uh they're
uh one's twenty-six
and the other is uh twenty twenty-one
so they're uh uh
well they're going to be getting there
you know there's no no no prospects right away for anything to happen
oh i see
i have uh five children
the rest of my girls are like twenty-three twenty-six twenty-eight and twenty-nine
and i have three granddaughters right now
and uh i uh
and uh she's she's a teacher
and what she does is she
and and so she kind of
and they let her bring her her little daughter in for free
and then so
but she just works part-time
then i have another daughter in uh bountiful utah
and she has to work full-time
and it's just tearing her apart
and uh the baby just screams
i mean the baby is like seventeen months
and she just screams
well even if she knows that they're fixing to get ready to go over there
they're not even there yet you know
and and then i have my uh uh i have a seven month old granddaughter
and uh her mother stays home
and she they live they live with us you know in as orange county is really expensive
and so of course we love it because we get to see this cute little baby all the time
but uh uh she just
uh she used to work in pre in the preschool and and and child care
and she says after working in there
and and you know here she was a provider
but you know there's only so much one person can do
she said she'll never put her child in a in a in a preca- in a p- in a preschool
but it's really it's really really very difficult
well when when
the uh the first uh ten years see first ten or twelve years i stayed home
and uh then after that i i went to work
and uh uh uh a couple of times i just uh uh you know
th- then i had one job
and then that job ran out because it was kind of a government seeded type job
and then and then like about later i i tried to get the baby to a baby-sitter
supposed to be good uh recommended person from the church
and i knew her personally
but i quit my job because i couldn't stand how she was taking care of my child
i mean first of all uh her children were sick all the time
so when my son stayed over there he got sick
same thing same thing that the her kids had
and so uh we didn't take her over there until like about eleven o'clock
then he she'd take my son and her daughter over t- to kindergarten
that day uh i was saying now he he's sick
and she goes well she goes he has the same thing that all my kids have
that's what he got you know
goes well okay
so it's not like he's going to infect her kids
but then what happened was is i said uh he just threw up
and kindergarten starts at eleven thirty
so she said well she'll keep him home
and he'll probably just sleep anyway
well you know what
that woman sent her sent him to kindergarten
and he threw up again
and they put him in the nursery uh they put him in the nurse's office
and then what happened was is you know they gave her a call because they knew that she was my baby-sitter
and they said uh
well she wasn't home
i mean her all her kids were sick
but she wasn't home right
and her and her her daughter that was in kindergarten with him also did not go to school because she was sick
now why didn't he why didn't she keep him home with her
so it got to the point where he's he's supposed to get out of uh kindergarten like about two thirty
and i had to leave work
it was it was five o'clock in the evening
and i found out he was still there at school
and they were calling me
and they said somebody's got to pick him up
and i kept thinking that she was going to get picked up she was going to pick him up because she only lives in like two blocks away from the school
and he had a hundred and four fever
they couldn't uh give him anything because they're not allowed to at school and everything
i i quit that job
and i stayed home for awhile longer
then i went and got a uh a job in real estate where i can kind of adjust my time a little bit better
but uh i haven't had any good really very good experience with child care
when when our kids were small we had a couple of uh good good women who uh would often c- uh get them to come to the house
so who's your favorite team
well i uh
so i kind of grabbed on to that team
i i used to watch them a lot when they were playing the big iron curtain or steel curtain
well last year it was buffalo
and i i still try to keep up with buffalo because they just they just impressed me as being so efficient
and they never score
and that really impressed me
but then down here i li-
and i've been keeping up with the saints a lot
well they are exciting aren't they
the saints are starting to impress me this year you know a lot
they are they are just a fun team to watch
this it they are really
did you see the game sunday night or
there were they ha- uh a fireworks display at halftime
and some paper or something in the super dome up in the roof caught
oh you're kidding
so they had to stop the game in lieu of the third quarter and put out this fire
those big piece of something came flaming falling out of the roof and landed on the field
so there's this big fire on the field
and they were dumping the gatorade bucket and everything
oh i can't believe that
i mean you just really can't tell what's going to happen
and morton anderson kicked a sixty yard field goal
and it it was beautiful right down the middle
well do you think they're they're going to be able to make it this year
uh i s-
i'm not sure i'm not sure who they play
it's pretty much going between washington they are undefeated
and uh buffalo new orleans and chicago because chicago has only lost twice
and one of those was to buffalo
and they beat the saints
what do you think about uh houston
uh from what i saw they were playing
and from what i saw the game houston houston impressed me a lot
but my brother watched it on t v and said that warren moon was just having an off night
and if that was an off night i'd hate to see when he's on a good night
he's he definitely uh is one of the best i think
the their their backfield is really impressive
well they squeaked out a game on sunday
who who did they play
so that was
i i watched that game
and uh that was uh
well because i'm right here in dallas i i kind of pull for dallas
well also houston is uh in pittsburgh's division
well that's true
but i hate dallas
well i you know i i was never really a big dallas fan until we moved here
and they just kind of grew on me
and they they've actually started doing something
so i've actually pl- paid attention to them
well do you know anything about the expansion teams they're thinking about bringing in
um what cities are they looking at
uh right now i think this memphis they're they're trying to get the teams
and that's that's where i was when i saw uh
uh baltimore is trying to get a team
and there's some other city
but i'm not sure
you know i think you are right
because i know they've got a football team
but i think it might be them
and right now i think memphis and it's memphis and i think baltimore have a really good shot at it
because i know saint louis is much bigger than memphis
and when i went up there they were saying that memphis sold more tickets than saint louis did
it's like the liberty bowl or liberty stadium in memphis holds about sixty-two
i think that uh one uh advantage of having uh the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you don't uh convict someone who uh really shouldn't be convicted
um and i think that you know a unanimous verdict uh helps to ensure that
i guess maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who is very unreasonable in some way that uh you uh would have a problem uh you know that you wouldn't convict someone who maybe should be convicted
uh i have twice
uh what sorts of cases were they
they were just you know small time cases where uh trailers and banks were involved you know
so were they criminal or civil
they weren't they weren't any criminal
what uh what was the verdict
did the did the jury have trouble reaching a decision
uh the jury it was uh let me see i think it was ten to one on the jury because they only had to have eleven people so it was
and uh the one changed his vote at the end
so did it become
so it became unanimous you know after they turned it in and then he changed his mind after they turned it in but it then became unanimous
uh but since it was a civil case it really didn't matter right
what was what was the other case
the the other case was just traffic
oh didn't really even count
and you know it was seat belt law and it it didn't even hardly go through
i'm i'm a college student
so i haven't been you know a jury eligible age for very long um and uh i did get one summons actually at one point
but i declined it which i'm able to do because i'm a student because it was uh a very bad time
well you learn a lot going to the juries like that though
yeah i mean i i really i would like to uh to do at some point um
but i i haven't
uh one one thing that i i think is um you know maybe is a problem is uh i i think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now
but i wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesn't work as well
i wouldn't think that it does i mean from from my from what i experienced in them
it didn't you know it didn't turn out the way i planned it i mean the way that i would think that it would go
uh you thought it turned out pretty well
but it was you know it was
and it was it was just wasn't organized enough for me
and i just assumed that it would have been
oh so it was just kind of a zoo
and the jurors just sort of
um that's interesting
did it did it work out pretty well in the end
i mean did a couple of people sort of gradually sort of assume uh sort of a moderator role in the trial
they well they picked one person
and then he finally you know moderated everything and made it turn out the way it should have
so it work- it did end up working out pretty well
the one thing i sometimes wonder about um in civil cases is uh whether especially sort of in uh maybe like pro- product liability or medical malpractice where there's um sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes you know it's not just a matter of um of you know did this guy rip off this guy
and it's just a matter of interpreting a contract
it's sort of a matter of um you know sometimes getting into very technical issues
and i wonder if uh if there's really um if the system works adequately in in educating the jurors about uh whatever um you know issue is under discussion
i i don't think that they they they educate them enough to to really know what's going on
in in the case you were involved in you said it was just sort of a bank matter of some kind
the the bank was suing them for uh because they went to get the the trailer that which was uh seemingly their property
oh so the deal was that he had uh borrowed money from the bank to buy it
and he hadn't made the payments
so they came to get it
and then when they came to get it well it was on the landlord's property
and he wouldn't let them take it off
uh so they were suing to get it back
so and they are it was a double wide
so they'd already taken it apart
so they left it there and then when they came back to get it a couple of days later it had rained and got all in it
so they were suing him for the money
and you know there's no way they could because it it was the moving company
uh i get most of my news uh from newspapers really
i read the daily newspaper uh the houston chronicle
and sometimes i'll read like the uh wall street or the new york times
but sometimes i get a hold of copies of it
uh how about you
do you uh mostly get things from t v or
i actually get most of my news coverage off uh computer networks
however i do also watch television news uh usually in the morning once a day
and i read the front page of the wall street journal most every day
oh that's interesting
uh what uh what sort
uh well well dow jones for example have the cause the uh news wire
and it's picked up and actually available uh at my office
so it's no fee or subscription either to read at my leisure
and it's sort of by category
or is it something that is uh a little bit different from that
well uh it's similar to that
but it's dow jones
so that's that's interesting
i've had i had access in the past to uh
and i thought that was that was pretty a pretty good way to get news
uh i've never used the dow jones news wire
do you get any uh do you read any news magazines or anything like that for sort of like a broader like more long term analytical sort of approach
uh well actually not
uh i do uh follow uh uh uh
i don't know how to how to describe it
so i'll say a religious newspaper which which talks about issues that are relevant to me in a more broad sense
it's a weekly but uh but not uh not like business week or news week or one of those kinds of things
i'd like to say that however uh that i'm overwhelmingly disappointed with the media in general except for the raw news wires
in like in sort of like uh qual- uh quality or sort of an orientation in terms of like view point or the way the news is presented or whatever
i personally think uh
i i have a problem with their viewpoint
well you won't offend me
so go ahead and say
and i personally think that uh ther- that there's a strong bia- there's a strong bias in the media
uh after all who who writes
and they're that's a liberal uh a liberal field at least from academia
and uh the other thing that i always notice is that whenever they write about something that i'm an expert in i find their descriptions to be wrong and it
they they generally make mistake on anything technical at least
well even if it's not technical if it's uh some social thing or whatever it doesn't matter
if i am an expert in it they usually make mistakes which makes me believe think i'm not expert in it
do you by mistakes do you mean just like honest mistakes
or do you think they are deliberate sorts of things
uh i think both
uh by deliberate i uh i mean mistake mistakes of omission or uh
so uh uh to give you an example uh we will go out of the printing media
i know of cases where uh we have one television media where they will show
huh that's disturbing
which is which is rather disturbing
i mean he does that
uh i don't you know but i don't usually
and it was
and it was addictive
did you did you think that c n n well the gulf war coverage would be kind of uh an abnormality
uh you know whether you thought it was more of a biased or whatever
but i i guess you wouldn't
if you just watched it during the gulf war that probably wouldn't wouldn't tell you much
well during that small sample i would think that everyone was just about just about the same except the three networks radio television programming
so if at a particular time you wanted to get the latest and greatest news you could do that by uh turning on c n n
uh at the moment it's under chaos
i i don't really have a budget per se
i'm i uh it's called living within your means
uh but uh no
uh but i have uh i have a rough feel for how much money i can afford to spend each month
and then i don't
and then that then it goes through the moon
so uh what do yo-
we're trying we're trying to uh
but uh the other side of it is
so not much on that side of it
but we don't know how long it will be a dream
we we're kind of real we're real happy that we don't have any debt
but we're at the same time we're real scared about incurring it in this uh economy right now
so we're stepping real careful and trying to see what's the best way to save what the little bit that we do get you know on top of expenses every month
so what do you and your husband do
and uh it will be easier once we get overseas cause we have uh like uh uh support quota and it's cheaper to live overseas than it is to live here
and it doesn't get switched very easily once you come home
so we we go over seas for four years
and then we come back for a year
with with what church
uh we're with wycliff bible translators
yes i uh i know who they are
there there was uh you know there was a fairly large building that that was well that belongs to them
so uh are you uh are you uh active in translation
uh we will be
i was over over four years doing language surveying which is the first step
and uh came home and got married
and we will go ba- back as translators cause we want to raise a family
and it is easier to raise a family as translators
well i always wanted to do translation
but as long as i was single and foot loose so to speak it's easier
you know they really need surveyors cause you could you're free to travel anywhere
so uh what what uh what languages do you speak besides english of course
well i have a smattering of about ten different ones
i'm not bilingual in any of them because i kept switching from one area to the other you know
since i did you know complete a survey in one area i'd switch to the other
so i know the greetings in about ten
but in about uh about five i guess i can do better in it
and my french is pretty good
but it's uh french
so uh i'm terrified to speak in uh in france
because they're real snobby about their language
and french is street french
and i just picked it up off the street
and i knew what i was i knew what i was communicating
but i didn't know what i was saying
and he paled and said uh i'm not going to tell you what you said
but uh i didn't ask him either
so they hemorrhaged him to death without new infusions that will eventually die
and i it just amazes me that the french don't recognize that
uh some of my things
i i'd like to have a short work week you know
and and we need you know better health insurance and
if you don't want to you know uh talk about it now and then be bored when we get to it
so i just press one then
so so you think uh i think that a short work week is real nice
uh i have a thirty-seven hour work week
well well right now i i'm just a student
but i've work in the job force before and
it seems like saturday you get get off
but sunday you're getting ready for monday
and if we get have a if we could have a thirty-two hour work week with that happen is that for every four people we could give another job
and then that way everybody would have a three day holiday okay
and that way that more that would make a bigger market
we'd have uh more recreation
we'd have we'd have less crime
we'd have to we'd have to build less prisons you know less police force
although there may be more crime i mean if people have more leisure time
it it that's that's a possibility
one one of the problems they're facing now a lot of people now is that the health insurance is that the small business can't can't offer health insurance and it it's too costly
and what what is happening is that they're on a policy where they have x amount of users in it okay
so they get a specific rate
well what happens is that if people start becoming having chronic illness and and things like that
it's called a a group
well what will well what happens then is that
so they they have to cancel just like life insurance
so what they do is that that they cancel the insurance
and then all the people don't have any insurance coverage
but i'm i'm you know i'm i'm satisfied with my job
i'm i'm an engineering student
and i work for my instructor
and i'm i'm not a typical student
i'm i'm older
i'm i'm in my thirties okay
and so i have a lot of job experience
and my instructor thrives on that because he can just tell me what he wants
and he can give me access and tell me what to do and just turn me loose but in in the same token it's a very really enjoyable for me because i don't have to have you know nobody breathing down my back
and and one of the things that i i really hate about jobs i don't i don't like bosses that that you know want to
i i just really can't deal with that
what kind of what kind of jobs have you done
well well i do wo- uh research in computer science
and i've just been doing that for a few years now
so uh i my job has most of the benefits i want
uh what i really like is i like being
like they send me to conferences for instance but probably not as much as i'd like
but uh you know that's just nice being you know having a company being able to give you time to do that sort of thing and sort of
uh they also
a really important thing to me is when they uh they pay for continuing education
like i i get night courses that they they'll cover right now
and that's really good
you have what you might call knowledge power you know when when you work at a company whether you know it or not is that you're categorized
some people can be let go and replaced like uh say uh a typist uh somebody who does data entry or answers the telephone or receptionist
but if you're a person who that's doing computer type things and you have the you have the knowledge you know what the system you've revised and revamped the system well then you're you're vital to the company and you get more benefits
so that's where i i i'm like
and that's one of the things that i've found in any one one of these jobs and anything i've done is that to have knowledge
when you have the knowledge you're you're not going to uh you know be let go
so what i
well what were you saying
i i think we're started now
uh do you want to go ahead and start
uh well i haven't really been up to date on a lot of music
and i haven't really gone out
and bought any or listened to much on the on the radio except for classical
well you like classical music
uh i like classical music
uh i i like all kinds
i like i like different things about each one of them
well i like most of them except for country
oh you don't
i think i i might like dancing to it
but i don't like listening to it
the the kind of country i like is kind of the older country music
not the not the kind like kenny rodgers and stuff like that
that's uh that's a little bit to uh
wh- what's the old country music like
oh like like hank williams
even even hank williams junior is real good stuff
the kind that uh this stuff
i mean you d-
som- sometimes i do
i mean not all the time
well i guess i i like the blues a lot
and i guess you could say it's similar as far as the kind of ma- the way they do it
and i i i do too
me too too
and uh most rap i don't like
you're you're about like i am then
i i can't
and i can i can barely watch anymore because uh they have this heavy metal stuff on there
and and i can't even you know i can't like that
and and i liked uh aerosmith and led zepplin and uh you know and uh jeez who else is there van halen
now i like i like groups like that
but when you get uh
i i even like guns and roses some of their stuff
but uh some of these groups now like slaughter
oh i i really haven't listened to that
so so you went to school then in
i'm surprised you didn't go to to any pa- parties or anything where they were playing a lot of music or stuff
well uh i used to a long time ago
but since i've started back into school now i haven't really done that much
i've been pretty busy uh but uh
i you know i used to go out and dance a lot
but i don't do that anymore either
oh i see
i've just been real busy with with lots of other things
well how old are you
so you you were out of s- you went to school for awhile and quit then went back
i i went to school and got a degree
and then i worked for awhile
and then i just started i started back a year and a half ago
oh i'm uh twenty-eight
and uh i didn't really start getting into music until i went to college because uh my parents didn't really have music in the house
uh i see
so i'm always behind
i'm i'm not i'm never really up to date on all that stuff
but i know what i like when it's uh when i like a sound a certain kind of sound
my mother had a piano in the in the house
my father likes uh
he's from uh west virginia
so that's what he grew up listening to
and he's always liked it
and and you know he's probably about fifty-three years old now
so he grew up like in the late fifties
and you know when they had that the elvis presley music and stuff like that
so he likes that
and my mom always liked that kind of stuff
my mom likes like uh doris day you know
she always had those these old doris day records and stuff like that though
so you know i grew up listening to that stuff
but uh i could see why you went uh you know i could see why you were kind of sheltered
well i i do play the piano you know
but uh i i like the uh early seventies late sixties rock
do you like uh like v- van halen or anything like that
or how about brian adams
what kind of music is does what songs does he play
th- this love cuts like a knife
uh summer of sixty-nine
he's he's from canada
i'm not i'm not very good at remembering the uh titles
but i can
well do do you watch music television m t v at all or v h one
d- do do you get cable
that's that's you have to get cable to get those stations anyhow
but uh yeah
do you like uh like someone recent like enya
but she she's from ireland
and uh she's gotten some uh she's been on like the top ten i guess or whatever
she she did
so how serious is the
well needless to say here in washington d c
uh d c around here stands for drug capital or death capital
it's uh it's really bad here
uh for example
well luckily it hasn't gotten that bad here
uh san jose actually has a pretty good record in terms of being relatively low on violent crime
uh but it's on the uprise especially in a lot of the uh outlying agricultural towns
uh because you end up having a lot of gangs forming uh largely around the hispanic core
uh it seems to be that uh gang warfare follows very rapidly on the heels of
that's how they uh they bind themselves together in groups i guess
interestingly enough i don't think we have here a a lot of gangs but uh only a couple uh of not a whole large group of them but uh just a few most of them centered around uh drug territory
and uh nowadays the latest thing i've i've read about in the paper here that they're doing as far as uh crimes involving stealing cars is that instead of stealing uh cars like at night breaking into them or whatever they will pick out a car that they want and wait until you show up
and then as you get out of the car they just uh step up and uh take the keys off of you and drive the car away
well that's efficient
that's the uh latest thing
and they get in
uh i think they call it car jacking around here
we're from uh i'm from ohio
and my wife's from florida
so this is a whole new thing for
and it's uh really scary sometimes
and it's pretty bad when they're using metal detectors in school and uh of course the mayor uh of d c is having a real problem uh trying to
what do you do to to reduce crime in a in a major city like d c where it's a way of life for everybody
it's uh i would hate to have to wrestle with that problem
i don't know what what the solution is
uh there's no way they can stop the drugs
and that's what's causing all the killing
uh most of them are fairly uh radical in terms of what you'd have to do
uh course the
because i mean you know the parents aren't making a living at anything
and they see all their friends and neighbors uh
and they're accidental parents half the time anyway
and their friends are driving mercedes
and so it's actually
and uh i think uh to a large extent they don't understand the concept that what they're doing is actually illegal because this is the way they were raised
but it's not wrong because all their friends do it
so maybe it's the law that wrong in their eyes
and they they say well it's it's the law that's uh got to be changed instead of their way of life
so i don't know
well i think that the drug thing would actually be relatively easy to solve in terms of of an actual solution to the problem uh the the social the other social problems wouldn't wouldn't go away
i mean there's there's been a lot of uh
and i used to think that this whole argument was completely bogus
but then the more i thought about it the more sense it made is that uh alcohol is as bad a drug as anything else
uh and prohibition didn't stop it and didn't do anything really to slow
capital punishment uh
the problem i have with capital punishment is that uh uh it's supposed to be a deterrent to crime
but i don't think that it really actually does that
and they don't think that uh stop and think and say well maybe i shouldn't do this uh because uh i might get the gas chamber or something like that
and then they try and get out of it
well i think that in some cases it is warranted
and i don't
i mean i mean i'm thinking of an extreme case like a serial murderer or
so you're in you're in favor of capital punishment then
well for some things
needs to be punished or uh eliminated from society
and i don't think that that rehabilitation is effective
and i'm kind of i- in favor of capital punishment also
i just don't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because uh you still see them committing the same crimes
but i tend to agree with you that uh we should have it
i just i don't know that it's always effective
but i guess we uh we're kind of stuck with it
it's it's a difficult uh problem isn't it to determine how you're going to punish somebody for a particular crime
but then you know i think that that some murderers don't really warrant capital punishment
just like for example uh you know you hear about cases where women have killed their husbands who abused them and i don't think
huh do you think they should be punished at all or uh
because they're not really a danger to society
i know they put uh put them in jail sometimes i guess uh
just would depend upon the circumstances and and the extent of the abuse and and if another alternative was available
you know now i wonder what you think about this
and uh unfortunately we we don't get to do it
but uh it used to be a long time ago i guess in biblical times
so if somebody killed somebody in your family
and i know that uh if somebody had done something to my family i would feel that i had the right to to get revenge on them
well i think that would be kind of drastic punishment
but one thing i think that if there is a chance for rehabilitation then that chance sh- should be investigated
but like i said if if someone is is just pathologically going to murder people no matter what then i think they should be eliminated from society
huh that's interesting
i have to uh agree with that
there's a lot of folks probably that are in prison that uh that aren't really a danger to society huh
and a lot of people that
i don't i don't not sure
i i'm in washington d c or at least very close to it
i'm not sure what kind of uh capital punishment we have here
well i know in north carolina we do have capital punishment
and i'm in i'm from south carolina
well we in in in our family have been pretty remiss in trying to uh you know keep track of uh daily finances
uh the uh way back what twelve years ago or something when i got my first computer i did what everybody else does which is to put the whole family budget on the machine and put checks and you know checkbooks and all this kind of thing
and we kept that going for about a month
and it became so onerous that we gave up on it
you know so uh the only thing we're you know that we do now is uh i keep a a little spread sheet of uh what i call the net worth calculation which is just the the present value of various kinds of investments and so worth
uh and i only update that oh i don't know maybe once every quarter or so every three months just basically when the statements come in
you know just to see whether or not we're falling you know getting ahead falling behind or staying even or what
uh that's really about you know the extent of uh of the kind of uh financial score keeping that we're doing
well it's kind of difficult for me because right now uh like most teachers i'm laid off
so it's a lot it's very hard on a nonfixed income because i don't know how many days i'm going to be called in and whether i am or not to try to keep track of finances
and but i know how much i have to bring in a month
and that's about it
and then anything extra is you know more or less split up between all of us
oh i see
are you are you married
are you living with a bunch of with with people that you're sharing expenses
oh i see
so uh right now we're on we get f- you know aid from the state at this point because there's no other way to do it
and my ex-husband just sort of took off and doesn't pay child support
so right now i know what i'm getting from the state
and uh i have to balance more or less what i get from the state with my bills and uh you know try to work as many days as possible
but i still have to figure out
and it's like a juggling act every single month
like this week i've been just holding my breath and hoping they'll call me in
but they probably won't because next week the kids have school vacation
so you know the four days before they only have a four day week and they usually don't need subs because everybody's pretty good about coming in
a- oh i see
but we're shopping around as far as well i'm shopping around as far as trying to get uh that's why i'm doing this to get some extra money
and uh getting pledge sheets for the boy scouts
so trying to get pledge sheets for the boy scouts
because every penny i bring in is ten percent to me
but you know we do a lot of robbing peter to pay paul
i guess we're in the situation that a lot of am- middle-class americans are in
you're the first you know uh
oh my lord
in a you know one of these uh
his company went broke i mean went you know bankrupt
actually it was a subsidiary of a of an outfit called u s shoe or something
i- i- it was a computer subsidiary
but uh you know they just
they took the top management and gave them jobs with the with the corporate uh at the corporate front office
and everybody else was sent packing
i've got uh somebody was knocking on my door here
uh it sounds like in a certain sense at least at the present
i mean it sounds sounds terrible to say
but at the present stage you probably are even more in the market for a a budgetary thing than than most people probably ar- might be
in terms of keeping keeping score of input and output
do you have do you have a computer at home
and we try to
you know i keep track of every penny
and it's like okay what do we have left
what do we have to pay what have we paid this month what hasn't come in yet you know
have you do you use a standard uh a standard spread sheet
or i mean
well why don't you start cause it said i was suppose to ask you what do you
do you have any elderly relatives currently in an uh nursing home now
oh my gosh
and we decide not to put her in a nursing home
and then my sister takes care of her
she even though she is a hundred and two she still has all of her faculties
but with somebody that needs around the clock care
and i have seen them age twenty in the time and and with the expense and everything
i th- i still think it is worth it if you if you had a good nursing home
and they needed some quality care
and fortunately four of them live in the same home town
and she has alzheimer's
it was getting where she was getting th- dangerous i mean letting strangers in and things like this
but they were very fortunate
and she happens to room with one of the doctor's mother's
oh well that's good
and then she's got a lot of family there and that go and see her all of the time
but she really doesn't
but she has adjusted beautifully
oh that is great
but then i am also facing my father who is very sick
and my mother and father reside in colorado
and at that point because he requires round the clock
and it's really sad
and i have thought if something would happen to my mother for uh
so i would have to move him down here
you know where i can go see it
i i'd be very uncomfortable with him being in colorado
oh why yeah
and some of them are limited care too where people can do uh
like they have apartment styles
but basically people kind of have a small apartment
and doctor's are available if they need them
i i know a lady that lives in a place similar to that in austin
well the only problem with these are that they are very expensive
and the bad thing about it before you can get any kind of government help you just practically have well you have to be a pauper
it it takes every penny
they want you to spend every dime you have before the government will pay for your your care
and that's the sad part about it
and i think a lot of people who do it now
and my mother could make it on that
and then i would send it back to her
so that's what would happen
you just have to give it everything away
i i work at a brokerage firm
and i have seen so many people that just have to gift you know their belongings as much as they can each year in anticipation of having to move to a nursing home
and i guess uh i don't know how old you are
you know we're the generation moving into this
and i don't know how our kids are going to take care of us
and everybody in my family has always had
so my my mother and my father are in their late sixties
so i mean they're not
and he's still living at home
and i don't know how he is ever going to get on his own the way things are
oh i know
and so it's kind of
but it something will have to change as more and more of us get older
uh luckily if we could be like your grandmother i uh you know i would love to live to a hundred and two if i were okay
but you see these people in their seventies yeah
and that's the bad thing
uh the other day i attended a conference here at utah state university on recycling uh-huh
and uh i was kind of interested to hear cause they had some people from the e p a and lots of different places and uh
uh i didn't think that was a new revelation
well it's not too new
so what what is the e p a recommending now
actually they were the guy was pretty negative about the things that the government was doing even though he was from the e p a
but he had a lot of uh facts to to give and uh things like how many solid waste plants were being shut down
and and uh one of the most interesting things that he was talking
he was talking about uh the city of new york and how they went and collected all this news print
and now at this stage of the game where they have gotten into
that's a that's a common problem though
that it seems that has happened in dallas as well as new york
and i try to recycle all of the newspapers that come to my house
and after a while i just quit taking the newspaper because i couldn't recycle it anymore which isn't good for business on the other end either i suppose
we're doing some here in in cash valley the community here
there's uh we've actually got a kind of a nice set up
we've got a couple of plants here that actually take uh recycled paper and shred it and spray it with chemical treatment so that it's not a fire hazard and make it into insulation
and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them because they are actually buying it and shipping it in from outside
well that's good
so one of the real keys it sounds like to getting recycling for uh paper or something like that to go is to get some sort of business to actually want it once you have collected it
there has to be uh a reuse for it
i mean that's why they recycle
the one i think is the most interesting is with the recycled bottles and all that uh the industry seems to be doing with the recycled polymers uh everything from uh waste baskets to carpet to the no stick i mean the sticky slide rugs under the carpet and uh i think they are even putting it in the roadways these days
and they're making clothes now that are recycled
like the recycled plastic coke bottles and and milk cartons and things like that
and there was a paper presented at this conference from a guy from alabama
and he was kind of hired to do a study by two departments for the government
one was like environmental protection
and the other one was oh i can't remember what
but the basic idea it was presented to him was how can we maximize the amount of energy that we can get back from recycling and minimize the volume of stuff that we are putting into our landfill and uh the solution that he came up with for plastics and it was really quite amazing
he says well the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them
he came to the conclusion plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause it's it's low weight but it's high volume so it takes up a lot of space and there's almost no energy there's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling
but there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it produce electricity
so his solution was to burn plastic collect it and burn it
well it's carbon
so that makes sense
like a carbon fuel of some sort
and it's more than even paper or something like that
but what what about emissions
well that was
so it's not very practical
well it's interesting
i bet that was a good day at the yeah conference then
well real interesting
uh i got a bit
so uh you know my feeling is that uh it's really being used today
it it you know it it really isn't doing any real good purpose for anything because it's not cost effective because of the amount of time the people end up waiting on appeal
i think i've seen some statistics that say that uh it's more expensive to kill somebody than to keep them in prison for life
because y- you you've got all all the prison expenses plus all the legal expenses
uh and you know it certainly doesn't seem to be a deterrent uh for one thing because it's used so infrequently and for another thing because i honestly don't think the people that are committing the c- crimes that would be eligible you know really care
committing them mostly is you know either crimes of passion or at the moment
or they think they're not going to get caught
i mean it's kind of like the aids phenomenon you know
you know i i i'm never going to get caught
but you also have to think whether it's worthwhile on the individual basis for example someone like uh jeffrey dahlmer
one one way or another
but but the other side to that is if you put him in prison for life there's a chance that he might do things in prison or you know and somehow redeem himself
but in some cases yes
you know so that you know
the the question is you know the other qu- problem with capital punishment you run into is what are you going to do about people who are later
there are cases where you know twenty thirty years after the fact of getting evidence especially as new technology comes along that might prove their innocence then oops
you you can apologize nicely
but you know you know i think you know the the price you know
it i've heard quotes you know it's better that a thousand people go free than one person be unjustly imprisoned i think i- is really the the philosophy of the way our legal system works
the benefit of the doubt to the last iota is uh based on the uh person who is accused
and you know the i i think that you know
and the way it's being used now it's like you listen to bush is you know
well where are we going to impose d- you know
it's like for drug dealers is the new big thing like in
tsongas is also saying you know capital make it a capital crime to be a major drug dealer
and again i don't think these people care
and there there they seem that the profit marg- uh drug dealers the profit margin's so high that yeah the the risk is almost not there
and and you know uh especially now i live in in massachusetts you know
w- w- we're going to get capital punishment here probably after the second coming or something
so you know
but you look at our our crime rates and things like that and you compare them to to like texas or someplace that does you know it it it's impossible to make a case that it's it's affecting it in any way
i think it's mainly people like they get the vengeance of it
because you know
well it's also
and you know the the big thing down there was all right we have capital punishment
but if you look at who gets accused and who are the ones who actually get executed it's very racially related and ethnically related
oh yeah it's mainl- lot of blacks
you know a a a sixty-two year old guy is less likely to be put on death row from what i've seen
and you know i i think when you listen to like the uh the the victims' families and things they're always talking about you know uh feeling justified or feeling you know like they've gotten something out of it
i mean my thought has been once the guy has been imprisoned if he goes to jail forever or whatever if he gets killed it shouldn't make any difference to the uh the victim's family
the only thing that should really i mean
but you know th- you know what the important thing is that they be caught and not be a danger to society
and you know also by keeping them in prison you do have the possibility though we don't currently do this of making restitution
i mean the
you you will work your prison job
and any money you earn will go to the victim's family
and the the other thing is that you know i was reading through a book on uh geneo human geneo research and there more and more things like schizophrenia
and why does it just turn out to be genetic or biochemical in origin
so if someday we can go to jeff dahlmer and say well the problem is you you've got an endorphin imbalance
and you know if you take this regularly you'll be a sane and productive member of society you know
you really get back to the question of you know is someone responsible for their actions
well i i think on some of it you have to say someone's responsible for his actions
i never like the uh the defense well i never liked the uh insanity defense
uh i'm ann
oh you're ann
and that is uh and that is the exclusion of jurors because of or in spite of their race uh
well they they uh the the people that
the uh the jury that's trying uh the officers in that case
is is an all white panel
and there's been a lot made in the local papers of that
um it's in ventura
and there's there's still quite a bit of publicity obviously
and it's kind of it's kind of debatable whether you could get a fair trial almost anywhere because that uh that
well that videotape was just horrible
so you know
and i i think it would be very difficult to find someone uh find a panel that would be not have seen it and and known of what was going on
oh i agree with you
but i can't imagine that they would do an all white jury without having some sort of of discrimination or or you know uh appeal on not having a jury of his peers and all of that kind of stuff
you know um the
i i'm kind of torn on this issue
it's like they're saying well on the one hand they're not he's not getting a jury of his peers which is in some ways i think true
but on the other hand it's it's also saying that white jurors are not going to are not going to convict
uh you know they're not going to do their job which is
the whole the whole point of being on a jury is to convict or or or uh let go based on whether
so what's the prevailing thought within the community
i mean you know what the news media is going to make of it
but what about the community
i haven't talked to uh
but i i rather imagine there's there's some snickering about it and a lot of the usually fatalistic uh here we go again folks
oh my goodness
i you know
on on on one hand you know on the one hand you almost hope that they convict them because it's sm- they have that very strong piece of physical evidence
these people beating the heck out of this guy um
but that's that's interesting
be a go- a good adjudicator
i don't know you know
and and again there's something else tha- you know there was a
i don't know if it's it's got it's got as much notoriety
but it's rather almost as infamous here as it was as it was with uh the rodney king problem
um a girl walked into a korean owned store
and uh they she had a dispute black girl
she she had some kind of a dispute over some orange juice with the with the owner of the store
and and oh of course they
you know the criminal case went up
oh my goodness
i mean it was it was just
she gave her no time in jail you know all of these things
and then oh there's we have these we have people wondering around to- with petitions trying to get the judge
it would make it would make life easier
you would know the whole world would know what you were facing
and then it's a matter of of deciding
uh before a couple of years ago i had a a very narrow view of of nursing homes
and it was uh more like a funeral home
and uh then i had to do some volunteer work here in tyler texas
and i went to one
and it just had a very good activities director
and now i don't have such a bad view of nursing homes anymore
but i i certainly wouldn't want to send my parent unless it was an absolute last re- resort
uh i have a sister that is in nursing school
and she's real interested in geriatrics
well that sounds good
so uh she she's real interested in uh what ann richards has been doing
she's ann richards is really cracking down on uh the nursing homes
and i don't know you wouldn't know anything about a texas governor
and that's about all it goes
and she's really cracking down on restrictions and what goes on in nursing homes
and uh my sister's real interested in that and and getting into the to that side of nursing
that's one problem with the the nursing home environment
it the elderly even out of the nursing home are very open to abuse
uh you know they don't always have their full wits about them
and it can be pretty sad
i've got a had a grandmother who had a stroke
and she was in a nursing home for four or five years before she died
and you know it's the type of thing that she was living down in florida
my in- families was up in maryland and the other part of her family was up in uh new york state
and you know it was very difficult for either them or my grandfather to take care of her since she was uh you know could not do very much for herself after the stroke
and you know the nursing home was the you know best facility to put her in
you know besides moving her up which is not a practical solution since both my parents work
and both my uh aunts and uncle work
which means it's you know very difficult for some-
and you know there's also a lot of medical problems that can't always be completely handled in the home
which makes it you know
and some of the really nice ones that really take care of their people are so expensive because cause they can afford to hire the people that are really going to care for the older
and you know even there you have to watch out for you know
and you know the elderly sometimes have a lot of jewelry and other stuff that just very easily tends to disappear in the nursing homes
but uh he was in the nursing home the last several years of his life
and someone visited him every day
but uh if she couldn't someone visited him every day
and uh people didn't get paid much there at all
they would let a let a patient get a lot of bed sores
and uh the the people living in the nursing home would have all kinds of needs that wouldn't get met because they were just old people
and then the nurses and doctors really didn't put any for forth any loving care for them
either that or they're just so understaffed that they can't afford to put in the uh care that they need
cause it's you know
an elderly person can you know
you need to have twenty-four hour care uh answering all the needs cause they can't do much for themselves at certain points
and nurses get so worn down
and you know there's a lot of number of
the elderly are very you know complaining because they remember the way that things used to be
and remember being able to do things for themselves which you know they no longer can
and it very very hard
and they feel they feel pretty helpless
we just uh moved my grandfather into not a nursing home but you know a transitional type facility
is it uh like a retirement center
and they provide one meal a day
and you know the rest of the housekeeping and other meals a day are up to him
but they do have you know group activities going on
uh he'd much rather be living alone in his apartment down in florida
uh you know to move into that facility we moved him from florida up to maryland
and it's it's a bit of a shock to the system weather-wise if nothing else
well there was stuff like that in florida
uh so uh what are your benefits like at your job
and how do you feel about them
uh pretty good actually
and they have uh a pretty good uh benefits package
in fact they're they're kind of known uh for having good benefits
although i saw a survey recently
oh that's good
and i'm actually making just about as much as you know i'm m- making actually over average over the average for my career my experience and all that stuff which kind of surprised me
and i'm not like a hugely advanced degree or any of that stuff
uh anyway the our benefits are pretty good
that that's pretty generous although you have to hold the stock for two years before you get the company contribution which is kind of a a pain
and the best thing and a lot of the stuff the best thing is like four years or five years it's pretty soon you're completely vested in the retirement plan and everything
so uh it's not t-
but there's full uh th- there's several medical plans to choose from uh that cover pretty much everything
so i don't pay much of it
b- and i pay five dollars every time i visit the the hospital that you know for a checkup or whatever
uh they don't cover eyes though
and i i have contact lenses
so that's kind of a pain
but you know i i can live
but for all practical purpose you are almost a hundred percent covered
so that you've got small small things to gripe about
well that sounds like you must feel really good about it
and and the dental plan is fabulous
the dental plan i pay absolutely nothing because uh i i guess they would charge a little bit if there was some orthodontia or something for one of my dependents or something like that but that's not the case
well i uh work in washington at the naval research laboratory
and i get no benefits from them at to the part time work although they pay better per hour than my my sort of quote real job does
uh and benefits through the government are uh really
uh i before i i uh
and uh at that time i was in gravy city
uh the law firms
and uh benefits were just amazing and we had everything paid for
and uh anyway with the government it's not uh quite that nice a deal
uh but it's you know it's it's okay
what we have to do is we have to pay uh about twenty percent of our uh uh our costs
and it's deducted from our check each month and that sort of thing
and the plans that are available to us uh range from kind of mediocre to really sweet
uh but uh it could be better
it's really nice to be for me anyway to be able to work in uh a research atmosphere uh where i don't have to uh uh you know worry about uh academics or anything like that
one of the things with my company is that they've uh got a reputation for a lot of job security
and uh there's a lot of different things that they do lot of different divisions even this area in the san francisco bay area that they do
i myself have moved around quite a bit within the company and it's and i and i haven't had to move my residence to do that
you know i still live in san jose
you see now that's that's interesting
because i have a cousin whose husband works for hewlett packard up in the massachusetts area
he he lives in andover and uh the work that he
he's uh specifically an engineer and and does work with uh the hewlett packard machines that do uh
and it's amazing
it's it's all ecologically designed
and and uh he seems really really happy with the the set up
in fact i know a guy who works at andover who used to work who i used to work with out here and he moved his family back east a few years ago to to take that position
uh a- anyhow
steve uh with the election year and whatnot coming up do you think we ought to cut taxes raise them
or or or what do you think
i do know that uh politicians always talking out of both sides of their mouths
let's example uh
and at the same time the budget he sent to congress has tax and fee increases
so uh i know the politicians uh aren't aren't straightforward
now i- in terms of economics i'm not
it's hard hard to call
see i never thought really it's uh
i i always that the the real question was is are we getting a reasonable return on on investment
for instance like social security tax or soc- uh
i mean that's that's tax
and and supposedly this money is going into some kind of fund so that when it comes our turn to retire the money will be there for us
yeah you know
when i when i see that money taken out of my paycheck each each week i or each every other week i i really think that money's history
and you know so as far as return investment that's not that's nothing
and we're not even going to get the exact same number of dollars back
uh someone was telling me that there is a uh uh there's still an office in uh you know staffed with with people there and in d c that are researching to find a cure for polio which
but i believe that the cure for polio is already founded
but but supposedly once you have an office in d c or you know and and staff it with people it's really tough to close it down
and and they just haven't yet
i'm not exactly sure uh about polio in particular
well that might be the difference
uh the other thing that uh i remember seeing on t v lately is uh had to do with
it's it's it's funny because uh it was one of the things that bush is trying really hard to get ahold of is the line item veto where uh you know congress is able to attach all kinds of uh funny amendments for individual uh c- congressional districts to the to the main budget proposals
and the poor president has has to uh either accept or reject the whole thing
so it sounds like you uh you think that that we'd be able to save some money by uh passing the line item veto
i i think the line item veto is not not is not necessarily a bad thing assuming that the uh the the president uh uses it to get rid of uh this kind of waste
on the other hand uh it it assumes that you have lots of confidence in your president not to veto important things
and whenever there's that kind of subjective judgment there's always going to be a dispute as to uh where the exa- where the boundary between waste and and necessity is
so i'm not i'm not sure that that that will help solve our problems
but there definitely is is a problem with
uh i forgot
the- the- there has to be some way to do it
and uh i lived in massachusetts for a while
and uh when dukakis vetoed certain things there was a big uproar and wasn't necessarily so popular
but massachusetts wasn't when dukakis was there anyway wasn't in that great shape financially
i mean i don't know
i- i- they were very good at first
and uh that's part of the reason he became a nominee is because things went so well
and then of course the bottom fell out
i mean there's there's two ways you can kind of go to get out of tough financial situations
i guess you can like raise taxes and then create like job programs and whatnot
or you can hope that if people keep their money that they'll spend more and create jobs and and whatnot
it's really it's a hard balance it it definitely is
even not for government even just say for a small business
uh i know some
uh well i'm not sure how it is in georgia
but in in pittsburgh the r- the crime rate really is not very high at the moment
is that is that true for for atlanta
uh it's it's lower than it has been in the past
uh i guess nineteen ninety is when it start to drop off
and usually around the christmas season is usually when the crime rate is a little bit higher
uh what kind of crime problem do you usually run into
well uh the least what from what's on the news uh there are very few like actual robberies reported uh uh of of residences
what's more likely to occur is uh robbery of uh you know knocking over a a small store or a car theft you know it things of that nature
very few uh assaults
although on the college campuses uh there are uh cases of you know like people getting machine from a from an automated teller and you know somebody trying to to device a scam for for uh getting the money for them that actually preys mostly on foreigners
but mostly petty things and n- no nothing nothing really too big
well i guess here we run into that sometime
but i guess a lot of crimes are done with apartment type break ins that type not much home break ins
there are some but not not very high
uh as far as tellers and things like that it's not extremely high either
there were one case where uh this one guy uh was taking women from the teller and and you know making them give him money and stuff and then at the same time raping them all
so so that's kind of like a double assault there
uh a strange case that uh that happened oh it's about about a year ago was someone actually stole a complete automated teller machine
and they backed up into it with a truck and put it on the back and drove away with it
now there's a crime for you
but uh i guess most of the things that happen around here are are pretty uh innocuous
although uh from what i hear in the news
and and i i s- saw an episode of the t v show cops uh one time that was in pittsburgh
and uh it it it did surprise me because you know they were doing drug arrests and thing and things like that
but i i don't really think those things happen too often because like i said from what's reported in the news at least it's it's not all that common
like i say lot of lot of cases is usually just apartments and and break ins and things like that
and a lot of it is due to drugs
uh drug related you know in in most cases
it's not like uh it's someone do steal a a or television or v c r or something like that
it is for drugs you know because you really can't on the street make any money off of it per se you know
you going to get ten or fifteen bucks for it so you really not making a sizeable profit
so it's not really lucrative to take chances like that you know even though it it does exist
you know i just to diverge a little bit uh i live in an apartment
and uh the apartment like would be very easy for just about anyone to break in
but even so it i mean it's it's still difficult for me to convince my apartment mates to to like lock the doors when they go out
uh it would be so easy for someone who is motivated to do so to just you know sit out back take a look at when people are here and when they're not just come in you know
and they could uh they could get in pretty easy and and especially uh since there are bedrooms upstairs and people leave the door open you know while they're upstairs playing music
but you'd be surprised also how much people watch you that even not uh participating in any type crime
i was surprised uh
and they work at the same place i did
but i didn't know that they had been watching me
because i was getting ready to to go in my car one morning
and the first thing they said is uh you must don't have to be to work at eight you know
i uh get a lot of my news driving home from work listening to all things considered on national public radio
uh that is one of my big sources for current events information
uh i really like that coverage
my wife uh on the other hand is home most of the day
and she watches a lot of the cable news network
have you seen uh h- have you uh ever heard of all things considered
we don't have the uh national public radio in in my area
i can hear it at the uh uh oh the college town nearby when i'm in stillwater which is about an hour away
but the f m signal doesn't reach this far
uh i'll listen to shortwave quite a bit
it gives you a whole different perspective on the news uh when you hear it from say a european point of view or from the country of origin
uh i agree with you too on the uh
uh i'm not too satisfied with our local newspaper uh which is why i rely on shortwave and and then the cable cable c n n
i'm uh interested in the in the shortwave aspect of it
uh how do you find that the the coverage from other places in the world
how do you think that uh the viewpoints differ
i think a lot of it is just uh the fact that in the u s you're so far removed uh in a lot of cases from say conflicts
or or it's not happening in your backyard so it's it's more of a it's not as a personal uh the news isn't as personal in what we receive domestically than than what's on shortwave
it's b b c is uh oh i don't know the right word is is almost uh
and it just
do you think then that uh the american media is presenting an opinion along with their facts
uh very much so
and i i think a lot of it is uh especially t v news
they don't really have the time and a lot of them don't have the education and the background to uh oh to really decipher the news and to really explain it
i mean i you know i think it's important to interpret it
but a lot of times the person doesn't have the experience to to do the interpreting
which uh which approach do you find to be uh more useful the the interpretive approach or the straight reporting
oh i like the straight reporting
uh and then i i hope to be able to form my own opinion of it
it's it's nice to hear someone's interpretation of it uh i always think it's humorous when when the president gives the state of the union and uh for thirty minutes
and then for an hour and a half you hear different commentators explaining what you just heard
and a lot of time i don't hear exactly what they what they write into it
so i overall i think i would rather hear just straight reporting
one of the things that i found interesting last year during the uh the gulf conflict was a sentiment against uh peter arnett who had stayed in iraq and was presenting uh some of the things that were available
uh there was a there was uh a piece where he was showing a bombed out building where there was obviously a crudely uh uh hastily erected sign saying baby milk factory
and while he was being severely uh censored and could not make any judgment call on this it was fairly obvious that it was a piece of propaganda
but people were really down on him for reporting the fact that th- you know this isn't a baby milk factory
how could he say it was uh
i i think that that to me showed that the americans were really getting used to having the not just the facts but also the conclusions and opinions spoon fed to them
i i think people are people have that opinion
they they want to sit down in front of the tv and uh or at a read a magazine or u s a today and read in four paragraphs uh and and find out every-
so let's talk about the uh wonderful abuses in the state of pennsylvania of personal property taxes whereby you can purchase something mail order
and after the fact the state of pennsylvania can find out about it and send you a bill for the sales tax appropriate to that item that you purchased as well as interest and penalties
well actually i don't think they're out of line
de- devil's advocate possibly
and whe- whether or not you agree with that law i- you're still circumventing it
you are legal in in your circumvention of that law
what what if you're not doing it in order to circumvent the law though
i mean what if you don't even realize that you're subject to paying uh income tax on something that you purchase mail order
really i i i don't think that's a valid argument
um s- s- naturally some some things you just can't find in your local k-mart or or uh bryn mawr stereo dealer
uh but th- th- th- then why not pay pay the sales tax
why should an individual just because it's just because the state can't really find out about it be able to avoid paying sales tax
well i mean it seems to me that generally at least in my own experience when i purchase something mail order it's not to circumvent paying sales tax to the state of pennsylvania
it's because i'm sorry the commonwealth of pennsylvania
uh it's because i i can't find the item that i want at a competitive price anywhere in my local area
so i go outside the area for that
and i think that it's not my responsibility to police myself and pay pennsylvania what they believe they are owed even though you know the revenue stream went to another state
i don't i don't think that that's my responsibility as a as a conscientious consumer
but b- is it also legal
w- w- fr- from what i understand from v- v- various net readings i- i- it the federal government is going to try to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state tax schemes uh in into place in the next few years
it is it is a lost revenue stream right now
and states c- can use all the revenue they can get
with some with something like that d- do your arguments still apply
well i think that if if policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion then i don't argue with it
because it's not a burden on the consumer to remember that oh i bought this out of state
but the point is is that businesses do that
and i i i was actually talking about businesses purchasing something mail order and then having having to pay sales tax on it
that's my understanding of the way uh the way it works
usually the the person ordering doesn't pay
but the accounting department will uh suck up all the bills at the end of the month and realize how much they have to pay
and there r- there are s- some substantial nasty penalties um if you if businesses try to avoid that
uh do you mean businesses from the point of view as of of selling things to a consumer and then being responsible for the sales tax
businesses uh if purchasing things mail order
if if i'm a computer consulting firm and i see these this great deal on forty-six mother boards uh from from say utah
um i i might buy the mother boards from utah but then still have to pay pennsylvania sales tax
my a- accounting department will at the end of the month
i think that i- i- i think that's the way things work in pennsylvania
and i know they work that way in uh say here in d c
see i'm unfamiliar with that because i don't i never see that end of the business
so my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer
uh but if that's the case if the business is responsible for policing themselves then i think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that uh the opportunity f- to forget that you owe sales tax for something uh can be avoided
i- i- a r- a big hole does exist right now uh in that consumers can just say oh i i forgot that
there there is no well defined mechanism at all
and and that it is a
uh i mean i i don't know if i agree with that
but it but
so what is your uh family
and we have you know we have money that we take out each month that we uh you know for food and and for for gas and things like that
and then we put aside so much money each month for birthdays and for christmas and for uh other things
and we budget them into what we call our our needs and wants list
and so uh the things that like a vacation
we have a fund for the things we need and then a for the things that we want
and uh and we're continually putting into those you know each month how much we're going to need
and then we know the month that we're going to have enough to get that particular item
so we very rarely buy anything on credit
and uh we kind of have the same plan
uh we have one credit card
and every month we put uh you know the same amount in for retirement
uh and we budget we're our our new thing to our budget is we just had a baby
budgeting uh each month uh an allowance for his education starting now
so that's in our budget every month now
but we too do the same thing as far as uh
we take oh one big vacation a year and then maybe you know three small vacations
so we you know an
uh we have found that we spend less money if we pull out the money uh instead of just writing checks for things
and we actually pull out the money each month that we want to put in for birthdays that we want to put in for uh the vacation that we put in for christmas
like you have a separate account for that then
well a lot of that uh i don't know how safe it is
oh i see
and so it's actually pulled out
oh i see
so they each have their own account
does your husband deal in uh stocks and bonds and mutual funds and all that kind of stuff
th- does he invest in that and for long-term
uh we have an investment plan
but uh we have really found
and we are really saving a lot of money
because you're you've you've sat down with a piece of paper
so what goes into that that particular thing
christmas birthdays uh car maintenance dental medical
we have it you know
and when when we see something on sale uh instead of just looking in our checking account and saying well we've got enough and getting it and then when something comes up you know kind of scrimping to pay for a medical bill
and we're finding that we even have more money than we thought
well you know uh what do you do as far as
i i take it
do you uh run the family budget as far as uh groceries and that sort of thing
and how what's that
do you have a set amount that that you spend each month
or or how do you work that
and i usually have extra
and so then that can go uh you know either back into our checking account
or i can just carry it over
uh you know there are certain months of the year that you'll spend more on food than other months and certain times when that will be left over
but that's completely up to me how i do that
and then uh because i don't work i stay home
and so it's kind of my money
and i also get my own money to do what i want to go to lunches you know and do that kind of thing
we have a clothing uh envelope for each of the kids and for myself and my husband that we put how much we figure we need each month on clothing
as far as like big things like something comes up and you have to buy a t v or a big item like for the house
do you have like a household
like we're going to need to buy a bed for my daughter that's coming out of her crib this year
and also we need a new bed
and so we've got both of those budgeted
and we put a certain amount in each month
and we know which month we'll enough saved to go buy those
and if we find one on sale before then then we can just take that and put it towards
and it's like crystal clear all the time except for during the winter
and then we get a little bit of pollution in the valley
we're uh we're in kind of a basin
and uh there's been a lot a lot of growth population growth around here
here in utah up along the wasatch along the western side of the of these rocky mountains here where a lot of the big cities are salt lake and ogden and provo
and logan's up in the valley a little bit further north
and it's like seventy percent of it is from cars
and uh it always really hits hard during the winter when we get the inversion
and when we get get cold air down in the valleys and warm air up above
and it just sits and sits and sits
and we're starting to hit pollution levels now on the wasatch front which match that of l a a few years ago
it's not it's almost sad
because when i grew up here it was just always the crisp air up in the mountain valleys
and now it's not in the mountain valleys
and uh uh it's supposed to have about the worst air pollution
i think probably due to uh a lot of students going back and forth to school
and then we're right next to interstate five also
they're getting serious about things like uh mandatory
well they've already passed laws where you have to get your cars checked for pollution if you're in certain counties
we have a lot population is a lot lighter up here
and uh they're they're expanding it to uh more counties here uh as the population spreads out
and i think they're also going to be making it uh
th- th- there was uh something in the law about if you're car was over a certain age like over twenty years old you didn't have to get it done anymore
they're ge- eliminating that out here
and i think they're eliminating that uh that loophole
they're also talking very seriously about the thing called a dirt gun where they're uh looking at the emissions from the car using basically a spectrometer and looking at the basically how much of what is coming out of the exhaust
do it remotely just looking at the what they do
and they look at the source light
and then as the car goes by you can see the exhaust pipe and the source light behind it
and you can look at the emissions actually
now where does the source light go
like across the street
oh i see
they'll set up like a trap or something like that in some sense
and they're also looking at uh other you know ways of monitoring this and cause they've found out something basically that uh
and a poorly tuned car can emit something
it was like four hundred times as much uh of certain pollutants and it was like unburned hydrocarbons then a properly tuned car
and and the idea being that if you just tuned up all the cars well if you tuned up this ten percent of the cars that were producing like fifty percent of the the pollution then you know you it'd be one way to cut the pollution in half
but it's also been uh oh you know
but it uh it's tough you know
like i've i've looked into riding the bus to work
and i can drive to work in uh and get there in twenty to twenty-five minutes over a very congested corridor which goes over lake washington on one of the floating bridges
but if i uh
and it takes over an hour
and you know i feel guilty cause i'm driving a
that i'm the uh least informed
but it's i'm the least informed person in the whole united states
but i i i've never read a newspaper in my entire life
and i've i i never watch t v news nor listen to the news on the radio unless i'm just happening to be listening to music and they slip it on in the car radio before i can turn it off
i i've i've explored that with lots of people
uh they've tried to lock me up and uh things like that
but uh uh i'm basically not interested
and i also find the uh everything is so slick and superficial and misguided and mis- and off the uh uh
what am i trying to say uh
and i occasionally will read something like the new york review of books
you know someone will write a book about something
and then i'll learn all about this thing that was in the news two years earlier
and anything i participated in or know about when i read about it in the paper is always so uh covered from such a funny and superficial perspective that i don't have much confidence in it
but i mean i don't think it's just that i'm lazy
i i i like to refer to this as sort of consumer report phenomenon
but assume that they do a reasonable job in other areas
uh without thinking that there were people in who think each other areas area of of specialty
and uh i guess you could explain it two ways
and and the cynical view is
and the view that i would rather take
and i think the same thing is true with news
if you want to just have an idea as to what's going on most papers a- and especially the better papers the the times the wall street journal the washington post give you a reasonable idea
i i'm i totally concede that intelligent people read these things and intelligent people write them
so i mean i'm not being elitist in that sense i hope uh
well i mean there's there's a reasonable question as to whether it's worth the amount of time it takes
and most people think it is
and i can i can you know accept that some people think it's not and can find better ways to use it
oh you don't
and i think they're saying well if something's really important i'll at least find out that it happened
and and that's a that's is a reasonable start
and for awhile i didn't read a newspaper when i came out here because i didn't find one that i liked
uh and if something important happened it was covered on t v
and i could then go and and pick up newspapers if if it were important enough to read about
and i imagine you get the same level of something that you cared about happened you'd find out from friends or other channels
uh i did on the uh
see i actually have a a
i i mean that's that's the closest thing
uh and i sort of had planned to have dinner with a friend of mine
and when i arrived at her house she was engrossed in that
we ended up watching it for a couple of hours zooming out and grabbing something to eat and then zooming back and ea- watching it some more
and i thought that was terrific because she actually helped me understand what was going on
but even then i didn't end up doing it on my own uh uh
uh i work for georgia tech
but it it does have about uh i guess two thousand civil employees
and on a a scale i guess it's still considered small
the area i work in it it primarily have maybe a hundred people or so
so that's make up most of the laboratory
so from from that standpoint it's pretty small it's pretty small
well i i work for uh actually probably similar kind of place
i work for uh lincoln laboratory
so we're we're part we're actually part of m i t
so it's very much the same kind of place and uh the technical institution
uh while i was sitting here waiting while they tried to find somebody for me to talk to trying to think of what uh uh what things were important uh besides salary and a and a job i guess uh list i had scribbled down was the people you worked with and maybe the uh the challenge of the work and uh the working conditions things like that
what are your uh what sorts of things would you consider important
because a lot of time nowadays even though you're working uh you're treated
and it may not be true in every place
in a lot of cases i think you're treated more like a number instead of a a person
because when it come down to layoff they don't really consider people and and you know their well being as far as you know how they going their next dollar going to come in
and i was reading this book one time about this guy that had uh
that way that you know one person wouldn't get one big blunt blow at one time
and uh you know i think if they had programs that set up to subsidize people that do get laid off a little bit better you know other than s- you know something like
but i mean the company as a whole
because you as an employee even the company is making money
but you are responsible for that company growth
you're responsible also for helping that company get to the par- point that it's at at making profits
so there should be something in there or some kind of clause that will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than you know uh neglect or something like that
you know because it's not a person's fault that you know people not buying or businesses are are not on the up and up all the time you know
i don't see how one or two people maybe more one or two but you know a number of people can can be the downfall of com- a company situation
now how do you mean that
well in a sense that say how do you make a a conclusion that you're going to lay off these ten people
uh for the bad times of the company
what about the the work effort those ten people did when the company was doing well
you know in that standpoint
well you you think it's better than to to try to spread the the effort equally among all the employees of the company
and even at that it would at least give the person time to look for another job because they know that that there are problems
and you know there are reason to look for another job instead of just dumping it on them all at one time
you know that's just that's my views you know
i think uh back about a few years ago when things were tough hewlett-packard did that for awhile
they went to a uh a a four and a half day work week rather than cut yeah just cut everybody back ten percent
and uh have to give everybody a half day a week off
and i think you can do that for a little while
well at least that would give a person a chance to look you know because the way it is a person really don't have a chance
uh but uh i've i've noticed that uh this year it seems to have been a lot warmer than it has in the past
it it it's it's a lot warmer a lot drier too because usually about this time of year this you know you see a little bit more rain
i mean by by mid february i mean we start getting a lot of rain
well i remember last year or the year before
uh we had ice and snow uh uh
terrible ice storm uh around this time of the year
and uh this year it's been so hot and uh sunny
it it's really quite uh quite amazing
i used to my wife and i we used to live in san antonio couple years ago
and it was it was i remember the first day of spring
it was so much ice that came down later on that afte- that afternoon and evening
it was just it was horrible
and it was twenty-nine there
and it was you know in the seventies out here
it was really uh
well um i don't know
i i guess i'm just sort of acclimated to colder weather
um i i like it warmer
i mean i like it you know i like it warm
but it doesn't really matter
i mean i'd i would much rather see it cool at this time of year anyway because it would mean a little bit more rain possibly
i have you know
i i don-
i come uh i've spent most of my time in in warm weather areas
and uh uh the ice and snow just doesn't uh hold any allure for me at all
well i spent three years in germany
so i'm not too thrilled with the whole thing anyway
but i got used to it
i mean when i when when when we came to san antonio it was just like uh you know it just just swelter
and then we got used to it
and then we went up to dallas
and it was just
it's it's not not that it's just hot or dry
do you you think san antonio is more comfortable than dallas
you must well uh
we were we were down there
and the last day right before we left we had to i had to ride with my sister
and the air conditioning went out on the car
and we you you just get used to air conditioning all the time
the humidity was like eighty plus eighty percent plus
and it was just killing us
i mean that's really bad
just you know so mild
and then you've been to such extremes like san angelo texas where you just where you walk outside and you sweat
you know you're sweating
but you see the water leaving your arm
oh wow uh
i know i i tend to i tend to be able to get along with monotony in the weather when it's very temperate
uh it doesn't
some people say uh they they like to watch the changing of the seasons
but uh i'd rather you know like southern california you know have it kind of sunny and temperate all the time
so it's kind of a luxury
but i don't know
i i think in in some in some respects it probably more tolerable
well i guess this the weather isn't as lively a topic as uh as some of the others we might have gotten
so it's just like well that was my fault
but then the weather's like
man i mean it gets pretty mundane
i mean you can only talk about about the situation just so long
well it's nice talking to you
so we're talking about drug testing in the work place huh
um i've been tested a few times just before pre- drug employment
but that's about it
we have random drug testing at in my business
but i've never been uh never had to do it
and i think it's mostly for the the field people that you know drive trucks and heavy machinery that kind of stuff
but uh they they have done some testing around our office mostly after lunch looking for people drinking uh drinking beer and stuff at lunch time
oh they do with alcohol
they they they'll check for alcohol
oh i thought it was just like marijuana or cocaine
once once you start doing that stuff you sort of you're sort of stuck into uh checking for the whole the whole thing
huh that's interesting
oh in the oil business
and you work in the office around
so uh it's pretty pretty safe environment
see i work in the automotive air bag industry where we make the safety bags for the cars
and we work around a lot of explosives
so that's you know
i'm all for it because the well the type of environment i work in you know they're working with explosives
and so they could blow up the whole
well they have safety features with each of the explosives they use
but still it can be dangerous
well i i i agree
i think that uh you know under certain circumstances especially when you're working in in high risk uh uh industries where you can really hurt other people that that you need to have that kind of stuff
as long as it's not abused uh you know random you know
as long as it's random and and the individual's rights are uh are protected i don't have that big a problem with it
now do they fire them or do they
well see this is it
and and the policy is something like see if i can re- state this correctly now if you turn yourself in as having a drug related problem then you're eligible for company counseling
but if they catch you if you test positive for a a controlled substance then you get fired
so it you know it's sort of one of these little catch twenty-twos
and then if you if you're not worried about it you just forget about it
but i know they do have counseling and that they do give you a second chance
but i'm not sure if if it's if you get caught or if you turn yourself in
i mean if if they're going to give you the opportunity to turn yourself in then they ought to you know go out of the way i think a little bit more to uh to help you get help get you rehabilitated to you know to get get back at your job
but uh when you're not when you're a private company the rules don't always apply
uh do you think it works very good with that random do you think it limits
well it's it's hard for me to to evaluate it because everybody i work around is in an office environment
and you know it's not
i guess i ha- haven't run into anybody that's that's had a problem that's that's been a problem
uh so i gue- you know i guess it works uh much like uh well shoot like any lottery
i mean everybody's got an equal chance to get picked
so uh i'd rather have that than you know say well this week the a and b are going to be in
and next week
and i'm not sure if our policy covers that or not
well especially around uh you know equipment machinery and stuff
huh that's true
you know i've i've gone out and had a had a beer at lunch time but not to excess in any case
or is it
uh i don't remember to tell you the truth
um well they must
i mean gee whiz
because i i really don't know
well you know you can take some of that that testing a little bit too far
uh there was a company in houston that
they did uh an unannounced drug sweep of the of their company oh it was it was it was an unannounced sweep of of
you- you're first
i was just going to say i think one of the biggest thing for me is room for advancement you know not to get in like in a dead end job
and plus for me it's uh i mean like medical and you know uh benefits and dental
i guess one of the differences i see is uh working for a university uh there is room for advancement but not so much so our in uh quite a highly unionized environment and then also in the administrative association
so there is a progressive path
are they like pretty much train for a specific job
and that what i hired for and then i just very little variation from that
but then also there just isn't the ability to in one sense have uh a broader scope for rewarding people for their performances
uh so that's in our situation where we are dealing with an institution
uh it's a little more difficult to recognize an individual's performance and i suppose that's maybe a disadvantage of being in a larger institution
but i agree you know the uh medical benefits and those kinds of things are one of the big pluses of working for a large organization and also the uh security aspect for long term employment uh
well you know that's interesting though
because i don't know if that's necessarily the case anymore
i use to think that you know after you work
you mean security job security
uh that use to be i think a couple of years ago
but i don't know if it is so much anymore
in fact they we just had a lay off in what november i guess
but uh it wasn't necessarily
i mean you know some people had been there a long time
like in some of the large oil companies there has been massive lay offs
uh so i i think there it's probably a major distinction between institutions and the corporate world in uh institutions are slower to react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where the businesses we need to cut back that's what we do
and institutionally like here at the university oh if there is a cut back well gee it's not where it necessarily where it's needed
where the most dollar where where you know it cuts back the most
well in one sense for us it's where it makes the least noise which means it's often the lowest support type roles
you get too many management people you know
and it's very easy for them to say oh this is the best way when they really aren't aware of what all it took to get the work done you know
and then they wonder why it doesn't get done in the same amount of time
well those people aren't there anymore
because it's support people that are providing the speed for it
so what else do you think is important
well the uh
because my perspective is from an institution
uh the there is not much incentive for innovativeness because the limitation for reward is very severe but if you're in the corporate world i think there is considerable motivation for
although he you know the more complex your structure the uh less difficult it is to kind of carry some things through but uh i think there is uh
and so you can see the reward of the efforts
i was going to say more it's more personal for one thing
you probably have a better team uh cooperation or team playing atmosphere
probably where as in a bigger corporation i think you're just a number you know
you end up being your own person and uh if you do your job fine and if somebody else is messing it up well then that's their problem
and you know you really
whereas yeah in a smaller
i think you would be more willing to either help that person or help it get accomplished you know
it becomes the organization instead of person being you know a part of the individual themselves
so uh with the issue of trial by jury uh i actually found the whole question about whether you need a a unan- a unanimous verdict in a criminal case to be somewhat interesting
actually i i agree that
i i believe that's a for for civil suits it's not unanimous right
but for for criminal suits it's unanimous by federal law
i don't know if it's even true that it's always unanimous because i thought there were cases where uh i don't know if it's the difference between felonies and misdemeanors but where it was okay for a state to have it like eleven out of twelve
and that's why i phrased it that way
the difference yeah the difference could be that for uh state if there is such a thing state felonies versus federal felonies that federal things that are under federal jurisdiction require the unanimous
and things that are under state jurisdiction even criminal don't require
but i don't know what the
do you think that that's an unreasonable uh requirement that they be unanimous
well i'd be curious as to what the uh requirement for a an acquittal is
and i i don't think it would be wrong to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if you know six or seven voted not guilty then instead of it being a hung jury that was an acquittal
but i don't know whether you need an a unanimous uh vote of not guilty to acquit
that that would be an interesting change
it was also allow the uh idea that if you had one person who was uh very disagreeable that i mean it it fundamentally changes the way the processing occurs because uh
so i i think if anything it would have to be a very close to unanimous decision
but i've never had the the opportunity to serve on a jury although i've been out here and registered for i guess about five years
actually i i thought that that would be very interesting thing to do
and i've been called uh three different times
but i've never actually even made it into the the jury box
and because there have always been a number of people
and and i've never gotten up there to answer any of the questions
well the people i know who have served have said that usually what ends up happening is that you know after initially finding out where people stand that the whole deliberation usually results if there is a you know something like a nine three or or more severe and and the people in the majority trying to convince the minority that they're right and in fact i'm not sure that that's any more uh liable to get rid of the reasonable doubt than than anything else
and that that uh peer pressure
and in some cases if it's a long trial the desire of people to get out of there and not be stuck in there for a very long time that people are changing their minds for the wrong reasons
i'd read one book i think it was calls trial by jury
some of them did say that you know when they were the only one left opposing the verdict uh you know everyone was getting on them so so heavily that eventually they just gave in knowing that nothing they could do could stop it from either being the verdict everyone else was trying for or a hung jury because the one vote doesn't mean anything except the ability to not have a verdict
i i understand
you you would hope that if you were in that situation that you'd have the moral fortitude uh to hold out if you believed that that was really the proper response
i think of the movie uh twelve angry men
it's it's it's exactly that situation where uh
and it's eleven to one
and he's the one
i i believe he was opposed to the conviction
and uh and he held on
so do you think you get good coverage from the sources that you have
uh actually no
because because i'm in school
i i kind of miss out on most of the current events
uh i don't watch a lot of it
but that's the on-
what about what about you
well i read uh
and i try to at at least have a few minutes to look through that
and i look through uh
i get a newsweek every week which i i pretty much read that cover to cover
and i as far as you know
uh don't watch much t v
and uh don't listen to the radio too much especially the news channels or anything like that you know
and that's about all i ever hear of it
uh but most of my news probably comes from newsweek
and for the longer term i i read uh like scientific american and and uh readers' digest and some of those other types of magazines that come out which they
the news isn't like immediate what you'd generally think of as news
but it's recent material
and it's more in depth
it is it is more in depth less broad
well actually it's probably isn't less broad
but it's just more in depth
and uh it is it is more sig- it is more just significant information you know
not the fact that there was a big auto accident down on the corner of broad and main you know
or they're making making time because they to fill in an hour's worth of news
i do i do too
uh i get kind of bored watching t v actually when i watch the news on t v because it goes so slow
and then there's nothing that you know really is like oh so exciting
you may find one little uh news item interesting
so you have to wait twenty minutes to to hear about it
that that's about what it ends up being
actually y- you mention newsweek
i i i do like uh u s news and world report
but that's i think that's a good magazine
i you know they they certainly have a very similar uh charter at least in my mind
and uh uh what what kind of uh what kind of news normally interests you
i mean what do you what what do you find interesting versus what do you find boring
well right now trying to keep abreast of uh what's going on in europe you know with all the u s s r's satellites breaking off trying to become independent and you know european community coming together
that's going to affect our uh economy quite a bit
uh they they keep claiming it's going to have a big influence
but we've yet to see it
i mean it's only been three months or something like that since that happened
but they like to tell us that it's going to be important
i'm i'm pretty sure it is because uh once once europe becomes unified and uh their economy becomes one big economy we're going to be uh kind of hurting
i i think that's a possibility
uh it we might also be helped though because it it will be easier to do business over there too
and uh i know of at least one company that specifically went over there and established a presence before nineteen ninety-two so that they would have it when it came time
oh yeah so they have a toe hold
because once you're in there then you can easily expand
but getting in after nineteen ninety-two is more difficult
because when they first start off they're going to be highly protectionist
and there's already a lot of evidence that they are being very protectionist
even amongst themselves they're being somewhat protectionist you know
like england doesn't want to do one thing
and and sweden doesn't want to do other thing
and they're they've all got their own reasons which have to be resolved yet
and some of it i mean is
i i can understand their viewpoint
they're just they're starting off
so you want to get established before they com-
uh what is the uh
do you watch anything like with sports or anything like that
actually i'm not really into sports
so unfortunately i forced to watch quite a bit of sports
course you can always mislocate it or misplace it i mean not mislocate it but misplace it
so what kind of music you into
well i have a uh pretty wide taste uh in music ranging from progressive rock to jazz to uh lot of different forms of uh music
in fact it's easier for me to say uh the types of music that i don't like are opera and uh screaming heavy metal
but i can't deal with opera at all
and heavy metal uh it's noisy
i'm into uh some industrial music that's a a bit even harder than that
but it's it's got to have a point to it
oh i don't mind music that's
but uh the the uh basic point of heavy metal w- which seems to be music to annoy you
is uh gets a little annoying
uh lot of stuff that actually has uh ended up becoming popular like uh nirvana and uh oh you know
so lot of the stuff i was listening to in my teens like the clash and and the sex pistols and r e m that sort of stuff
uh r e m makes me laugh because they've gone from a college radio progressive group to being uh you know ultra mainstream at this point
and it's not really that they've changed their musical style so much as the stream changed
it's a lot of people l- like saying that you know bands in that position you know sold out
i think that's pretty much you know bull
because r e m really hasn't changed
if it's it's interesting
they're producing uh similar music
and it's good music but you know people have picked up on it
uh for a while there music seemed to really ha- popular music seemed to have uh not a lot of point to it
i was really tired of uh the michael bolton
mi- michael bolton really got on my nerves because he he was making all this money doing mediocre cover tunes
and i could uh go down to a bar that's about three minutes from my house and hear people doing covers better than him
and and that
i'm sure that that so- that sold a lot for him
that's all you really need for a lot of lot of pop
i'm ki- i've kind of like developed a a short hatred for for pop
it just seems like there's no no real point
you hear the same same tune over and over again in a thousand guises
well i- it's interesting because you were you were saying that you liked classical music and i like a lot of classical music
but i also dislike uh some classical music
and what gets me even more is the attitude of people who are really into classical music
and feel that if if it's not seventy five years old it hasn't stood the test of time
i can i can believe that
what kind of things are you do you like in classical
uh i like bach
stand uh uh debussy or debussy
uh uh i like tchaikovsky
he can make a lot of noise when he's uh so inclined
uh and some of some stuff that i like uh
for instance frank zappa has done a fair amount of orchestral composition and that's interesting music
but it would not get performed by any uh municipally funded uh philharmonic
uh just because number one it's frank zappa and he's weird number two isn't he still alive
you know we're we're
much better off playing uh beethoven's ninth
that's right you know
w- we'll do we'll do the ninth
and everyone will know it and and hum it
and i- it it just isn't chance taking enough for me
uh i feel that uh that that music should take chances in one way or another and that uh you know if you've heard a piece oh a hundred a hundred times
do you think that there's any way that uh
or do you think there's too much crime now
i mean i guess
uh well uh out of control i don't know
uh i live in the university district in seattle near the university of washington
uh there's uh there's a lot of problems
i mean there's like a big rise in homelessness and more street people
and uh you know we get c- cars on our block uh regularly uh uh g- uh gone through rifled through and stuff
i would not of okay i would not have guessed that in seattle
you figured it was like omaha right
it's uh it's not newark
but uh yeah
i wonder i mean i wonder what what really is the answer
i mean it seems like our our the prison systems we can't seem to decide whether or not it's a reform system or penal system
where you put away the people that are so bad that uh you don't want them out in circulation
but but the problem is is that we we only have but so much room
and we we try to put aside in the warehouse
and all we do is just displace other people which come back into society and commit crimes
so it's uh
i i think you know
uh see i mean my mom taught english as a second language
and and she was dealing mostly with people that were were in on drug crimes
oh you mean she taught in a prison
in a in a maximum security prison down in central virginia
and the problem she had was not with the inmates at all
the the people that she had the most problems with were the people that ran the prison
the b- the bureaucracy
it was it was i mean
they they put her i mean
i didn't obviously i didn't see the classroom uh and
but uh they they put her at the end of a hallway
and they refused to let her wear a body al- a body alarm
but i just assume it was something that she could hit immediately and and really annoy a lot of people
but uh you know
so she didn't feel safe
she she felt fine for the first year when she had her first set of inmates
and then later on the uh the administration kept getting worse
and uh she got a couple of inmates that she wasn't she didn't feel quite as comfortable around
but well she had decided that it was when we came back to the states she decided that it was too
she didn't feel that public schools were s- were safe
so next thing you know she's teaching in a maximum security prison
well at least it's maximum security right
but but the point that was that it you know
you said that perhaps uh people have given up the thought that rehabilitation's possible
and and i'm i'm thinking that it's even to the point that the people in that run the system have given up on it
uh well i i think the people that run yeah that run the system are the most hardened and probably the most cynical you know
i mean i uh you know i i talked to a few people who worked in prisons and stuff
and it's uh
but getting i mean well see
i always have problems because because i can never decide whether or not i'm i'm supposed to be a conservative or or a liberal
those are funny labels see
but i keep i keep thinking that there's got to be some way that that a lot of this is circumstances
i mean i can't help but wonder if if i grew up without a father on the streets and with like little or no money wouldn't wouldn't i be in prison at this point
i think uh yeah i think you can blame it on social problems
i mean i don't know
i mean as as you know as poverty has gotten worse as you know education has gotten worse as there's been more single parent families as there's been more homelessness there's m- been more crime
i don't i don't remember the the gentleman's name
but the the uh the mayor of baltimore is a is a rhodes scholar
and what he
is he the guy wants to like deregulate heroin or something
well what he wants to do is take all the money that uh he gets for drug enforcement and use it for uh drug education
and basically just just attack the problem at the demand side
stop trying to attack supply because which which to some extent makes sense and to some extent doesn't
i mean switzerland tried the the grand experiment
and you know they had this park where they were letting anybody use drugs as long as they stayed in the park
jonathan uh you s- you say it's near and dear to your heart
buying a car is uh something you're contemplating i take it
uh fantasizing about
our situation is that we're a two car family and i have a mini van we bought a few years ago
it's got a uh five year loan
so that's still got a couple years to run and the car i get to drive is a uh nissan sentra that's going to be ten years old next month
i think about uh sprucing that up in a couple years if i can
what do you think you'll uh what kind of a car do you think you'll buy next
well i think the next car we get will probably be a
i i like buicks
it's a nineteen eighty-seven and uh whatever i get i want to have uh air bags uh both driver's and passenger side and four door because it's much more convenient if you're carrying anybody to you know rather than have them stoop down to get over
so i think the four door is probably a major requirement
and other than that uh you know reasonable cost and safety and uh as much economy as you can get out of a car
uh you know i'm not looking for one with a great big engine uh something that will carry it around careful i guess is best best way to describe it
and it that seems to be just fine
i know they s- they're coming out with some v eight now
and i think that's probably a little over kill for this day and age
so they've got some pretty powerful sixes
and uh you know v eights seem to be a return to the days of you know ten or twelve miles a gallon
i uh i drive a a truck a ford truck
i i like trucks because they're spacious
and it's handy to haul things
uh it's not related to my business
but there's so many occasions when i've had to move some members of the family or do this or that
and it's it's handy to have a truck and not have to borrow one
is uh traction much of an issue for you up there
uh not really uh you know
and i figure if it's so bad that i need a four wheel drive i probably ought to be home anyway
actually uh pretty good way of looking at it
we uh we had a small accident with our mini van a few years ago
and we weren't aware of it and just slipped on some black ice and went into another car
and this is a rear wheel drive model
so we got some monster studded snow tires after that
what kind of what make is the mini van
and uh we're pleased with it in terms of comfort and uh driveability
but uh it's real nice for carrying around our kids and others
and it's uh got some nice features in terms of being able to remove seats and flip them around
so we've been able to do some real creative uh load hauling when called upon
one of my sons has a a plymouth uh van or you know uh uh that same type of thing the voyager i guess and uh they have a a child that's five years old
and it's really handy for hauling him around and and their stuff
and of course as he gets friends i'm sure that will be even handier
so i know if we were if we had kids still at home we're in our fifties now but if we had kids still at home we'd certainly have to seriously consider a van just for their functional value
i think that we're going to be uh owning a mini van for some years to come
probably till the kids are out of uh high school anyway
what about uh all wheel drive
or is that
and even as as light as that is with uh the small tires it's it's done pretty well in winter
uh again like you if conditions are are that bad i probably don't want to be driving anyway
so i know i'd be happy with a a reasonable uh four door
you know again we've we've got the same issue with getting kids into the
what kind of crime do you think uh is the most prevalent in our society
oh boy probably uh robberies people stealing from each other
uh th- that that's mostly what i hear though is people getting ripped off and things getting stolen
that's the most prevalent crime uh the ones that really you know the ones that really add up after a while i guess you know from s- far as insurance money and stuff like that insurance costs
you know everybody has to pay for it indirectly eventually
i i i wonder if uh if drug use is a more prevalent crime though because i mean so many people use it
and even though just using is not really
i mean it is a crime
oh well yeah
that that that is a crime
i guess uh when you when you count all the little things that people do like
uh speeding is a crime
well that's true
but i was i i was staying in the realm of of felonies versus misdemeanors and uh drug use
well actually drug use is probably a misdemeanor
but uh what kind what kind
have you been uh have you been the subject of such a crime such as stealing or anything
well i've uh i've been caught with marijuana before
so i guess that was a crime
that that's not that much
i mean you know those aren't
uh when i think of crime i think of stuff that that affects other people like people getting you know killed or raped
i in some ways it's almost worse than murder
it's very degrading and
murder murder is is hard on the people that were related to you know i mean it is a rather final solution though
once once a person's you know gone then it's
but the person that's been raped has to live with that the rest of their life you know
what what do you think is uh is an appropriate uh punishment for some of the various you know such as things such as rape or or uh murder or something like that
well for for a lot of the kind of premeditated murders i think the death penalty is
they they have that down here in florida still
they the electric chair
oh do they
i think i think that's still an appropriate penalty to pay if they absolutely sure they got the right guy
and i guess usually they're they're always sure they
i think i i think it should take from conviction to execution should take no longer than a year
i- if that
you know the sooner
a a a year's plenty of time you know for something to come out i guess
then you know there's been guys in jail for six years
and the other guy admits that he did it
i mean the system isn't perfect
i mean it's run by a bunch of imperfect humans
you do the best you can to make it perfect you know
you you go out of your way to try real hard to make it perfect
but i think you have to accept some of the errors
i think that murder itself would decrease significantly if if there was a credible punishment uh for murderers
i i don't think it's a so much of a deterrent as as it is a a good uh a good way for vengeance you know for the relatives and and family members
i mean just general society to
and and it decreases the prison population
and which is significant i mean
i know that a a lot of the lot of murders that you hear about are people that know each other
and they're the kind of like crimes of passion and stuff like that
but i y- y- you might be able to uh stop people you know
generally the crimes of passion and things like that uh are not premeditated
i mean they can be
but usually they aren't
they're spur of the moment and uh the premeditated murders the ones where the person plots and plans when you catch those those individuals i think that you you end up with a uh uh how do i want to you end up with a s- you end up with someone who's more dangerous to society because they actually could harbor these thoughts for a long time
they could p- probably do it again
they they would have no problems doing it again
and i think locking them up for you know fifty years doesn't do a any good because as a as a taxpayer i'm going to pay you know one and a
well uh yeah
we we do
um we've been married for twenty-three years and we have uh three teenage daughters
and you know they're very expensive
we've actually gone uh just recently to you know having having two checking accounts
and now we are having two
uh it's kind of hard to talk
so i have to be
that's that's kind of the way i feel about it
i usually uh
and of course we're ju- like ther- like a lot of people
we just scramble through month to month you know
uh we have a two income uh family
she also works and uh but she she enjoys it
and she's good at it
uh if it's if it's
i am kind of uh uh i'm pretty bad about procrastinating and one of these days i am going to do something about that i believe
but uh uh if she she handles it pretty well
so your wife
she uh she writes all the checks you know once a month
her is her career uh related to to finance or accounting
uh sort of on a peripheral
she's uh uh an annuity administrator and so she uh she works for an insurance company
but but she enjoys it
so that's sort of related to her field a little bit
and we you know we've experimented with with uh budgets you know from time to time uh
but if you know
so a lot of times we just uh just kind of play it by ear
we try to keep our uh
just like taken directly
it's just taking it out right
and that that's kind of handy
because if you don't see it you don't miss it
that's exactly what we've always done and we've had uh they've always had uh where they match your funds you know
sometimes if you if you save so much then they will match it
uh that you know we've done that too
but my husband works for an insurance company and he he has now for about oh gosh how long has it been ten years i guess
but he was with another company before that
but we have we have
i i work also
but i only have a part time job and i get paid very little
but uh you know i try to use that money for food mo-
you know we just transfer it into my account
and then i use that for food household expenses
and then i add my own check to that
and then with that i try and handle you know some of the clothes that the girls need and things like that
but the expenses that we need and have around the house
just kind of play it by ear but keep the the deductions you know
we well jim has jim has a budget
uh you know i am given so much mon- money a month
so i am suppose to kind of get the food out of that
so i try not to you know
we don't you know i don't ask for more
i mean i just try and make it on that
because i think when you go to the grocery store you can just you can go crazy with all the choices that you have and uh you can
so uh well how long have you been married
uh about five years
so you're just really getting started
so do you have a family too
uh i've got one little girl
she's like uh nineteen months
so uh she's she's not uh
not not really
not too bad uh
you will see that all of a sudden you're paying you're trying to decide whether you are going to do you know soccer and piano and all these choices that they have of activities to do and then you really have to start saying okay now what can we afford you know
and then you have to really sit down and plan some more
and uh but i think when we were back at your age we didn't have much of a budget
you know more budgeting as as they got older
uh but uh but what do you do
i'm uh i i work for i'm an electronic technician
i work at a for a university uh georgia tech uh research and uh
so i just uh
well we just have you know we have a good friend that's about to move to atlanta
but uh budgeting
i found you know i feel a lot better
you know we use to work out of one check book and it would be very hard for me because i wouldn't have i wouldn't have any idea how much money i was spending in one month
now i have know exactly what i'm spending
and it's so much easier
i seem to be younger than most people who who talk on this thing
i'm i'm just graduating col- graduating from college
uh i didn't really perceive much of a of a problem with the school system
you can compare just about everyth- thing to japan
uh it seems to be not difficult enough for students not challenging enough and just not generally competitive enough
uh however i if it weren't for our needless uh
uh i haven't
it's been uh well seventy-nine since i was at school uh-huh
and uh i've seen things change
because i wasn't really like listening to the world go by back then
so it's hard to compare
but uh it seems like when i li- i lived in chicago
i i've lived down here
and i certainly see how much i pay in real estate taxes every year
and i begin to wonder if i'm really getting my money's worth
i mean i i've seen so many different things so so many different bad reports coming out of the school system
and i recognize that there are good schools out there
i mean somebody's getting getting a good education because we
uh well i don't pretend to understand that either
uh but i'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools
but then again i'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put uh because the the dropout rate is in those areas w-
it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and and crime
and they all seem to go together
and it seems like if you could eliminate one
so uh a- the other two a- a-
but it's just like i i don't expect them to know which which which part is best to fix just like i don't know
it's it's a complicated issue
i i still don't think i would blame it directly on the school
i think i think i blame it i think i blame it on a couple of different things
i think i blame it on the school system uh
well that's i meant when i said the school
i although i think that
well that's odd because i don't think the teachers in my school district uh were well paid
but there are some school districts out there that are very well paid
i mean i know one family that's got
and they both have
like second jobs that they work in the afternoons
and from their teaching job alone they pull in forty grand each
well it it
i mean okay
and they only work nine months a year
and they get an awful lot of breaks in between
and that's my tax dollars that i'm spending on that
and i don't even have kids
well that's true
but tha- there's
you can always play games with uh talking about whoa look at this
but when you're talk- w- w-
and there's really not much you can directly do about that
i think that that if if there is a problem with the school system uh from it's been my perception that the school teachers and school officials are not that well uh paid that perhaps that might be one area that that could be improved
and th- this is a profession
and as a matter of fact it's a pretty big influence on on
so do you your privacy being invaded at any time
that is something that is not required and in fact uh it is actually prohibited
but it doesn't stop many people many
and it's n- o- one of the things that it's used for primarily is for demographic uh research
and to get th- your your phone number on uh
now th- that y- s- you can still yeah
and i say what are you going to do
and then ultimately they say no
but uh really it's part of this compliance thing
uh the thing i don't like
i know that certain states actually sell their uh their lists like uh motor vehicles
that really burns me because hey you're required
and i think that it it's one thing f- to uh voluntarily give it because someone asks
but it's another thing where it's required by law
and then they go ahead and take that information and sell it to somebody
i don't think i don't think they have the right to do that
that's something that uh people have seen
oh here's an easy way to make some money
but uh i don't know if that's been challenged in the courts or not
i i've heard fairly recently uh some talk about that in this in in my state
uh the budget problems up here are are pretty tense
and people are looking for alternate ways of uh
en- enhancing revenue is the uh phrase they use
and they were talking about selling the d m v lists
and there was a lot of uh a lot of uh consternation about that
and the last i heard they'd backed down from that idea
well that's easy
they you become
and you start getting millions of calls or solicitations
and then you s- y- y-
like uh national public radio or
i i i i think i sent in in money for f- once to uh to public uh t v
and i started getting calls from all sorts of diseases and syndromes and everything you could imagine
and it just started soon after i had done that one
and i just said this is this is terrible
uh and that's also happened to me where i've given money to my old alma mater in college
and uh it's one thing
but the thing that makes me mad is uh then they start getting uh other people
th- the people do these phonathons and they call you up
and they actually happen to be people who are graduated in your class or something like that
and and they say oh we we know you
you uh had uh contributed x amount last year
and you know like hold on here
who how do you know that
why why you even telling me this
i mean it's one thing that i and the college knows that
and that was very offensive too
last year the uh lotus development company the uh company that puts out one two three was planning on marketing a uh c d rom with people's names sorted by number of different criteria
um um oh yeah
so you're remodeling
well i i just live in a i live in an apartment now
i uh two summers ago i went to massachusetts and i went with a friend of mine
and we undertook a building house
and this was a a lincoln log house where you have the wall partitions
and it's preconstructed you might say
and we started in uh we started from an empty lot with uh
and we had to cut them uh down and clear the lot
our one of our main problems was
well in massachusetts i thought i was going to
well it was a a fun time
but i thought gosh summer time you know
well all it ever did was rain and thunder storms
and we're in the process
and it started pouring down rain
and i guess we had most of it done
but the end was result
what happened was that some of the the wa- a lot of water settled on the top
and it really didn't give a very good finish
and some of the
it was sort of sandy and and not uh a very good finish
but it turned it was okay
and it's only the basement floor
so it was okay
but uh it kept us pretty busy
it was only uh
and then we just had like two helpers and uh sort of a a family type
it wasn't you know like a commercial project or something
it was sort of just you know uh gets your get his you know my bro- my brother and well maybe you know my cousin's coming over today to help us do that kind of thing so that the scheduling and everything was kind of hectic
and and then materials coming in
but overall yeah we got it done
and it's a three bedroom two bath house
and it's pretty neat
so uh i mean what was it for
well it was uh for my friend's parents
and they'd lived in this this old
and they live in this old house
and his mom just wanted a a new house
and so we did that
and uh she was really pleased with it
so it came really great
so what why is it that the weather in atlanta that gets
and that's why you
an- and the windows have you what type of windows are you putting in
because the windows are something that is conducive to temperature changes in uh you know the solar game
what what are you putting in triple glaze or double glaze or
we just we just went into a building supply store and bought plate glass
and uh but it
and it's had several owners and stuff
so you have the sash windows in
did t- uh did it go up and down
oh i see
and so uh and and so we wanted to
those are uh
and the ones that would open uh wouldn't want to stay open
and they also there they they
and it causes the glass to crack
and it's a never ending problem
so so i haven't uh i haven't been in any really home repair things lately
i uh i i guess i have to say at this point that i do approve of it
uh because i know that uh in using drugs i was not a good employee
and so i can see from the company's standpoint that there uh
and uh b- you are also under their liability under the workmen's comp
uh on my job we had a lot of workmen's comp cases
and uh it's also a retreading plant
and that's where most of our uh injuries occur
and what we do is we'll have a drug test if an if a a break or a man uh has an accident
then he's automatically uh given a drug test
do they do it like you know within hours of the
or is it
and so that kind of uh
i don't know if it's been a deterrent or not because we have uh just started using it oh for the past year or so
now we've let some people go uh that wa- we was found that drugs were used in their system
now i don't know how t e c would handle it
they haven't pursued it you know
uh if there's some uh problem i know
and he went to a a separate drug testing firm
and they showed it negative
so i think the tests themselves are not really that cut and dried you know
that's that's that's sort of scary
and then i also had a friend who was just around some people that were smoking cocaine
and he tested positive on cocaine
now then you always wonder well is he just saying that
that's that's a bad situation
i think that probably i think most companies now as far as entry
you know exams require that
and and and uh i'm i'm really gung ho for it
in fact i you know
some of the places now um like i b m don't allow them smoking you know in in the plant
we we have designated smoking areas
but um i work in sort of a building that's that's not really well
but it's a little bit you know separated
and it's it's a factory environment
and uh they they have designated smoking
but it's just wide open
it's not ventilated properly and i think that's bad
but as far as the drugs you know being in the factory kind of environment that way i think it's a it's a definite i think it's essential
because you're endangering everybody's lives if you if it's something like that
they never they never called me
they never you know
and finally the day we declared war was my time
and so and and my boss has has gone for about like three times i think
and i told him he's obviously in a high risk group
and of course you know they did
you know that they were going to do all them first
wouldn't that be awful if you were
i like i say i'm a former drug user
but uh i i well i i accepted christ as my lord and savior
and so i don't use drugs any more
oh what kind of drugs did you use if you don't mind
uh marijuana cocaine and amphetamines
and all on the job too
you know it had gotten that bad
well it's really lucky that you got away from that
and i was losing jobs just from doing a poor job you know
that's that's it
i mean you know there's all kinds of drawbacks much less the drug testing
well well i'm definitely for it
plus you know you you want to think that that you're working with people who are not only putting out their fair share
in some cases like uh my husband uh several years back worked for motorola
and they had you know
i mean it was a chemical handling type
i mean and they have they have some serious chemicals out there you know
like they have emergency shower where you just run in there and strip off and dump water you know that kind of thing
and they had people out there using all sorts of drugs handling those chemicals
oh my gosh
and that's really that's really frightening
so i think some place you know places like that it should be like mandatory like you know on on a on a greater frequency than maybe
just you know paper pushers like like i am
well well you'd think so
but they weren't
because when he was at
course now it's been years now because it was before it was even before they had the the designated smoking type stuff you know at t i
i guess it was like eighty-four eighty-five something like that
and they at that time they had no testing whatsoever
so that's scary
that reminds me of uh
and i have just casually asked her what he did for a living
and she said oh he's the supervisor of this chemical land fill you know where they go and dump all this toxic stuff
and i just you know went oh where
but i'm proud though that that um you know i grew up in the sixties
and back then it was popular you know
but people have really wizened you know become wise about drugs and they really have a good campaign for the young people you know
so so i guess it was just a generational thing
and that's good
that it really is
well i think we did it
so it's good talking to you
well i enjoyed talking to you cathy
seems to be a a topic that's going to probably take about a generation to uh catch on it seems or maybe a generation to two
and we may have to do it out of necessity as far as moving that time schedule up
uh it does seem to be a lot of habits to break
i uh wasn't raised as a kid on it
but my kids are
and so they they tended to want to grab the aluminum cans when that was one of the first things to do
and we were doing all right there until uh the price dropped out
so as far as at home use uh we'll pick up a six pack every once in a while or for whatever occasion of doctor pepper or something
and and by the time we gathered up enough crushed cans to take it in uh
at the time it was still oh about forty or fifty cents a pound
and we came out with about a dollar
and a lot of hassle all year round
and cans laying
so they they realized you know
well of course to them a dollar was a dollar at four and five years old
that wasn't uh that was a big deal
but we decided it wasn't worth us keeping it
and then uh t i started keeping up with uh cans there
so occasionally i'll bring whatever i've got laying around the car or the like and throw them in there
but as far as a habit at the house uh i haven't started on anything other than just whatever the city wants to pick up
i don't know if it w- was
but it it should be starting i would stay probably in the next month if if everything goes that
it seemed like uh
if if i recall it's been a long time
they were fine on the green big green containers but uh seems like they said they were just going to have a bin
and all different types would go in there
and then that they would sort it as as needed
it it seemed that there was
at the time anyway it the thinking was that there was too much not getting sorted properly and that at at the collection sites where everything's clearly labeled and people that happen to go to that kind of trouble to do it happen to do it pretty well uh those are okay to have the general public doing the sorting
but when it comes down to just general purpose trash that all the houses uh
so they felt that having one guy just sit there and run through it real quick was better than than having a household try it
but i i don't know
well it would get messy too
i i i know other places when they recycle they have to like wash out their glass jars and whatnot and uh which we're not in the habit of doing
i was brought up uh you know long time ago that they didn't even have cans
and you'd return them to the the grocery store
and you'd get our money back
and that that was all well and good
but i guess this day and age they don't
and it seemed to be a very popular thing for people driving by that highway there by our tracks to throw the bottles at the tracks and try to crash you know break them
but uh they weren't that successful
so there were a lot of bottles to be returned
and we just walk about a half a mile in each direction and gathered up enough to buy whatever we wanted for the day
and they uh p-
i i think kids don't appreciate maybe the value of money that it's so little that they don't care
uh for a good
well i wonder
but we we did buy a can crusher
and we are crushing cans
and when we buy the soda when it's on sale for ninety-nine cents
so i would say in the last three years we've probably used a lot more cans than ever before
uh it was just easier
well as you say it takes a while to build it up
since we've had the crusher all summer we
i think the kids when we were on vacation they said they did take them to a a recycling place probably at one of the li-
oh what are their names
and liberty is the cat
uh wife and i we have we have two cats
uh one's real nice
but the other one is a well
are they um just house pets
that's that's what ours are too
our cat we got from the pound the day bef- the night she was going to be put to sleep
so that's why we call her liberty
oh well that's a nice nice story um
i've had mice uh let's see
i have i had a son he's now gone from the home that was an animal lover
so at one point i had a snake skunk dog and cat running loose in the house
um do the skunk uh was it kind of like a cat to have around the house
yes it was litter trained and we had it perfumed and uh it was very aggressive
but all the all three of them dog cat and skunk used to chase each other all through the house
and the skunk
and the only thing we have with the skunk he was very very protective of his territory being the sofa and the blanket on the sofa
uh i had i had a dog one time
and uh he chased after a after a skunk and got sprayed so we had to we had to give him a tomato tomato juice bath and uh get him cleaned up
they um ours would still back up to the dog or cat when he got mad and try to perfume them
but the glands had been removed
but i suppose it was still in the instinct of them to to back up and get ready
i i think they're kind of nice to have
they're kind of you know just relaxing to i don't know to pet and to
when they like sit up on your lap and stuff like that just kind of enjoyable to you know have like
what what do you think
i always said if i di- well i always said if i died i'd come back as a dog
um do you like big dogs or or little dogs
well we had a german shepherd
and he had dysplasia and he had it for about three or four years where we just about had to lift him and carry him every place he went
so when he died we got a little one
but our shepherd was almost thirteen years old
and it just you know was almost cruel because
uh-huh almost cruel for him to to walk
he just he couldn't get up
so he was a hundred and twenty pounds
so it was a chore
so we said the next time around we'd get
and then we've had three cats in our married life
and we've got a calico now
she's the she's the nice one
we uh we used to live in an apartment
and like our cats never went outside
but um the neighbors used to let their dogs out
and our neighbors were i don't know kind of slimy
and uh our cats wound up getting fleas uh from the apartment that we were in so we had to we had to flea bath them
and it was uh it was an experience that they didn't enjoy at all
well don't even talk to me
i when i was single i had gone away for the weekend
and my husband then fianc3e was to keep my cat
and he let her out
and my house was loaded with fleas
i mean you walked in
and your legs were just black
and we had such a time and never got the cat back
i found it you know in the street
well now so if you were going to have a dinner party what would you make
um let's see
uh i like seafood
uh let's see
uh shrimp steamed she- uh shellfish with maybe herbs
now what is uh what is uh the steamed shellfish you said
and what would that be like a clam or uh
uh i think hors d'oeuvres are good too
uh and that way you can have a variety uh
so if you have a a dinner party and you're going to serve uh seafood for supper what type of uh hors d'oeuvres would you serve prior to the meal
like cheeses or fruits or vegetables or
or uh just
probably not nachos and dip huh
and then when you serve the meal what type of wine would you have with uh with the with seafood
oh all these hard questions
uh what white wine
so i'm not i don't know a lot about that
and and then uh uh dessert
uh chocolate something chocolate
usually when we have a dinner party i always i like to grill
oh you do
so we might have some cocktails ahead of time and maybe some uh some dip uh some cheese
one of our favorites is uh to take some let's see philadelphia cream cheese i think is that what comes in those little blocks
and pour cocktail sauce over the top of it and then get these little canned shrimp and uh wash them and cool them and then dump them in the uh sauce and then take crackers
and then you just dip the cracker in the sauce with the clams and the cream cheese
and you have a real nice dip that goes good with a cocktail
and then i like to barbecue like steaks or pork chops
and then we have uh s- oh lot of times we'll have baked potatoes with them and a salad
and then uh i don't know what we usually have for dessert
but uh that's what we would do for a dinner party i guess
but that's i guess when you talk about dinner party that's probably not uh that's more for like when friends come over
i wouldn't be the big uh snotty kind
i just started i just really started uh uh learning about that
and i bought a martha stewart
and she talks about catering and uh you know goes into goes into all that and the different types of uh
oh well do you work in a uh in a setting where you uh are in the food business
um my father owns a restaurant
oh in uh
it's it's just a uh c- a cafe
so it's not really anything you know that i want to
uh it's in lewisville
so you graduated from which high school
and that's a public school or private
uh well is your father's cafe uh one that you could cater out of
um and he's not interested in letting his twenty-one year old daughter experiment with it probably
well let's see
what else for catering uh
oh that would be good
could have uh uh fruits and and pineapple uh
let's see uh
and you could actually go with uh a chicken if you wanted to
i think i think decorating your food is you know really
uh we have a sheltie collie a miniature sheltie
it's about oh about six months old
and we're try-
so we don't have a yard
so it has to stay inside
and we're having a difficult time trying to train it
uh you you're you're in the roughest stages of pet ownership i think
but i guess every one one
i don't i don't know if that has anything to do with the intelligence really the the the training bit uh
but uh and my son and daughter-in-law have kind of a sheltie mix
and we watched it this summer for two to three months
and it wasn't trained quite fully either and uh but it was a sweet and an intelligent dog
so how'd you all how do you
i i'm old fashioned
and when i got my my dogs when they when they did something i hollered at them and threw them outside
just just put them outside i guess unless you ca- catch them in the act
well we're hardly ever at home
so it's kind of difficult
and you know you don't want to you don't want to spank it or scare it or anything like that
we we try to take it you know
it gets it gets frustrating when you take it outside
does does it just want to sniff around
and you know and then it runs right inside
and it does it huh
and you know it won't it's little job
and it comes inside
and uh you know there's certain spots in the house where he likes to go
so and he chews on plants and all that
that's nothing huh
but you know that's natural for a little puppy huh
well it it it'll it'll catch on pretty soon i'll i'll bet you
i i have a sixteen year old almost sixteen year old golden retriever
and she's gone the other way
oh that's sad
because she's so old she doesn't have much control so we're battling with that problem and she still feels good
uh she can't hear worth a darn or see very well
but she's got a great appetite
and she knows we're there
oh of course not
but we can't bear to do anything because she's been our friend for all these years
so we're putting up with all her accidents
and the la-
and so that was a bad one
but uh i think we're buying a carpet
what what's the deal
we we try to we're trying to take it on walks now you know and we can't because it's not accustomed to being on a leash and
i mean it just goes like a mad dog
i mean it just jumps up and down and starts yapping
does it oh
and it's you know
you know maybe you nee- you can get it signed up this spring or summer for some of the dog obedience classes
well we've heard bad we've heard some bad things about some of those you know
they sometimes mis- misuse their license or whatever you know
well you know we went we went to the junior college richland and we took
my my daughter was living at home then
and she took our golden retriever oh not the golden retriever the norwegian elk hound over there and it it it's a pretty good class
and they did pretty good except this dog is
so she didn't learn a lot
but it i think it calmed her down a little bit
and she's used to being around other dogs now
i think it was like a six week program
uh i think it was one night a week for like six weeks
and uh you know it was a group class outside
well sheltie collies are you know timid
and they don't really
they're they're usually
and uh if they're not accustomed to something they they're really scared
um our our friend has a
um i guess we're going to talk describe uh job benefits
and so what do you think next to salary do you rank is the most important job benefits
uh i would say the medical uh group insurance area as far as uh covering medical costs for yourself or family members
well um does your company have good benefits in that in that regard
i work for a public school system district and uh so it's different than a company where most companies fund almost the entire thing
where the school district does um the employee must pick up a greater figure in the way of uh costs
but overall um i've been pleased with it over the years
i think the biggest frustration is because of the cost of insurance going up every year our district has had to alter uh you know change companies
or now we're on a managed care thing which has stressed a lot of people out although it has not disturbed me any
uh well i'm
my medical coverage is with an h m o um so that's in my opinion that's get- that's bordering on a health clinic
but it seems to be a good way to maintain costs and still provide a good amount of coverage
our district did that for the ninety-one and the ninety school year or calendar years
and i was in the h m o
and um i was because my my same doctor you know agreed to be in it for uh
they usually sign a contract or something and um uh i did have surgery last summer
and i paid ten dollars when i went to see him that first day
and i've never seen another bill
so i i have to say it really works
but again i was fortunate because my doctor agreed to be in it
uh if you've been going to a doctor for you know ten years or something and he elects not to join it can be very stressful for you know those people
i'm i'm fairly young myself
three years ago is when i first got into full time employment and uh at that time i immediately joined the h m o
and i never really
so the only doctor i i've kind of consistently had has been through the h m o
and uh you know for me it's worked out real good
but if you you know have a family and and um everybody's gone to different doctors uh it is hard to give up somebody who you feel knows you and your body and your just has you know all the medical history
and you feel comfortable with it
i i'm sure it would be very stressful
and my husband and i have just elected that if that happens i will go and just pay
you can continue to go to your own doctor but your benefits are not as you know good
um like you you mentioned you work for a school system
oh all right
i work for uh georgia tech in the research branch
and i guess another one that that i rank up there high is the uh kind of job flexibility and time off um i enjoy as a benefit
are you talking about like spring break
it it really um
now i'm not a teacher
but i don't think the teachers could stand the stress
it is just texas has really um you know
uh and it it would be just
like in two weeks we have spring break
and i don't know who looks forward to it more the students or
well um i'm not actually on the teaching faculty
but we have a large research organization associated with the university
and that's who i work with
um and we're given you know a good bit of flexibility in what we do
well that's good
i would think that that type of employment you're you're one day you might be really tuned in and the next day oh a little luke warm or something and um it's good that they allow you that
now we do have to work you know the day
but we do get many days off
and uh we all look forward to it
that's the only reason i work there is that my children now have graduated and graduated from college
but at the time i worked there because my hours and days were the same as theirs and uh i've just continued to uh stay there
are there are there any things that that you'd like to see changed in terms of the the benefits
so i guess the recording has started now
so have you ever served on a jury
i was in the air force and served on a court martial uh board a couple of times which is very similar to a jury
i've um been voting for years
and i couldn't figure out why i hadn't been called yet and i finally was
so it was an interesting experience
uh it was uh uh it was uh well let's see it was municipal court so it was a combination of uh
and i was in the pool for a couple of weeks so it was a combination of criminal and civil
and they had uh
uh did did the judge uh hand down sentences
or did you folks do that
uh i uh i had a hard time getting seated on a jury
i kept getting uh
i'd be questioned uh for empaneling the jury
and they kept uh dismissing me
but it's just whether the prosecutor or the defense attorney feels like you know
they want to get the best uh mix for their case
so they ask all kinds of wild questions
that that's a science in itself
well i kept getting called up for drunk driving questions
and i think part of it was they didn't uh they didn't like the fact that i don't drink any more
because you'd probably be uh too puritanical
although in my case i might have been more uh sympathetic with the person who got caught
well i was never there never there for any sentencing
uh i finally got empaneled on one case uh on my next to the last day
and uh we got into the uh jury room to uh decide the case
and there was one guy on the jury who announced to everybody that he didn't need to deliberate because he'd already decided that the guy was uh not guilty
and he would never vote for guilty
so uh they appointed me jury jury foreman
and i uh didn't think that uh going in without deliberating allowed us to reach a verdict
so i told the judge that we weren't were unable to reach a verdict because we couldn't get one member of the jury to deliberate
so the whole thing had to be tried over again
it was uh it was funny
i ju- i i don't know
i uh i didn't uh uh i didn't like not being able to deliberate
i uh i i wanted to vote guilty for the guy
and the other people were kind of mixed so uh the guy had to go through the whole thing all over again
oh how many members were on the jury
uh it must have been six
i didn't realize until the uh wayne kennedy smith trial uh a few months ago that they had six member juries
i thought that they you know it was always twelve twelve men tried and true so to speak
but uh apparently for some some crimes it's permissible to have six people sit in judgment
getting to this unanimous thing whether you know a jury should be unanimous or not or not in a court martial case it doesn't require the jury to be unanimous
it's a simple majority you know rules
is it on uh capital crimes that they have to be unanimous
we weren't we we
the two that i were on had to do with drugs and uh we were uh unanimous is acquitting the person even though we in our in our uh gut felt that the individuals were both guilty just because of the friends because of various things
and you know being fair to the person if the government doesn't prove its case no matter how you feel you have to go by what's offered as proof
and we had to acquit him in both cases
uh it was too circumstantial
it was yeah in some of the critical things like the off- special investigations at one time in one of the cases had videotaped this person
but something happened to the camera and the tape and all they could do was testify
uh there would be a point there was a point where i would have said no that no one would deserve to die for for a crime that he committed
but uh since i've become a parent and since i've seen uh things like jeffrey dahlmer i really have to question that
i really uh i i can't conceive of someone being that brutal to that many other people
and uh try and figure out what would be a suitable punishment
of the statements made by people against the the death penalty um i i like the statement made by cuomo
um he's he's governor of new york
but uh he's uh against the death penalty
but um he said that he would he would want to to seriously hurt or if not kill someone if if they did something to his wife
but but even even in that circumstan- in that uh uh situation he would b- he would hope that there would be people around him who would uh keep him from
oh it's a uh it's a question of your your gut reactions to something like that versus an intelligent reason response
uh a- and that was the thing that uh killed dukakis back uh four years ago when someone asked him a similar question
and he he thought for a second and gave a thoughtful well reasoned reply when uh people wanted to see if he was going to go for an emotion uh a gut level reaction
and i think that the people who are strongly in favor of the death penalty are really working from that gut level
uh you know whether it be a biblical force uh you know the eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth a life for a knife life type logic or just uh uh some sort of anger at putting peop- putting uh murderers up in federal pens for the rest of their life uh while we foot the bill
i think people are are working at that from more of a uh a gut reaction than a a reason humane one
see i don't think the decisions that are going to be made on dea- on the death penalty until we decide what our prison system is intended to do
are they reformatories where we're trying to take people who can't survive or or that that aren't conforming enough to society so that that we work well together
is it is is it designed for punishment
um the death penalty surely fits in well with uh in a penal situation where you're trying to punishment
uh perhaps not in the manner that we do it
but but it in in theory it fits in
in reforma- system in a reformatory i mean
if you if you put someone to death you obviously
uh th- the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent
and i really don't uh agree with that
i don't think anyone who would commit a uh a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say well i was about to kill and dismember this person
but oh if they catch me they're going to kill me
so i better not do it
i i just
don't think that uh that it works that way
i mean people say that
but i mean if it was really a deterrent i mean i think like horse thieves in the old west you know
and if we really w- if it was really seriously going to be a d- deterrent i would think that it would be public
i mean i don't think it would be this private thing because nobody ever nobody ever sees it
if you know
like say some young kids or something like that that might be inclined more towards a life of crime had to sit and watch and and see a guy burn or or you know something or shot by a firing squad or something like that
i would think you'd make a bigger impact on their life rather than you know telling them that there's there's protestors out here at the you know
well i i don't know if that would really work that way or not
uh there's a lot of violence
um are you working right now
i'm working in the computer science department here uh at c m u
what kind of what kind of work do you do
uh i'm doing basically system system design work and uh implementation work for the speech for the speech group uh here
i work at uh the georgia tech research institute
um i'm a co-op student
so i work and go to school about halftime
and uh i really don't have any job benefits to speak of
we're kind of um
we don't really have any vacation or you know sick days or health care or anything really
so it's pretty fair they've got you slaving away
at at this point
well um t- i- i'm research stuff here now
so what they they have uh um okay benefits package
but one of the significant um benefits here is that you can take uh up to two courses a semester um
and they pay for you know pay for the classes
carnegie mellon that works out to be um a reasonable a reasonable benefit
uh they do that i think if you're uh research here
then i know of some of the people that have gotten their masters
and i think that um they might you know pay for that
but i know they let you they'll let you decrease how many hours you work by kind of percentage
you know they'll let you work halftime if you want to if you want to finish
they'll let you work decrease your number of hours by any percentage just just about so if you want to get your masters
and then i think of course you get like a with your extra degrees you get a pay raise due
so that will probably help out
so i i don't know in in terms of other things other benefits other than sort of monetary
i'd you know i
we we do
we have to contribute a certain amount uh to it
and it's kind of split between c m u and and you know the employee
i mean that's pretty that's a pretty important uh part of it there because that that can be really expensive if you ever have any health problems
my dad i think my
i'm still covered on with my dad's uh health plan at his where he works
but it would definitely be something to look into once i get my own
and it's also right now it's uh the
like everywhere else uh
here in pittsburgh the health care uh rates are are going up pretty quickly
but it's you are right
i i i really agree that that that's pretty important
well the only i think the i guess the only real um benefit i guess you could say working for me working here besides i mean
i'm at you know in school
but there's there's some weird law where uh uh student employees working for the government don't have to pay social security tax
that's about the only real bonus i have so i have to take that into consideration when i evaluate like how much i get paid real you know because if i was working somewhere else i'd have to you know pay an extra five percent
and they've just raised the um income caps on social security to the point where
well if you could call it a benefit that c m u i mean i-
the other thing that they allow you to do here while you are working is is consult for um you know other companies
um so that's that kind of helps out in terms of
you know keeping up-to-date with contacts in industry
you know in case you know in case you ever need to bail out
see around around here it's like uh
we pretty much work from project to project on well you know with different sponsors
there's not there is not a whole lot of you know funded research from
uh well i don't know exactly what's hot down in texas
so that's about all i can feel apt to discuss with you since i just know
and that's usually what's hot around here
so so what kind of music do you like
uh mostly folk music
i find myself uh listening to a lot of uh uh either old timer or new england uh dance bands as well as uh just more popular folk music and new artists coming up
well we're on totally different wavelengths
i'm more uh old rock and roll uh some new newer i guess you would call it heavy metal rock and roll type you know uh van halen that kind of thing
what about uh classic rock type stations
uh i don't listen to the radio at all
so uh classic rock for me is what i have which is like uh doors eagles jimmy hendrix
so some some of the older eagles stuff was good
i i didn't like uh
they started getting a little more you know
the type of music at least to me it's uh sounds like it's only sounds good at a high volumes
and i don't like listening at high volumes
but uh some of their older s- stuff was uh you know quite enjoyable to me
you know ho- hotel california and that era
that does that's something you don't doesn't even sound good loud really you know
you know definitely
uh so anything new you like coming out now other than folk music some i might know of
well down in texas uh you know little listen to a little country every now and then
way way more than i can stand down here
well there there's a conway twitty twang
then there's the uh dolly parton uh hollywood sound
that's more even more commercialized for of country music
but uh it's getting uh uh getting pretty big everywhere as i see it
i think some of them the artists are even uh hitting the pop charts
it's it's kind of strange that it's getting as big as it is
concert tours for country and western sings is it's it's quite quite odd
but uh i don't know
it's music is kind of going an odd direction nowadays i think
it's becoming not necessarily good music just popular music you know
i i i think most artists are in to make a few bucks
and that's all it
but they're not in it to say anything or give a message which is what they were do-
late late sixties early seventies they were they were definitely pushing a message
that's what what you say
and and then music is wrapped around now
i i don't i don't think gun
at least to my mind guns and roses doesn't have too much of a message too much to say
but you know it's kind of odd
it's just who does it you know
you hear a you hear a paula abdul song
and i think if somebody else were to play that you know they wouldn't they nobody everybody would think that's lousy
but because she did it it's supposed to be good you know
and it would be considered good because it's madonna you know
and folk music would be huge just because madonna does it
so it's it's it's really backwards how things are working now
i- i- it's the artist not the merit
so i don't know i i don't know that that's i don't think that's a good thing at all
so i don't know how how much farther we can digress before we have to turn it around and go the other way at least
well i don't know
i know for myself that uh for the most part i don't know which artist is which
so i listen to a song
or i don't like it and then if i really like the song eventually i'll figure out who it was
i don't you know you don't i don't know enough about it because i just listen
uh everything i listen to is what i buy not whatever they play on the radio
well you have to figure out what to buy
or do you just buy along the same artist
it's just it's you know it's way to hectic and too confusing
so you keep buying the same artists until you don't like an album then you stop
or about the only new music i hear is somebody else that i know will buy something new that i haven't heard
and i listen to it that way
but as far as
see that's one thing i like about the uh some of the folk music scenes you know
there's a couple of nice uh small coffee houses up in new jersey
and it's very nice
and you know an artist is there
and very often the artist will have a d- an album
and so if you like the artist you buy the album
so you definitely get to try before you buy
you know it
you you you don't always quite get it right
and uh they're in a public school here in tyler
and uh i'm happy with it
good curriculum uh
they have no problems uh
but i do live in the better well in the best part of the city
though i live in you know the real richy part i guess
but everybody around me is
and uh but they're
and their schools are kind of rundown and uh older
and they don't really
uh but you know i'm happy with what they're in
so go ahead
it it's it's pretty much what i was s- going to say
is there's a lot of disparity between different neighborhoods and what sort of schools go in
uh i grew up in new york
and uh the place
or not new york city upstate new york and i went to uh the city of rochester school district and s- a lot of my friends were in one of the neighboring suburbs
and it wasn't we weren't too far removed geographically from each other
but the difference in schools i think was pretty substantial and uh one of the things that probably would have been better if is if the entire county had had had just one school system
and that would result in some uh could result in more equitable distribution of money
because what was happening was you know all the very rich people went out to the move out to the suburbs
and the city had a very low tax base so they didn't have a lot of money to work with
there wasn't as many you know of the nice supplies in science class that we would have liked
there wasn't as many advanced placement courses uh when i was a senior that some other schools had
and uh it it
so i you know i think that one of the things one of the ways to to to help schools in general uh and get them all to a minimum level of of of competency almost would be to expand the size of school districts so you get a wider variety of people
and the the problem with that is then then then people will either the rich people will either pull their kids out of the public school and put them in private schools or they'll move farther away
so you know it it's kind of you end up chasing like a dog chasing its own tail sort of
also uh the the family environment
you know you can come to south tyler where i live
and you have got room mothers in every room
you've got every every holiday
all these kids have these really supportive really supportive parents always up there for something
and the parents might not could even tell you what their kid's teacher's name is
uh that has a a whole lot to do with it you know
as far as their learning i mean if the parents aren't uh you know willing to go with the kids and find out what they're learning and if they're learning you know they really don't have much of a chance at all
you j- they just don't
i mean i mean i'm i'm up there at my kids' school
and if they're up i call and find out you know
okay you know uh
and i i know kids that their parents could really give a rip
and the kids are not motivated
so they just go to school
and you know eh you know i'll get through the day and uh bring homework home
and there's nobody to to sit them down and say you're going to do this
uh just you know they they take a notion to do it
and uh that doesn't work either you know
and uh they can't just have it at school and then come home
and there's nothing you know
i know that that that was a big factor for me
i ended up coming out of of the public school system very well and was very good education uh
ended up getting some scholarships to go to college and
which has been you know which is really nice
and i think the difference for me was that my parents were you know they were definitely they were always there
was like well
and that's the way
and i had i had the brakes done on it
and then the reason i did that was because i don't have a scope
and it has eight spark plugs
and it's hard to to get get at them
and i i had an occasion to change to have to change the battery once
but the brakes i was really surprised that the brakes
and i know that the oil needs should be changed very regularly and all of the bearings
and the lube lubrication system needs to be lubricated and
so i i stay on top of that
and they wanted something like fifteen dollars uh a front or something like that
or maybe it was thirty dollars to do it just to pack the bearings
but what i found is that they had a brake job
the other thing i let them do some times is that i let them go through and let them tell me what let them do the diagnostics
and then i can decide whether i want them to do it or whether i can do it see
and they told me that my my brake pads were gosh you know seventy percent still good you know
but still it was cheaper in the long run
so i just got the the brakes done
and i thought that was a good deal
and they repacked the wheel bearings
and plus and they re- repacked the the wheel bearings
but uh i've i've had considerable experience
i'm you might say i'm uh uh good back yard mechanic
and i you know i took auto shop in high school
but i i still have a pretty good feel for it
i i had bigger cars
and the brakes go out fairly rapidly on those
and what i was surprised at is that on my little nissan i bought the truck with about sixty thousand i have almost one hundred and ten
so i drove on those brake pads for uh you know forty-five thousand miles
and there was hardly any wear to them
so those small little trucks and cars like that they just the longevity of the brake pads is really good
you know they've gotten to the point that where they don't weigh very much
and the the surface materials on the pads is so good
so i you know i just did it anyway
i like to i like to stay up on it
you know like i just kind of stay up on it
and then if you go and like just about any point any you know point in time
you know it's not dirty
i i i keep it that way because that's that is the key to the longevity
so so how
well it sounds like you've had some good experiences with that uh and my experiences have been kind of contrary to that
uh i i get a little more involved in the maintenance of my car
and uh and in fact i have an eighty-seven mustang with a three o two in it that i've uh beefed up a little bit and one of the things that i did was to change the pulley system on it to use under drive pulleys so that the engine doesn't have to turn the accessories and can use more of the power to the rear wheels uh the only catch was the first set of under drive pulleys that i put on it were uh not even cast aluminum
well there's three there's three pulleys that you change
you change the crank pulley the alternator pulley and uh the water pump pulley
so when i changed those over i put on these these pressed aluminum things and uh probably about four months ago the water pump decided to go out
so in the process of seizing the belt spun on the pulley and wore through the water pump pulley almost all the way
so i was on my way to work one day
and uh the water pump pulley split laterally in half
and the other half was kind of dangling off the end of the crank and uh i
um i'm from maryland
and um i have one son who's almost sixteen months old
are are you married or
i have i have two children
and uh so i try to spend as much time as possible with them
uh what kind of things do you do
well um w- we do a lot of things with them you know
ta- taylor my youngest is
or my oldest is in school
and so she has a lot of school programs and things like that
ho- was it a big change in your life to uh have a child
it's really nice uh
my husband uh is working mo- you know most of the time
uh i'm just working a couple days a month
what do you do during those those days
um we spend a lot of time at the playground
and we go to the zoo
and we go
and we wa-
well you said you said you worked a couple days a month though
what do what do you do
oh are you
so it's it's it's real easy to work out my schedule
you know to uh get in to to still stay in with that
an and to have enough time to spend with matthew
he he's uh just now really starting to to get interested in a lot of things
but my my wife was uh
she worked part-time when my oldest was was little
and now she's staying home all the time
but uh that worked out really well because it's a big transition i think to have children
you know to go from you know nothing you know
but when you have children it doesn't work that way anymore
and i think a lot of people are um are turning to well i think i think a lot of people are realizing that
but still there are so many people that are you know have their careers first
and it's uh i think it's really hurting uh the kids you know
i i i think that my wife leaned that way
and i'm really glad she did
and you know i'm glad she's staying home
but you know i know there are some days when she wi- she wishes she was back at work
that's why i like to
i think it's uh
well t- see that's that's why i'm glad my wife did too
'cause she worked either two to thre- three days a week
and that got her out of the house
and yet she'd get to spend you know three or four days with
uh we had started out like that
and um i think that was really ideal uh
but then when you start having two of them it's you know a little bit tougher
are are you from the maryland area
i'm i've i've lived here forever
i me- i live in germantown
are you where are you from
um uh i'm in dallas texas
so uh i'm i've lived here like eight years or so
so that explains
i uh we we do a lot of things on the weekends together the family
but uh as far as during the week it's it's usually uh you know just my son and i
uh he he works for coca cola
so he uh he manages a plant out here
an and it takes a lot of time
but um it you know
my wife did some teaching at like uh like a private tutoring place
and so that that got me to sp- to be able to spend more time with the kids at night and stuff
you know 'cause normally if if they need something they just go to mom
i mean i cou- i'm perfectly capable of doing it for them
but you know we'd go to the library and do things like that
i know my husband was real uh
in the beginning when he uh he was transferred to a a larger plant
and he uh he works about an hour and a half away from here from our home
and uh so it takes him a little bit of time
and i'm not able to work during the week uh because of that
he was i was working in the evening
and he was coming home
and i i could go to work
their relationship uh when i was able to work in the evenings uh really grew
he you know
i think it it really it really helped to have that time together
because i think yu- you know you grow closer
was your uh was your husband i mean naturally a child
i mean ha- had he been around children
uh oh yeah
he has uh he has seven other brothers and sisters
and they have we have thirteen grand
well his parents have thirteen grandchildren
so it's uh you know there's a lot of kids in the family
and and he really enjoys it
but uh right now it's kind of a difficult time
and and the cost of living here is just so tremendously you know outrageous
um it's difficult uh to do it any other way
i'm i you know
it's it's hard because you know
then you're not getting to spend as much time with at home
i mean your husband is not getting to spend as much time at home as he'd want to
that that's a tough situation
but then then again you know some
you know to get along too
at least i i just consider myself blessed that i can stay home
we- well like i said my wife normally feels that way
there are days when uh i come home and she says here take these kids
so she's she's had about enough during those days
but but for the most part i you know i've really feel like that's led
the way that you know we- jus-
like what you said with the cost of living and everything i think a lot of people can't afford to get by on just one salary an and won't
and so i think that's le- tended to lead to a decline in in families and family values especially
and i really think that that's one of the problems the nation's facing that you know we need to do something about
but i don't know what
and i think uh the kids are where they need to you know
they need to really focus on the children in the wor- in this country
would would you have said that a couple of years ago do you think
i didn't i didn't even really think about it that much i mean you know
i i was aware vaguely aware of it
but um i didn't it wasn't really that important to me
oh it it really does
just the whole uh you know
seeing how you really are cre- are are forming this you know the mind
well you know in the next year or so you'll see so many instances where you know he'll mimic something that you've done
and you see you know everything i'm doing he's learning from
and and you think if i wasn't here he'd be learning that from a baby-sitter or from a day care
you know th- that's how they're developing their patterns
and i think a lot of people either don't care or don't realize it you know
or or they just put it in the back of their mind and let it slide
i i've seen a lot of people just say well you know he'll learn everything when he gets into
uh you know
but it um
i i know
even just this first year that i've been with uh my son h- here um he's
of of a difference it makes staying home with him
instead of uh
plus plus i think it becomes part of y- part of you too
i mean you get to stay home
i mean it's not just for him
but it's also for you because you're both kind of bonding together there too i think
well it's been nice talking to you
well it's nice talking to you too
lynn do you do you want to start
well i i tend to uh take two kinds of vacations the vacations to visit family and the vacations to just have a week being cultural and going to the theater and doing sight-seeing and things like that
oh well i couldn't live without the family vacations
but uh my favorite is the the indulgent ones where we go off and and uh see places that have interested me since i was a kid
uh not anymore
and they're moving to florida
and that's one of those things
so uh basically it it sorts out into that
and then once about once every three or four years i try to get over to england because i lived there for a while
and i'd love to go back
and it was
and i'd real really like to go because um i'm fairly recently married
and and my husband has been hearing about these people for years
and uh but he's never met them
so uh i'd like i'd like to do that
but anyway that's that's our typical vacation
and uh we enjoy the family vacations
but the other ones are very special getaways
and we probably take one of each every year
well uh we we as you do take family vacations uh sometimes one a year
and but this year we're not going to be taking one for
but vacations we really enjoy
oh i've never
and we we really love cruises
and uh we've gone fairly inexpensive from as most cruises go
uh we usually book just a month before it's ready to go
and we get upgraded
last ti- last two times in fact we had an outside room
and it was beautiful
and we like not having to take our suitcase in and out of hotel rooms and drag it all around
well what do you do on a cruise
oh my god you do everything
you i mean you can be as busy as you want to be or as laid back as you want to be
or you can take part in the games that they have going on
uh they have a massage parlor
i mean you can do anything
and that's just aboard ship
and then when the ship docks you get to go sight-seeing and shopping
and that's quite fun
and where have you been on these cruises
uh nassau san juan saint thomas
we we've gone with friends each time
and then we went to uh the western caribbean which is uh port uh cancun cozumel
oh the the mexican coast
and but it was wonderful
so we really like those
and uh i guess we just like to go someplace someplace entirely different
and we've been down in texas eighteen years
and so like you we always try to make it you know back home to see the relatives
and that's fun
uh things are different there though
well i i grew up in dallas
so i mean
it's not it's not like i'm going home
my my parents retired first to san diego
and they're going now to florida
and so they're going very nice places
and uh you know i just grab the car and drive everywhere
oh that's great
so it it is it is nice
but it's not home
and um and i've never thought about a cruise
oh they they they really are
we've yeah as i said we've done them three times
we'd be going again this this year if circumstances hadn't changed
we we'd probably go
my husband would you know
the minute i said the word he he he's chomping at the bit
but i like all of that
so we're going to be able to go up there
oh that will be nice
so i'm kind of looking forward to that except i hate to see them go
well go in don't go in the winter
oh that's what everybody says
and i i think it's
i think i'll try to stay away except my my second grandchild will be born in
so that will be hard to stay away from
well th- there are exceptions made for special occasions like that
but the ordinary thing is to stay out of the north in the winter and get out of texas in the summer
huh well that sounds wonderful
i i guess i i would contemplate going on a cruise uh oh all circumstances permitting it
well there's all age grou- groups too
and that's that's kind of fun
uh you if you sit at a table with a lot of people for your meals you meet different people
you may meet people you know thirty years older than you or younger
and everybody is really interesting
and everybody is there to have a good time
huh how long are the cruises
uh we've only gone on the seven day cruises
and then they have ten day ones
but i think seven days is long enough for us
i think most vacations uh seven days is enough for us
and that was pushing it a bit
uh i tend when when i spend enough money to go overseas
well that that makes sense it really does
i mean oh we went to panama too
oh that's interesting
and uh we went with our daughter and son-in-law to visit his parents who live there
and his father is a a doctor
and his mother is a kindergarten teacher
and they took time off
and they were having a little break
so they took some time off that uh they could show us around
and it it is a beautiful country
and it it is gorgeous
and uh it's it's just it's just a gorgeous country
huh well may maybe now things are calming down again
we really hope hope so
well that that's really great uh
i i mean as i said basically all i've done is go back and forth to parents
well that that's that's pretty good
and and uh we had my husband had a conference in l a
so we spent a week in l a
and of course
oh do you like l a
uh i'm i'm i'm very unusual
well uh it's funny when i tried
but today i went to see regarding with henry
oh i'm dying to see that
we uh jeff wariner just got out of the hospital and uh jeff and deeanna went and
and uh we all liked it
we had both moms and uh fifteen year olds and a twelve year old
oh my goodness
and everyone enjoyed it
oh well i am just dying to see it
and they said get a baby-sitter
and we'll all go see regarding henry and i said ooh i want to see it so bad
well my son had gotten to see a lot of movies this summer on choir tour and visiting friends and one thing and another a lot of the ones i had wanted to see
and so since he had this friend up from houston uh and his friend had already seen so many and i thought they decided on this and i thought well i want to see this one too
well let me see
well we went to see one hundred and one dalmatians last weekend
and that may be
and we won't
well she goes all the time
but i go maybe once every couple of months
and when i go i go see two at a time
so we went to see soapdish
oh was that good
and oh hysterical
well i want to see that and city slickers both
but that's what i was
and my face hurt so bad
and course growing up on on the back of a horse you know and being on ranches and stuff so much of that was so true
and i was absolutely rolling in the aisles
oh well good
i'm i'm glad to hear that because they
oh they are are
and like i said with city slick- i mean with soapdish it is so cornball
and it is so overacted that you're just hysterical you know
just they just carried it off
well i don't i don't know if you got to see weekend um at bernie's that was out a couple of year's ago
they had a free showing at the berkeley um united artist
and we didn't think we'd have much chance of getting in
but we thought we'd try it you know free movie
it was so funny and it sounds like uh what you were just describing soapdish too
i mean we just we hurt by the time we came out
and the whole theater was hysterical
and it's just it's just goofy
i mean it's uh
or it should be out on t v i would think
um cause it's it's just a fun summer light comedy
especially in the theater it was contagious you know i i imagine the way soapdish was but with everyone laughing
oh gosh i never laughed
and people were just screaming and applauding
and you know it was just hysterical
well i'm glad you did that before your surgery
oh me too because i don't even know if i could live through it now
i mean i'm getting around real good
and i'm just still real sore
and today i was i course i went back to work two weeks after uh but see i don't have permanent work
i right now i'm working with a temporary agency
and so the second week i was out of the hospital i went up and worked half day on the computers cause you can learn all the software for free
oh so i went up to do wordperfect cause that seems like that's what everybody wants
and i was up there half a day and came home and collapsed
and then they called me to see if i wanted to work a day
and i said yeah
and i went
and of course it took me the whole weekend to recover from that
and uh i worked about three days a week ever since two to three days a week
and so i went to my doctors last thursday
and this was my fourth week checkup
and he said well gosh you're just healing really well
he says now i'm not going to say you're going to feel like playing ball
but you can if you want to
and uh you know he was teasing me
and he says yeah
and uh he says so you just take it easy for two more weeks
i said okay fine i i will i will
whatever you call easy i'll do it you know
and so i don't i'm real glad that we didn't go see those funny ones when i was when i'm still sort of on the sore side
well wha- what's your next
that was one uh jay got to see
and so i and to try and uh try and find time it's hard uh with jim's schedule too just to get a time that we can both go
and uh i'm holding out for city slickers for the two of us because uh we had friends that went to see that and said you know it's just perfect for our age group
uh and that's what he would have liked to have seen regarding henry too
but knew that uh
we've we've got a lot of company this summer which is wonderful
but some of the different things we're doing uh there's just not a time enough time to do it all
and he said well realistically
you know he knew he couldn't get them all in
but uh jay really liked robin hood
um when the choir group went to see backdraft and they thought that was uh it was funny cause he sounded like the critics
he said you know the plot line and the characters uh you know aren't real big
but the the fire scenes and the dra- you know that action part is fantastic
but he thought robin hood was great
but h- but he enjoyed it
well i went
i really uh like him a lot which is why dances with wolves was the last movie we had seen for several months
in fact uh a friend from germany was visiting in march
and we wanted we didn't ran out of time we wanted to take him to see it
uh i just thought that was terrific
and i really enjoy harrison ford which is one of the reasons i wanted to see
and he's very good in regarding henry
that's not an easy part to play i i don't think
well my kids are going to their dad's tomorrow night
so i sort of think i may go do that
that's at that one won't your sides
and we went to the
so are you a a a golfer
or are you a spectator
oh i'm a
but i don't actually play golf
well i'm the same way
i i go out there and hit the ball
um uh well in the carolina's it's it's just you know we've got a bunch of golf courses around here
but i don't know
uh well i mean i'm not a serious golfer at all
uh uh a friend of mine goes golfing a lot
and he drags me out every now and then
and i uh i don't have a i don't really even have a game
when i go out and play golf it's usually like at a at one of these par threes that
you know you
but um i like watching it on t v
but god i a couple years ago i played two three times a week and got lousy
and i thought i was really improving and the big break was going to come
and then i got worse again
well i i i if i can i can hit a great deal like um they they my friends
to get me they they say i hit worm burners because i i can't hit it up in the air
so i'm pretty bad
but i i i get great distance hitting it you know across the ground
and if it's going over water or something one of them have to take the shot for me because i'm
but i'm getting better
i've got where now i can hit it in in the air some of the time
uh so i'm kind of a novice at it
um i'm that and worse
i i play
but i've been doing so bad
next year i always say this every year but next year i'm starting over from scratch
well that i i guess that's what i need to do is is get some kind of lessons or something
because i my my tee off is not bad
i mean i'm i'm good up to everything else putting and stuff like that
it's just that that initial tee
and i think i'm doing all all fine
you know checking the ground and and so forth you know
if you get if you get down on the ground you really can
can you tell ho- no- but can you tell how how fast you're going to hit it
um well if you know if it's up on a slope that you've got to hit it not kill it
but you've got to hit enough speed and the right angle that it's it's you know
but you can feel that
i have i can gi- get it within like you know four or five feet or something
but i don't have enough field
oh it just dies and rolls in
it's it's like i said
but that that tee shot uh it you know
when teeing off i- i'll go probably a hundred feet across the ground
so it it takes me awhile to get to the hole
and you put it in
oh the t v golfers they do that
so it's fifty percent
and me it takes me five to get there and five to get it in
well it it it usually takes me about probably two two or three to get it there
and and then that's according to the hole
and it ju-
uh uh maybe one or two putts
but the friends i play with uh they play all the time
and and they're really good
uh they're not joe pros
but they they golf in the high sixties low seventies
so i guess they're pretty good
i'm i'm usually in the eighties or nineties
so i'm i'm not good
if when i'm in the nineties i'm feeling good
you know i can hit a great drives and think i'm going to do all awesome on this hole
but it ain't going to happen
well i either teeing off i either slice it
or i hook it ever single time
and and i alternate
well it's a good thing with me i slice it every single time
uh 3 utts should be separate slash units
well i think universal health insurance like national health like what canada has
is that what you're you're thinking the subject is about
did you read uh the article in the paper today about this particular subject
in the dallas the morning times
uh the state of washington and the state of minnesota is uh going to begin testing a program a state funded program for citizens of those two states
and there's fourteen other uh states that are considering it least according to the article in the paper this morning
i think it's a trend that's that's that's uh probably may go nationwide eventually because i think national health is something that we all need
well it's been interesting that we
so we live in a society though where everyone if you ask them on polls will uh say that they think that everyone has a right to health care
and yet i don't think we've ever quite decided who's really supposed to pay for it
well that's the thing you know
uh unfortunately the ones that currently pay and pay the premiums for health insurance are are paying for the people that don't have health insurance
i don't think you uh
uh through my company
but i have been in a situation uh recently where i was laid off from a position as a sales manager of a company and was off work for about a year
and my wife developed cancer
oh my goodness
and it was a go to parkland type situation
uh because it was a life threatening situation it was very good
uh as it as it turned out one of the top uh people or one of the top doctors in the state that is involved in cancer treatment was at parkland
but yet parkland is not free either
it's it's a situation that because i didn't have any insurance and i was on unemployment it was paid by the county
so you did have a good experience
uh i was fortunate that there was parkland
uh no she passed away
but it's very sad
but in any event uh i'm in favor of national health
well so am i
oh is that right
so uh i'm really quite active in trying to uh be proactive at least for children's issues
it's very complex very complicated
but uh i strongly believe that all children have a right to immunization glasses hearing aids
well i when i grew up and
i grew up in south central kansas uh
and my mom worked for the health department the county health department
and we had x-rays every year
we had a dentist come to our school and uh check our teeth once a year at least
uh we had all our flu shots taken care of our measles mumps rubella and all that other stuff
and uh when my children were growing up we didn't have that
but i'm sure that there were people that don't
well and the costs have so much has gone up so much
the cost of immunizations for example uh and just the legal
so well i don't know
it's it is interesting
so uh one out of every three children has nothing to reimburse them for their health care
and i work in the children's parkland system
and it's pretty overwhelming to me
but uh it's pretty hard to be indigent and to be dependent upon indigent health care systems in dallas county
so now what are your opinions on recycling
well i definitely think that we need to start recycling
i think if we wait uh which is happening until somebody says we have to do it yeah
and that is not too far away
but i don't know how it is there
i can take plastic and paper bags back to the grocery store and i can take plastic like milk cartons or if they have water in them
and there are some fire stations i can take newspapers to
and that is very inconvenient cause i have to wait until i have enough of them to make the trip worthwhile
well see i started saving newspapers
and i would take a ton of them and uh that's i can't remember where i went to take them
but they wouldn't take them
and then i don't know if you note even doing that the amount of trash we throw away is incredible
oh i know
that cannot be it could be recycled
but there is no place to
we have a pilot program in arlington going on i think in the north part of the city where they are have people people separate the garbage as the trash as they put it out
and i think that is what it is going to have to come to where we are just forced to
besides well like a law or whatever
an- that's how it is in new york isn't it
and you get ticketed if you don't do it right
and i think it is going to come to that because some people will just not go to the
it's it's trouble for me to do what i do i mean i am willing to do it
plus you have to have a place to store all of it and see i live in an apartment
like our garage is always full of sacks of newspapers
and so i don't know
and also i have a real strong opinion
in iowa the state i am from uh i believe it has gone up to a dollar now
every time you buy a container no matter what it is whether it is glass whether it's a beer can or a fifth of whiskey or a pop or whatever you pay ten cents for it and then you take it back to the store
and you get it back
uh so that way it kind of forces you to recycle
and uh you also don't see the litter there
and i've just started drinking a new water called clearly canadian
i don't know if you've tried it and they have on the ba- it's five cents that they pay five cents and it even shows the states that
well on- some of them are five some are ten cents
texas is not one of them see
so i have to throw them away cause there is no place to take glass
now i work at j c penny at their corporate headquarters
and we have a paper recycling program that uh is company wide
and i do the recycling for that
do they save like the paper they they use at the office paper
and i know there is a lot of computer paper that you can't use
but uh we use to have uh
i mean i don't even remember how much money that they've uh i mean the money that they've made from the recycling program
i mean they have made a substantial amount of money from it
something else i think we do can do is support companies that encourage
like i have decided downy fabric softener now has where you can buy a little carton you add wa-
well i image everybody else will start doing that sooner or later
but i am going to stick with downey because they were first
and i want them to have my business
and i think packaging could be done much better
well i know
and then when they come out with the new things you are like well why didn't you think of that before
and i think that it's just people have got to be aware
and they don't want to think about it
and uh i just look at it i don't want my grandchildren looking at me and saying why didn't you do something
you know i want to feel like i at least tried
and i don't know
do they not ever i mean i don't know that much do they not ever burn trash or anything like
see there were no
well that doesn't do me any good because i don't have any place to burn it
and then just like the glass bottles that it says on the bottle i can get ten cents but not in texas
and there is no place i can take glass to
so i still throw away a lot of glass
and then the packaging thing really grips me
and it's got a great big piece of cardboard and a great big piece of plastic
well uh i myself am not in favor of drug testing in the work place except in in specific uh very specific in this uh very specific examples such as uh transportation workers as in uh air traffic controllers bus drivers and that kind of thing
um i don't really
i think it's a severe invasion of somebody's privacy to say well we're going to look at your urine and then decide whether you're uh you know worthy of working for us
i really don't see that that's a very very valid uh thing for a company to say
and i personally i don't think i would work for somebody if they were going to reject me on the basis of what's inside my body
uh i guess i basically agree that uh
i mean suppose they found out some other way
well i think i think we i think the problem here is is that a a drug test does not necessarily imply that someone is taking drugs or not taking drugs
there's too many cases where it can you know
there can be false positive results and that that sort of thing
i don't think there's any definitive you know
so we don't want him here
uh like i said some industries though i think it'd be very necessary
but uh i i just i find it to be pretty offensive that that it's such a a big deal
i mean if your employer's not going to trust you
or you know it
i just i think it's a whole trust issue
but have you ever been in a situation where you you were drug tested
i i mean i was very offended by by the whole process
i mean it's very humiliating
and i mean i'm not speaking in favor of drugs or against drugs
but i uh i am totally against that sort of a uh
i mean it's it's a pretty personal thing when somebody says i want to look at your urine before i'm going to talk to you
and i just thought it was dumb of the company at a point where they were trying to convince me to to want to work for them to do this
and i'm just like well uh
that's that's basically my opinion on it right there is that it's just you know
i did i i was in the same sort of situation as
and then you had a physical where you were drug tested
and i know people who have been drug tested and who have not you know been hired by a corporation which uh you know
the other side of it is is besides its being an invasion of personal privacy as in my it's my bodily fluid
and i don't really want you to look at it or or something pretty basic like that
i mean during the eight hours during the day when they're supposed to be there i think they have every right to say this is these behaviors are acceptable and these are not
but when it enters into what they're doing when they're not at work i find that to be fairly offensive also
well like you say i mean if it's not a critical kind of job where someone could get hurt then really what people ought to be doing i mean the the employer ought to be judging you on how well you do your work rather than on these other factors
and i mean if you are doing drugs and it's causing a problem then they'll notice it for other reasons
and also i just think it it gets a lot
i'm a big uh supporter of personal freedoms and personal privacies
and i think that it just moves down along a line that that i really would find bad if if most people went down that line into regulating employees' lives outside of work you know
well we're not going to hire you if you smoke
well you know i i can see how they can say in the work place we you don't want them to smoke
but when somebody leaves work i don't think that it's the employer's right to regulate their life style at all
well do you think it's should be illegal for an employer to do this
uh i really think it should be except as i've mentioned twice now in the specified industries or or jobs because there are certain things where it's just vital that a person is clear minded at all times
and other than that i think i do not think it should be allowable
i think it should be illegal for them to to want to do that
it should it's kind of the big brother syndrome
i mean i just
i tend to to view it
even though i don't think i'd work for a company that did that i sort of want to defend an employer's rights as opposed to an in- uh in addition to an individual's rights
but an employer really i think has the right to hire someone on any basis they want to and if they say they don't want smokers i sort of feel like an employer should have the right to decide whether they want to allow that
uh and i don't really
but anyway uh well i do take care of pretty
and uh i embarrassed to say it's pretty trivial
all we all i do is uh keep a list of things like debts that are outstanding and every two or three months update that and every once in a while make a list of what we spent that month
but i doubt i do it more than three times a year
yet i i do everything on paper
uh i don't even use a calculator for the stuff i'm doing because it's all pretty round numbers
mine is really simple because i got all our bills paid off when uh he was a marine
and while he was gone i got all of our bills paid off
so really the only bills i have is rent utilities insurance you know
so they come in
and that's it
that's about the extent of it you know
i just really i'm real thrifty
i take care of you know two children and me and uh just real careful with the money you know what little we have
so that's what i do
i can't imagine having to go into real complicated stuff and making you know fancy budgets
it seems like if you're getting to that level y- you're not in real good control
you know i mean i i i've never liked credit cards and a lot of debt you know
and you pay twice as much for it when you get done
actually i mean i like using credit cards for everything but just paying off the bills because that way it's a record of everything
and i don't have to worry about keeping
i don't have too many i don't have too many weaknesses
but i found out a credit card was one of them
it's so much easy easier you know if something's on sale if you're a woman and you're a sale person
it's like oh it's on sale
let's go grab it you know
so uh and if you don't have the money then use a credit card
so i got rid of them credit cards
yeah i guess if that's if that's a weakness that's a good thing to do
i mean i didn't have like thousands of dollars you know and like that
just i just learned that that wasn't for me you know
so but i self-employed you know
so uh i keep
i just keep it in a notebook and write down what i've made and uh you know what it's going to have to go for that month
and you know it's not that not that hard not at all
well that's good to know
so i always do my own income tax you know
i don't understand the idea of paying somebody to to do it
all you got to do is read a book i mean read the little book they send you fill in the blanks and go
and a lot of them
i mean it seems absurd that people will pay you know some bucks just to get someone to
but i don't
so i don't mess with it
but i don't use a calculator either you know
i don't i don't have that mu- that many you know things to add up
i i don't trust myself with using a calculator or computer y- too much stuff like that because i want to make sure that that i i keep on top of the numbers and understand what's going on
and we have a
and and it seem
and they have a number that you can call in
and i always call in and like once every other week or so
and i will uh check off what checks have cleared
and i always check them off and you know check my balance and my book and you know because i always want to know exactly what i have you know
so what are what are your views on capital punishment
you know texas has one of the biggest criminal justice systems in the country
and it's eating us alive budget wise
so are they currently practicing capital punishment in your state
but the nature of the uh courts and the appeals and the stays and all that means that it's a very long haul before anybody's ever executed
and then i was reading in the paper just this morning it's interesting because i had forgotten i guess that i wrote this little topic down that it costs more to execute somebody th- than it does to keep them
because of all the costs of the appeals and all that you know
uh i guess in a way that it it kind of defeats the purpose of having capital punishment if
well i think capital punishment is supposed to be primarily a deterrent to other people
you know who would see it
but i'm not sure how successful that is
well i think it would be more successful if it was applied in a more expedient manner if there weren't so many appeals
if if the person who's going to commit the crime knew that they were going to be punished severely possibly capital punishment
what what kind of work do you do
uh i'm a research engineer
i work uh f- with georgia tech
um well see i'm a school principal
and in a very poor section of town with p- predominantly anglo kids
and i see kids already that are going to be criminals in spite of everything we can do
and see i'm afraid i think if we would take the equivalent amount of money and invest it in young people that
i mean course you couldn't do that because you got to do something with the ones that are already there but i think we would make a bigger investment in kids
um that's probably true
down the road you know
but i guess there's other factors that
but p- p- pumping more money into the school system is a good thing
but it's not going to
well i'm not talking about just in the school system
oh i see
see i'm talking about
like in in
uh i'm afraid i think that there are kids who just ought to be taken out of their homes and reared
uh i know the institutions don't work that well
but it's a bad day because
and i have the same thirty-seven in my office every day
and a lot of their parents are totally irresponsible
so that's a difficult situation
and you know you just see those kids going down the road
now not all of them will commit offenses that have to do with capital punishment
but some of them have already been in youth centers
and if we had something to do before they get to be full-blown adult criminals
and i'm not talking about necessarily in the school system
i think that's one reason we have problems in schools uh
and some of them are our problems
but a lot of it's because everything society wants we are supposed to do
but that's another subject
well that's probably true
anyway i dealt with two or three kids today that are going to end up where somebody has making a decision what to do with them
there's there's no easy solution for that
i don't i don't know that there is an easy solution
but if you could find a way to prevent some of it and i'm not sure what it would be
i don't i don't
i'm for it in in some cases
what kind of crimes would you d- use it for
uh premeditated murder
i i would consider it for sexual abuse of children on going
you know not one instance but perpetual abusers of children
well you always have castration
well you know somebody elected that recently
and all the civil rights people are up in arms about it you know
well um i used to work in a day care center
i worked in um in all the different areas of the day care center
i did not work there long because i couldn't handle the the treatment that the children got
and this is supposed to be a very well-known center here in tyler who had two or three um centers
all over you know the um city
and they would um be one way when the parents were there and be another way when the parents left
so um i think you need to make you know if you do do day care centers you know you should make frequent checks and um to check in on them when
because they do do things differently when you're not around
the things that we kind of looked at is is you want to see how many teachers you have
and and how many kids they have and how they break it up
because we had
it it was a really good one
and in fact it worked out for us because my wife we kind of bartered
and then you know so we got our day care free
but they didn't have enough teachers
well this one was set up good
i mean they had two teachers to every room um sometimes three
and they had a good system like so when you walked in everything looks cool
and the owner came and just chewed me up one side down the other
and i said no
this child was crying and needed some comfort you know
did did they separate them by age group
because i'd think you know i think that's one thing that was important
they did they had like um the the crawlers the babies that didn't walk in one room
then they had like the um three three year olds upper fours lower fours upper fives lower fives you know just like that
you know they really did separate them well
i- it sound
it sounds like to me your your concern would be to make sure that they are loving people
affectionate people that they're they're kind of par- may be parents themselves or something
but their but their system was was great
but um the you know
the one woman that taught that did the babies i worked with her
and she was fabulous
and she loved them and cared for them
but um every one of the others that i saw was just screaming and yelling and um you know would make me a nervous wreck
so you know
i i i think that's probably a really important thing because you can have doctorates and p h d's and all that kind of thing and you know know all the technical stuff
but if they don't reach out and touch the kids then that doesn't do any good
these kids are just in a day care center all day and uh with no any type of emotional you know getting love getting care
you know going through this routine
the other the other group that we had was kind of interesting
the other one we went to the it was a husband and wife team and we knew them from other associations
but uh it was kind of interesting because she was kind of the strict one
and i think you know she would she'd put her arm around the kids and talk to them and stuff you know
but he was actually the more um the more uh what demonstrative type
he would you know laugh with the kids and play with the kids
and and i- it was kind of interesting to see that that it was actually the man in the group that that did that side of it
so they had a really nice balance
but they also did they also did some of the teaching things
and then they had um you know
obedience obedience was important
and you know so they you know they used uh oh i think they used the
you probably heard where you know where you stand in front of the clock and get your power back to control yourself
that's that's a new one
and it's it's one
uh i can't remember what they call it actually
but y- you just stand them in front of a clock
and you know it has a second-hand that goes around
and they have to stand there
well do we
i mean it all depends really on what kind of bracket you're in
my tax bracket is is pretty high up there
i pay the i generally pay the maximum tax bracket
and uh i think that we're paying too much
because i don't have any children
and i pay a lot of property taxes
i don't have any um
it it you know
and um y- there's so many people who want a a dib of the federal money or the state money or whatever it is
and i just
sometimes many times i end up feeling like i'm paying too much in taxes
uh well no
i'm a student um
and i d- i work as a co-op at uh georgia tech research institute
and uh i'm going to get back most of what i earned i mean most of what i pay in taxes
and uh and uh
on- one of my parents is still claiming me
well when you when you go out into the uh when you go out into the working world it it changes quickly
um you look at your paycheck
and you go oh my gosh where did it all go
um what kind of what kind of
uh well have you pay a lot of in ta-
or are you did you go directly from high school into into college
well i did work um just very for some time
but i didn't make enough money to really
have you have you been active in in politics trying to concerning this
have you like worked on political action committees or something like that
i uh i haven't done any of that type of work myself
um but every once in a while when i hear up here at at uh in d c area um one of the radio stations has been talking about the the congress
and i guess it went defunct recently
and one of the congressmen has has written in the last three years al- about a thousand bad checks
and we we the taxpayers float him a loan for all tho- all those bad checks
and um it's causing quite a stir up here
um i i i think we pay too much
and i've i look at my paycheck
and i make
well let's see
and then they charge me sales tax
and they charge me gasoline taxes
and they charge me all these others
and it's just too expensive
i i'm just thankful that i don't get all the government that i pay for
do you have you used um student loans and things like that that were guaranteed by the government
uh i uh my father pays for my my schooling my tuition
so uh i'm i haven't made use of that
oh that sounds like a fun fun field
are you like in the particle particle research or
or is it more um applied physics
um i haven't i haven't gotten too terribly much into my major yet
so i guess you could call it more straight stuff than applied
well maybe maybe you can figure out how we can stop this inertia that's
are are is america i mean are we pretty pretty steep compared to most countries
um like like europe
but they do have socialized medicine and things like that
and um i know i was reading in the paper i believe yesterday that um they're talking
or maybe it was on the radi-
here in indiana we pay uh we pay county income tax state income tax
uh you name it they tax it
oh so y- y- you get the whole smorgasbord
well i i actually live in new hampshire tax free or die
but i'll bet that means your state sales tax is pretty high
so they they hit me up for the five percent there
well you know we
but uh the problem is that so i'm paying state tax even if i don't live here
but at least on things like stock options and things like that they don't tax me
so that's not too bad
i uh i really think that here in indiana at least we pay a a whole uh just too much tax
i worked in a factory uh last summer
and on the average i was losing twenty percent of every paycheck to taxes
and i don't feel that i really get a whole lot of return from that
i mean i don't utilize all you know it really any government welfare services
and i you know went to the schools and stuff
but i really feel that that i'm just getting overtaxed
oh i i mean i i'd consider twenty percent lucky because just on i mean you know when you figure out just on feds you know i actually hit the thirty-one bracket this year which was no fun
that's that's not any fun
and also you know then you figure out seven or eight percent for f i c a which is taxes where you
most people forget about them because you've g- you know you can't always get your f i c a back at the end of the year
but so you know and then you know like a five percent surtax i'm paying forty percent tax
and a lot of it
and if you look at the way the government is run these days it just seems like a lot of it's going to waste
well i i mean i think there's some people there y- certainly are some things where you need infrastructure
and you need you n- you know
there are things government does better you know
but you know i think you know you look at things like you know tax subsidies to tobacco farmers because jesse helms wants it that way
or you know and and just tremendous amounts of you know
so much of it is now just going to service debt or you know is going in into into programs that you know
they are they are a fat
you know i think the military is really fat
i think that a lot of the the h e w services although they're providing necessary services have too much fat in them
the- there is just way too much bureaucracy
you know like we
and so much of that tax money is going just to keep that bureaucracy running keep the paper shuffling around instead of real you know good programs
i mean we we spend a fortune for things like v a hospitals
and you know then you look at how well they're managed you know
i don't think we're getting our money's work out worth out of there
i think it's all going into into bureaucrats
and a lot of it's feeding that
just i just i really especially in the election year i mean i'm really thinking a lot
it seems like everything is really screwy right now as far as the economy uh the government goes and our our whole economy in general
and our taxes just are going to keep rising no matter what happens
and especially when you've got the bush administration who has increased government expenditures uh beyond what any other president since world war two has done
and yet he supposedly
well be- between him and reagan
oh oh yeah
i mean i just read something that two thirds or three quarters i'm not exactly sure of our national
and then they go and say i'm not c-
but you know the other thing is it's tricky though
because like in new hampshire they say oh all right let's cut the military budget
so you know it's like you know it's very tricky to balance that stuff off because then you hurt you know
if the if the if people lose their jobs then they become a load
and they're not contributing taxes
so you know it's it's very hard to say you know this is what we should cut
especially that defense cuts in the defense is really a catch twenty-two double whammy because like you say if you cut defense well that's great
but then you're going to have people on welfare
and they're not putting taxes in
so that's that's really
and uh in our
but what's very funny is in our town meeting they were v-
th- this this guy had both for our school district meeting and our town meeting had this proposal which unfortunately violates new hampshire constitution d- for our local town to do it to uh have you have people line item their taxes
i guess uh i can start
i'm actually we're actually trying to find one now because our family's growing
uh so i'm looking at uh something larger than what we have
we've got like an eighty-four charger that's about gone and a uh an eighty-nine horizon
so i'm looking for something uh littler bigger
uh so we were thinking mini van for a while
and uh we're looking at uh some just four door five passenger sedans as well
or you open to buying foreign cars
uh i don't really have a preference either way i guess
it's you know it
but i haven't had any real substantial problems with the ones i've had
and i really like it a lot
uh i think the japanese really build good cars and i know that kind of rubs against the grain right now in the whole uh you know buy american keep american auto workers working right now
but i feel that the japanese have really produced a much higher quality product than our uh car manufacturers have for a while
if i were to buy another car i would be uh i would be partial to buying another japanese car
but i would also look at american cars
but when i bought the car that i bought now i did that also
and i just felt that the japanese car was a much better product
so if i were
i mean e- even if it's just details it seems like uh they you know
there's a door seal that s- doesn't quite seal
and you have to take it back every once in a while
it's clearly just a a design problem there
uh i'm kind of
so i don't need a a mini van or such to uh
so i'm looking for more a a two passenger car that uh
oh like a miata or something like that
well i like the miata
but i don't like it enough to buy it
actually the the car that i really like right now is an eagle talon which is an american car
but uh something along that lines
uh because i have a an economy car right now which is okay
but uh i think i i'd like to move on to something a little better
i guess probably the factors we'd use to compare are a little different because i look for you know size and safety and then mileage
and i was looking for uh dependability and something that was going to last a long time i was g- that i would get a for the money that i was going to spend that i would get a return that was that was worth that money
i c- i think in terms of computer terminology i look at you know price performance and things like that
but it you know depends on what you what you pay initially
but you know i've got a hundred and twenty-five thousand miles on the charger
actually it was my wife's car that she brought into the marriage
and she got just a commute between cincinnati and dayton
it's you know
we we had to replace the friction plate and the transmission at thirty thousand miles
but uh the other ninety four thousand have been just fine
so but uh
uh i've had uh i've had one or two american cars i think
and and they were okay
and and i never had a problem with it
but uh my mother had a dodge at one point
and i i had driven it a few times
and i really did not feel that it that i would buy a dodge
well actually i had a uh a dodge omni at one point and that was i think what really prejudiced me against american cars was because i did not feel that it was a very quality uh car
so i guess you'd have to say if i was looking i would definitely be looking for a foreign car
it it's hard to beat some of the
uh like i guess in particular we're looking at a like a ninety-one corsica uh buy back at a they say g m sponsored auction
but i think they're obliged to have these things because hertz and avis and those folks have it in their contract that they can sell it back to g m after you know it's after they've used it for six months and put you know twelve or fifteen thousand miles
and you can get those for like eight thousand bucks if you
because i guess uh
i mean well ninety-two's granted but the new ones you know fourteen to sixteen is what they go for on the lot
so all the depreciation has been taken off
and s- the dealer comes out okay you know
i don't know what kind of i don't know what g m corporate kind of hit the i don't know what kind of hit they take on it
but sounds like everybody's had their chance to make their money off it
it's just you know
we can get a like a caravan for at twelve five but that's a little bit more than we want to spend right now
but uh uh it's interesting
but uh i don't know
if if uh it seems to be
well julie uh are you in a situation where you'd soon need to deal with uh special care for elderly
well i don't know
and he is still living by himself
but he doesn't want to to move away
and he recently had to have an operation
but he just really doesn't want to go to a nursing home
is he able to uh still do everything himself pretty well
well he was until this operation
and now i don't really think he's doing that well
and my a lot of my aunts and uncles live near him
and i have one aunt that really looks after him a lot
but uh my great-grandfather was put in a nursing home when he was a hundred and three
and uh died six weeks after they put him in the home
and i'm sure that kind of thing would influence your f- grandfather's feelings
and and for for i'm sure a lot of people going into a nursing home it's like saying my life is over
and i'm just here for the rest of the stay
and so i you know
yeah they have can look after a lot of things
but there's some of the day-to-day needs that they just are not able to deal with physically anymore
uh i know my none of my grandparents were in a nursing home
and they died
but they were all goodness younger than your grandparents
like they were in their eighties that type of thing
uh when i think nursing home i do think of people that are not able to do take care of themselves physically uh
but i just don't think that nursing homes really do a very good job
because i think what they often get used as is uh almost like a very high level or long-term care for uh similar to a hospital
and a level four type of care would be someone that really requires long-term hospital care generally are not able to look after this- themselves to very to a very great extent physically
but i don't i mean
at least i mean i think some nursing homes do that
but i think a lot of nursing homes really uh are guilty of neglect
i th- and i think it happens more in areas where it's uh
and and i guess that's sort of my lack of understanding
i think that a majority of the places in the u s uh you know there is some government aid available
but the majority of it is to the availability of the individual to pay
and uh if you're not able to look after yourself then you have to rely
recently graduated from high school meaning like uh you know three or four years ago
i'm a senior in in uh college now
and uh i can't really talk too much about
i feel that my uh
and i go to tech georgia tech
i want to as- talk to you about that afterward
the high school i went to was uh was a good one also
and i well i guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools
because the one i went to was you know i'm sure a a lot nicer than you know a lot of the inner city schools and the things around atlanta
it was a a it's a more or less a suburban school system
that that was true for mine too
uh although i
but i don't think i honestly don't think that's the biggest part of it
you know i think that uh i mean i know that in my town you know most of the most of the parents they're valued education
and uh you know and so the students were you know to some extent motivated to
i mean you know
and i'm also i mean in the in those places where uh like the economy is really bad they might you know be more tempted to to quit school and get jobs and that kind of thing because they need the you know money to put food on the table and stuff like that more than they would
now i think maybe it's started changing in the past few years because uh they have of these uh sort of mandatory
but uh certainly before that there were people that you know would graduate from high school and could barely read
uh and that's just sort of inexcusable
and you can't really
i i i mean i just can't even picture how that could happen
you know except maybe to someone whose you know really badly learning uh disabled or something
but these people obviously
that's hard for me to say since i didn't i didn't really grow
well when i went to elementary school it it wasn't in a great area
but i still i mean i learned to read started learning to read when i was in kindergarten you know
so i guess i can't really i can't say what it would be like to uh grow up in a really oppressed region
you know i guess the whole the whole environment and attitude towards school and learning is different for the people
and i think that's almost a bigger factor
i mean i don't i think you know people just
so i guess the problem is the the thing to do is to try to uh to get some kind of motivation to learn
and again i don't i mean
they got to know the you know how qualified i mean
i think it'd be interesting to you know to spend a couple of days just looking around an inner city school uh you know sort sort of maybe from elementary through uh high school
you know just sort of to get a feel for what it's like
but uh i haven't done that
i i can't say that i have either
but i do i do think that uh i mean public education in general i think can work
and i think it's a good thing
i've i've heard some i mean i've heard sta- sta- statistics and things that that compare a public education to a private education i mean within like within the
if you compare the like the people that could have that could have sent their kids to private schools and the people that you know the people that uh did send their kids to private schools
i think they compare fair- you know fairly well
i mean i don't i honestly don't really think i could have you know done much better than i did in the school system i was in
i i i my schools i mean there
once once it seemed i got into high school they had a lot of uh accelerated programs and all kinds of stuff like that
that i mean that makes a big difference
cause i wondered when they're taking classes with uh with people that are really are interested in the the subject and stuff like that
i mean and and in the
i guess it wa- in junior high it was still three
then in high school it changed into four levels of uh of instruction in the major subjects
i mean actually i think that works pretty well
and that that makes
well i- i i i feel like uh i am from mars
i mean i'm fifty years old
and uh i've been divorced for um eighteen years
but i've two kids and all
but i uh i i've never had a budget
and i don't uh do any planning
and i don't know
i don't uh uh i don't have a long-term financial plan
but i'm i'm glad you're a stranger
but really i'm i happy i i well i'm curious how other people live
uh so maybe we should start with you
and uh we live from hand to mouth
and they worked
but i'm not disciplined enough
the best program we ever had is at the beginning of the month we took and uh took my check and divided it out into envelopes and then paid for the expenses out of that envelope
and when the envelope was empty
and that worked out real well cause we didn't have to keep writing down what we'd spent
and we did that pretty successfully for about three months
and then we started
and in about two months we were back to doing the same thing we always do
huh the uh
i had a part-time job around oh gosh fifteen years ago seventy-six
and uh uh this was a sort of a career shift at the time
and so i was willing to take a half time job to do that
and i actually did
my bank account would uh
i'd i i kept bouncing checks just at the end of the month
but i i had miscalculated
i well i didn't keep a balance
but when you're only earning half the salary even though i wasn't spending much money i sometimes i sometimes would just
uh and sometimes what i would do is keep a piece of paper in my wallet
and every time i uh i spent money i mean cash mostly i would uh write it down so i could see at the end of a month how much i spent on food so i could do better planning
but i would forget to write the things down
and it that i i don't know if i ever went as far as three months or not
i even find now like with the automatic tellers i'll go take money out of that and then i forget to take that
so i i i leave a little bit of a slush fund in my checking account and i figure that so the balance showing in the checking account is always somewhat different that what's really there
and i figure that gives me room for the mistakes i make
i i- i have to say that
uh and it uh
a- and i don't i mean
and i i i think my strategy if if i may i- i- is to is to not spend money
i mean i don't have expensive tastes
i mean i buy a car
well the last car i got rid of i'd had
pe- people were embarrassed for me
i mean it was it was a good car
oh it was great
my my mechanics loved it because it was an old it was a sixty-five buick
and it just wouldn't stop
uh and it
i i just didn't feel the need for a new car
uh and now i mean i i don't uh
i mean i don't mind buying a good steak
but for me i only do that every week or without even
i mean maybe once a month
i mean you buy a a tenderloin steak it costs outrageous like twelve dollars a pound
you buy a a less than half a pound so it's six or seven dollars
but but i'm just i'm just saying as a single person that's that's a drop in the bucket
and so if you're extravagant on how you buy food it doesn't add up if you're buying i mean if you're not going to super expensive restaurants which i don't care to go to
so so that's i think one of the reasons i don't need to budget is that i don't have i don't i don't have to hold myself back from buying that expensive thing because i can't afford it because i'm not interested in that expensive thing
uh one of the things they talked about was uh did we d- wh- what do we think about a judge making the decision
and i really don't agree with that
i think that the trial by jury is better uh you know than e- having a
yo- you know what i mean
there's there th- this topic is kind of mute uh there there's no way
we we couldn't survive in a sy- in a juror syst- in a trial system without a jury
uh one man can never be one man one woman can never be objectionable in every case
uh every person has their opinions
and that's why jury selection is often very difficult uh
well i i feel the other thing too uh
they were saying uh you know what new ways could y- could it you you know change the system
i i really think that uh we spend a lot of time uh going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal
i mean i- if you go to a trial by jury and especially if a person has confessed if they have been caught you know point blank in the crime
there's uh no question
you know all these things
i mean you know
and it can go on for ten twenty
i i think this is a little ridiculous
oh that's right
i i'm serious
and i think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems tha- that exist in the s- in the criminal system today with plea bargaining
you know if someone is ill
well plea bar- plea bargaining is a different story
that that actually prevents trials or at least speeds them up
well i know
but i think a lot of all of the whole criminal system is messed up in in that regard
i mean you know people who commit uh crimes that they
but you know they get lesser sentences
and i understand that the jails are full of people you know uh and that they have to do something
but i think that the reason they are full is because they know that they can get away with it
yo- you know what i'm saying
that w- we don't have uh well a lot of states don't have capital punishment
and uh i i think they should
i and i think if a person is guilty of taking someone's life and like you say it's it's there's no doubt whatsoever like drunk drivers that kill people
and uh you know all they they're caught dead to rights
i i just think that that's they've they've taken a life
and if they should pay for it with their life
when you're saying as far as the appeal uh procedure was concerned
i'm i'm sure you've probably heard of marion berry
uh his f- last appeal was was denied two days before his sentence was up
so i mean his appeal was denied
and two days later he got out of jail
i know that that
there is never there was no reason the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence
and i don't know
uh what would you do to change it to make it better
well uh the the only i can i wa- you know
uh a- like i said as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence that's absurd
i i i don't agree with that at all
i mean burned out
there's there's no possible way that you could uh you know feel good about yourself
i i feel that everyone is everyone is uh entitled to a trial by jury
that that that right s-
i mean supposing i come up to you and i just point blank kill you
well i mean were there witnesses
in other words you're saying that w- you have to find out whether it's premeditated or what the circumstances were
that you can't you can't remove the jury regardless of the case
i mean you could have fifty people in audience watching
and you you'd still there's still mitigating circumstances
well i i
um the uh the latest one i've seen uh had to do with a uh uh the uh basically a manhunt um
and it was uh it was called manhunter actually
uh the uh the guy uh apparently had a a mental disfunction in which he needed to go out and just slay people uh just uh kill them with with as much blood and and guts as possible
oh how awful
but uh uh it it did show some some uh some interesting things about the f b i
because they were the the uh the characters trying trying to get him were f b i people
and uh uh of the of the few good things that were in it it did show uh a lot about the f b i about the training and and how they go through training and how they try to to develop uh uh a mental picture of who they're looking for before they go out and do it and all the different ways they go about doing that
and it was uh uh it was pretty telling about the the the f b i and their procedures
i i imagine a lot of it had to be fictional just to keep the f b i uh going i guess
well they keep it rather secretive
well the most recent movie i saw uh i'm afraid was uh
well two two of them actually
uh the rain man was one
oh that was great one
oh i loved it
and and driving miss daisy
you know i haven't seen that one yet
and i need to go see it
oh you need to see that
and this all took place in the south
and uh normally never the twain shall meet
and um uh it it really was a fantastic movie
well as it as i recall it got some academy awards didn't it
it it might have one best picture too
just as rain man uh with dustin hoffman
uh that that was tremendous and tom cruise
i i think it was more a lesson for tom cruise than anything else in terms of uh of how to act from dustin hoffman
uh oh that was that was uh what the much of the hype was that tom cruise learned so much from dustin hoffman
it must have been great just being with him on on a daily basis and seeing how he prepares for his for his lines and all that stuff
and a good bit of that was filmed right in cincinnati
which is just forty-five miles from from where i am where i actually live in a suburb of dayton
is is the kmart there
that was that was so funny
or was it kmart
the the i guess the the first the first uh scene in that movie that really got my attention uh concerning the the disease and all that was when he uh dropped the the uh the toothpicks
and he was able to count the number of toothpicks just by a mental image
well you know there are people uh referred to as savants also
uh who can do most phenomenal things
and everyone feels they are totally retarded
wel- because that's the way they they might seem outwardly
but boy there's a lots going on in there
and i the the i think the the best thing about rainman was the uh the way that they put together the the real awfulness of the of the of the disease
an and then they balanced it with the wonderfulness of it you know
and and and you need to to work with it uh you know certainly on on a daily basis but then ag- then again work with it toward a good end
not not toward winning in las vegas for example
well the warmth that developed between them
and again it i think was a picture of relationships
again the relationship uh between the two uh that uh never would have occurred uh by accident
i was uh i was so impressed with that movie
i can i can se- tell you oh so much about that movie just because it it really rang uh rang a lot of my uh my personal background
i i have a a brother myself that's that's older
and uh he's not you know
nothing nothing of course serious is wrong with him
but uh but we have gone through these these lapses of of a relationship
and then you know uh for for for no real you know direct reason i guess uh we we get into uh uh a really good relationship for a while and then you know back and forth
so i i was really able to to relate to the the relationship aspect of the movie between the brothers
well that's tremendous
that it's good because it does make you think about your own family
and see it did bring out a lot of thoughts between you and your brother
he the he was he's one of these guys though that doesn't really like to go see movies like that
and and uh it it was like pulling teeth to go get him to to see it
but uh oh boy he was uh uh he he gave the the best response that i've heard him give of this type of movie for rain man
i mean he certainly didn't
and he didn't go back for more
but uh he he said he enjoyed it
well he at least saw it one time
and and he really
he he's kind of a dustin hoffman fan anyway
but he wa- but before he saw the movie he was like disappointed that dustin hoffman would do this
i'm like oh come on
he will do that to research it and to be able to mimic a person uh uh with the kinds of problems that he had
i mean i was i was believing it
but i was it was great
well i'm sure everybody that saw it was believing it right along with them
well it's just uh been delightful talking with you
and uh let's hear it for the summertime
but they're predicting some more snow for our direction
oh well take care
and i subscribe to the paper on the weekends
where where are you
i take the paper every day and i read it on the way in to work on the in a carpool
and uh and i watch the uh actually i watch the morning news before i leave for work
and then you know usually over lunch there'll be a big topic of conversation on something from the news
i normally find that uh i- i'm probably the most um news hungry of my friends
so i don't we don't normally talk about the news at lunch
i i find that i have to only subscribe to the paper on the weekend simply because i used to get it during the week but um i would always end up arriving at work late because i would always end up skimming the headlines spending too much time
so i have to cut myself down to the weekend plus after work
um the macneil lehrer news hour is on public television and i enjoy that quite a bit
um one of the women that i work with her husband is iranian
so here lately with all the middle eastern news we've had some very interesting conversations over lunch
i will admit i work with uh someone who's iranian
and he definitely has a very different slant on the news
and i will admit i'm reasonably skeptical also
but he's i don't know uh he's mu- much much more so
it's sort of interesting though because he does bring a a much um different perspective with all the gulf goings on um
he was always speaking in terms of you know american imperialism reasserting itself
um i suppose it's a different attitude that we normally don't hear in the country
well i i uh i like the print news much better than the television news because television news tends to sensationalize
sort of like the uh what is that a b c's nightline
well i guess they only normally stick with just the one um story
but they they can do a much better job since they don't have to chop it into little two minute stories
they don't report on every murder and shooting that happened in in every little town
a lot of times they end up um with these panels of experts
and they go back and forth where everyone's giving some opinions
and sometimes that
i don't know the value of that because i saw plenty of jokes and and um oh editorial cartoons about all the retired generals
i- i'm only twenty-five
so i've never actually been through a period of war and i don't know anyone in the military
and i don't have a lot of background knowledge in uh military strategy and and weaponry and and all that kind of stuff
and i thought the generals were very interesting
now when they started to speculate i i saw that for what is was
but i thought the- the- they were interesting
and and they shed some light on what was going on for me
i- i- i'm twenty-six
so i don't have any more experience in that than you
um it it it was very interesting that it seemed like some of the commentators had their axe to grind you know
and they seemed to mold the events to their view of the world which i suppose just about everyone does
but these guys had a a uh national soap box to stand on and and express this view
you know one of the best television news shows that i saw during the war was a show on a saturday morning on a b c
and it was for children and it was hosted by peter jennings
and it was so interesting because they were relating the war to these children in their studio
and they also had children calling in live from all over the country and asking questions
and they they had all their correspondents in the different areas in saudi arabia and israel and and all
they had them all uh on
they had them all on hold and if a child asked a question that the person in jerusalem could best answer they would cut to that person
and that person would answer the question
and uh i was real impressed at how a b c handled uh translating
i didn't see anything like that although i did uh
but there was a a a big push with the local t v stations to have little hot lines with counselors to to help parents learn how to talk about their war with their children
and our local h e b stores here
but they have videos that uh
but they were free rental
uh it was
it was something for children that they they had several advertisements on television pushing parents going and uh getting the video and watching it with their children and discussing it and that kind of thing
again not having uh lived through another war i don't know if that's a common thing that people thought of
or if that was a new concern with people
well back during the viet nam conflict that no one will will have the guts enough to call a real war uh the that type of technology just wasn't at people's disposal
so i don't think there's ever been a war that's been so thoroughly covered by the news
and they would run these extended two three hour versions of the program and i i was just i was horrified and fascinated
the uh the war start-
must have been thursday uh
and friday night i was i stayed up until two o'clock in the morning sitting right dead center in front of my television just watching practically with my mouth hanging open
because i was watching c n n
and they would they would switch back to one of their israel bureaus
and the people would be standing there in gas masks
and you'd be hearing the sirens
and it was just
i i didn't have that experience
i i don't have cable so i i'm pretty much limited to p b s which i thought i thought they did a very good job
um i've got one question for you
um i i found the newspaper situation in dallas very interesting
we've got the one fairly well relatively weaker paper the times herald and then the morning news which has a very strong subscription
or do you have several
and they're pretty close
uh the one that i picked is more similar in format to the newspaper
i grew up near houston and there are two major newspapers there that run pretty much neck and neck
and the one i picked here had the same format as the one that my parents took as i was growing up i mean the same type of typeface on the headline and that kind of stuff
and i enjoy
and the other one has some weird ones that i've never heard of
i i actually take both newspapers on the weekends
and i can afford that
i i find the news reporting in the morning news to be better
but i sort of have a liberal political slant
and the morning news just has an incredibly conservative editorial um outlook
and my my fiancee takes probably six sunday papers
but he's a football coach at southwest texas state university
so he's getting all the sports sections
and so you know he has these stacks of sunday newspapers that go unread
i know that they uh have capital punishment for certain crimes
and that's probably the way i feel about it is
my belief all my life i guess has been that
but i don't
uh uh i tend to agree with you uh you know
because uh you know i i do also myself believe in capital punishment uh
if it's premeditated or if it's uh
that's that's kind of the way i feel
if if you've got a guy who's
he's not going to get any better you know
it's it's not going to
and and the only thing
a lot of people have the opinion that you know don't don't have capital punishment
but give them life in jail
and you know i could go along with that if if i could be assured that it would be their natural life in jail and not parole after ten
and they wind up
it's it's just
but the you know the the problem is not
i mean because the the cops are out there doing their job enforcing the laws
and the prison system are just you know
a lot of people don't think it would be a deterrent uh to to future crime
and the way it is now it's not
because you know you
the state of texas for example may uh you know may execute somebody twice a year
you know that's that's no kind of deterrent because we we've got literally hundreds of people on death row and and many of them who have been there for literally for ten or fifteen years on death row
and that's that's certainly no kind of deterrent
and i would tend to agree with anybody who says right now that it it's not a terrent a deterrent because it's not
you think of your chances of getting the death penalty after cre- uh committing a crime
and you can
and that's where a lot of aggravation comes i think is is uh these guys spend so much time
and you know the last i heard it was costing ten twenty thirty thousand dollars a year
it it's amazing
there's uh there's a girl i work with our secretary as a matter of fact
her her father was murdered her father and three other guys up here in sherman
and the uh the guy that they tried and convicted and sentenced him to death you know he's been on death row for like eight years
and you know this this was her father uh you know that that got killed you know just cold-blooded murder him and three other people
and but still
and the state still can't bring itself to to ex- execute
to yeah to carry it out
it really does you know
she and they have to go back uh
occasionally you know she has to write letters to the parole board and you know lawyers
and just just ever so often she mentions well she's got to do something else you know write another letter
you know she should be getting on with her life you know getting getting that part behind her
but yet it's it's kind of tied to her the way it is now
and she winds up being a a victim
not only of
it's just it's it's ridiculous
she she's an emotional victim
it it's terrible you know
and you know the like you say the cops that are out doing the work
oh man i i couldn't be a cop for that for that very reason you know because they do
the the criminal gets right back out
and you know the cop's just got to go back and and do his thing all over again because so many of the crimes are are done by repeat offenders
so unless you've got something else well
well it's an older home
well for the neighborhood i'm in
and uh i live in the basic three bedroom two bath home
so at least i have two bathrooms
but uh it's pretty typical for the area as well
uh i've always been interested in older homes personally
so i think you can end up doing more with them it seems like
do you have lot of a big lot or anything like that
oh i see
oh that's nice
because i have just like a very small you know those basic tract houses like that
and um i do have garden
but it's extremely small
but uh it seems like though for your area that that is sort of different
well in the uh newer neighborhoods and development communities the houses are so close together
we have uh one thing we have that we really enjoy here is we have a hot tub in the back
so we have we have quite a few parties
and uh seems like everyone that lives around us ends up you know hearing every conversation that goes on outside with everyone
so uh that's true
but uh you know it's fine for now
you know it's very difficult to arrange furniture and things like that
because it seems like then that they built the homes much larger
and they've got better closet space
at least we do have like three walk-in closets here
so that's that's maybe not so typical
and then you get those visa bills in
so anyway um anything else about the area about um
you know can you compare yourself to any thing around there
so it's it's
i mean i got probably the biggest
but you know too the only bad thing too is that then you have to keep up you know
well i i enjoy that though
you must have more time than than i have
and i'm looking at the yard and seeing how tall the grass has gotten
now that's that's
i almost wish i was in an apartment or something you know
well um i don't know do we just terminate this or do you have to talk for a certain amount of time
well can you tell me anything else about the house
i mean do people around that area seem to do a lot of renovation
that's that's nice
the town that i came from is uh is a uh older town
the typical the typical homes there are like you know early nineteen hundreds late eighteen hundreds
and i renovated a house there
and that was so much fun
i mean there if you don't live in a house that's at least seventy-five to hundred years old you know you're just nobody practically
and that was really that was a good experience for me to learn a lot of discipline
and uh was considered typical for that area
so uh it was quite a change for me to come to a house like that now that's just you know a very square little box
and you know there's not a whole lot you can do with it
but uh anyway
well i have lived in a small town for you know
this this town was like less than ten thousand people
and it was about sixty miles south of dallas
and you know i didn't move out of there until i was you know twenty-seven
and that was just you know
so i love the big city
you know i had lived in a rural area for for so long
so i've enjoyed it
but uh it can it can get kind of tough
i don't i don't want to be a part of the rat race
but i haven't planted anything yet
or you know i usually have gotten flowers coming out the gazoo
but i i haven't done that yet
you know i'm just kind of trying to trying to stick in with that
but uh since that's over with now maybe i can i can get this yard in shape
uh landscaping is more than the gardening
i do plant a lot of beans because it seems like the uh bugs get on them so easily
and i have a real problem with anything like pesticides or anything like that
so the only thing that i use is soap
i water you know spray the plants because they say supposedly that will keep the bugs off them
but uh i don't have luck with that tomato plant
so i hate to spray them with anything
um what do you do
um my favorite one is putting on the um tomato plant is to put uh dust
and that stuff has been around since the beginning of time
so i've heard him talk about that forever
but um you have to really wash your vegetables after that
so it won't make you sick
well i've done some rewiring on it
do you plan on like adding any rooms or
or is it
do you not like have a half bath
and that was even just with two people
well do you have any children
and they enjoy where they're living
oh so he doesn't know right
and i turned out okay
so don't worry about it
so you think that you want to move away from the big city uh
well that's what i've always
you want to go back to that uh
after we got married we moved ended up moving to the houston area
so are you from texas
so it's not you know
um you say you watch evenings mostly
and then sometimes oprah and sometimes donahue
but now it's mainly evenings
oh two they're going to change
well one they're taking
but that's kind of young for us
oh well well
so we don't watch uh that type of show
but we like l a law
i'm surprised that i was surprised at the ending of you know with all the funny things happening
i just wonder if if uh they just want to go on to other projects and not be stuck in this show since it's gone on for so long
it looks like it looks like it might be one of these seven or eight year run things
so do you do you mostly like this type of like a story type of thing that lasts an hour
oh i don't usually like stuff that continues
that's why i'm surprised i like those two shows because usually i like you know stuff that just ends sort of that you just you don't have to
have watched you know
i mean you don't have to
you know i usually don't like that
we we do that sometimes
i i guess i'm i'm not into real heavy stuff
i i'll mostly i'm into it for relaxation
so i like things like golden girls or cheers
or uh monday night is real good with me you know major dad and and uh northern exposure and and uh
oh what's that one with burt reynolds
that type of show is what we what uh we watch
we generally just stay on one channel all for all of monday night just to watch those
but mostly they're just little vignettes
that is it's it's really funny
they use like animated
it's not like a cartoon
but it's like dummies and things
and uh it's really um
but there's always a a moral to each story
and what night is it on
well yo- we watched it
the times we've seen it it's been like on satur- or excuse me friday night
uh but it's
but it it's real
the first one we saw um they were it it involved a tradition of when a per- person reaches seventy-five
and i can't remember what day they call it
but but uh the son-in-laws get to throw the mother-in-laws when they're seventy five over a cliff
and the son-in-law and mother-in-law are sniping at each other and all
and then when it comes time for him to throw her over well the the teenaged son the night before tried to save her by hiding her
and she said no
you can't do you know
he ran her out was running to hi- in a wheelchair to hide her
and she said you can't do that
this is what old people are supposed to be thrown over the the cliff
and uh he said i don't understand
it's it's real funny that they give the teenagers the as the one that questions uh the what's going on
and uh in the end of uh the son-in-law when he did get the mother-in-law up to the cliff uh th- the so- the teenaged son throws himself in the way and says no you can't do it and then and then uh oh well we've got to do it it's tradition
and the son was you know why
in in the end he doesn't throw her over
oh he doesn't
and of course the town thinks he's just terrible because that has been tradition for hundreds of years and he's broken it
and then we saw one where this there was a teenage when a teenage boy comes into his manhood
and they all go out and howl you know
and and the son refused to do it
he he did
so he didn't go howl
so all the all the people that worked with the father ostracized him
oh how funny
it it it's it's real interesting to watch the show
and and wh- the relationship between the family is is really now now the mother-in-law lives in the house with them
our our grandson our oldest grandson is the one that that got us to watching it
but it really is it moves real fast
it's a real short
and there's always like i say a moral to it
or is it hour
well half hour
that that's all there is to it
and and uh they
it it they they're trying to liken the the father in there of the teenage son to like jackie gleason show
uh the way he talks to his mother-in-law and so forth
and i guess maybe there are some parts of that
but i didn't really see that in there
but what i've read about it they talk about that
but anyway we've we've enjoyed that
and and uh i guess mostly i i like the news shows too the news magazines like sixty minutes or twenty
twenty or prime time live or something like that you know all all of those shows if i can do it
but my husband likes to watch um old movies especially war movies or or uh sports which i'm not
oh see i like sports
well i i do i like ice skating
and i like uh gymnastics
but i i
and i'll watch snippets of baseball games
and i i just don't have that much time to sit and watch the whole thing
and i don't ever no matter what's on i don't ever just sit and watch t v
i'm usually either doing dishes
or i may be sewing
or you know
i always have or letter writing
or i may be working around in the room somehow
but i don't i don't ever just sit and
i that's something that comes from your old age you know
it's it's uh
i mean i
but before that i really there's not much time
or like at six thirty i'll watch wheel of fortune or something like that
if our gra- if our grandchildren are with us that's they have to watch that
it's it's um oh
and you know the the kids will get you started on stuff like america's funniest home videos
he's he's he wouldn't let us pull it
and i mean it it got to the point he was eating a pear here
and he bit into it
and it was just hanging by a thread
and i and i'd tell him you know it's getting ready to fall out
and he walked around the house with his fa- face down toward the floor and his mouth open hoping it would fall out because he wouldn't let anybody pull it
and he wou-
so do you have p c
and i can transfer data back and forth between the p c and the main frame
um well i sort of own a computer
but neither one do we really own um
um i actually i'm doing consulting right now because i just had a baby
and my husband's working at bell labs
but he's really from france
and these computers actually are from france
um well i actually do some work working at m i t and at nist national institute of standards and technology in washington
and then i worked for dragon systems for a while
um well it depends
and i work in the speech field
and i do a lot metacoustic phonetics and looking at the acoustic characteristics of speech
and i do that type of stuff typically for other people
and we like here we use the p c to do that
well more uh
wo- word text processing
so i don't i don't use i mean
but i don't usually use a word processor to do it and we don't have too much standard software
like i haven't bought we haven't really bought any commercially available software at all
so we don't use it for things like our accounts and addresses and things like that
we use it more for just writing programs when we need to or um doing research looking at the speech signal and then doing writing and also as a
and we connect to other computers to read our net mail and things like that
so you've got you've got a modem in it then
uh neither one has a modem
but we have a modem
uh and so it's an external modem
i got when i got mine i had an internal modem in it i used it uh quite a bit when i was uh uh looking at uh information on a large bulletin board sponsored by a newspaper in a in fort worth but uh went out of town for a while
and and sort of got off the uh bulletin board and off of my micro completely and after a while the modem started making noises on its own without uh even without using it on the computer
so i finally
oh i didn't hear it
do you hear the the beep in the background
oh that's a an ambulance or something going on here i think
where where are you
so you've got a lot of traffic noise real close
so it'd be interesting for the people that look at this signal
so it'll be interesting how much of it actually gets picked up
and often times that
i can't talk on th- can't do this much later than now between sort of like six five thirty and six thirty or something like that because the traffic outside they honk the horn so loud i can't even hear the phone call
uh about twenty after four
so you're an hour ahead of where i am
i'm in central central time zone
and um what did did you ever try using like prodigy or any of those systems
uh i know someone who has
and and she's uh very uh pleased with it
and you can do a l-
you can save a lot of money too certainly cut down on long distance charges if you if that's what you have in mind
have you did you use commercially available software
i have i have used lotus
i have used uh word perfect uh i
i've used uh d base
and uh i've used a substantial amount of shareware
um i haven't done much lotus work connected with my job
i've been through three classes and i have a great deal of respect for it
um i haven't done much
i do some and i
and the d base work i've done was
but i've heard both good things and bad things about it
well it's probably the granddaddy of most uh data base management systems
so i i think by now it's a matter of uh personal taste
i've used i've had a class on um r base and also in paradox and both of those seem very easy to use compared to d base
do you think you d base is more flexible or allows you to do more
or do you think the others are pretty much compatible these days
um i wouldn't say compatible but certainly comparable
but uh yeah
and what do you work on at t i
i do uh main- mainly business data processing
um sometimes i get called late at night at home because there's a production problem
and that gives me the opportunity to uh come in to work and fix it if i can't think of some thing to tell the trouble shooter while we're on the phone
um i also uh handle most of the calls from our users and other programmers who need to find out something connected
um well i guess first of all i i could have asked that before
um what do you think about the proposal that all young americans should spend a year or two
i think everybody should should uh put in their time so to speak for the for the good of the the nation and for the good of themselves
because i i didn't know if that would make a difference yeah
i think it's uh
would every- everyone grow up and mature and and realize what this country's all about
i just um
i guess that's my that's something that my family has always believed strongly in
and uh i had opportunities in high school
to work in some programs um and and i agree with what you said that it's uh
and i uh
and uh it gives you a little bit uh more a glimpse of the the real world
and and it would certainly help the country too uh
i think that's probably like uh quite a few things that that the kids uh maybe not so much nowadays but used to go through you know
they just they were they did things for people
you know for their communities for their their uh families for their friends where now i'm not sure they really do
well i think sometimes through groups and organizations um
my first when i first thought of it i thought it uh when they asked the question i thought well that sounds wonderful
and then i wondered if people were unwilling
but but i think even if you went in with a negative attitude i don't think it would stay negative very long
um but i do know through some organized groups like scouts and church um they
but i i think that's a small uh number could
but even even through those groups do you think that they participate as much as maybe they used to
um not since um
and that was something uh i think in the fifties and sixties um
i think it's probably more true still in the in the smaller communities then in the larger cities
where uh where abouts do you live
well i live in richardson right now which is just
so we're not far apart
one of the calls i'd gotten before was uh down to austin
and and i know a friend of mine talked to someone in the midwest
so i know there is the possibility that it could be out of the area
but you're right
and uh i think it was just
of course it was back in the in the fifties
and i think it was real prevalent back then
i i think people thought more of others than they do now
you know as far as doing things for them and and then gaining benefits from it
and maybe uh maybe this would be a way to get that feeling back um if we've lost some of that
and it it seems in the last decade or two um that's true
if if young people had to do it um maybe that would start the trend back because that's one of the things i always
i i don't know how young you'd have to go
but i think by the time they're oh early teenagers anyway i think it's too late now at least around here
i think uh
they're um things even just starting around the home
and and just watching the parents do things too um it can start a pattern
and then that helps develop that attitude
um i guess i would really like to see this happen with families more
you know i think this is certainly a possible way um to handle it
but i wish
and i think that's a good place to start again
i think it has to start in the families first because if you don't do it for for your own immediate family you're sure not going to do it for anybody else
and i do think um the schools
and uh sometimes what richardson and plano both
i mean when you live in areas like that where there's so much they don't realize what a small percentage of the world that is
i mean that's uh
and uh it's
i know our church youth group uh starts with projects young
but they have a high school group that works in the appalachia area every year
oh that's great
um and it is it's uh
and they've also see that there's there's a different way of life and those families are really close
that we talked about that were common in the fifties are still there and uh
and it's changed their perspective
and and that's just the t- two weeks during during the summer
well that's that's great
so if two weeks uh could have that kind of effect i would think uh
i'm glad that there are still some areas that that get the youth involved in that sort of thing
e- even a small amount of exposure can make a vast difference in their attitudes
well i guess um
well i enjoyed talking with you
well good talking with you
and i hope you have a good evening
do you have you ever had to put your children in child care mary dell
and i had private care for both my daughters until they were two
and then i was really lucky to have put them in a
and it was a wonderful environment
i i just wish all kids if they have to be put in day school could have that kind of place
so it worked well
well i have uh a nine year old and a six year old
and neither one of them has ever been in in uh day care for the reason of of me working but uh they both went through preschool
like half day programs
so many of the churches have really strong preschool and children's day out but it was a nightmare back when cheryl was little
and this is one of the few churches that did it
but they were so seemed
and what i liked about preston hollow is that the people that were there when cheryl was two which was fifteen years ago many of them are still there today
and these people that had changed her diapers when she was three were still there
oh my gosh
so it it was really neat
but it was because they had a director that had always done it as a labor of love
oh my goodness
and she just kept good people and real cheerful place lots of arts and crafts
and i'm really glad my kids had it because plano schools do so little of that
that is uh a big drawback i think in that in the uh public schools out here
you know to
and if you do
or pay for it after school
and they started a pilot program where we can pay private tuition so that they can take french and music and art
oh is that right
and you know i willingly did it
but i thought
oh my goodness
and with our budget cuts i'm sure that's not going to
well that's the only way they're yeah well that's the only way they're going to be able to do it
and parents who really want their kids to have any humanities are going to have to do that
oh my goodness
so in some ways i think the the day schools do serve those purposes
well even the preschools you know they get so much of that in preschool
and then when they hit kindergarten you know it's like wham
get the computers out and you know
so you were able to have somebody come there
and that was hard too
i i lucked out with really good people both times
but i know so many people that are never able to find that
and i'd practically give my paycheck away to do it
or did you have someone that lived in with you
uh the first one was an
elderly lady who was putting a a daughter through nursing school just purely on baby-sitting money
oh my goodness
and she kept cheryl during the day and then did more baby-sitting at night
and she was neat
so that that was a plus from that respect as well
and then with emily it was a neighborhood friend that kept her
i have uh
oh well i guess it was on the home show
but they were talking about uh
oh i can't even think of the name of it
um it's some kind of advisory board they've put together for parents and children
and the the doctor that was on there the pediatrician said you know i can't imagine leaving a three week old and taking them to a nursery day-care and leaving them there
oh that would be hard
you know so um
well they give a lot more leave
and our benefits for maternal and and parental care and even for elderly people are are really expanding
we have more options now then we did when i my kids were born
oh boy that's great
with being able to take off full-time longer of you can phase your schedule in so that it's not full-time for up to six months
i've i've had a couple of assistants that came back just three days a week
or they've you know
and that helps because you don't have to just wean yourself cold turkey and say okay i never get to see my baby for eight hours a day again
and the bank has a lot of programs now for child care referrals
but i think we're finally beginning to make progress but just not very fast
well and i would think you know since big business is supposedly why the government makes the decisions they do you know the the people that work in big business have families they have children
so it's only to their advantage that they get these programs going and working
that's that was the rationale they gave when they were giving us information about our employee assistance programs that they want us to be happy and want us to be able to cope with trying to split ourselves in fifteen million pieces
so i i hope it helps
oh that's good
because that's hard
have have found the uh you know a pri- a private home to take their children to when they're young until they hit the preschool age
usually you know you'll find a a woman that's keeping like six children or four to six children in the home
and my future future sister-in-law's mother does that too full-time
well in plano though the problem is you find
and this is what i found with emily
i from the time she started first grade i wanted her out in plano area
and i kept finding
and they'd move
and i finally decided
so this year i i tried kinder-care
well let's see
well we keep our paper paper bags lined up in the garage for glass and glass and uh plastics
and uh we make the dump over to the wal-mart bins there as soon as they're full
i guess we collect m- milk cartons and whatever p- other plastics are acceptable
are you in the part of town where uh they have gotten into the other containers yet for recycling
well maybe they don't
i i know that was supposed to be in may
and i couldn't tell whether some parts of town had started it or if it was just everybody was
so i i thought that it all had all been delayed several times
so i have no idea what they look like
and i'm kind of anxious to see them
th- that's going to be interesting because it's uh we've gotten so convenient and conventional in trash disposal which is
and i say well they work fine
and i keep mine outside the garage so that i don't have any odors
but it's clearly a place where uh uh
and i am i'm glad the community is doing it
uh it's one of those things that kind of has to be forced on people
uh i don't know if where you grew up in your what you saw back uh years ago
but for me the thing that strikes me is i uh growing up in rural south dakota where hey the farmers brought their eggs to town and the local hatchery would candle them and package them is that uh in the fifties uh you could say we had the recycling going on then that we should have now
and you got a nickel or dime which in that time was a lot of money when you returned them
oh of course
you know actually we had milk delivered to our house in glass bottles
and we had a milk shoot at the side of the house
and so you just put the empty ones back out there
and he took them away and put you know put another gallon of glass glass bottle in there
so uh yeah
so uh you know i look back at at uh my childhood
and i'd say you know they were doing things then that we should be doing now
and so it doesn't bother me at all that we're we're uh kind of starting to put the pressure on people to get away from all this uh throwaway society that got developed in the sixties and seventies
it would be nice it would be nice to see it take a good turn here
so i hope that this time it it stays
so uh you know we when we go dump actually when we go dump our things oh we collect newspapers too and then take them
seems like there's a pretty well there's a p- pretty continual flow of people coming and dumping glass and dumping plastics so that's kind of encouraging
i didn't know you know i didn't know if we started to do that
well i'll have to say i'm i'm the only one i'm good at at this point is the newspaper uh taking that to the boy scouts and my aluminum cans uh getting rid of those
but on the plastic i have uh i don't have any habits there yet
and i'm guess i'm waiting for the city to to push me in that direction
but but it just seems like on the larger scale that you know the we always talk about in our society is that economic strife things
and i think if uh if we just start to put you know the nickel deposit on things like uh was the case years ago that uh it would have more immediate effect uh than
because i remember searching ditches for beer bottles because they were worth money and it seems like beer drinkers are among the worst for throwing things out the window
and so outside my little town
we would uh go out and look for long neck beer bottle because they were worth something
do you know i saw in tom thumb yesterday i saw the return to the uh the small coke bottles
and i don't know if there's a deposit on those or not
well that's interesting because
they were glass they were the glass uh
well let's see
they'd be i don't know maybe ten ounce or six ounce or ten ounce
sort of a small size sort of a small size and and we anyway we just we didn't stop and look them look at them a long time
but and they were packed in the old sort of six pack stick them down you know uh sort of sort of a basket type thing
the carton the paper carton
so i hadn't seen that in a long time
well i mean the
and we had all the mechanisms in place with the fold up paper cartons the wood
and and uh uh i'm not really say going back to good old days
but certainly we were doing things the way we think we should do
well it will be interesting to see how over the next year this all works out because like on the uh grass i'm i know your husband uh
and uh but he but you know he likes to pick the grass up too
he doesn't doesn't
i'm the i'm the same way because otherwise uh
oh i'm i generally listen to neal sperry on saturdays and neal uh neal's a person who says i like to pick it up
but i don't believe in throwing it into the uh the landfill
so i have my compost pile
but most of us don't have the uh sufficient
lot size to uh to do that
uh so i'm glad the city's willing to take that on
well there's someplace you know
because really when i look at what my grass does in in actually about twenty-four hours uh knowing what the farmers do in rural areas they just take their hay and just build a big mound of it and it naturally uh composts or stores
and uh so all you have to do is just place it somewhere and churn it
and it will naturally decompose
so you just have to kind of keep in separated
and then uh who knows
but it's certainly usable material
well they must they must keep it separate if they have this date in
they have this day now that it's you know separate from the other trash pick up
but i the thing i don't understand about that is like when
but i've trimmed trees and other things which uh end up being something that clearly won't decompose nearly as rapidly
okay well um
i um i was thinking about it for a long time
and i like basically almost every form of music and type of music
um i don't have a whole lot of dislikes
i um like jazz um especially the blues
and uh i like uh a lot of the uh of course the classics um everything back from bach and and beethoven and chopin and um just in general everything
um i enjoy uh a lot of the the modern forms um uh
do you like like rock and those kind of things punk even
some of the punk um when i was in high school that was uh one of the big things was punk music
and uh a lot of it is has a lot to say or some of it has a lot to say the music does the lyrics do
but the the actual
uh well it it's it's it really expresses some of the opinions of of the people who enjoy the music um but as far as a musical art form i just don't see a whole lot of art to it
um some of it um
i like uh the rap the two types of rap i like or i enjoy to listen to and one is the the rap that is just funny um
and they usually do a lot of satire um
the monotonous the monotonous
i don't enjoy that at all when they're just talking about well i'm better than you and blah blah blah
and then some of it is some of it actually gets into some serious discussions of problems in our in urban society
it talks about um race relations and police relations
and um that that uh-huh
um i'm with you though
i like classical um i don't like to listen to it all the time but um some of the time anyway
i like easy listening just kind of you know
but i don't really care to listen to it any more for some reason
um let's see
country western uh i'm not quite as big on that
that's that's about my opinion of that
some of it's okay uh yeah
it's it's okay um
um the thing about country western that i don't enjoy is is doesn't seem to be any imagination behind it the one country and western song sounds like every other
sound uh really similar
country and western and so the the musicians don't get to really get into their music
and you have a country and western song and
well that's kind of the way i feel about rock and roll sometimes too i guess
and the other thing i don't like about it is they have a tendency to play the instrumental so loud that you can't understand what the lyrics are you can't understand what they're saying on some of those songs which probably is just as well on some
and i can't say that i like a lot of the modern the very very modern uh rock and roll
but i i definitely i really enjoy the fifties the sixties and a lot some of the seventies rock and roll and uh i really enjoy especially the sixties
and where are you from
oh that's neat
well did you understand what this was for you know what it was for what we
uh television shows
i i don't watch too many
but we can try it
well i don't really watch too many t v shows other than uh occasionally i'll i'll turn on donahue because it comes on in the morning when i seem to be getting ready around here
and uh so if if there's no one else around you know it's just me and i have a chance to listen to something i'll turn that on but uh just for the
but and then i think i enjoy when i catch it i don't even know what night it's on but designing women sometimes
oh i love that show
and then there's a new one that started out that i've caught occa- a couple of times called good and evil i think
oh i heard they just canceled that
it's uh it's it's different
have you seen the show it's it's new this year called home front
oh it's it's really good
it's uh i think it's on like tuesday nights from ten to eleven and it's set in post world war two times
and it's about how the servicemen come home and readjust to civilian life here and the changes everyone's going through
it's kind of like a s- a nighttime soap opera type thing
it is it's a good it's really well written
is that on what chan- what station
uh i prefer oprah winfrey to donahue
well she comes on later
and i usually have kids around so i don't end end up watching that one is the only problem i have with it i guess
but i work full-time now and can't catch those anymore
and now when i watch them i think why did i ever watch those
so when i did watch them i was addicted to them every day
but not anymore
so do you know of any other shows in the even or something that you enjoy
oh uh tonight i'm looking forward to seeing golden girls
oh that's always fun
and if i can stay up late enough i like to catch saturday night live every now and then
and right now we're watching a penn state football game because that's where we live
so that's really exciting
well i think
i also course like to catch the news during the evening hours but uh it's a little tough because that's when i'm usually making dinner and the kids are wanting to talk all at the same time
so usually i don't get a whole lot of news watching in
so what have you seen interesting on oprah winfrey lately
sometimes they come on and and say
oh that's right
well today on c n n they were talking about something like this about uh learning to recognize voices and words and stuff and the research
just uh doing this as a fund-raiser for our church
oh that's nice
so it kind of makes it easy you know to do a little something for it
because we uh we've talked to a lot of people from texas it seems
and we thought well maybe they work from for dallas
but outside of that rent a lot
well i have a v c r
and i see most all of mine there
uh i don't know um
actually earlier tonight we were watching to live and die in l a
now i i live alone
consequently i don't like these sa- psycho things
and it is uh to me an outstanding movie
he is uh an attorney and his daughter is an attorney
and she has a suit against his company
you know it's one of those things
but there's a lot of l-
well it's just
um gene hackman's a good actor
actually i we saw her just the other night too
oh did you
i i live with um a roommate and my girlfriend the three of us
have you seen the movie um crossing delancy
now that's one i have watched oh six or eight times
so well what business are you in
i'm i'm an electrical engineer
oh all right
so is everything going all right up there
um it's only about um half an hour
i live wi- on the border
oh well that's that bad then
see we live up in tax free new hampshire and drive down to massachusetts to work
but um we
i live on one of tho- that little ten mile spot
uh sounds wonderful
not up um where i live
but further down the coast in massachusetts they got hit pretty bad
and we got the backlash of that thing
and they had record high waves thirty year high waves come in there
and it was quite an experience
well what movies are you looking forward to seeing now
um well i'm i'm only twenty-seven years old
so the doors movie that's out on video i want to watch that
it it really just turned out nicely
so i would recommend that if you have a chance
so we we often sit around and say what movies should we rent
and we don't know
well if you if you can get green card go for it
i have been working at uh as an accountant at the medical school here in dallas
and i have watched uh gross anatomy
and i don't know
but i hope you have a very merry christmas
uh well uh to begin
i guess uh space is uh real important i think
so it's real vital to the future of not only our kids but every generation until the end of time i guess
i i agree it's definitely new frontier stuff
but uh i'm not too up-to-date on the space on the space frontier
but uh i guess they're going going pretty far into it now
um star wars is not too far
oh have you
i i i worked on some of it at t i once upon a time
so what do you know about it
well actually i'm i i'm quite versed lately
and people are talking about about the current space program all the time
they're talking about new rockets that they're designing now that you know are just like science fiction you know
take off you know
and then they land with the with the you know
the afterburners are going you know not like space shuttle landing you know gliding down but straight down to the landing pad
oh my gosh
well i don't know
you think you'd you think you'd uh go up in space if you had a chance
oh yeah i think i would
but if the time came it'd be real nervous
well you know i had a car uh uh a tire come off of a car
so you know i like i know what it's like to
so well i guess they're talking about people going to the moon and stuff now wherever
well at least we're going to have a space station supposedly in the next few years
and they're going to put
but science fiction books
i mean you look at the jetsons you know cartoon show and it's not too far fetched what what they all had in those cartoons
so you never know
any of that stuff from the jetsons from that cartoon that you would never imagine would come become possible and now you we have a lot of those
so you never know what what may occur
but as far as me seeing it you know
but i think it's real vital important for the future you know generations to come
it's it's it's something definitely that uh you know
it's it's uh got the extra little oomph of interest
i'm sure it'll draw a lot more interest too once it becomes you know like it's more possible
but when they start showing the drawings and all that i'm sure you know when they
i wish uh
like uh boeing or mcdonald douglas or something like that was supposed to buy uh a space shuttle sooner or later and just make it you know purely commercial and they'd go up you know and do things
so did they scratch those uh that star wars deal you know they one we was all worried about
but i don't know whether it it research will go on
but the economy the way it is all over they probably cut back on on that because it's not
well they're they're going to be cutting back so much on just you know the number of troops we've got in europe and the number of troops we have here
but uh russia's still going to have missiles
and we don't know who's handling them now so that's a whole different story now
latest i heard it was just going to be russia that russia itself that was going to have them
at least that was you know that's what everybody says
and now they're saying yeah
some crazy hit man over there so
with those little republican- republics or whatever
and one of them crazy crazy guys get a hold of it
but that the guy that's taken over for gorbachev he's supposed to be he's supposed to be on our side isn't he
but that way
but but uh
well michael what do you think about uh funding for aids research
well uh uh that's something i've thought a lot about
uh i i work in a hospital
and i've worked in the hospital for fifteen years
and i've taken care of a few aids patients
uh when they asked us did did we want to uh keep it the same or uh spend more spend less i think uh i think right now what they're spending is adequate
uh my for my personal opinion
uh because i think it's something that's going to take them a while to come up with a uh vaccine for
i don't think it's going to be that easy to come up with or i think they already would have by now you know
and uh so i don't know if if spending a lot more money would really make any difference right now
i think they're doing the is as much research as they can possibly do you know
and uh what about you
well i guess i'm not too aware of how much they're spending right now
uh that's something i've never really kept up with at all
i mean i
uh i don't i'm not sure uh
i know uh i've always thought more about the disease rather than the der- research
and uh that sort of thing
uh if if we were talking about the money uh i'd just have to say what they're spending is probably enough simply because i don't know that much about it
i mean i i can see that research is needed
and you know
i mean it's becoming a major problem
i guess the area that i think more about is i would like to see them focus on uh preventing it uh in more
well that's true
that's true because uh it's a such an easily preventable disease
and i i feel like just saying uh safe sex is not the answer
it's it's uh abstinence in certain cases
and knowing you know
myself uh uh i'm just recently or about to get a divorce and uh course i'm not all ready to just run out there and start dating everybody i can or anything
but it's sort of scary to find yourself single again you know
and uh because you never know what's going to happen
you don't know who you're going to come across you know
course it's it's not that i'm wanting to i'm not going to want to go and have sex with everybody
but it's something you got to think about these days
and uh i mean it certainly changed my attitude about that in a hurry
but uh uh i know that uh in some of these larger cities they're passing out free syringes and all of that sort of thing to prevent you know so that uh the drug addicts won't be getting dirty needles and everything
and uh i don't know
i know it uh sort of doesn't address the problem of drug addiction
but uh i don't know
so i don't know
that i think that's
i'm not too a- much against the the passing out of the free syringes myself
i mean i i definitely think that it's the drug problem that needs to be addressed
but as you say uh people i mean in the meantime
if they're perp- perpetrating the aids problem passing that on to each other then you know
you know i guess if you consider the two problems drug addiction and aids aids would have to come first i guess as far as something to to do about it
so so i don't know
uh course there's so many things in the world where if you solve one problem you may be creating another
and uh so i guess you just have to take the two problems and see which is worse
but uh but i've never looked into how much money they're spending
i have i have no idea
and i know a lot of our tax money goes to that
but uh i really have never looked into it
i've heard you know uh different voices speaking up and saying we're not spending enough
so i don't know
and yet i know it's uh it sounds like big money to me
but it probably takes a lot
it seems to take more than uh for any little thing they do
uh uh i
a lot of the my family you know they fear me working like that and under some some of those conditions
but uh uh i don't fear it at all
uh i work in in the operating room a lot and uh and of course when w-
i'm lee with uh uh
or where are you at
well there's a lot of s- stuff going on in arlington these days
i'm not not personally
now do you work
oh you are
because i i work for myself and so uh
i miss uh insurance and uh the steady paychecks that come
oh is that right
and i enjoyed the freedom of having that you know
go to work when i wanted to or not but you know the benefits weren't there
i uh i own part of a roofing company
oh do you
in the in the dallas fort worth area
and uh you know unfortunately we we were part of a of a bigger bigger company and they uh you know we we had all the benefits there
and and i do miss that
but uh on the other hand i i uh i enjoy having the the time that i have with my family and being able to you know work when i want
i think today the thing that i uh would appreciate the most
uh because my husband gets
but we have to pay for mine
and we're the only one i'm the only one that's being insured
oh is that right
and and we pay the same amount that someone over there that has four children has i mean
so it's kind of
and i would
and the way medical expenses are i think that's probably one of the biggest benefits to ha- you need to have
that is the single most uh benefit that i that i enjoyed and i do miss
because i looked into picking up some uh medical insurance for my just for my family you know just
and uh yeah
oh yeah even at a group rate
uh it's it's unbelievable
and uh the amount that you have to pay for you know for kids
and and if you want to add dental to it i mean that's that eats even more
i guess what the other benefits that uh that i uh that i miss i guess is uh you know some of the bonuses and stuff that that goes on with just being involved with a big company you know
and i'm sure it will be you know quite a few people are affected by that
although uh i will personally tell you i used to work at a bank
and i would see the g m people come in when they were they would shut down to retool
and i don't know if you're aware of this r-
just they go off fishing and stuff and come in and every friday and go to the safety deposit box
and i'm sitting there making a hundred dollars a week you know
and and they had all these gr-
i i really believe they have done this to themselves in a way because of the unions being so stocked
and right now anybody's that's laid off from g m will have a full year's paycheck
plus probably an additional six months through the the worker's stuff that they have at at uh through the company
so i'm sor- you know i'm sorry it's happening because it's going to hurt
but i don't feel as sorry for them
well really the
and that would be it
really the ones it's going to hurt is is actually the the businesses around in that area
you know that's the ones that that that's going to hurt because they depend on that uh
but i think there's a case
and they got so good i mean like two dollars for a prescription no deductible on the medical all these things you know and it made the prices of cars go up
and and you know the
i we i believe in unions
but they went too far
i mean i can't make eighteen dollars an hour
well i'll tell you i i've had my fill of unions
i mean i know someone out here that makes eighteen dollars an hour
uh do you want to go ahead
and they are really big on women's rights
and and equal treatment
and so i i've seen a lot of like rallies and things like that
but uh i'm not that liberated
i mean my mom is kind of old-fashioned you know
so i you know you pick up some traits from her and stuff
but uh i think it's i think it's interesting and better for women to see that there's more more of them doing men's fields
and i don't like to see women you know like waiting on men hand and foot
but you know i i believe in like sharing and doing things for each other
i see a lot more uh
and they're all married
and uh i love seeing the men help the women so much
and they both cooperate together on
oh me too
i mean i i don't mind doing stuff
uh i have a boyfriend
and i got to make him dinner and stuff
but you know i he'll help me do the dishes
i don't want to you know expect to help to clean up then after
if they did that you know
and they're they're good about it
but it is neat to see them all work together
and a big thing that i see all that most of the most of the women getting married now uh go back have gone back to you know
they they stay at work or go back to work or whatever
and they're well educated
and i believe we'll see a lot more c e o in companies
and i think we'll see a lot more don't you of upper management
and uh and i think black women now
i- in fact i work at a high school
and my boss is a black woman and has only been there a couple of months and already promoted
and she's very sharp
and i think that th-
and the ethnic thing will be you know is a good thing now
oh me too
and they're sharp
so you're going to see a lot a lot more of that in leadership i believe
and it's just too bad that some people you know still look down on them just because of their color you know
but they wouldn't know what they're doing
but i'm not big on subserving as far as
but i never have gone along with that you know even far back
but i was brought up pretty good in a home that
ther- you know
some people say oh the boys shouldn't have to do those jobs the inside jobs
but we never were taught
so that was good
so that's i think that's good to keep the equal as far as as uh not nex- nex- uh necessarily by sex type thing
and i think the uh attitude is a lot better towards the parents raising the younger ones now
you see a lot more of the mothers and all saying to the young girls you know you can do it
i i see more men uh like participating in like the family things with children
like you know helping to take care of them more and and uh uh doing the jobs equally you know
i'm real dis- i'm kind of disgusted this year because i don't see many women into the political scene
and i really think we should have more political leaders in the women than we do up for and even for president and vice president this year
i think they're all scared out after tha-
oh what was the lady's name that ran a couple of
oh i don't know
but you know who i mean
and they t- their tax deal and
at least she was strong to like try it and you know
so that's good
but i wish they would get some more on that
and that disappoints me
and right now i don't think we have too many uh th- in the forefront
and uh other th- uh
so it would
is it p- do you think it's possible to have honesty in government or an honest government
well i suspect that it is possible
uh i think it probably is more likely if you have a small government unit where everybody knows everybody
but uh other than that i think maybe it just depends on how you define honesty
that's an int- you know that's interesting
and it was just applying to governments in general
and i thought that was interesting
it was just government in general from times past you know on
so they're saying that government officials would tend to be power seekers
and that would be a next question to ask
how many do you think are in there for pub- for bu-
because they want to be a service to us
or are they in there for their own gains
and personally i feel it's probably there's probably some of each
but i think maybe a lot of them um
and you know how good a name can i make for myself and so forth
so i guess it would be like anything else
and they talked uh
third question was how m- serving for their own gains do you think goes on
i'm sure there's a lot but i agree with you there's a lot in business
i think that's just i think that's very normal
i think i- i think a little more honesty in the campaigns would be
if you knew what you were getting when you voted uh
because i'm taking a texas government class right now
and one of the things
if they tell us the truth we don't elect them and
especially with all this fron- co- stuff coming up here lately about people's past
and i don't know why anybody would want to get under that scrutiny anymore
because it's i think it's gotten just care- well
and and we're getting away from what we ought to be looking at
and it almost seems like in order to avoid uh some of the scandal you would have to have the kind of wife that you would only find on say in the bobsy twins or
you know i also think it would be funny if we could know everything about the people that were in there and throw them out
uh at uh it's t c j c
tex- tarrant county junior college
and it's really it's really enjoyable
and then they also you know ask can we eliminate do you think we could make laws to eliminate all corruption
and i don't think we can make laws to eliminate anything anyplace totally
but that doesn't eliminate it does it
i mean i don't know how many laws you would have to have
well they've got laws against cannib- cannibalism but that didn't stop that guy in
but i think there's no way that you eliminate it all by legislating
and we would end up with so many more laws that you know
i mean i just think that's human nature that you're going to have corruption in government in business personal life i mean you know
the japanese government is always having a some kind of a scandal
but when i think about where i'd want to go you know this is still the best
or i can
and i uh i i have not found one yet that i would rather live in
i think uh
at it's worst i think we've got the best
okay um chuck do you have any pets there at your home
and what kind do you have
i live alone in an apartment and uh except for the cat
well we have a cat um
he's probably oh a good two years old big old fat and sassy tabby
well it's uh you know they're just uh aggressive by nature and uh he's been neutered and declawed
so he's an indoor cat
so uh that kind of calms him down for the most part
he's uh he has been really aggressive uh especially towards my little girl for some reason
he's uh been so mean to her
and and you say you've had him how long
we've had him for about two years and he was so mean to her um right after we first got him
so we had him neutered and and declawed
and now he bites her
but he's a very possessive cat
he he loves my son
and he's the only one that allows him to touch him or pet him or love him and he's so funny
and while he showers it's so hilarious
so he's quite a animal
well as long as he doesn't get too aggressive i guess with the daughter he's all right
well we we did uh actually take him to the pound a couple of times you know because we just couldn't have him being so aggressive towards the girl
but uh he seems to have mellowed out a little bit
and we do keep our daughter away from him
we we tried a dog about four years ago and we ended up with uh oh malamute and some other kind of mix
anyway it was it ended up being just a huge huge dog that ate us out of house and home
so we gave him up and tried
well do you live you you in a house or a place where you uh
but we're in a subdivision where we really can't allow the dog
so he was just chained up all the time
and it was it was unfortunate
so have you tried any other pets
i i live alone in an apartment
oh my word
and uh it's it's not that big that uh although i've heard rabbits are pretty good you know i saw something on c n n or on cable here a while ago that showed some people that had rabbits in apartments and in houses
and they apparently uh
oh my word
especially when they're young when they bring them in uh
and do they they just paper train it or something
and i would imagine that they don't have many more than one to start with either
did you see the the c n n the the dog show uh
we don't have c we don't have cable
well they have uh uh a wesmin- they call it the westminster dog show uh
i think it's in new york city at the at the gardens
there once a year live and they had that on last week
and that's really kind of something to watch uh
it's on i think two or three nights for maybe an hour or two and some of the weirdest animals you ever want to see in there
so you live in utah do you
it's north of salt lake city utah and we really love it out here
it's uh kind of country
we're we're only about ten minutes from ogden
so we're kind of country but not too
well do you all work for t i or for
oh well see i'm getting so many calls to texas
this is the very first one i've i've talked to
oh well great
and uh no my no my
so how do you get most of your current event information
well see i'm going to school right now
and uh while i'm working i don't get a i don't get a chance to read the paper a lot
and i don't watch t v as much really either because uh my free time is kind of
and i do like to do other stuff with it
while i'm at work sometimes i on the computer network um i read the news sometimes
and that's kind of helpful
i mean my roommates and stuff you know people around me talk about it
and the people i work with are pretty you know up up-to-date on that kind of stuff
well i'm a housewife
and so um i get most of my information probably through just the news at six o'clock and then um talking with people and just hearing what's going on
do you watch do you watch the network like major network news
or do you watch like the macneil lehrer hour
just the regular channel just channel eight
that's the um eyewitness news
oh ch- see channel where i am channel eight's um like public t v
so it's kind of different
i think i think the uh
i think a lot of the commentators on like the major networks like right it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on
but um it seems that um they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they you know report on the news
and i think even in the elections they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not
and basically you know if a candidate can get them to follow then the news will you know kind of publicize his name
because they can they can only report on i mean
they give each candidate perhaps you know ten second blurbs in which to you know to say you you just can't get a full picture of you know their message unless you have time to sit down and r- and probably read something on it
and the news too it just doesn't um cover that many stories
i mean it just covers your basic you know violent crimes and you know and and your ca- catastrophes with weather and stuff
but other than that you really don't know what's going on
um i will read our current letters that come out on elections
and i guess i do read that
and i do study who's running in our area
and i do study what's going on in the economy
it you know
and i guess i do read other magazines um too to get my information
i subscribe to like science news
and that's that's real good because it gives like a brief summary of or like the updates like of what's going on in science without getting into a lot of detail that would you know bog me down that i wouldn't know about but other than that i don't really read
i don't i don't really subscribe to anything else
i used to read every month a reader's digest but um now i guess i just have friends that clip articles
or if i you know am interested in something of course during the w- when we were in war i read up on that just a little in the newspaper to find out what was going on
but a lot of the times i you know i wish i had the time to read all the stories in the newspaper
but i just can't seem to find the time
well i remember back during the uh during the war everyone here at work always had the radio or the t v on because that they were going constantly with that stuff
and people said that they wanted to see more on outside of texas news
you know we just don't want to hear every night all the killings that went on here in dallas that we want to hear what's going on with the economy what's being done to help it what's going on in other countries what's you know just more information
if they reported every if they reported every violent crime in atlanta it would take it would probably take the whole news hour
well i guess we'll get pretty good news coverage in a couple of years when you host the uh summer olympics
they start already they're having like um
in the newspaper they have a section i think every now and then on the olympics you know
and they've got like a countdown
i can't believe i mean
they're they're stretching out the olympic news for that much coverage over
also big in the news right now is the braves because they're uh they're in you know tr- spring training or whatever and they did so well last year
they spent a lot of time that's another thing they spend a long time on sports
and i think that um that's fine i would like to see more time spent on other things
they way they do the newscasts i wish they they kind of separated it you know
but i don't have cable
oh we have one rotten cat
well i like cats
this this cat is a uh
he's uh a one owner
but he follows he'll follow my oldest son around
you know when he is in the house he will come up and he'll jump on his lap
but if anybody reaches over to pet him or whatever he'll just kind of look at them like what are doing
he's he we bought the cat for him
and so he's uh been the one that you know spent the most time with him
but i i've never owned a cat like that
huh that's interesting
so it's a weird cat
huh we have a a mutt
well we we named it hooper because that's where we got it from
a lot of people uh uh drop off abandoned abandoned pets at her house and she use to work for a veter- veterinarian
so she would spay- uh neuter them give them all their shots
and we saw an ad saying it was free
so we went down there and picked it up
and it's been an excellent dog
but it's my first dog i've had
and we got it because my wife stays here at home alone while i go to work
so that's mostly why we got it to keep her company while i am away at work
so that is that is that kind of your child right now
right now it it is
i mean we have been trying for kids
but right now we haven't had any
but it's pretty good training i think really keeps her on her toes
have have you had dogs before
uh my brother has
uh we didn't do a lot with them
uh i never felt like it was mine or anything
but i mean that did did more responsibility when it's yours and not your brothers
when i was growing up i had we always had a dog
and we had mostly mutts
well not mutts but mixes you know like one or two mix
and those dogs always seem to be the best dogs
ours is uh like a cockapoo
but it's a really good dog
they seem to be i mean listen better or something
it's just uh an accident
from a frie- uh from my my son's friend down the street
they're they're cat was an outside cat and just end up with some kittens
uh we i would
we uh we had a dog that was a uh mix between an alaska malamute and a labrador and uh i should say a pup
and he was just too big for our kids when we got him
and we when we moved into our house that was the first thing we wanted to get was uh you know was a pet
and it was a dog that we gotten
and he was he was just too big
uh the kids couldn't handle him
and i was still going to school
and my wife was working
and i was working
and so we just didn't have time to really train him
so he was kind of jus- you know he was too big for the kids to handle
so he was just tied up to a post so we gave him to uh
there is a place out here uh called shorties lane out here in harrisville and they have uh
but he just takes a few the animals in
and some he destroys
and some he keeps
so we took him up there
and he ended up keeping him
uh cause he has had him for six or seven years
we we've saw him just about a year ago
and uh i thought boy that sure looks like that pup we gave away and so we asked him about it one day
and he said yeah
i he would have been a great great dog
uh they just uh they just started a recycling program here i think
actually this is my first experience with recycling program
but uh instead of just like tossing everything away which i always felt bad about uh i am starting to split stu- split stuff up
they make me drive it like a mile down the road and spit it out down there
well here in saskatoon uh
there is no curb pick up of uh any of the recycled products
uh we're in a community of about one hundred and eighty thousand people
uh there are areas where we could uh
actually we have a couple of the uh handicapped societies types of places where the uh
so uh we are able to uh have drop off bins for news papers and cardboard and that kind of thing
and then there are there's a uh deposit program on plastic and glass containers well primarily soft drink bottles
and so we are able uh to take it to one of the uh rehabilitation centers
and then they recycle the containers
the the deposits only on like drink stuff
on the on primarily on soft drink pops and that kind of thing and uh so they induce recycling of plastic and glass soft drink containers
uh we do have one of the scrape metal dealers that will accept tin and aluminum cans as well and actually the recycler there is a deposit on aluminum pop cans and beer cans and so the recycler uh with the handicapped group will also accept those
so uh it's fairly fairly extensive
but then again it's uh it's the initiative of the individual person because there is no coordinated pick up by the city
so did they
you're giving are you giving these products to the handicapped group
and the handicapped group is getting the uh the money
or or are you or are they some home distributing the funds back to you
well actually there's there's the opportunity for both
generally the uh the handicapped group takes care of the things that
actually the government has placed the deposit which is the inducement to re- recycle the bottle so that you get your money back
and then the recycler run by the handicapped society pays back the cost of that deposit
and then i and then they in turn will get some money from the bottlers and from the the people that do the canning of the pop and the beer as as well
you know there's a i heard about a similar program in new york city where uh a thing called like homeless incorporated or something like that
but what they do is employ uh homeless i think mostly men but homeless people to uh go out and collect all the recyclable cans
and and i think it's mostly cans
there may be bottles as well but like beer cans soda cans and what not
and they uh bring them up to a one lo- one centralized location and uh are able to collect the money from the various beer and and soda manufacturers and uh and get more money to these people that desperately need it
uh i guess partly because of our climate
here in saskatoon at least the majority of central uh
well i want to say central canada
but central canada tends to referred more to ontario and quebec but uh
we certainly have a fair number of people that are on welfa- welfare and unemployment insurance and that kind of thing
but we have actually quite an extensive network of collecting news papers
or people can drop their used news papers and other papers in the bins
and then the bins are collected
uh some of the
jimmy so how do you get most of your news
well i kind of uh i watch the uh national news every day for one
and i'm a i'm pretty much a news junkie
and i tune in to c n n a lot
so when you say the morning news or evening news or national news is when
uh every evening at six thirty i believe
well i would probably be a junkie or s- watch
but i don't uh i don't uh subscribe to cable be- because of the poor service and also uh because
well i uh i give to the united way
and so i figured that amount of money i just donate to that
i take away a uh addiction
uh overall i i
the quality of the news you get o- off of most uh sources i would say is pretty low
and that's one of the reasons where i why i try and get as many sources as possible
because if you hear the same story from three different sources then you get a much clearer picture of of what is going on you would hope
but still you know hard to say that what you've heard is what really is
what what uh newspapers do you read
well i read uh the local newspaper
and i also try and read one of the uh major dailies like the chicago tribune or the new york times or something like that
for a while there i i i uh subscribed to new york times a- actually a couple of newspapers because uh you know my fiance
well she was unemployed for a while
so she you know really needed to look at the
and i don't know
but uh and when you read a lot of this stuff the the quality of the writing has definitely gone down in the last ten years or so
but uh i mean they they say it's like the sixth grade reading level
but i swear it's at least second or third grade
uh i think if you listen to like n p r or something like
i i really like n p r a lot
uh and i like listening to that on on uh
when i get a chance when i'm in the car a long enough time to to listen to it because i
i miss n p r a lot also
i really like them because they give uh
and they also
uh they're they're pretty good too
uh i guess a year ago you're probably watching c n n a lot right
uh but i i don't know
i guess a lot of it's still a lot of hype
look at the the smith trial
i mean that was a joke
but then you also have things where you uh where they broadcast the clarence thomas hearings basically the whole length of them which i thought was r- really good
i had uh some visitor
and he was just in- just i don't know fixated on that you know just listened to it constantly
uh and i guess that's good when it's live if you if you'll really want that
but that's not really providing you news
it's it's more like a media event rather than reporting
well but the but the ne- news news that you would get from any other source is being generated from that event which is something that's good also about c span which i i tune into every once in a while
it it is really kind of boring
but you know that's
if if you don't watch it there then you're going to hear somebody else's canned uh report somebody else's view about it
and that's what you're supposed you're supposed to
if you watch the news you're going your opinion is going to be formed about on what somebody else thought about it as opposed to actually watching it yourself and forming your own pinion opinion which i haven't would be much more in favor of forming my own opinion as opposed to following someone else's
but one of the ways that i get information is uh every day when i log in on the computer i subscribe to this this thing
and and they basically uh type out abstracts which are really literally
i've i've actually read the actual articles
uh i just got done reading a a magazine or a couple magazine articles about the uh new saturns
uh and although i can't afford it right now i would just like love to have one
you like uh
so you're an american you want to buy american
it's the best car in the class for the be- cheapest amount of money
i'm interested in having it for uh doing a little autocross racing uh closed circuit racing and uh it seems to just blow the com- compe- competition away
it terms of handling uh acceleration
it just got like the top rating
it was compared up against uh
there was like the mazda m x three uh nissan's whatever their two n x two thousand the civic s i
and it just you know it it dominated over all of them
everybody all the uh raters loved it
i like the i like the styling
and i seen a few of them actually race
and they seem to be really good cars for it
uh can't afford it
so you're talking about ones in a lower lower end p- price range
and let's face it
well you can wait till you graduate
and you'll have plenty of money
i i've got a a pontiac sunbird turbo that
and trying to get it prepared for racing
but it's it would be nice just like scrap it and go for the g- saturn
i'd do it i'd use it for both
the nice thing about autocrossing is you can you can do both
uh just like a uh set up a lot of times
and it's like really large uh parking lots
and you put up set up the track pylons
i've seen a lot of mustangs uh compete
and it's interesting
uh what are you thinking about buying
uh i think i'd like to get uh b m w or if i go the german route which i'm kind of leaning towards right now but uh or maybe a hon- i mean a a acura legend
uh a lexus uh s c three hundred maybe
i haven't really determined if i like the the japanese or the if i like them enough to purchase one
you know because your b m w your german cars have good reputations i think
well i was i was actually in uh
a lot of the b m w are produced in uh sh- uh stutgardt and uh and munich and i was i was there this uh summer
and uh i- i was really impressed by the uh the uh factory uh tours and such for b m w
they their they have the whole philosophy
i mean they they kind of even brainwash themselves into thinking they're better
i mean as you're walking through that little tour in uh munich it's kind of
it was it was interesting
i was at i i also went to uh the porsche
and uh it was it was amazing how they were completely opposed
the uh the b m w is really oh like oh we have all these like high tech things
and everything is put together with exacting tolerances
and and then you go to porsche
and it's like well uh these cars are completely handmade and no two of them are alike
and so it's like completely opposed
unless it's it's a toy
if you can afford that kind of a toy then i guess uh
but it it b m w good for that
what kind of driving just like commuting you'd want to do it use it for
no m- no heavy mileage
so it's pretty minimal
i also i was impressed by uh by the mercedes too
i really i really like the mercedes
but but if if you have a problem with a mercedes you take it into a shop they're going to they're going to hit you up for just all kinds of things
and is it different for the for the b m w
uh i think well something on the order of a three series it's probably different
so i'm kind
so this is the big issue with us although i don't recall marking it on my little things to talk about
but you're married
we we've been married for two and a half years
you know i know we're not supposed to do this long distance
but actually i'm getting a call
well i don't want to i don't want this to be a unilateral
and our children are sixth fourth and third grade
and the school years are wonderful
and they are interesting
they they have all their own activities
and um i think as parents we really enjoy them in in our personal situation
so they're pretty good kids huh
i'm su- sure that's coming though
well we had ni- wh- growing up
but my dad uh
and the time that my we spent with our dad was he owned his own business
so we worked with him most of the time
so that's how we spent most of the time with him
well we're catholics
and everyone always asked if the girl got spoiled
well i do think with working parents it is i mean there are some real issues here um
that i think um
i happen to um
so uh i i i talk to parents about this a lot
i i think working mothers or mothers who choose to work outside the home um need very early to come to grips with any guilt
and i feel when my children were very young i had jobs that helped me be flexible with my schedule and spend time with them and all that sort of thing
and i long ago decided i'm a better mother because i work outside the home
and it has um helped us to afford some things for our children that we couldn't otherwise that i think are wonderful particularly at this age
and i think our kids are real secure
so i know it sounds like a rationalization
but it's i really think it's true for our family
and i think it has worked very well
it's like you said you know to each his own
and we're planning on having my wife stay home
if if a woman is happy doing that
and uh i would not have been real fulfilled
it's a wonderful it's wonderful to be a mother
and i you can do that despite working very easily which is one of the things i preach all the time to to mothers
um and i think we choose very very carefully the um alternative situations that we had them in
but i really do think sometimes they very early on are around lots of other children
and they they learn to share
well that's good
well so so so your wife does she work right now
well we just moved down here
but then wh-
so what do you think about uh recycling programs in atlanta julie
i mean it's hard to find places to go
i mean kroger does a couple things
they i don't think they do they do newspapers
there's there's big bins out there
i i really don't know what the details are
as a matter of fact i'm pretty sure there's a place you can call and find out the closest you know thing to you
but i think there should be some kind of curbside service
they pick up newspapers and uh you know milk jugs and aluminum and tin cans you know like soup comes in and stuff
during the summers like the around where i live the uh homeless people see-
i mean they all have like shopping carts and stuff
and they're go around and collect cans and aluminum and stuff
and so we used to just save them up
and then they'd come around
and we'd give them to them
during the winter time i think they they move south or something so i don't do that anymore
and the the recycling at georgia tech like that uh outside the uh student center they never empty those things
so what's a guy to do
and now they have like bins and stuff that are a little more convenient because mean until seven o'clock you got to pay to park at the student center
huh oh yeah
so you do recycle don't you
i'm kind of i'm kind of bad about it
if i if see a s- if i see a pile of cans or bottles or something i'll throw it in there
but i don't really i don't ever take anything
well i mean it's real
and since we go there all the time i mean
oh by the way may name's julie
uh well is there anything else you'd like to share me about your recycling philosophy julie
like what about like uh
they have uh
but i used to just save up the ones that i got one time and then go and hand them to them the next time and use them over and over
a- but also most places like big star does
and i'm not sure if kroger does or not
and they they have like little little boxes that you can put your old bags in
the petroleum pretty much i mean those petroleum products i think are the big uh you know the great satan of the recycling
did you know that like something like fifty percent of the world's landfills is like paper filled with paper
paper doesn't seem threatening at all you know
well it is it is though
well they do treat paper with chemicals
like yellow paper you know takes something like twenty times as long to decompose
you know you can bury a piece of yellow paper
but i can just forget that from now on
i'm going u- i'm going to switch to the white ones
well white paper's bad too
they they treat it too
well what about uh papyrus you know made out of bam- you know bamboo stuff from the from the banks of the nile
i think we should just abandon the you know the written word altogether you know
well i mean
i think we've kind of you know
i mean everybody everybody
like uh dick tracy
so how do you uh
so so it sounds like you've got a television going on there
so i can assume that you probably watch the t v news
uh what what station do you listen to
uh it's a local radio station
it's called uh k l i f cliff
so uh it's not affiliated with anything is it
not it's not a network station
because i i listen to uh public radio a lot
and they have they have k c r w which i i i saw a thing recently they may be trying to start their own uh cable tv outlet
they're getting a little getting a little feisty now
well this has this station has a lot of just ongoing news
but i hate watching the like ten o'clock news
so you have a paper or something or
we have a lo- well we have uh dallas morning news which is the big paper in dallas
we read i read it pretty much from cover to cover
it's been it's been a while since i read the dallas news
i uh fact last time i read the dallas dallas news i was in arkansas
the times herald went out of business here and so we really only have one dallas newspaper and one
well that must be pretty bad
so how did that happen anyway
uh financial trouble
i mean when did it when did they
oh when did it happen
so how do you keep up
oh me i uh
they're uh speci-
uh if there's something you want to know it's it's in the times and then and in detail
uh they uh we we used to have two papers here in town
and then the herald examiner collapsed about two years ago because of oh i don't know just nobody was buying it really
so there really is only one major l a now
uh there used to be
fact i think there still is the uh the daily news which runs out of the san fernando valley
and uh they're not bad as far as a uh you know as far as a local paper goes
in fact it was kind of weird because i met the uh i met the i met the editor uh while i was on uh while i was doing jury service in santa monica one time
it was like we just sat around and talk about newspapers and stuff
he was a really cool guy uh you know went to columbia university and all this stuff
and uh it's it's a pretty good paper
but uh you know it's not it's not the times
although i you know i'm sorry to see some of their uh
there's there's a daily news uh news rack right around the corner from where i live which means that they're they're expanding i guess
but uh a- and occasionally i i pick up like time magazine or something i think uh if they've got an interesting lead story
but you know it's
i i don't have time
but i don't read it much anymore
that's that's kind of a problem for them
and then we have a local rag here in town that i pick up periodically and read just to see what's going on in our little community
and it's just sort of a you know four or five pages that covers what's going on in plano
but it's still not an awful lot of news
i uh it was it was a big discovery when when the times when the times found out there was a place called orange county
i mean the way they i mean the way they've been handling it before they practically they practically acted like their reporters needed to shots to go south of the l a county border
oh i would imagine in uh you know in in dallas they have plenty happening in dallas to cover that it gets hard covering all of the sub- suburbs
and of course they tend to cover the county
and we're not in dallas county
so they tend to ignore places outside of the county
i i i find that attitude kind of arrogant though
but you're not bothering to cover the things that are interesting to us
well uh i'll let you start i guess
i i'm employed by a company that does do uh random drug testing
and i've got some
are you uh in- involved at all
i mean i'm not
my employer does not do that uh although uh i had an ex-employer that
uh the previous job i used to have uh they
after i guess a few years after i had started with them they made it a condition of employment that you pass a drug test
uh i i don't know
for example uh
because it you know uh like there was an incident several years ago where an amtrak engineer you know he crashed and
but where it's not necessary uh in that regard where it's not an immediate threat to life and limb or property uh i i'd i would seriously question it
it uh that's that's mine
it it you know
i i go back
it to me no matter how much the th- our company claims it's not a constitutional issue that because this is uh between a company and an employee it is not it is not a government
i i our company's doing it because they're a uh government contractor
uh and so it's it's required for certain some form some form of drug program is required to get the government contracts
and i'd i'd
so it's the government that's mandating it to a certain extent
an- and our company has taken that and gone all the way
first off we don't we don't have enough courage to uh pick out the people that that have some sort of indication of possible drug usage uh because that would offend them uh if they if they weren't
so we'll just accuse everybody of using drugs and
but and they
so it's a a complete random testing
w- well it's random in the sense that you don't know when
uh and uh you know i i sit at a terminal and and write software all day
it it uh certainly
and and uh yes
i i agree that there are there are uh jobs that are definitely life threatening
and and and th- there needs to be a line drawn somewhere at rea- reasonable and proper
i- you know
i mean it's well there's also the issue of uh
o- o- out here i remember hearing a year or so ago that uh a lot of
o- or i shouldn't say high i mean several percent
i that that i that i will give credit to to our our company for in that that i think there's there's a couple of levels of tests in terms of of uh of drugs
and e- e- essentially the first thing is t- is on the order of paper in the urine and uh or some you know
but it's fairly simple
and then there's a a much more uh uh refined test uh uh spectrography or whatever it's called the chemo- chemotography uh to determine exactly what the what the things are
now l- let me ask you this
uh e- e- at the time you hired on with this company uh was that prior to any
i i've been with this company for uh for sixteen years now
so that this is obviously not a condition of employment that you subject yourself to this
and it and it and it has it has you know
and i uh
but on the other hand uh someone new coming in that knows they're going to have a test
and uh i called you know from that the the t i data base calling instructions
uh there's really a lot isn't there
oh i guess the work force would be the main wouldn't it
and then we can start recording it
like i said i guess it would be the work force you know as far as changes in the generations
i know because i know when my mother was a you know going into the work force there wasn't very many opportunities for her i guess
and i've never faced that at all
i think no- now you go to work when they're six weeks old
and you stay there
and i feel like the next generation you'll probably just work right along with your husband you know
oh i do to much
and it's just going to get better
because women are in every field now
i mean i can't think of a field that they're not involved in
oh i can't either not a one
and i know at least in the medical field it seems like they've come out with a lot further advances as far as female medications and things since women have gotten into the doctor field
even in washington you know
i mean people will just look at you as a person and not as a man or a woman
oh i do too
and that would be it
i guess it's kind of an ideal world though huh
i kind of think maybe in time that you know you'll go by social security numbers you know
and that way they can't say well they picked a male over a female female over a male you know
or the way you you know
just go by your social security number and then look at you qualifications that you know that you have
and then if you get it you know then
also with uh women in the work force they've gotten a lot more options as far as you know what's it called job sharing
like if you and another lady were to share the same full time job
or a lot of women i know now and my uh one of my supervisors when she went on l o a to have her baby we hooked up uh uh a terminal at her house
and she you know we could send her messages
and and she kept in touch like that
i would just take her the actual paperwork once uh every week or two
and that worked out great too
and that's a real attractive option if you have the the technology for it
all it was was you know
i mean she just used a phone modem
and she was like she was sitting in the office
so i think that's real nice too to come up with different options
oh i do
uh well like one week she'll work three days and i'll work two
and the next week you know i'll work three
and she'll work two
oh oh that's great
and we just share off like that
oh that's wonderful
but we've just really got a wonderful system that we're working under
and that way we're not really missing any thing out you know
and that would be a nice way especially if you have young children
oh it is
well both of ours is school age
but we don't want to miss any of those p t a and you know all of that
but even that they have extracurricular activities
and the older they get the more that you're involved in that
and i look for more of that in the next generation
i do too especially as women get up in management and and can be in on those decision making
you know when that subject comes up they can say yes
oh i do too
plus i bet it cuts cuts down on your absenteeism because you've got two days off that you can do everything
so you don't have to you know unless you're just really sick or the child's sick
most of the time now you know it's just the weekend
or just forget it
or what i've done is found like doctors' and dentists' office with extended hours
like my doctor stays open til nine in the evening
so that's real helpful
so you don't you know have to do it during office hours run out on your lunch hour
well i think we've really come a long way in that because
but i know
but i can rem- remember back growing up my mother
i mean it was
but it wasn't that easy for her to just take off
i can remember my mother getting in trouble if you know one of was sick
and i know she probably didn't make hardly anything you know compared to the work that she did
i think there is still some discrimination there where as you know men and women work in the same job
oh i do too
but i think that's improving
and you just want to make it right
but at least the wheels are moving forward
well i should probably get back to my job
because i've been like waiting like for about ten minutes to get connected to somebody
are you are you in dallas
or not detroit i'm in uh california
well you're on the uh
well i guess we're supposed to talk
wh- what did how how did you get to know about the t i thing
oh one of my instructors uh said that they were doing something like this
wha- what are you working on
a a masters in uh information systems
i'm doing my masters in in computer science and computer engineering
uh i don't because uh i come from a lot a bigger city than this one
and i i'm in raleigh
and it's really small
all all you have is like towns built around universities
so it it's basically a bunch of small towns anyway
but they don't have a whole lot there
uh well i'm in monterey california right now
so so i mean it's like this this town probably has like two hundred and fifty thousand people
and that's about it
it it's it's a lot bigger than monterey is
but we're just uh just south of uh san jose and san francisco
and it's only a couple of hours away or a hour away to a you know to a large city
so so where do you go
i go to the it's the naval postgraduate school out here
because uh i was looking at at the
and they're asking like for a uh g p a of like three point seven or something like that
and like they're looking like for uh g r e like ninety-nine percentile and this and that
and it's like
well that's what they look for
that's why that's why i didn't apply
i mean it was like for me it was like practically impossible to get between like ninety and
ninety-nine percentile on the on the verbal part
uh let's face it you know
and you know i you know did the you know
i found it a lot of times with regards to education you know the school only takes you so far you know
so uh i don't lose any sleep sleep over stuff like that
so are are you going to go for your doctorate
see i'm in the navy
and uh you know most of the navy funds that i probably won't do it until i
oh probably be another twelve years
oh you know i like what i'm doing right now
but uh but what if they pay for it
they've i think they have maybe two people a year go get get their p h d
because i know i know a couple of people here that work for uh
they civilians or uh military
i think i think they're military
but i mean the guy is still in
and uh h- uh he works over in maryland
and so he's doing his masters here
they gave him like a scholarship like for a year
and he's doing it in like in a year and a summer
and so he's getting that
and uh they said like they got a lot of benefits and that
but uh this guy
i mean you can earn a lot more money
so you say
i go why you still there if you can earn a lot more money once you've get your your your masters
they go well they got a lot of benefits that would go with it
well a lot of times it's you know a lot of times it's not the money
they they like what they're doing
they you know they feel good about what they're doing
but i mean i mean you
once you get your masters you can be earning between anywhere between like thirty-seven forty-five thousand a year
and and that's not what they're paying
well it depends on what rank you are of course
i mean like i say if you're if you're you know if you're at an upper level in the rank category you know you're probably pulling down close to seventy grand a year
but that's uh
it's like it's like uh in i b m
in i b m you can get certain points and uh everyone's a manager
but nobody can get one more point to become you know like whatever you need to earn so much money
i i mean i b m is like
there's a joke about i b m which says you know it's like uh
all all the major companies get into a a boating race right
and so i b m says well we have we have to have a team right
and then they come in last
and they have this whole team you know analyze why they came in last right because the person asked for it
he goes uh the problem was that there were five people saying row row row and one person rowing right
so he goes have you come up with a uh have you come up with a solution
you know it's like everyone's a
but you know it's like only use like one person does the work
that can be that that can really slow you down
well that's the way it works
i mean that's that's why they're having problems
i mean everyone's a manager
i mean it's like it's like the people that actually do the work there are uh very few
and then the other people just plan it you know
it's like it's like have you have have you ever seen the commercial like for federal express where the with uh the think tank
like all these people are just standing sitting around just going you know like what shall we do
and then this guy from federal federal express comes along
and they can tell you where your package is anywhere any time
and so it's like the same thing with i b m you know
so they have this think tank
and they got to come up with ideas
but see uh the the thing is that i b m is so stabilized that everybody will buy their stuff
they've got a they've got basically a uh you know a lock on a lot of the market
and a lot of times you figure you know with the support that they provide you know
people generally go with that because they figure that the you know you probably won't get fired for getting i b m material
and it fails
and you're dead
where's if you try something different they'll they'll say yeah
why didn't you buy why didn't you try something more mainline
well i b m doesn't fire anybody
because uh what they do is they they put you in a different job
which y- you actually are like sitting around not doing anything
so you quit
i mean that's their policy
like if you're stealing something or doing anything like that
but they won't let you off
what they'll do is like
so they'll put you into keeping up the paper you know
and then you say that's not my job
so you quit
so in other words that's the way they force people out
that's why they can say you know there's no layoff policy
but it does- they don't really say that you know
you're you're always going to have great career conditions
he- hey that's kind of sad
but i mean it's like it's like they they have just like different policy
but it's like i b m like never in their commercials they never put down any other company you know
well they're the standard right now
or as far as that goes you know people think of computers they think of i b m a lot of times
and the main
because see what happens is they have a good backup policy
and anybody can fix it
and so that's what you're going to go for
well you know that's that's a that's a big thing
and and you know it's like for example like leading edge
they they made like uh small personal computers
but what they do is what they did i don't know is buy all the parts that i b m would throw away
but it can last five
and so that's
i mean they're still around i think
i've seen well i've seen them around anyway you know
they buy all all the things that i b m throws away
and they and that's why they're so compatible
because i mean
and by the time you have computer for five years you're going to throw it away anyway you know
or they have to anyway
well i mean there's like well
i mean one t- one of my teachers got this computer which you know
it's like uh voice uh synthesizing stuff
and he got that
he said you know it's like uh
and it was wonderful
and then when you tried to erase and correct you know all the errors in your voice it takes up all your memory
and i want more you know
and it's like jesus christ you know
because it's like one second of recording
i mean you put into wave and you want to correct the errors into wave
i mean it's like
i mean by the times it transforms into wave by mark off model
and you put it in there
and you want to correct those
and then you know you're trying to make the the wave smooth
so you can approximately
imagine imagine what it is for us to make mark off models you know
well when you get you know when you get right down to it the uh the more they can do for you the more uh like i say the more the more memory they're going to require
both both in terms in ram as well as uh you know standard memory or disk mem- disk base
well like they say like nobody can get enough you know
and it's like i was watching this program on t v yesterday
and they were showing this like three d g- three d graphics view of like
with just graphics on on a
this is like this is like video game stuff
but the only thing was that it was just lines
i guess um i'm going to school while i'm working at t i
so there's not a whole a lot of time that i've got uh for hobbies it seems like lately
but one of the things that i do when i've got some spare time is i do some woodworking
and that oh i guess ranges anywhere from uh carpentry work to um um some types of furniture and um oh i don't know what you would call them knickknacks i guess stuff you hang on the wall to put a mirror on
and i made some um candle sconces that you hang on the
there's something about working with wood that that i enjoy that
because it's it's out there
you know i don't have to worry about getting stuff on the carpet except when i track in saw dust
and the wife gets kind of aggravated about that
but then i get the opportunity to vacuum
so i guess i get some of both
well when i have time i do like to sew
um i had been doing a lot of crocheting
and i would help her with whatever she happened to be doing
and then she would go to these uh arts and crafts shows and sell her needlework
so a lot of times i'd help her with that
but i think the the temperature has been pretty good so far for working outside
do you find you do most of your your uh crocheting or your knit work around christmas time
and my husband says i do it you know make afghans so i can keep my lap warm
well that's kind of what my wife says
she enjoys doing it during the cold weather because she's always got something to cover her her legs and feet with while she is working on it
i think she made three this year one for uh my father-in-law and then a couple of brothers and sisters
so those things they take some time to make
it's it's um um um
but you make it in strips
and it's real easy to do
and it's just that it doesn't keep your feet quite as warm because you do it in strips like that
well that's kind of like quilting
well i'm not sure what she does
first thing that comes to mind is some kind of chain stitch because she starts and goes all the way across you know back and forth until she winds up with this big piece of of afghan
usually single crochet would is is always starts it off
we have a a very small phone company down here
well i guess that's that's one way to end a conversation
well it gets a little aggravating
and and you know sometimes they get disconnected when i'm talking to them
we planted um potatoes and onions and bell peppers
uh what else did i get in there
i think i had four uh jalapeno plants last year
but i i've got s- i've put them i chop them up and put them in jars and usually give them away because i there is no way that i can eat all of those
but always got to the keep those planted
oh my husband doesn't like them either
but i can always give them away
well that's kind of the way i am um
i planted uh zucchini last year
uh i planted four hills of them
and those things just flat took over
um it wasn't until late i guess in the summer
and i'm not sure when a good time to plant those is if they should be planted early or later
i would think so um
seems like these all they all went to uh to leaf
and it wasn't until late in the summer they started making fruit
so i don't know if i
but i don't i hadn't looked at a farmers almanac to find out when a good time for zucchini is
probably the same time the the other squash is though
well that's true
most of the okra that is growing around higher is is uh later okra
well that's about um
well i was just going to say it's a little over six or seven minutes
so whenever you feel comfortable about concluding well i'm
oh just any time
well all right
an and thanks for participating
well i've enjoyed talking to you
well they range from let's see about a year and a half to nine years old
i lost one one time uh
and he'd never been outside like you know by himself outside
and it started raining
and i was hysterical
i was i was
i mean you would have thought a child had died
and they laughed at me
we uh we've gone through the same things with ours
we've had you know they've been ill
i mean i take off work
to take care of my cats you know
and then we had a baby
and its like all right who comes first the cat or the baby
and and then when we go to sleep at night you know it's like my husband and i have to try to get any space on the bed because we have all four of them up there with us
oh how funny
and they didn't used to be actually
but they got kind of wild and weren't doing very well inside
so i put them outside once i got a house
and they're doing great out there
but the other one the first one i got he doesn't want anything to do with outside unless you're there
and lord knows what happened to him
we started out with two with two outdoor cats
but our neighbor decided he didn't like cats and shot one of them
oh well he lived through it
oh i couldn't believe it
we went through like twenty-two hundred dollars worth of vet bills
oh my gosh
the the cat almost died
and but he turned out to be such a wonderful cat
oh he loves life now
oh i imagine
and he's like oh thank you so much
but uh oh that was a traumatic experience for us too
oh i can imagine
uh well uh from what we can tell it was a pellet gun
and then he started chasing him with a bull whip
oh my gosh
but uh luckily enough you know we found the cat in time and uh rushed him to the vet
and it took us about six weeks of in and out of the vet and surgery
i mean he started off as a stray
and then we did all this for him
but oh he's been a wonderful cat
but uh we wouldn't ha- we wouldn't have them
i mean i don't see us without pets without cats
there's just uh there's this they just fill this void
i ke- i keep talking about getting rid of my outdoor cats because i feel like i don't i can't take care of them as well because they're outside
and it worries me that one day one of them won't come back
and i feel like they need a big home a nice place where someone can have the time to play with them and things
but i can't give them up
i just i go hysterical when they don't come home
and you worry about oh who's taking care of them
oh oh yeah
and every time you see one hit on the side of the road you say is that my cat
and you go crazy thinking it might be yours
well i didn't realize my husband was such a sucker for animals until i brought one home one night
we we- i had one that had we had we had to put to sleep he got so sick
and uh well i fell in love with this uh it's a chinchilla persian
and uh brought him home
and oh my husband just died
you've got we've got to keep it now
my my first one that i got
so i found this one
and uh actually it was on a sign at taco bell drive-thru that said free kittens
and i thought
and he was the only one left
and his mother had been killed coming back across the road to make sure she'd gotten all her kittens
and he was the last one she carried across you know
so of course i had to take him
and he is uh you can tell he was weaned too young because he'll nurse on your ears and your fingers
and he said he was probably weaned too young which he was because his mom was killed
but he is the lovingest cat
everybody people who don't even like cats like him
he he doesn't have any front claws
but he doesn't bite anybody
he's just he's just kind of there real friendly and docile
oh that's good
oh we just uh just love them
they uh you know get to feeling so lovey and dovey
and they'll come up and just start kneading in our chest
and it's like oh your claws need trimming
we do we call that doing biscuits
oh it just drives us nuts
oh i just love cats
i had i had a dog when i lived at home
but they're a lot more trouble than cats actually
and they have so much more personality than a dog
and but oh they're so much fun to watch them play
oh they are
and they just act so funny
oh we've got
well the two that were outside they're like brothers
i mean i've never seen two cats so close
and uh they uh will get to playing chase through the house
and it is hysterical i mean
and then the other two cats will follow in pursuit
i mean it sounds like a train
and so it just sort of echoes through the house
oh how funny
they're just they're they're just uh they're wonderful uh
uh we have uh bonzo bear poindexter and felix
oh how sweet
and what do you have
and they don't look a thing a like
and rascal is a black and white short hair
and they came from the same litter and everything
we have uh uh tortoise which is a black and and orange
and she's so ugly
i mean you can't help but love her
she's she's the oldest one and but uh very possessive
i mean it's like nobody messes with her mamma
and uh i mean it comes bedtime
and she's right there
well in fact i got her when i moved out of the house also
and so yeah
i mean oh if something happens to her
oh i know
and i'm like no
and that's okay for weekend
but cats are good all the time
i said now you do like cats right
have you seen those uh
and it had this man sitting on a couch with his date
and there were cats hanging all over him hanging on his clothes you know
and the couch was ripped up and down at the bottom
and they were just all over him and sitting on his head the whole nine yards
oh the whole time i was pregnant they kept saying are you getting rid of your cats
i'm like uh no no no
oh i wouldn't either
we just just love them to death
well it's been nice talking to you
well it was nice talking to you too
so well you're you you take this subject much more personally than i do i suppose
well take it back thirty years
if you were educated you got you know you might teach for a year or two before you got married
if you had if you were a teacher then you know that was it until the kids were little
you you weren't supposed to want a job
there was not there's not supposed to be any reason to use this education or this brain that
and then and then of course today it's supposed to be all the other way
and and uh your kids should be totally happy in day care because everybody else goes to day care and and we have these wonderful people who are who are totally prepared to tea- to teach your child everything they need to know in day care and we'll see how the generations go
but but uh a really good day care is probably going to cost more than you're going to make at the job
at least for a lot of women depending on on what she did
i've i was an engineer with uh mechanical engineer with t i
and uh i did it for six years
and for one
well i had one while i was pregnant
and then one while my oldest was a year old
and and it just drove me crazy
i couldn't put in enough overtime that was necess- or that you know things that would come up at work that would require me to stay late or to come in early or to do something on saturdays as is you know as is needed because my husband for a long time was out of the country also with uh with work for like three months
so it was you and the kid
well that's the thing see you know
you know the technicians work the eight to five job and know when they're going to be there
but if you're going to be more professional oriented then you've got to have this to be able to perform well on the job
and so it was
in my case i just uh decided that as long as my kids were little i would be better off at home with them instead of driving myself crazy trying to do everything at once
so you figure one of these days you're going to go back to being an engineer
well actually i've found out that i'm not going to go back to being an engineer
i'm i'm i'm a photographer now
i have i have branched out
but when i went to college it was i felt like i couldn't support myself if i decided to be a photographer that it would just have to be a hobby
and i'm very mechanical
and mechanical engineering interested me
so i did that
and then i you know i did that for six years
and then i stayed home with my son and did nothing
and found out that i was that you know it was great
but i was bored part of the time too
and i wanted something else to do
i mean you figure there's got to be more to life than sitting here playing with this child
it's it's great while they're really little
but as they get older and they're more independent and there's things to do then it's good for them to go to different
i mean it he goes to a a mother's day out program now once a week
and so they're getting they get the socialization with other kids and you know and not really school but but a different authority than mom once in a while you know kind of learning how to deal with society
and and they need that you know to be able to relate to other people besides the same person every day
and i need it for the break
well that's the other thing you know
well still taking care of the children is a very important job
and and someone's got to do it and be able to do it right
that's that's the whole thing
and and if it's not mom then then dad or somebody's got to move in there and do the job because the kids really need it
well i think the biggest thing we're going to see coming up in the next ten year even in the even now they're starting to do it
but i think it's going to be more in the next ten to fifteen years is that there's going to be a lot of women
and they're going to have to work it out to working part time
because if if i had been allowed to work you know maybe thirty hours a week instead of fifty hours a week i might still be working basically full time or part time if there was if there had been some way to work it out
because i liked my job really well
but i was just pulled in so many different directions
i was it was just driving me crazy
and now with the photography that's you know it's working
that's what i'm doing is working part time because i can put my kids in a day care situation for a few hours in the uh week and use those hours to do
the thing that i'm doing is taking school pictures in day cares and in mother's day out programs and also soccer teams and you know different stuff like that
so my kids can be in day care for a few hours a week
or my husband if it's you know uh when he's at home can take care of them
so jobs have to i guess become more flexible
i think they're really going to have to and not and not just for mothers for fathers as well
well so so that's another thing that has to adapt is you know the the father's attitudes about you know who whose job is this
well it it's his job too
because as far as housework goes you know men can do housework just as easily as women
and thanks to a lot of new inventions housework doesn't take as much time as it used to
it's just convincing your husband that that's important or that it's important enough for him to do it
and you you you
because if he saw mom doing only that you know all the time he was growing up then it's hard to think of it in that other uh that i should do it or just to think about doing it rather than having someone tell him to do it
i know that was a big thing in our house for a long time was that if i wanted my husband to do something to help and even though we were both working the same number of hours and and doing things i had to come in there specifically and say this needs to be done
and a man might say out loud well you know i understand this
and i agree
but still he was raised with a mom taking care of him and that's a very hard attitude to change
and without and and it's just they don't look at things
they just you know just scoot it on another spot on the sink and put the next plate down and in a while get around to it
and i think most women walk in and and and with oh got to clean all this up got to get this out and this in and this you know taken care of instead of having someone say now this needs to be do- this is the time this needs to be done
and a lot of that is is how it was drilled into you when you were a kid
which brings us back to the idea you know someone's got to be there taking care of the kids to drill in these you know drill in the right ideas to so that they know that uh you know male and female are both responsible for doing this and uh
and i think that's that's going to show up a lot more now in the in the next generation of of boys and girls
it's not they're not going to the boys in this next generation are not going to have to be told as much this needs to be done because mom was there saying that dad is there you know
you both got to they were both working at whatever things were needed to be done
but i think in between we got a group of kids a generation of kids who didn't learn to take responsibility because mom left to go get a job and dad didn't move in to fill the gap
and so basically no one was taking the responsibility and i think that's happened in a lot of cases
and it's going to it's going to
un you know some time day care is really good
but sometimes it's just it's baby-sitting
it's someone you know keeping an eye on the kids
but the kids are basically doing what they want and not really having any relationship with the adults to say you know here's what's right
and here's what wrong
and here's what we expect of you
and i felt like when they were young that was the time to instill it
that it could be it could be added to and strengthened as they grew older but when they were little you know
and this is the way because i it's that you know
when you when you if you if you teach them when they're little the way you want them to be and the things that are important to you then you just you add onto it as they get older
but if no one does anything when they're little then it's twice as hard as i think as they get older
well she's usually in bed by this time
but she's staying up late tonight
you know my dad was a very traditional dad
and when i was a child i didn't really know my dad very well
and i miss that
and i want
if woman's role like we said if women's roles change drastically men's roles will too
but men have to be convinced of that
and a lot of it's for the better
some of the some of the women's roles i think are almost for the worse because we're losing out on some things
but i think if we can if we can expand the men's roles at the same time like your taking care of your child and your dad probably didn't very often i know mine almost never did
and we went and saw the rescuers down under under over the the break
do do you have kids you take to movies
and it didn't get as you know as good a reviews as like the little mermaid their last one and got all kinds of academy awards and things last year
but this one was i thought was excellent
and i can't believe how good they're getting with their animation now
it's just just the special effects you know
and in this movie this there's this boy
and he rescues this uh bald eagle
and uh and it's a huge eagle you know wing span of twenty feet or something like that
and the boy actually rides on his back
and he rides through the clouds you know
and you see him coming out of the clouds his head coming out and then the bird coming out
and it you know they're flying all over with it
and i mean i know they there must have used been computers or something for animation this day
but it was just so real realistic and lifelike and good animation
well roger was a composite one
there's one there's a movie i've seen roger rabbit
but uh i enjoyed that show
that was made in a few i don't know several years back i guess
latest latest one i've saw which was a mistake to go see was lionheart
he was he's of course uh i guess he's trained in this uh martial arts of some sort
but the plot was bland
chop them up huh
or he's singular i guess you know
you know how they can make any of any single one of them in a movie to be a super superstar of any sort you know
but chuck norris of course could be just about equal
or and all of them i guess could be in that fashion
it was about uh a
french foreign legion fellow who deserts to go help his brother's wife who got who became a widow because he was selling drugs
and he got killed
really uplifting huh
so he deserts and goes to new york
and he starts out by fighting to make money
and then he moves on to l a to where that where she is to just help him out
it was really i mean the hollywood really must think there's some real dummies out there or something
i haven't heard i hadn't heard much about that movie
but uh well i guess that's one i won't go see
well it was worth the buck i guess
oh you went to the dollar movie
they show up at the dollar movie right after they get come out
you know they're usually not not that great or didn't do that great anyway
uh i want to see uh that new one uh that won all those academy awards this year dances with wolves
what what what
i i absorbed all of that movie in one sitting
uh i guess what made it so good was the cinema- cinematography
the the wide open the spaces
and uh well it had an excellent story line
um i thought an excellent one too was misery with kathy bates and james caan
but that was a well directed and acted movie
it's a little on the violent side but then what movie isn't anymore
and you know and p g used to be r
and seems like the rating system you know is kind of switching that way a little bit
well i have no objections to it
it's just uh
and it's a matter of your taste uh
it's just that the rating system seems you know instead of having x now they have what n c seventeen
they just changed it because x had a connotation with it you know
and even on those type they don't show what you expect
but what the hey
so i knew the story line going in
but they changed some things in the movie
but i thought the movie was really good as well
that's about all the time i can i can spare
but that was a good show i thought you know
i read about how they did uh an article on how they did all the special effects with the submarine
you know that wasn't a real submarine you saw in the water
it was it was all done in studio with smoke and mirrors and all the hollywood magic
i thought you know
that was in the water you know
i hear this movie f x part two coming out is uh pretty good
it was uh
you ought to rent the uh f x part one
but it it's f slash x
huh what's that about
a uh special effects man who somehow gets involved in this um
oh i'm not sure
but he he gets involved in some sort of bad dealings with somebody
and he has to go underground
and he uses all of his special effects knowledge in doing what needs to be done
to to fool people
and using makeup and using the all the props and whatever to get to where he needs to go
but you need to rent the first one first
uh if if that is that the second one follows the first
i don't know if they have the uh original actors on that first one to that one
i mean hollywood i mean they were doing their dealings with that before they even got over there i think
well they had some
in some of those you know they i guess they retitled some movies that were going to be about lebanese and and you know and and americans
and they decide oh make it iraqis and americans you know
and they just change the title and uh and reshot a few parts you know where they yeah you know where they could
i guess they figured we wouldn't can't tell the difference between an
eventually i'm sure they will come out with the the the proper names
i guess they they'll probably come out with a lot of movies you know
it was it was such a rout though you know
i don't know you know
they probably do the story of someone who was shot down early in the war or something and how he survived or or about or about those two newsmen or whatever that got captured
well i think we've probably
keep on watching those movies huh
and uh we'll
uh my husband and i just bought a just moved here recently
and uh we bought uh this house about uh i don't know year and a half ago
what we have here now is just a basic three bedroom two bath brick house which is uh completely different from what i had had before
when i was working and before i married uh i lived in a little town south of here that is just full of old homes and uh historic old houses and things like that
so i uh tried to
i was in the process of renovating a house and uh that was about seventy-five years old
so uh it had to have everything done from top to bottom to having it leveled jacked up uh new plumbing new wiring wallpaper paint
you you are experienced i would say
well i i really did enjoy it uh you know
well i agree
i have done something uh like that too only not nearly as extensive
but it must be interesting now trying to do something to a basic ranch
that's that's true
when uh i met my husband he was living in an apartment at the time
and and uh the town that i was living in only about eighty miles from here
so uh you know i we
and as you probably heard from the in the dallas and texas area period the housing market is just unreal
i mean you can get things for such a song
so that's that's really why we ended up in a house like this
this is not what we you know what we want to stay in forever because i have to have my i've found that after doing this other house i have to have my hands into stuff
you know i'm always just wanting to paint and and wallpaper and redo and redo
so uh you know i i'm ready to get ahold of another one that i can have a little more input into
well maybe you can uh make that one charming and and make a little bit money uh
that's that's the key you know
the thing is uh when we moved in they had just uh painted wallpa- we're you know wallpapered new carpet and everything
so i feel sort of uh you know like it's sort of defeating my purpose to go rip everything out now
so uh we'll see we'll see how much longer we're here
well we just moved to charlotte
oh oklahoma of all places
so i know
as far as the market was concerned and i'll tell you uh we we had kind of a charming house
but not tra- not really uh traditional looking
and uh so i tried to make it after i sold my business
i in in
oh it is
and i considered it a full time job and when we did uh
we kind of had planned this uh trek to the east
and so i think some of the things that i did paid off
one thing that i did that might even be a good suggestion for you uh was something i did on the outside
i love old estate estate sales
i happened to go to just a little estate sale that
where the couple uh was very old
and uh all the men started going down to the barn
and so i th-
well shoot i'm going
they uh auctioned some tools and
but then they went over and started uh auctioning this big stack of bricks
and so well i thought gee i've been wanting to
do some brick uh walkways for a time
anyway it ended up after some pretty uh heavy bidding
oh my word
and so my husband and i loaded bricks in his
oh my word
but what we ended up with was about four thousand
and so what we did
but it needed
it was quite large out to into the yard
oh how fun
oh how nice
and so for
and he he did the digging
but i figured the sand and all
leveled it and and
and it turned out beautifully
oh i bet
and what satisfaction to know that you did it in such an inexpensive way
well it nearly killed me
but but you did stag- stagger back and say oh doesn't this look nice
well let me ask you
they're fixing to sell it again but and move again
she's a renovator a lover of old things and you know they have to be doing something constantly
and the patio that came with that house uh was not laid on a like
i don't know if you can put some sort of a plastic sheeting or something un- on on top of the sand and then lay the bricks
but they have they have a problem with these little tin- like sand bugs or something that drill in between all these bricks
and of course you know you have the uh the weeds that come up in between the bricks or and things like that
i i didn't have that trouble because uh we laid the
but we laid those bricks about as close as you can get them
because when you start
and we put them on a base of four inches of s- sand
and then we uh we swept sand in between
but but it was an error to to leave like an eighth of an inch or whatever
that's probably because they had you know
every spring my mom says we're going to have a par- a barbecue and tell everybody guess what
we're going to we're going to redo the patio you know
but uh they just they just haven't brought themselves to do it
and i also used a rubber hammer a lot
rubber hammer and uh and and prob- you know
if they have problems with uh sand bugs of some kind i think all they need to do is probably put some insecticide down in there on a oh a fairly regular basis
well the thing that's funny is they've done uh they've done things like that you know
and then it's like in two days time they'll come home from work
and those little things are back
and so i don't know what they're finally going to do
and then she won't have to worry about it
well i think i think she needs to take them to the extension agent and ask him what they are
or what is it that will uh
what it what it is that'll that'll
i think in this area or most all areas they use you know
and you know they're
oh that's true
but my my dad farms
and you know she's always telling him isn't there something that that you can bring home with you that kills everything that you spray you know out in the out in the field that you can get rid of
it might it might do it
she's got so many flow- she's got just a gorgeous yard so many uh flowers and her her four cats you know
so she's sort of uh real funny about what she sprays
i think uh you probably just need to make sure that it dries
very very careful- uh well
well gosh deb we could talk all day couldn't we
i i was just you know it just seems
like i as i said when i heard the what the subject was i thought oh gosh i haven't thought about uh what i went through at that other house in so long
but uh i don't know
and i thought that would be the hardest thing to do
but uh gosh you know i ended up wallpapering every bedroom in that house uh up the stairway
you know i just had a ball with it
and i've sworn up and down
my mom's uh my mom's great grandparents had this huge victorian house in paris texas
and the one thing that she ended up with is was the old door
that was that was on the front door of that house and she has that up in her attic
and i have sworn that it
so as far as looking toward the future you know that's my plan
i think though because uh you know as a
i uh uh i guess it actually changes
i do a number of different things simply walking with my wife and sometimes my daughter will come along on her little bicycle
uh and then moving up i run in the mornings
not every morning it probably averages about two days a week and then with my wife i actually go to the gym and lift weights which isn't i understand quite exercising
but it's along the lines
well um that's a hard question to answer because i do physical things but i don't always set out for them to be exercise
and um i play racquetball
but i haven't since i've been out of school
but that's going to start soon again and um i play softball once a week which is kind of more recreation than exercise
because i really don't like to exercise
i think that's the basic point of it is i'm not i i don't enjoy it if i know that it's exercise
but if it's like a social activity or a recreational activity i don't mind so i have to disguise it
so you look at it more as a task
i mean i'll voluntarily clean the bathroom
but i won't do it if i have to do it
so i'm thirty-two years old which is probably different than yourself and so it's interesting that as you get older you begin to understand that you need to exercise
my job at texas instruments i have to sit in front of a computer all day and make phone calls so that i don't get any exercise doing that and plus there's a build up of stress so i need to go out and take those walks after dinner
and i need to go out in the morning and run
or i'll just get nuts so that's kind of a motivator
so even though i can look at it as a task the you know i kind of get the i get some kind of global benefit from the whole thing by saying well i'm lowering my chance of heart attack and thus that type stuff
i i do all that
i'm doing that more and more than i used to i'm getting better about this knowing that i need exercise and doing it but it's still at the task stage
or are you
well it's a
and it takes you know
that that during that time the stress from the day goes away
i get to share whatever i did with my wife and and vice versa
going to the gym is is actually something different than than like
oh and the running
and i enjoy that too
so running i i'm at that point which you probably get to after about six months of dedicated running where you don't feel your muscles any more and you don't think about the pain of it
you you you take the time to relax some how
and you think about other things
and that's no fun
and it's so hard to get past that for a lot of people
the ex- the uh weight lifting on the other hand is actually you know
i have just a i don't i'm not a huge person
but just going to lift weights on occasion with my wife
and my wife thinks the same thing about both me and herself that get that little bit of definition in your muscles is is attractive so that pays also
so so i guess that aspect of that takes away the work the with my wife which is nice
i love her you know
but also uh that that long term benefit of a little bit of tone in your muscles
i haven't really brought myself to go to the the gym because that's very stressful to me
because i feel i felt real competitive there
and i need to find some place i could go and not feel like there's all these people who are just huge and hulking that are
i don't i don't let that bother me
i'll tell you the sit ups and push ups are excellent you know
you you're you're struggling against your own body weight you can d- have variety by putting your feet higher or lower by putting your arms further apart or closer together by doing them real quick or real slow and you can actually get a good wo-
you can i know in the push up at least you can get chest muscles and the back of your arms quite built up just doing push ups
but i do have my ride
oh is that right
i'll do those once in a while just you know like at eleven thirty when love connection's on and i can't sleep
i'll get up and stair step for half an hour so
it's i guess pretty pretty healthy
but i don't have a regular plan that's i need to get started on that
well may- you know maybe not
i'd say i'd say at twenty-two you don't necessarily need a plan as long as you're getting getting the exercise otherwise
and what's real funny about plans is that there's a struggle between uh when you when you add something to your life when you add a plan to your life
well the answer's sleep right
well star trek or you know it it it's always trade offs
and you actually have to as you get older you have to really think what can go and what to to to replace this thing
it's i mean not just exercise but anything
and uh i don't i don't think you should worry about not having a program yet
i guess if you care or if your wife your future wife uh gives you a reason to care which helps
well i hope so
the biggest problem well like in this part of town seems to be the attitude and the atmosphere in the schools that uh you know you can throw money at it
to me it seems like the schools are reflecting society in a bigger way you know because i mean the general values that we're teaching kind of conflict with what we expect out of people in school i mean
is it the do you think it's the values that they're teaching in school or the values they get from home
uh well the values more or less at home and the t v just a general
i mean learning is not a revered endeavor really
i mean it's a lot more
it's socially well i won't say socially unacceptable
but whereas like in uh a person that uh stud-
and things like that are a lot more glorified generally in society
and i think that carries over to school a lot
i i i i think that the biggest problem is uh with the uh with the home environment being part of it
you know if
i think too many parents expect uh the school to teach uh the moral aspects of of things to the st- to the kids and you know while we're not going to worry about uh teaching you manners or teaching you respect for anyone or anything like that you know and then expect them to pick it up at school
you're not going to do that you know
you're going to carry carry with carry to school uh out into the world you know what you learned at home
and uh uh i think that that part of that showing up now you know with with things because kids i think have probably less respect than for for people than in in other things than we may have seen in the past uh
and part of it's the the family i think
and part of it's uh the living conditions of certain people are subjected too
and i think that's that's that's another root problem
you know i wonder if that's a root problem or not
because i think about that a lot
and it's just like everybody likes to blame everything on drugs now
but i wonder you know
oh that's kind of side tracked
but uh i just remember seeing on the news the other night they had the thing about how catholic schools are doing so much better i thought well you know of course they're doing better and not so much when i was growing up
but uh they still had a a better success rate simply because they started with a lot better raw material
i mean everybody that went to a catholic school had uh at least the parents did at least had education as a priority like you said and kind of had a whole conducive atmosphere to it
and i wonder if not so much that uh
well i think it's like you say it's it's the socioeconomic mix
there you know the they're
you look at the schools like that where you've got a lot of kids who are basically uh that might be more well to- well off you know going to a private catholic school or whatever uh
and and they're not all that way
but you know some that are um that they're they're not quite the same as the kids that are going to the inner city uh you know public schools
but uh this this was actually inner city people were sending
i mean just because their kids had the ability and the and the drive to do try and get an education they didn't send him to a public school you know
well you know in a lot of cases like that where you know if kids are going to a public parochial school like that it's it's because the parents are more interested in them receiving an education it shows i think it shows that the parents have some uh desire for for the kid to do do well you know
and that may be passed on down to the kid as well
and uh maybe they pick up on that
and then from the other aspect um maybe the uh school itself has has has more emphasis on uh trying to do a good job because the classes may be smaller uh
they may be able to to give the resources that's needed to uh to do a good job
and what do you what would you do to fix the school systems
uh with uh
i would try to i guess to see about getting parents more involved with try to to come up with more ways to do that uh uh uh stress the importance of education to both both the parents and the students and uh more more classes that i think that are
and i think this is happening some around the country in terms of um morals trying to teach the kinds of things that that aren't getting taught at home and uh and and respect for other people
uh i think that's a big part of it
you know people you know
if you don't care about property and people you know you're not going to care about uh about learning i think
i wonder a lot of times you know people i mean a lot of times people literally tear apart their own schools vandalism wise
and you get
i mean it's been a while since i been in high school
but i can't remember exactly what goes through their head when they're doing that
but you got to think in a way it's kind of a outward showing of that they don't think they have a chance of doing anything and take it out on the school
well you know and i
that's not an ea- but that's not an easy task you know
that's why i say it's it's a tough question what would you do
because you know even trying to instill those values is kind of hard when uh when when you're growing up in you know in a home which may be uh just the pits
and uh you don't have any any kind of a good environment to live in you know
it's kind of hard to say well you need to take care of other people's stuff as well when you're when you barely have anything yourself
and i think that's i think it's
well i uh i guess because i work quite a bit with lawyers i'm not a lawyer uh that i find a lot of things are so specialized that i'm not sure
and i i look at it more from the civil side of things that juries have any sense of of the value of and worth so that they have real problems when it comes to uh uh
they can find guilt or innocence uh but then when you quantify things and that might also hold criminal trials for how many years is appropriate uh that they might leave it to somebody else who uh has expertise in that
i don't think the jury should be the ones that that put the sense- sentencings down
or even a panel of of lawyers if if it got to that point might be better at than just regular civil people
not knowing you know exactly what things are from from murder on up to like tax stuff you know
because i find that uh
and uh as a say i i tend to be around uh civil cases because i've been an expert witness some
and uh many matters are so complicated that it's so hard to uh come up with the fair value uh or the fair sentence
and one thing that you get if you have some expertise is uh you know the range of of possible values or terms or you know how heinous was the crime
uh that uh
and most juries over a period of five or ten years you might sit on three
and so how do you relate as to whether this particular armed robbery was a you know worth five years or twenty-five
and and most people that do sit on juries
some people just sit on them once in their lifetime you know if they're that lucky sometimes
or you know what whatever the case may be and and may not have any idea of what what the standard punishment would be for it
and it they may have some different idea
i mean it might be more important for them to put a sen- sen- sentencing down that was uh longer you know that didn't fit the punishment didn't fit the crime
or not long enough or you know whatever the case may be
i i think the judges do have that that better knowledge of it
the only thing i worry about sometimes is if if you get somebody in there that that has a name that is the defendant and you know sometimes might have more pull which that does happen
i mean we can't say it doesn't because it does happen
i mean not everybody is you know has has the right morals sometimes
people can be paid off or politically or whatever the case may be
and sometimes that's not real fair either though
well one of the others things that gets me on on the juries is that often in the newspaper i i tend to hear two things that well that go on
uh and many of those get overturned or get reduced in terms of sentences or get changed by a judge or an appeals court
and that never makes the the press
and so when uh you or i as an individual gets on a jury we tend to have certain mental images of what's what because we see the headlines uh
and we don't have a- again a lot of knowledge
so we don't know what is really going on what is uh really the range of sentences or awards that are uh are actually uh in the end applied
well well also what i don't think is fair either is when you have like a say a rapist come in
and and his attorney gets his sentences sentencing reduced because he's gone to a lesser charge like i don't know what assault or something or
but which that doesn't make any sense to me either
and and and the person that was raped or whatever doesn't
and they they're put on like they were the ones that caused it or whatever
but to me when you do the crime then you should pay for whatever you did
and and you shouldn't be able to go on the lesser charge
i don't i don't think that's right because all's that's going to do is say oh well you know that was a breeze
i can go out and do it again and you know have the same thing happen
that's that's not right
well that's where uh the role of juries is is restricted
and i'm not sure i'd want to change that aspect of it
one is it's restricted in the sense that juries only decide the charges that are actually uh brought you know if it's first degree rape second deg- degree rape or whatever they only get to decide on that
well okay this person has been charged with first degree rape uh
and you can decide guilt or innocence on that
uh such like maybe in murder they get to choose whether it's uh premeditated or one or two of the lesser degrees
the other thing that juries are restricted on and and at least to me this has been one of the frustrating things in my even in my own experiences that you usually don't get to hear all the information
and uh i don't know that juries have a right to know more because in a sense we call those safeguards
but often juries hear only a fraction of the of the story when they have to decide guilt or innocence
and to me how can you how can you make a decision if you don't have all of the evidence in front of whether it be whether it pertains to the case or not
somebody thinks it it had because they've got it there
so the lawyers the two lawyers are the ones that have all the information
and the truth that's brought out is uh as i say when i've heard about you know
the whole truth and nothing but the truth is that they want uh
they don't want uh the whole truth
i mean you can say
because stories look very different when you hear different parts of the of the truth
well that's just like that old witness game
well it's a game kids play too
but uh somebody did it just for your train of thought where they they showed something
and they asked
they there were uh like four people
okay um let's see
s- social changes
that sounds like not as recent social changes too like back to the sixties or fifties i guess
i mean there's plenty of things to talk about there
uh i was hoping that you would
uh it seems to me that uh
y- areas i think
true today you know
there is a a big difference in the uh economic um status of uh people although i think that has been true uh always
and they start out very poor
i think uh m-
and we're uh home schooling
so education you know things that relate t- to education um
uh for instance
and things that are being taught in the home are not taught in the home rather more not than are and children being put in day-care centers from very early
and and i think that a lot of these things that have been happening such as the day-care centers and things are having a big effect on the social changes
and they're not um th- they don't have the self-esteem that they need to have
and they don't have the um a solid family life that they need to have to confidently and deal with the things in the world
and uh i think we're seeing a lot of rebellion and things because of that and the things like the gang gang things that are happening
and and um
but it seems like
some of these even ladies that that'll work and have
a baby and then you know after two or three months
well that that i mean that's very young for a baby
and they think they have to
i i think that if they really tried they wouldn't have to
i i think that if they didn't that and it became more of the standard not to that uh i don't know maybe companies would start paying men more so that their wives could stay home you know and have a more solid uh foundation for the kids
i mean they're going to
like you said i mean there's they might be saving money
i mean even if they had to pay more now i mean in the long run it's going to cost society more to force two people to work even though it's higher productivity is short-term
it's already it already costs society much more because of it
you know it
trying to do all these programs like headstart and things like those you wouldn't have to do that if mothers would stay home with their children and do things with them you know
and i think uh a lot of it is selfishness
there are a lot of two parent um
oh rather than she needs the money just she wants the stimulating environment
so she does it partly because of the money but partly for herself too
it's interesting how w- uh
is that uh is is it like uh a preschool level then or through grade school or
i i have uh one going into fourth grade and one starting kindergarten and then a preschooler
oh i s-
oh well you sound busy
so you're teaching them
and i think uh it's becoming uh more popular then it has been for a while i think
but uh i can see more and more families going to it because of the problems in the schools
um and a lot of it is discipline problems
and you can tell which kids have been in day-care centers
it it's really obvious to look at them and watch the way they act and things
that's pretty sad because i mean i don't know something's got to change with the schools
and that's the where it all starts
and if we don't start making changes in the homes
and educating uh you know
i know they do do some they do have some classes in um high schools
the aids issue is is a bit of a problem
i guess the first thing that comes to my mind not having any immediate friends with that problem is is the financial end
and how can a country stand to uh spend as much or much more than they already are on such a problem uh
but then that kind of thinking is also tempered with the the knowledge or at least the the rumor i'm not really sure if it's true or not that uh we're not spending as much per let's say afflicted person on cancer
uh there's some uh
it seems to be doing much more damage and affecting much more pe- many more people than aids
and yet uh more people die of it
and yet the funding has already uh exceeded
aids has more money than uh breast cancer
well that's interesting isn't it
i mean if it's true
i i've i've always heard these things
but uh i've heard it on more than one documentary that uh they were complaining that whoever's sitting up there making these decisions or whatever institutions raise the money and uh
so let's give money to aids
and yet we've had breast cancer problems for years
and it's just
one of those uh course one of the shows i saw was taking it from the angle that since it doesn't effect men it's not going to get funded
and uh having thought about that for a while
but then i got i got to thinking the the number one killer of men seems to be the prostate
and there's only one test that just recently got developed uh a blood in- antigen uh antibody test for the antigen in the blood
and that's fairly recent
and yet men have been dying from prostate cancer for years
so it's not really cured
it's not uh not that heavily funded either
and then that seems to be one of the the major uh problems that men have in the realm of cancer
so i don't know
i i guess there's just some strange public opinion as to who they want to give to uh be it through different organizations march of dimes type uh telethons or or bicycle rides or whatever how they fund whatever uh illness they wish
it's kind of hard to to get an even keel on that
i mean it's really hard to say
well there's you know a hundred thousand per year affected by this one
so let's give it this amount
and then this other one's only a tenth of that
so give it a tenth of that and and just keep
well i'm i'm glad i'm not the one that's that's in charge of of making those decisions
they uh you wish that there could just be money for all these problems because they're all so serious you know
i mean it's not so serious i guess until it affects your family
and then all of a sudden it's the most important thing
but but then again we really we really do have it as a society to decide which things we need to address
i uh i guess i it it frightens me to think
and many of those things uh if they're not able to to be insured then the country's going to pay for it one way or the other
whether it's through prevention or or
you know the the other thought that i had uh
i've had several minutes to think about this after i uh
while i was finding people i uh i could think about the topic longer than the person that receives it
so it's kind of a a unfair advantage
but the other thing that i thought of on this is i wonder if there isn't enough money uh in our economy or in our system
uh it seems like there's so much that goes to things that don't really do a whole lot of good
i mean yeah
but we have such an affluent a- society society that i wonder if if we took a little from here and there and the other if we might wind up with a a cure for just about everything
you know you hear these ridiculous figures for pizza
or you hear these these phenomenal amounts of dollars spent for this that or the other
and then you have all the arts that that are nice and aesthetic
but are they that enhancing for the for the masses you know
but uh had all that donation and time and labor and effort gone toward something else
and me too because i eat out a lot
well i travel
i do about forty percent of my time is on the road
so you eat all your meals out
well i'm also married
and my wife is an a one cook
but she enjoys eating out
so i have to share it with her
and uh actually it's very easy for me because i i have a prac- make it a practice when i am out
so i look for just about anything
and it's it's uh it's a lot of fun
i don't have to worry really worry too much about price considerations because i you know
i was going to ask you could you go to you know nice places
and it's it's really great
i i i like different types of food
so where are your what are the places you know memorable places you've eaten
uh oh you na- okay you name it
you've got one down in uh down near uh addison
uh there's two restaurants that i particularly like that i every time i get into texas or i get into atlanta georgia i make sure i go
and that's houston's
it's it's great
there's a a restaurant in um right outside of reading pennsylvania it's called alfredo's that does not look like a restaurant that you would really want to recommend to a lot of people
but it is fab- fantastic
uh there's a restaurant and i don't recall the name of it uh in uh panama city
of course not too many people want to rush back to panama city uh panama the country uh panama
because i was thinking
well i i grew up in panama city
this is the country this is the country panama all right
and uh but i have gotten to quite a few
and i go to canada and get quite a few restaurants up there
i you know and i know the locations
and i know the places
but i lot of times i don't remember the names
but particularly down in your area i'm looking for some some more restaurants
so i you know i don't know what's what's down there
why which one were you going to recommend
well i mean there's so many places here you know
there's just it's just lots of good mexican restaurants here
but in the addison well about everything that you could want in dallas is in the addison area anyway
i mean now there's a new italian place sfuzi that has a great i've not been there but it has a great reputation as one of the best restaurants in dallas
and now there's one in addison
i'm i'm writing it down
it's f s it's s f u z i
and it's on it's in addison
and it's a great place
also a great place that they have like cajun food is copelands
now i really like copelands
um one down there is the uh i think it's an old schoolhouse
oh the yeah the i know
well i like the food
but i don't care for the clowning around
see uh uh
i i when i went i thought the food was not good
oh i've had
see i when i went i thought
the people drove me crazy first of all but then i just thought the food was over priced for what it was
well that's great
do you like like southwestern
well now there's a good place in addison too called blue mesa grill that's on belt line that's close to houston's as a matter of fact
and um it's great
i mean their they have i think
sometimes i've been when i thought well it wasn't as good
but i went there recently
and i thought well this really is good
so that's that's a very good place to eat the blue mesa grill
well this is great
well they haven't beeped us have they
uh well they don't always
oh i thought sometimes they say you know this is three minutes or whatever
i they've been doing that when uh the circuits are busy and other than that they you know leave you go about five minutes
and then that that's about it
well thanks for calling for helping us out
i i've had one for quite a few years
but i i've not had one the last couple of years
but it's something i've always enjoyed
do you do you like boating
and we were using it less and less and less
so we decided to sell it
well i heard that's the second happiest
now i loved having a boat
he needs his weekends free or
so they hold their you take care of them
so you know you couldn't complain about that
i had a hundred hundred sixty horse uh
oh i did fish out of it occasionally
but i'm not too much of a fisherman
and uh but i but i did enjoy owning a boat
and uh uh
i just like uh fourteen foot sunfish
but i'd want to be with a skilled sailor
well they offer classes out at uh ray hubbard
well i i've always thought i'd like to
and at this stage of the game i'm not that interested in it anymore
and we go out and take them out on their barge
and they like us to take them out on their barge quite often
oh that's nice
so we we get out on the water occasionally you know
but uh uh anyway it's
i i do enjoy the lake
but uh once the children were grown
and we'd go down there
and i'd get the boat out on the you know saturday
and we'd go for a ride and enjoy it so much
and i'd say well i'm going to leave the boat out because uh we'll probably do this again tomorrow
it got to where the tomorrow the boat was still sitting there
and we never did go out again
and i'd have to go load it up the next day
uh mount vernon
cypress cr- creek springs
huh what do you take i thirty-five
you go down i uh uh you uh you go down uh
oh did you
oh we love it up there
oh i think you'll like it better
but of course it's hard when you don't have any family around
especial- we got two kids that are under two
and it's kind of tough when my folks call and they want to see them
it's hard on the f- your folks too
and your wife's folks still live in colorado
uh there are supposed to be uh some people f- moving down here from colorado springs for t i
that's right uh
uh a friend of mine's dad is was a program manager up there
but it's a good company
but anyway we're supposed to be talking about boats
so back to boats
so tell me the last time you went for a boat ride
well actually i went uh canoeing down the brazos this weekend
oh my gosh now that had to be that's boating
well what are your hobbies
well actually my hobbies now are t shirt making
well that sounds interesting
what kinds of uh sweat shirts and t shirts do you make
um right now i'm making christmas ones with poinsettias and bears and all that kind of thing
and then you um
there's this stuff called wonder under that you un- that you iron it on
and then you iron that on the t shirt and you paint around it
oh i see
so it's real fun
i started doing it as a um just something fun to do
and now i'm selling them and pretty
well how's it going
and i sold seven
i didn't wasn't expecting that
well that sounds great
well somebody has to do it
that's right you know
well what are your hobbies
well i i kind of have hobby fads i guess
when i was growing up i was was into coin collecting
and that dropped off about the time i hit puberty i guess
and then my hobbies in high school went just to the sports
i've i had a sixty-six mustang i was rebuilding
and i went on went ahead and sold it
oh my gosh
but it was fun
oh you just
well how'd you learn to do that to fix them up
all i did is uh i bought the car
and then uh you know you can
i uh was just in a supermarket
and i seen a a magazine for you know
basically it it was called mustang magazine
and and so i bought it
and they had uh some names some companies that sold mustang parts
and i just started ordering some parts
and and you know basically you know i what i did was i redid the whole interior
i didn't do too much to the engine because the engine was pretty good but the the whole interior and then part of the exterior
well we lived we lived in south dakota
and i bought it up there before i moved down here
so it was it was kind of rusted out there
well that's true
well that sounds neat
well gee i guess there really isn't too much to talk about on hobbies
that that about covers mine
and t shirt making about covers yours
well let's see
and i collect dolls
so let's see
probably o- uh about twenty
do they all play different songs or do some of them play the same song
they they all play different songs
well that's neat
i usually get them for christmas gifts or and like when people go you know to on trips or something
well that's interesting
i never collected those never collected those
well that's interesting music boxes
and i have a lot of dolls
and um and i did that when i went to europe one summer
i was in i was in high school
and i was in a tour
and we went all
it's kind of a it's kind of to establish better rapport with the different countries
and um it was called people to people
and we'd stay in people's homes
and then we got to also tour big cities
and i really enjoyed it
was that in high school or was that a college thing
so i'd like to go back because we had you know
everything was rushed everything was like an hour or two hours at the louvre you know
but but it really
well that sounds real neat
so you you haven't been back to europe since then huh
but who knows now
well does you husband uh
what does he think of your uh t shirts and
well he likes it all right
well i guess cadillac
well why would that be
oh i guess it's a general motors product
and i like general motors because they're made in the united states
and uh we've had general motors for years and have always had real good luck with them
well that's good
if you had uh no financial requirements if you could buy any car in the entire world no matter what it cost what would you buy
oh um i think i'd still go with the cadillac
i don't i don't care about a big fancy fancy
which type of cadillac uh is your favorite
oh i don't know
it it always has been though
well i've always liked
i liked the the
one year they had a couple years they had where the trunk head would look like belt buckles across the back of it
i thought now that looks sharp that looks real sharp
well i think the ones now with all of the uh fancy gold lettering and all you know i think they're very pretty
and course the top now the vin- what is it a vinyl top i think those are pretty
and uh the
i i've never really uh i've never ridden in one recently um
but they're supposed to be just real smooth
and uh they they're just always
they they look like they're sturdy you know
now they've got a unique fa- uh feature in them now
if uh if you have a front end accident at such a rate of speed the e- the engine will actually drop out of the car so that it doesn't come through the so it doesn't go it doesn't go through the you know into the inside
oh i didn't know that
so that's that's a big safety factor they've got in them now
and i suppose they all have the balloons
well that's great
so you say you've always have preferred general motors products
um i i go for things you know built in the united states rather than foreign countries
what kind of uh
but of course if i have a choice i'd still have the cadillac
i've been very satisfied with the with the oldsmobiles
well i don't think
uh let's see
now that's got that big v eight engine in it doesn't it doesn't it
well i don't know
but it's a very good car
it's a had not had one minute's problem with it
and i've had now i have twenty-three thousand miles on it
oh that's great that's great
that's always nice to get uh reliability in a product especially when you're spending you know anywhere from fifteen to twenty-five thousand dollars for for a single item
you just you expect it to do its its job
and i think a lot of a lot of car manufacturers don't really keep that into consider- don't take that into consideration you know
but that's always been something that's been a key factor in me is how reliable is this car going to be you know
price is is an issue
but it's not the most important issue
it really isn't because now you can get like five year financing on them
and so um
but i i i would go with the general motors any time
well i've always been a ford man myself
but that's all right
you know it's american made too which is good
um but i i've
ever since i guess i i was growing up my dad's always had fords
and uh well i grew up in south dakota
so everybody has a truck and my ford trucks have just
i've i've just never had problems with them
um let's see
uh invasions of privacy
uh what most annoys me are all sorts of phone calls trying to sell me things
um my sense is that something may just have been done about it by congressmen
i guess in some cases they just consider pickup your your phone and and and not let you use your phone for a while whether you hang up on them or not
um but i thought i saw something about it having some kind of provision that people could specify that their phones were not for commercial using
and uh and uh people businesses would be prohibited uh from calling for pers- for for business selling you things
the phone company uh
uh some of did too
i think i think government can do that now
and uh especially with with possibly children around
uh that could could be useful protection
and i don't have children around
but i just don't like those nine hundred numbers
so uh i used to deal with
but isn't it does not stop you from the uh dialing services
where they uh intend to sell you things
oh oh where people just just call you
and leave again that canned message on the
and you know and then what those problems has been eliminated
and i did not like giving it out
i gave out my work number but i think i'm not sure if it's by law just
well that's the thing i hated too about uh radio shack
and i don't think they're going to call me and ask me how it's functioning
and and i don't give that out
so i don't
that's that's that's one solution
but you you you nonetheless often get get people calling you
and you actually have your number
or are they just calling a number that happens to be yours
and and companies can purchase this list
and what that is is people who buy from the mail
and they have a whole list of addresses and list of phone numbers
um is there anything you can do about that like give out a phony phone number
uh some of that unfortunately is legal
so they can't stop people from uh advertising
and that and that's what it falls under
so i don't care for it
but is it a legal uh solution for some companies
so that that's the way things are
well they you know
that's that's the telephone is not the only invasion of privacy
and you've got uh all kinds of people knocking on your door and who want to uh either direct you to the right path or or want to uh sell you uh paper routes uh whatever
you know it's not just the telephone
so it's right up your alley then
but uh i sense that it's not going to happen anytime soon
but i wish it were
because i'm a i got my bachelor's in mechanical engineering
and all we do is metric stuff
so everything's metric
and then you go to read some order book or something
and it's all confusing
so i don't understand as much
so i think we should get one adopted permanently
well i guess that is the policy
but it's been the policy for a long time
and nothing ever happens
uh i suppose things some things well happen slowly simply by having it taught in the schools more to the extent that that's happening having a new generation come up that's more used to it
but i g- guess it's it's easier to switch back and forth than it used to be uh be- be- because of of uh of computers coming into everything
i think people need to understand more like what a meter is instead of how many feet in a meter or something just get used to using all the terms
because someone says a kilogram
everyone wants a wants a conversion of that before kind of recognizing it as a as as as as a concept to hold in mind
uh i i i don't see that it it it can change it very quickly
i mean we're not the kind of society that that uh that something can be posed upon uh by government will
metric system no one's very uh no one wants it at all seems like
uh the the the public is just very conservative that way in refusing to change measurement systems uh money dollar coins anything like that
and and and it
i it's pretty tough when you get everything confused though
because i know we do a lot of problems and things
and they're half english and half metric
but even if it's english they should just have one
well i mean unfortunate- i think people like you are relatively rare who are coming up against this problem every day
your your average guy jogging down the highway wants to know how many miles it is to his destination
uh we have signs up on the n i s t campus here speed limit twenty-five miles per hour forty kilometers per hour
uh but that hasn't been adopted very widely
it says uh metric signs next hundred miles
or you have highway signs saying speed limit uh eighty eighty-five whatever would be the appropriate number
so it would be more like uh like ninety i guess
uh you suddenly have a
do do do you know where you are
i i i meant i meant down like in the elementary schools
oh in the elementary schools
i mean i think
but we never actually went out and measured anything or did anything on one system
i mean i think my children learned the metric system
but it doesn't get get emphasized over the other
and that's about it
so uh well uh what kind of vacations do you like
well uh i haven't been to many places
but i have a opportunity to go to uh paris france uh with uh with my friend in april
she is her uh her family you know lives there
and she's only been there once
so i'm hoping to g- i'm praying i get to go uh
oh that's great
it's it will be probably the most exciting place i'll ever get to go
have you ever been to uh like new mexico
uh no actually
i have been to europe once and to haiti and uh
it's uh well it's in the caribbean
and it's the western half of an island
and i was down there with a program from the college that i went to where we would just spend like three months in a foreign country most of them third world countries
so what did you do when you were in europe
uh well see i went there when i was in high school actually and i mostly went to germany and visited some friends of my family and uh hung out with them worked a bit on one of their farms and also went to a youth camp
uh uh uh well not that much
are you just kind of sight just kind of uh
i mean i wasn't a great asset to them or anything
but i you know drove a tractor helped them weed beets and that sort of thing
and uh yep
and i went to a youth camp that included working at an old people's home
and that was pretty interesting
and while i was there i visited my aunt and uncle who were uh staying for their vacation in france in nantes which is on the west coast like right across from england
uh so uh where in france are you
and uh um how long do you plan to be going for
uh two weeks
but we're only going to stay two weeks
so that might be fun
cooking class you know
and uh what else are you planning to do if anything
museums you know
uh actually no
uh the closest thing i did was go to some like uh restored castles and stuff
that there is some on that west coast of france
and i went to a vineyard or two in germany
um that's neat
well uh well
oh g- where have i gone that's anywhere
um short term i don't think anything's going to be done about it or probably should be done about it
uh are you saying you don't think anything should be done in the short term
uh the short term the recession is getting getting top attention
i i think that you're absolutely right there
the other thing is is that we've got these um these all these bank defaults going on and and savings and loan defaults and and uh uh
and that effectively adds to whether it's officially on the books or not
and that's got to be paid
and and uh so this creates a pretty serious problem that's going to continue to be with us for a while to come
um i'm not really uh sure that i even understand why the administration is proposing for instance tax reductions because it seems to me that if if if they're talking about reducing uh the tax that needs to be paid or the tax that's currently being paid then that can't it seems to me it can't possibly you know help with the the deficit picture
um and the the severity of the deficit picture already limits the options available or limits the degree of tax cutting you can do without uh bringing on on serious problems for the longer term
so that that that's the current predicament
it see- seems like it's it's a kind of a catch twenty-two
i mean it's it's the um
my understanding is what they're try- what what supposedly they're trying to do by reducing taxes is to kind of jump start the economy the idea being that if people have to pay less money in taxes they'll have more money to spend uh
and if they have more money to spend then that will be a spur to productivity particularly commercial productivity uh which in turn will generate revenue
but it it seems like like uh it's sort of a uh a sp- an unending spiral
and it it it uh
i'm i'm not sure that there's any real genuine truth to the uh the idea that that uh that decreasing taxes particularly the kinds that are being recommended bye-bye the bush administration and things like capital gains taxes and so forth is going to uh result in substantial amounts of money you know for consumers to spend
i'm not sure how i feel about paying on the quest the long term quests that tax cuts are worth at this point
it uh it would seem to me that there are other things that the administration could do
well well first of all you look to the fed to fight the recession as indeed it has with interest rates
i think what that's done is it's it's it's help keep inflation from um uh
well at the moment we're doing very well on inflation
what kind of things do you think can be done in in uh in the long term
well can be done or will be done are two different things
um at various places to look for for cutting the budget first of all i consider more defense cuts than are already planned depending on the world situation
but there are various other areas such as as farm subsidies that ought to be slashed
uh a lot of entitlement programs like education aid i think uh they should put a in
the reagan administration took all such entitlements to the poor but left them for the middle class uh
in the longer term uh we we we'd do well i think to make to make uh reductions there
i think that i think that that i agree with you certainly in the second situation
and i think certain entitlements i i'm inclined to agree with you too
education happens to be one place where i think that we would foolish to um uh
oh i see i see what you're saying
but schools that teach you trades you know beautician well and often exists only because of the federal programs that they can take people and tell them they can get loans for their full tuition uh and the school gets paid off immediately uh and then they don't provide very much education
and then they and then the people default on the loans
well i would have to agree with you if there are circumstances like that uh around uh
and i i i can't confess to having any substantial knowledge of that sort of thing
but but taking what you're saying at face value then i would have to agree with completely
oh i do too
um well i like to cook um but i don't like getting too awfully fancy about it just because um uh it's too much pressure
and so i don't like to arrive or or when they arrive for me to be completely worn out
and it's it's like uh yes
people would come and say could y- would you come over and make lasagna for me
it's like well i can't really give you a recipe uh i can i can just do it
and it's it's fun
and we had we did lasagna and garlic bread and uh yummy
um boy i like that
uh i do too in fact
well i'm planning a
and naturally this is appropriate because i'm planning dinner for people tomorrow night and then the next night
so tuesday night there'll be eight people here altogether
uh actually one thing we have done quite a bit through the holidays just because it's a real easy is just baked potato dinners
and have you know like three or four couples come over
and i'll do the potatoes and you know like butter and cheese and stuff and have everybody else just bring a couple of toppings whatever they like and it turns out great because i mean you've got like hot sauce and taco meat and barbecue and you know bacon and all that good stuff
but it's it's inexpensive plus it's real easy on the hostess because you can just have the potatoes ready and just have a salad with it
and you got a great dinner
it's it's real easy
i'm in favor of very little clean up um very little planning
and that it's it's fine because then i can just say okay fine
and it's pretty cool
well one of my favorites if i don't want to have other people bring stuff i just want to treat them is to make chicken and rice
oh i love it
oh you do
and then you put rice in the bottom of the pan
you pour bouillon or chicken broth over it and and you put the chicken in then pour the uh broth over
and you can put mushrooms in if you want
and then you just
over uncooked rice and you can either microwave it
and it just
oh how neat
and it's really moist
now i've done it with where you put you cook the ri- well i guess you probably could do it same way but cook the rice and then take a can of like cream of mushroom soup or cream of chicken soup and put a little bit of white wine in it
and every once in a while i'll put in i'll slice white grapes
and i'll put in there
and that's just because i'm not a real big wine person
but i like it
and then just bake it
and it makes a wonderful sauce over the rice
well i'll keep that one in mind
it's that was one of the first things i made for my husband because i was like um
yeah i could actually find something i could cook real easy that would be kind of sort of elegant kind of
or you know semi
but then i hadn't thought about doing it with uncooked rice
so just like in a thirteen by nine pan
you put in um let's see what was it three quarters of cup of rice
but you have to put the water in proportionally
i think it was three quarters cup rice to two cups water two cups um broth
i i use that for br- for rice
and for when i cook pasta or something i'll put a little bit of bouillon in there just to give it a little extra flavor
um now that would be good
um let's see
i've done it in the microwave so often lately because it's it's really easy
i do i do microwave too a lot
but i think it's about an hour
or maybe it's only half hour
how long would it be how long would it be in the microwave
um you just
until the rice looks fluffy and and not overdone
you know before it gets overdone
do you just brown the chicken to get it colored or do you go ahead and let it cook through
um i'd let it cook just a little bit just so that the cooking goes a little faster
ooh this is a beneficial call
but that one's an easy one
a friend of mine makes it where she goes ahead and seasons up the with the soup and the wine put in garlic and onion powder or chopped onions if you want to do that you know what ever however much effort you feel like putting into it
but it it makes a great
i mean i've got a two year old and a four year old
and they love it
and because my daughter calls it her gravy
and i mean
uh did you watch the bulls this morning
i watched a little bit of uh of the bulls game
and i uh had to leave
uh in fact i i think the bulls were ahead when i uh when i left
they won by they won by two points
uh they were behind as they headed into each quarter
and then they came back in the second half
and at the end i think they were uh looked they looked like they were closing it out
and then detroit kept coming back
and uh isaiah missed a three point attempt
and uh i think the bulls won by two
one of the uh commentators said that they expected that the bulls would uh if they continued at their current pace uh set an n b a record for seventy wins in a season
they they do
and they you know
i think by uh by relieving some of the pressure off of uh of uh
you know he doesn't have they don't have to rely on him to score ev- you know thirty or forty points at every at every game
well they they're they're balancing their attack
and i think they look like uh they'll repeat although uh here in the bay area people are real impressed with what don nelson's done with the warriors
oh i know
i saw the w-
i saw the the second half of the game last night
and they were impressive
now i don't uh i haven't kept up with what was going on with uh with the
well they traded away uh mitch richmond
or is it tim hardaway
one of the two uh who along with uh chris mullen was you know
and and they made a heck of a threesome
and they traded either richmond or hardaway to sacramento for billy owens
they've got th- the warriors have got a team uh
and uh i think that will be real interesting to see what they can do
and the lakers are down i guess in fourth uh position in the west
and i don't know
in the east i don't know uh
is it boston in uh first place
uh i think boston's in first
i'm so depressed with the dallas mavericks you know
but i mean just this whole year has been just disastrous for them
and uh you know they're going i i think they're going for an all time record of how many l- you know losses in a row
well actually actually the the the dallas area here uh pulls for dallas
uh san antonio pulls for san antonio
and houston pulls for for the rockets
so there isn't much crossover huh
i mean not a whole lot you know
i mean d- you find them they're find them be to be pretty loyal uh in with the local teams
uh you know it's kind of i guess it's kind of like uh there in the bay area you know you don't find a whole lot of uh of sacramento fans
because s- san antonio isn't that close to you are they
it's you know it's it's about the same uh same distance from here to s- to san antonio as it is from there to sacramento
so it's not something you'd drive
so it's yeah it's not really a local you know
uh he does a lot of local stuff there in san antonio
and they i mean they have got a great club you know
i mean of course drafting a franchise like him certainly
i mean that's i think the way it uh i think that's the way it works now in basketball
you you know magic was a franchise for the lakers and you know uh bird for the for the uh celtics
and you know uh you know i used to think that that one one player really doesn't make a club
but it really does you know
and you can see the decline in that team
once he left you know it's it's just not the same uh it's not the same team
well i think you're right
and i think isaiah thomas would fit in detroit
and i think those things do make a difference
and there are marquee players
and i think i think jordan and the and the bulls have to be uh considered the likely favorites
uh i don't know how good portland will turn out to be by the end of the year
you know i wasn't i i d- i watched only a few minutes of it
and i wasn't paying attention
uh and so i don't know uh
but phoenix you know phoenix and portland have both been very good clubs
well i guess we're uh forced to finally to do a lot about air pollution
and low polluting fuels are being experimented with ethanol and other types of fuels
i you know i assume
but i i don't know for sure
i just know that um acid rain apparently is a big problem in canada from would
i think the automobile definitely is an area and any any industry that burns you know
and then i don't know about chemical pollution
but i don't know if that affects outside
you know i i think seems to think seems to me that's what they were asking about was outside
and the thing i can the only thing i can think of would be cars and factories
um i guess there's been a lot of pressure to um do away with the c f c's in these spray bottles which
that is well that's destroying the ozone isn't it
again i that's what i hear
and and there's this big debate apparently about whether the ozone there's a hole in the ozone or not
but at last i heard it was uh discovered that the hole was bigger than they thought
well it is scary
and i think it will uh continue to force us to clean up our act
i think something too that you probably see in older states all we we do it down here once in a while we will have a cold spell is where people will use their fireplaces
i i i'm wondering whether it's going to get to the point where you can't
they've passed laws that for habit
gasoline lawn mowers um
and it's really bad in places like los angeles
and and uh it's not too bad around here although you see it you know more and more in the sky
and people in this country are really wedded to their uh cars
and our economy seems to
and this i think is one of the big problems
in this area too since you know in texas we're so spread out
but i know in colorado i have witnessed that where it just uh it just stacks up at the when the rockies starts
but we're even getting it here
we can drive into when we've been on vacation or something drive into fort worth or dallas
and you can tell it in the mornings too
and there's just a brown fog here
and we don't even have any mountains that are
but they also said that more dense the population and the more we crowd together the worse it gets
well that makes a lot of sense
i mean i i hadn't thought about it that way
but it it
and uh they make uh making more and more high-rise buildings
and uh so yeah
and we didn't see this a few years ago
and i think
and i think that that more and more it's becoming apparent to people that the earth which includes all the people on it and everything that's going on it is a is an organism of sorts
and that there is a a whole set of organic relationships that if we start to destroy one part of it it's going to tell us about it
and uh we're going to feel it
and i think it's going to be real interesting and particularly in light of what is obviously going to be a big structural change in the economy
uh in this country uh whether people are willing to get out of their cars
and in this country uh the the solution that that people seem to think work are politically unacceptable
and uh i have a little sports car that i enjoy using
and i know just like anybody else how much fun it is to drive
but i think uh we're going to have to make some fundamental changes
and and i'm i'm not sure how long it's going to take or what it's going to take because they keep saying that the economy is going to depend on how many cars and
and it's a shame too when you do see somebody driving a big car just one person in that
uh are you married
and do you have a family
uh yes i am to uh both questions
and do you and your wife have a budget plan for your finances
we uh uh
basically there's the you know the expenses that are fixed during the month you know the ones that come every every month
and we uh enter those into uh into a spread sheet
and uh whatever is left uh after that we you know we sit down and agree on kind of what what sort of range we are going to generally going to shoot for
i see uh
well that's basically what we do
uh about every every three months or so
and we sit down and just write from the largest bills down to the smallest and then we divvy them up between our four pay checks
i work part time at night and he works and my husband works full times days
and so we have four checks
but that works out nice because we get paid every week
and so that does help
and then uh we don't have a lot ex- extra for extra spending
but uh it we have found that works the best
in fact we found it easier to divide the major bills up you know cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half
and so we are not taking a huge sum out out of one
and then the next pay check we're real short
we found that uh
it's definitely helped uh get a handle on kind of the unnecessary expenses
we thought it
well it helps you to focus where your money goes and and i am sure you felt the the same frustration before you got on a budget
and then you're saying my word where did all that money go
uh and also we have found that if we write down
and we did this
but we did it for about a month
and we wrote down everything that we bought
and it was really interesting to see
and like i say we haven't been real consistent with it
the other the other thing that that we've found that helps is you know we tend to fudge on the budget a little bit it's just to uh uh get up the money in advance and put it in uh uh so long as it wasn't you know unreasonably high but for things like food expenses or whatever just put it in uh
and that way it kind of forced us to uh
wel- just stick to that
and then once that was gone well
if the entertainment amount was gone for the month say oh it's gone
that that sounds like a really good idea
and it really helpful
uh have you developed a savings plan or i r a s or anything like that yet
we we haven't
we our our initial goal was just to retire debt uh completely retire debt for car payments and credit card
we are just at a point where where we could start thinking about it
oh that's good
so are you still going to school
i am actually in the
i guess we're talking about exercise huh
well first of all i i ha- have to ask you how how old you are
oh i am twenty-seven
well i am quite a bit older than you are
and i i do exercise on a regular basis
oh you do
well i do uh jazzercise which is an aerobic uh
it's uh you know a national company
and we have a jazzercise center here in plano that has classes like all day long
so you can
or is it the same thing
it's really it's an aerobic routine
yo- you warm up
and then you have thirty minutes of aerobic activity starting you know slowly and then working up to uh you know a high heart rate
and then you gradually go down again
and you do that every day
and this is a club
or uh do you belong to a group
and you buy as many classes as you want to
and then you just go in whenever you can
so like i usually choose to go at nine thirty in the morning or a nine fifteen class or a ten thirty class in the mornings
or do you go alone
and that's one of the frustrating things cause i can find very few people to go with me and most of my friends that are my age don't exercise
or they might play tennis and since i am not a tennis player uh you know i don't get that
but i am you know i am between i am in my late forties so uh there aren't many people you know that want to do that
most of the people that are in the classes are young mothers you know with with children between the ages
you know young women
well what do you do
uh i really don't have a routine
and that's what i do every day
well now who do you play with
and uh that's about it
but when i graduated i haven't done much
but i don't have a problem with weight
well see that's that's th- really good
and i think that keeps a lot some people from exercising
i mean i don't have a problem with weight either
but i think i don't have a problem because i exercise
i mean people are always saying to me how do you stay thin
and it's because i
but you'll come
being twenty-seven you don't really have to worry about your heart rate and that yet but as you get older you will
and i well everyone's told me my waist line is going to expand one of these days
well it might not
because everybody's been telling me that too
and so far it hasn't happened you know
and i i just feel like you know
so that's why i've kept active in that way
but you don't play any other sports but basketball
but do you ski
uh i use to
but it got too expensive
oh did it really
cause i know that skiing in utah is is suppose to be
a lot of people do that and
well i have never skied before
but i have friends that go to utah all the time
oh they come up here
and they think it's really and they ski
well is it tahoe where you ski from
but there's a fun- there is a place in utah called a funny name
but it's like oh heavenly
huh i've never heard of that one
well maybe it isn't in utah
but they said they've skied heavenly
do they exercise much or i mean for skiing
i mean i've talked to people
but most of these people ski enough so that they don't get sore
and i am really sore after
and then is it your quadriceps that are the worst
and it's strange that you can do like i did aerobics you know all the time
and then i went horseback riding
and still i was so sore
and i couldn't get over
actually to tell you the truth i think uh jury selection is a uh prime uh discussion topic in terms of possible improvements on uh uh finding of uh guilt
uh i certainly can't argue with that
definitely does need some improvements uh
and the lawyers can throw people out for no reason whatsoever just because they want to
the uh the uh peremptory challenges are limited to i don't know how many
but you can
only i got kicked out as uh the last selection
but typically you know basic- uh typically uh everyone gets involved in uh the jury process
and i suppose an elitist might say well you really want someone who is well educated to be able to to winnow the facts from the from the prejudice
but it still has to be a group of your peers
so if it's your peers and you're not educated then
so if you're a nincompoop on trial you'd you'd have to have nincompoops to uh
you want you want a nincompoop jury because they'll sympathize with you a bit as well as hopefully being honest people and do their best to comply with the facts as they were presented to them
so that's why the defense is there picking through them whereas at the same time the uh the prosecutor sitting there picking through them because he wants somebody who will give him uh a guilty verdict if the facts warrant
so uh i think the jury selection process is pretty neat
but i don't think that the jury ought to be the ones picking the punishment afterwards
m- you're talking about the person's already been found guilty right and many times i've seen on trials they have on t v the jury will make a recommendation as to leniency or as to the death penalty or whatever
but i think that it should be up to the judge and the uh lawyers to make the decision as to what the actual penalty will be
uh and i think that would provide a more fair sentencing procedure
well i suppose you may be right on that
matter of fact i've heard that i've heard that some of the information uh is prevented from reaching the jury like uh mitigating circumstances or or preceding uh criminal record or things of this nature that
well preceding criminal record according to the judicial process has nothing to do with the current crime
but when it comes to uh sentencing for punishment of course if the person's never done anything bad before according to the judicial system then they're going to lean towards a slightly more lenient side
and the jury's supposed to be notified of criminal records when it comes to sentencing by jury
oh is it
oh i didn't realize that
but when it comes to what kind of sentence you're going to lay down i think that uh that they should
i don't i don't know that they always have because i never sat all the way through a jury trial
so you what you're saying is this if there is the second offense then you execute them
well if it's a second offense the punishment should certainly be more severe than a first offense because obviously the rehabilitation process did not work the first time
so you got to give them either more time in the system or a different process that will hopefully work better
when it comes down to things like alternative sentencing i'm all for that for uh small crimes infractions and misdemeanors or parking tickets or traffic tickets that have gone to warrant
what about uh white collar crimes like uh theft of trade secrets
well uh say embezzlement right
you get a guy down the street who comes up uh carrying a kni-
uh with regard to uh to jury trials i you know i i really feel as though uh jury trials are are uh whatever system has been been used historically in particular jurisdiction you know is really the the only kinds of things that you can use because the the jurisprudence is you know based on on uh you know on accumulated n- body of law
and if if you have a situation where you change that body of law then all of sudden they they start they could start going back and digging up all these cases that uh that would be handled differently were they judged by today's standards
so i i really don't think it they can really do much of anything to change it
it makes you wonder uh had the jury been a different group of people what would have happened with that outcome
uh and th- and the problems that that has come
well maybe they used a little bit too much force with stuff like that
but then then you know the defense lawyer addressed each and every one of those blows apparently
that's that's bad
and you know the other two guys sat in the car and they didn't get beat up
rodney got beat up because he he you know he pur- you know he involved himself in some sub self-destructive behavior
and uh uh
everybody says well this is the nineties
and they're going to rebuild
and it'll be even better
you know some some black guy with capital is going to come in and invest in that area
with everybody with that mind set they they're they're going to that whole area is going to be turned into residential ghetto you know
and you might even be able to to use it for for a bombing test site you know
t- they're only going to suffer
they they've defeated themselves with with their looting and violence
uh i understand why they were upset by the verdict just because even those of us that aren't black or uh don't live there or whatever we all saw the same thing on the on the tape
well e- everybody is saying this is going to be a new era
and we're going to reexamine this thing
hey the b- the average person is going to take a look at that and say suspicions confirmed
they're a bunch of animals you know
i mean there are forty people that are dead as a result of that
and i'm just trying to determine you know how you address how you weigh you know rodney getting getting the hell beat out of him against you know forty deaths
and there's no other
i'm not su- exactly sure uh what the circumstances surrounding the deaths
and i'm very upset that the news media has not identified those deaths and and pursued it you know because i'm interested in the circumstances surrounding this thing
i you know
or just a by- an innocent bystander or somebody got actually beat to death or what
and and so i but i i suspect a number of them
you know you you see film of people being pulled out of a car and shot you know in in the street
or or beaten
and and my reaction is i would have run over fifty people before rather than stop
and uh and there there would have been just nothing but carnage after after after if i'd been at the wheel
that's that's exactly how i feel too
i wouldn't have uh they wouldn't have stopped my car for any anything had i seen them coming
but i was just wondering since you're you're in you're back east uh and a little closer to the the bigger cities than we are in idaho here
you know how capital gang they always say well inside the beltway they think thus
and so and i say well wait a minute
and i don't think like that
in what uh section of the government do you work
oh that's interesting
an- and so uh uh and and the reason i'm doing this whole thing is because rick
whose another government employee wanted a spe- segments of my speech
that that were done a year ago
and he wanted another collection a year later
and so this is my seventh call
oh i see
and so that's that's why uh
uh around here we have a program where uh we we put out the the we separate the bottles and the cans and the plastic stuff from the newspapers
and we keep the newspapers in a in a
they're collected twice a month and the trash and and this bottled stuff that is put in a in a little blue bin that's picked up and sorted out into a truck
so they ma- actually have about three passes at this collection one for the regular trash one for the uh uh you know the bottles and cans and one for the newspapers
but i gather you do not separate uh the bottles and cans
they they do that on the truck
they separate them as they as they you know dump them
and you know one guy comes around with his truck and and dumps it all in there
and i think they're they're running out of uh you know
the sanitary landfill i think uh is you know running out
of course uh you being from new mexico you've probably been n- to washington especially if you're your present location
not only have i come to washington but uh i find it very amusing that uh the thing that was just instituted here is very similar
we also separate newspapers from all of the other stuff which goes into the bin and gets separated in the truck and uh landfill space is in deed the driving factor here
and in fact uh despite all of our open space out here landfill space is still uh very hard to come by
my you've got a lot a a lot of nothing out there
i mean there there's got to be a crevice between two mountains that nobody gives a doggone about that you could you could use for landfill
but if somebody can make a regulation about it they will
well what other we- we- what uh what unique things you think uh that you can do about it in in what in los alamos
uh other other than nuking it
um in fact los alamos uh has uh done a fair amount of research uh in recycling things in general
um it it involves for instance uh creating biological organisms which can remove heavy elements like selenium and barium and uh other things from uh waste material in general and uh and purify the waste of specific uh uh nasty elements
well isn't that a that's a that's pretty uh upscale uh trash uh uh situation
i don't think anybody around here would understand all the all those exotic techniques you know getting rid of the heavy metals
and the thing that just was in the local news bulletin was
uh uh they've uh looked at uh plutonium and uranium and uh some other similar things to try to remove those from radio active waste
and again this is driven by all of the documentation and uh e s and h uh uh considerations that uh people are uh worrying about i think much more than they should
actually i've been involved in recycling for long before it became fashionable
back when i was in graduate school i did all of the recycling of the uh paper from the computer center
and uh in fact i think i was the first person in our department to have my thesis published on recyclable pa- recycled paper
well that's certainly uh you know uh getting into the swim of things
i i think it should be i- it should go to the to the heart of the matter though and say okay guy
you y- everybody gets you know five pounds of garbage that they can throw away you know
uh but more than that every week uh you've got to pay by the pound
i i think i think people would be would get very very you know they'd be very careful about how they bought stuff
the only alternative i would see is uh and this would actually be a little more workable since weighing everybody's garbage would be a real pain uh if you did it by volume rather than by weight it would uh speak more directly to the space needs and the landfill
uh and uh and limiting the volume is probably a little bit closer to the real problem than limiting the weight
well of course that uh you know those big trucks can can probably are far more efficient in packing than any kind of little household compactor
well my exercise program consists of uh you know
it's it's a opportunity to stay alive really
instead of you know wasting my my the you know the trying to exist on the latency of my youth the good health of my youth
and what i like to do is i like to stretch out
and i like to run uh m-
i'm i like to run get my heartbeat up
i like to run about oh about two two and a half miles
and then i like to work out on uh on the uh the bailey life c- cycle machines up here at the at the holiday spa
and and i i think that you know
i've had a regiment now for about you know ten fifteen years of of doing that
and uh and i i kind of think it's uh it's a lot of work
but i think it's uh it's a lot of work
but i think it's uh it's the uh the amount of effort that's required to uh to stay healthy you know
and uh unless you do something like that y- you're going to get sick
i'm i need to get
i'm i'm pretty bad about that
i want i always say that i need to get run- start running
and i'm going to try and do that this summer
because i never have time
i i always put it off
and i don't feel like going back over to the gym and running on the track or whatever
because i'm i'm getting a gut here
well i uh two years ago i started having trouble with my knee
and uh you know i've got you know
i figured well it'll go away
well i s- you know i'm i've had to reduce my program reduce my program
and i've gained fifteen pounds
and so uh you know it's e- you know
i need to get back into swimming you know instead of running
if i can't swim or i can't run i should be able to swim
well i'm such a terrible swimmer
and i i i really feel i can i can dedicate about an hour an hour and fifteen minutes f- to this effort
but if it gets longer than that i i i- it i start not doing anything
and so so i got a real problem in that regard
you obviously are are not an exercise buff or else you'd be out there doing it
i mean i do it i guess
i'm going to do it uh because i want to get in shape
i'm not it's not something i really enjoy all that much that i'll i'll probably
i mean once i get into it and i if i if i get into better shape then it'll be it won't be as much of a a chore to me
well it's it's always a chore
i mean i started doing this when i was about thirty-five and now i'm fifty-five
and uh you know i i know that in i just know that i'm going to get blown away with some some piece of nonsense
y- you know some health related thing is going to blow me away
i need to lose fifty pounds you know
i need to lose at least twenty you know
but uh you know it's it's just uh i'm busy
and uh it it creates a problem uh you know when you're on the road
what sort of uh uh what other programs other than say running
have you have you ever done anything at all
or al- also last summer i was doing nautilus
or last year
got kind of expensive uh to r- to r- renew they wanted another fifty dollars
but uh doing a mix of nautilus and free weights i like that
club what club are you with
it's called oh what was it called
so you're you're down you're downtown
i'm at i'm at i go to george washington university
you're down there on you know twentieth and eighteenth and f g
it's uh plaza
well i'd uh
well there's a there's a holiday spa down there on on k street i think something like that
but uh i i go to the holiday spa here in alexandria
and that's pretty good
but you know evening time it gets pretty busy
but generally you know i can i can get in and get a program you know
but uh you know i i need to i need to rededicate myself to uh to doing this
and uh i got a problem uh you know ever since my knee went bad of getting back solidly into it
i mean i've been doing this for fifteen twenty years
and you know and i'm i know i'm going to get i know it's going to bite me in the ass
and so i i really don't want to want to uh you know back off on it
i think uh i'm young
i mean at one point it's going to be too late to do it
and you can recover
uh when you get to be my age and you start abusing your systems you get blown away
and just wind up having to kiss your ass good-bye you know
and uh and so the object
the topic is to discuss the uh sources where i receive news
and uh for me that's mostly newspaper and radio
so i don't get news from television
well why was c n n the only
it was unusual not to have the different sources you know of news coverage
um i don't know
i guess uh i don't even know why i watched c n n
well i know even if you watched a b c n b c or the other
i mean what's the other one uh c b s
they all were were tapped into c n n
and like you i listened to radio on my job at work
and all this week they have been having this uh a discussion about that is why uh why c n n was
well i listen to a christian radio station
and they were saying that c n n is definitely a world uh news service
and uh they
you can't really be sure of the quality of what you've got you know
uh we had some uh some people from our church went to israel uh just for a uh tour sort of thing
and i was watching on tv
they they broadcast this terrible riot
so we got all fearful for our people come to find out they came back and said they weren't even aware of it
and so it really made me question as to what how do we know you know uh if the news we're getting is any good
but uh i i'm from california
and i can remember being in uh in these earthquakes
and i mean they were they were very minor kinds of things from my point of view and it seemed you know from anyone else's point of view
but they get all blown up in the news um
well i i find it depressing to watch our
specially tv you know
it's just uh
and uh we have a lot of bad stuff uh
so then you wake up one morning
and you are in war with somebody
you don't even
well what newspapers uh do you read in dallas
uh we have the dallas times herald and the dallas morning news
but i don't i don't read newspapers
i find it hard to uh follow from one page to another
it's just something i have never developed uh an interest in
and i live in kind of a bad area where if i have the paper delivered it's stolen before i can get out and get it
gosh that's that sounds pretty bad to me
i mean who would steal a newspaper
they just come by and pick them up even if it's just for the tv you know t- uh selections of the day
so you're right
uh from los angeles
but i live in raleigh north carolina right now
but i grew up in l a
huh you work for t i
but uh i know some people at t i
and i have a couple of students who have graduated and gone to work for them
so i'm in the computer business
let's see i've i've i've never done this before
i mean i've never
so i don't know
but i think we've been talking for three minutes
and nobody has interrupted
well i i got into a conversation last night with a lady
and they interrupt at ten
so if we've done our three minutes
well all right
well i guess i would first identify myself as middle aged
having seen the last generation i guess it puts me in you know gives me a perspective on that
uh there's no doubt about the fact that when i was first graduated from college the impression was that a woman's career would consist of a childbearing years and perhaps a return to the office but not necessarily
uh now i think the change that i've seen as much as anything is one where couples uh are more carefully planning their intention on how to both share homemaking duties and also how women will uh have their children and then deliberately sort of plan how they go back to the work place
and i guess that's a significant change that i've both participated in an- and noticed
i agree uh
the equality of uh the roles now between the sexes i guess has been dramatically demonstrated with this war especially compared with uh the vietnam war
and you see women going off to wars as well as men
uh i have wondered why they allowed or let you know both the father and mother go uh
and the children are left without either parent
now to me that's kind of a drawback
but uh i guess it's a price you pay
and i also wonder about the children that are being brought up in the uh uh day care centers
well uh from what i understand there's been studies that uh these children are uh more rebellious
uh they term it as more uh creative
but uh that they uh are much more contentious
so i i don't i i guess we'll have to see another generation to see what differences a child being brought up you know in a uh kind of a uh community
i i guess one knows one's own storly
and i know uh in my children's case it was one where uh pretty much up until the older of two was in uh let's see i guess basically starting junior high
and the younger was in fifth grade when my wife reentered the work force
so i guess my experience is is just with what we did
and and so they didn't really go through the child care route
uh and we never actually experienced that
what in terms of changes relative to women in the work place and the potential changes over the the next generation or so i guess i anticipate uh an increasing equality uh greater presence of women in management roles uh i don't know whether there will be an increased amount of of surrogacy that we see
uh deliberate childbirth by surrogate mother
to be you know
not to be crass about it but uh
uh whether one might conceive
and i could you know i could envision a society where that would happen and make an interesting uh uh story or whatever
i i don't think i have a philosophical problem with that
uh i i don't have a other than than a reading and and male perspective on on the ver- on the biological urges involved relative to being a mother or not
uh i know that that my sense is that i have very much an interest and had one in being a parent
i i don't know that i uh felt myself necessarily encumbered with the necessity to have heirs
uh i don't have boys
that doesn't didn't bother me
vision more women deliberately raising children either in surrogacy or or as a professional nanny nanny as you put it uh
but it would be more of a family setting
uh i know that there are young people characterized i guess as being half my age so that by definition that means
they're young uh that in my work place who are both of them earning rather decent professional salaries who probably would consider paying a woman uh eight or nine or ten thousand dollars a year to take care of their child
or to put their child into a s- into a home setting
where they would you know like they they would get leave at eight in the morning and and drop a two year old off in a home where you knew there were going to be four other kids
and and you were paying for really high quality care
uh i have acquaintances of mine where i know that they are paying figures on on the order of what i quoted to someone because that's what the experience they want
and i would imagine if there are more of people like that with an opportunity that that's a possibility of a change that we could see in the next few years
and then you might have more control over uh the the morals that they would be taught rather than in like a classroom or a day care center
you know they're
uh well no
of of what they would what they cost
i just know i know several single mothers who absolutely can't afford it
they have to go with the a single uh wh- i mean a baby-sitter more more or less
but i think it's like about sixty dollars a week for two children if i'm not mistaken
and you have to pay that whether you're on vacation you know and taking care of the children or if the children are at home at home
i mean that is you know just a a rate that you have to pay
what what do you envision for the next twenty years as far as women in american society
i i i think that they will be more in the work place because uh the door's open
and uh it's just human nature to walk through an open door
so and i would be glad to see that
i- it seems in my experience i'm running across single women all the time
i'm i'm noticing that too
and and i notice the the a terming ex- em- emerging called solo parents
that i'm very aware of the number of solo mothers that that i encounter in the work place
and that that is a little troublesome
uh because the pressures on them are are
rather rather formidable
uh and maybe that's a change we'll see
maybe uh the possibility of of women uh who deliberately say no
we'll let the man will take care of the children perhaps
well i think we've done it
well i think we're about done
so are you a freshwater or
i i used to fish uh when i was real young down in galveston with my parents
and i never really got into that too much because you have to get in the boat really to do anything
and i didn't know anybody who had a boat now
so i don't fish too much in saltwater
uh mostly deep sea fishing for grouper and bottom fish and uh i have caught one or two small sharks and uh yes
but uh the ones i caught were never large enough to really do anything
i mean is that like a a sport fish
and there's no limit
my home is in uh pensacola florida so it's they do a lot of shark fishing in that you know in the gulf and um there's a certain period of time during the year they have all along the gulf coast from i guess from galveston to mayport they have uh shark tournaments
and you know there's part
either as part of or separate from the uh bill fishing tournaments they usually have so i have not done uh much freshwater fishing oh for you know lake lake fishing for bass and so forth but uh maybe some what they call brim and those sorts of things but nothing
uh a friend of mine no
i usually ended snagging my uh fishing partners or
so do you do you fish mainly for trophies
or do you do you eat what you fish
i used uh when i was uh working in florida i used to do a lot of surf fishing mostly for relaxation you know there are people who fish
and then there are people who catch
well i'm a fisher
oh and occasionally we'd go out on a you know full day trip you know three or four other people and do either again bottom fishing or or for grouper
or i used to catch you know i've caught a few worthwhile snappers red snappers and gray snappers and so forth
what about you you a
well most of my fishing is done at um area lakes around here freshwater lakes and um most of it
and it just wasn't working with my freshwater tackle
and uh we went fishing there last memorial day
and i caught my first bass that was actually big enough to keep
and uh that's really about it
and i fish to take home and cook
i don't i don't get too much joy out of just sitting and watching
but mainly i um i want to say i brought something home
the last time i went uh bass fishing
i was with my daughter a friend of hers and well a friend of mine and his daughter
we i was the only one who did not catch
i did not even i did not even
i have been i was out on a party boat a few years ago
and we we were grouper fishing
or you know actually we were uh snapper fishing
everyone on the boat was catching snapper snappers except guess who
couldn't catch one to save your life huh
the uh the party boat captain could not understand you know
he even even he started baiting my hook
and holding holding the uh the fishing rod
and it was it was really really really bad
uh i as i said i am a fisher
but uh i enjoy it though
i don't really get out as much as i uh as i would like too
and they do of course you know
we're only just a few not a few minutes we're you know forty five minutes to an hour away from the eastern shore here in maryland and they do a lot of fishing there
of course what i used to like to do though is go snorkeling for scallops in some of the bays or uh or oy- for oysters
and uh that i was able to do when i could go in and go down and actually pick them off the bottom
we were in uh rockport which is close to corpus and we had been fishing in a canal
and uh we'd been fishing in the canals
and all we were catching were catfish
and we were pretty bored with that
so we thought well maybe there are some crab in here
so i got my chicken and all my little net and everything
and of course there's no hook
so it can't be a fish
and crab they don't bite like that
so i netted it
and it was the ugliest fish i've ever seen in my life
and it looked archaic
i i had no idea what it was
and it had the rock in it's mouth not the chicken
but the rock itself is what it had grabbed
it was brown with these little white dots and it made a loud almost a croaking noise like a croaker does it it was the strangest thing
oh i'll never get over that
well we used to
i guess the weirdest thing i've ever caught is uh in some of the inlets and the rivers around delaware
i don't know if you've ever heard of it and it has a huge strong mouth
and they actually uh use their teeth to open oysters
that's where it gets its name obviously huh
and this is the ugliest
and i mean and they come in all si- you know
i've i've caught them from you know three or four inches long up to uh
i i don't think i'd want to even if you could if they're that ugly
they just they just look as though you do not want to do anything with them
it was it scared me to death
it was u- it really it didn't look like it looked like it was something out of the dark ages that just never died
well the first time i went surf fishing was in
and i threw my line out
and the first thing i caught was a sand shark which was probably a foot
and a half or uh two feet long
and scared me to death
and then i was fi- fished for another half hour or forty-five minutes caught a few white fish and so forth
and then i felt something relatively heavy
and i thought oh really here i'm really going to get one
i i try to refrain from their use as much as possible um for a number of reasons one of which is the you know extreme interest rate on most of them
the one i use uh of course for mostly only for business purposes is uh you know american express
not for my own personal uh point of view
plus it uh has you know from an economic point of view it has increased our debt tremendously to the tune of somewhere on the order of five to ten billion i believe uh at least that's one number for this range of numbers i have i have heard
well we uh me and my wife when when we have like extra money that we know we're going to have and we can put it in our budget yeah we'll we'll use it
but like last year i think we paid
and i think this this year we uh i think we used it for christmas
and we got caught just a few days on our grace period
and uh so we'll pay a little interest this year but maybe two dollars
but we don't like to do that at all
and you know we i think we feel about the same way you do real strongly
we uh we have several credit cards though
and i think we have a couple of department stores
but we use it the same way
i find the one i use mostly uh
but uh i try a- as with the american express i try to pay it you know as it comes in
it's it's not uncommon for us to have paid it before we even get the bill
i know when i travel or when i used to travel overseas quite a bit what i would do on my american express card is before i would before i left i would mail a check to to american express and you know have some idea of how much was there you know i'd sent them you know several hundred dollars or whatever i felt i would spend
but uh for hotels and and so forth
but uh but i knew that it was paid
i knew i knew that i had that much credit going in
sometimes you know sometimes i would go over
but it wouldn't you know it wouldn't hit me in a big in a big way because i knew that uh i would have it covered in that respect
i've i don't think we've gone that far
to pay it in ad- you know in advance before we spend it
but i guess if you foresaw that you were going to have to use it that like that
well i found i found in um in traveling overseas that uh often it would uh it would expedite things to have an american express credit card for hotel bills and so forth
plus i would uh when they uh would send the bill they would automatically convert to the exchange rate
so now the only time that got to be a problem was if the exchange rate changed drastically
uh for example i remember on one trip to france
and just in a matter of a week or two the dollar fell against the franc drastically
and whe- when i finally got over there it had fallen uh two or three francs to the dollar
so i got caught a little short in that regard
but uh uh i i was anticipating you know my room would cost uh let's say
so there's a little consternation you know in trying to get them to compensate
and i but as i said most most of all i try not to use them uh to any you know lavishly in that regard
well tha- that's good
well from where are you calling
oh from the dallas area
so you're from dal-
um i wonder how t i got g t e involved
well i know jack godfrey
and i'm also in the speech business
so when i heard that jack was going to do this i called him and asked for an
and so that's how i got
you have a very um very
your your speech is very exact
oh thank you very much
but as jack said i'm one of the the old hands in the speech business
i i've been doing it for twenty some odd years
and so uh i was very much interested uh in getting involved in uh switchboard
so uh you work for t i
so i think you get ten
so i think we're okay
well you have a good evening
well you too
well what would you have at a dinner party
well uh lately since i have children i've cut down on having dinner parties
uh i have one recipe for uh a really good um type of a meatball
and it's made with red wine and
um it's it's really good
and you can make it ahead of time and then um make the sauce when you're ready to um to serve it
that's one of my favorite things to to serve
well um i think it would probably depend on whether this was a formal or a informal dinner party
but if it was informal my first choice would be crawfish
well i guess being from that part of the country
because i mean crawfish everybody over here likes crawfish
but you know i i wouldn't have to worry about satisfying my guest
but if it was a formal dinner party i would probably think of something else like uh
shrimp shrimp fettucini is real easy to um make and everything
and it's usually well liked by people i guess
well how do
make how do you you cook crawfish
i in fact i just came back from the grocery store
and being in texas we don't have too many you know people that that eat crawfish
but they had live crawfish
um you're not supposed to i mean you're not supposed to eat them dead
well you eat them dead
because if if they are dead for too long
and you're not supposed to eat those because they're bad for you
well i'll remember that
so if you ever go in a restaurant order crawfish
i mean every once in a while you'll see on-
i mean it doesn't happen very often because it's just an accident
but if the tail is straight on it then yeah
but um you just put some cajun well lots of pepper
and they're absolutely wonderful
but there's uh they're a pain to peel for some people
i i don't know
you know we'd just have crawfish and beer or something
but there's a there's a
so um it it would just
it jus- i- it just depends on what type it was i guess
but you can buy
and usually you use those like for frying
or to put in salads or to um
but you can go ahead and buy 'em cooked and shelled
and they're more expensive of course
just um the crawfish i mean it just has a taste of its own
but um i think that
and also to get totally off the subject of crawfish lots of vegetables and hors d'oeuvres and stuff like that for a dinner party i think that that really helps
but in our family i am the one who who cooks
and i i really enjoy it
but i really do enjoy cooking
and we um we have them over for dinner
and before i had my second child we sort of had a contest going where
you know he would cook and then the next time it would be my turn and i'd try to outdo him
that that got pretty competitive
you know as
uh it was a lot of fun you know
it something unique you know
and then we got into different um themes you know
or um sometimes it would be um
and sometimes it might be the picnic out back
that's you know that's fun
and and we threatened to make the other two uh make us dinner one time
uh just to even it out since we seemed to be unfairly doing all the cooking
and they were doing all the enjoying
ridiculous and terrible just just to uh make sure that they didn't have to do it again
i'm i'm doing a lot more cooking now
but that's only because my mom just started working
so i try to have things cooked for her
oh that's nice
uh um i usually try to stay out of kitchen
it can it can be fun i if you have the time
but you know a lot of times it's too much of a rush really be able to enjoy it able
of those meatballs again she owned every christmas and and easter
whenever we have at the big get-together over at her house she makes this meat ball sauce
and it has
i don't i'm sure she puts wine in it because um she cooks everything with alcohol
i would i would be interested in getting that recipe for you if you have it around
it's um it's in the other room
one of the unique things in this it's like a pound of ground beef some bread crumbs um an egg um whatever seasonings
so salt and pepper um and chopped up water chestnuts
which is something different um
but um it makes them crunchy
and that adds something new to it
and then the sauce is just made with um
water burgundy wine and um cornstarch instead of flour
so it's not a it's not a thick
when you use corn starch in in gravy like you know when you have um chinese food
and it gives it a bit of a different consistency
well um how long do you cook the meatballs
and then drain off all the grease
uh then what i usually do is i freeze them
and then when
probably you have to heat it up for a good oh
if they're frozen you know it may take a half for them to thaw out
but then heat them thoroughly in the sauce itself
especially i mean the fact that you can prepare the meatballs so so far in advance
i mean like if if
i mean um um i'm sure that i'll be involved in a big company
and i know that my
so he's going to be
invite invite the boss over
so i'm going to have
and have to take 'em out to eat
but i've been doing a lot of things wrong i didn't know
oh they're wonderful
oh i will
i'm sure my husband will be surprised 'cause we were talking about them the other day mm- before
so which uh what basketball teams are you interested in
well i guess i'm a big laker l a laker fan
uh the college ranks um i guess i really
that's uh b y u
but they don't have much of a team usually
you never see them on a on nationally basketball
you know that's true
they uh last year they had a really good team
so they made it to the
and they usually lose in the first round
well i'm uh originally from the saint louis area
so the only basketball team pro anyway in that part of the country is chicago
so i i do pull for chicago
i mean of course this year is a good year to be a a chicago b- fan i guess because they're doing pretty good
um as far as college teams uh i know it's really easy to say
but i've been pulling for uh duke for about four years now
so i finally am feeling better about
uh but they're on uh probation this year
so you can't do much about that
so did you watch the uh final four this year
i watched every uh
and uh i was very pleased with all three games because kansas uh
you know i was pulling for kansas on the other side
so it was real nice to have the the teams that were there
i mean i i
u n l v kind of gave me the impression of being a uh uh oh i don't know a macho team you know
they just didn't seem they seemed to think they were better than everybody else
and and maybe they were
but um i was real happy to see them get knocked off
i i watched that game
and uh it was a good game
and it just
it looked like u n l v may have had more uh talent
but as far as playing together as a team that day it didn't duke seemed to have them off balance
and that uh they didn't couldn't
they they play the pro style is
the fast breaks and and
and uh u n l v wasn't used to that
of course i've i knew whenever u n l v went in at half time
see i don't know if they were necessarily behind
but they weren't ahead as much as they normally are
uh and you know that meant that they had to play a second half
and they they've not had to do that all year
they didn't have they didn't have to go through some tough games during the year
and that and that so that's a terrible time to have to deal with that right in when it when it counts so much
i mean duke's schedule was was so much harder than u n l v's that it uh it just made them a much tougher team overall
and uh that had to help them a lot
i think i think that that probably was the difference in that game
because it really could have gone an- either way down to the end you know
so do i take it that you think though that the lakers will uh
i mean portland's pretty good um
and uh they've got perkins
but i don't think he's really been a super star for them
well he's uh
he he to me is not a center
he's more of a a real tall forward
they'll make it you know
i- i- it it's going to be a war between uh between chicago and uh and uh uh boston celtics
i think that's going to be one of those that's uh that's won by the home team you know
one of those two will probably be um in there
um let me see
detroit's in that same uh that that same uh division
so i don't know
uh detroit hasn't been having that great a year this year
but as i heard isaiah came back this week
so uh that might help them
they have the they have the play-off experience
so does detroit i mean so does chicago so do- all three of them do
with larry bird back uh
they say he's starting to do starting to play
he's yeah but he's been yeah but he's been kind of up and down all year
uh one game and he'll be playing to where everything he throws up goes in
and then the next time he'll you know he can't seem to hit the side of a barn
so i don't know
i'm i'm kind of i'm not sure about him this year
well that's when
starting to be more consistent you know right at the right time of the year
oh any dark horses i uh you know
well the dark horses
san antonio san antonio is the dark horse that could could really flip in there i think
well anybody who has david robinson
he's got to be pretty much you know
i use to say akimo lija was the dominant player you know when he
but robinson's getting up there where
i mean it looks like he's going in for a dunk
and they kind of just scoot out of his way or take a step back you know
nobody's got enough beef i guess to challenge him when he's when he's driving hard to the hoop
he's uh he's
well then he's gone now
well i thought he was gone period
i i didn't read the story
but i i read that uh
well that might have been what it was
but i i guess the headlines said something about him you know that the mavericks released him or something
i maybe i misunderstood what they meant
um if they did they'd still have to pay his contract
well yeah you never know
he was making like
that's what he was being paid you know
oh boy what a good job he had
i'm looking forward to the the pro play-off uh
port- is that portland
but all i can do is hear about
they've got two the two johnson brothers
or they're not brothers
but i mean there's two guys named johnson on their team that are really good or doing good or something
um like i said they're doing extremely good right now
it it ought to be a real interesting play-off
i don't think there's any clear pick you know
uh so those are what makes a champion i guess
well it's been nice talking to you
now when you baby-sit what age group children do you sit with
all kinds um
um last like a few summers ago i kept two children every day for the entire summer
and i mean they became like my children
and um and they live in an apartment complex
so we swam a lot
and we played on the playground a lot
and then we would go to a movie on thursdays
and um there was always an activity
you know they had their favorite t v shows and things like that that we watched
and then we took naps
and um i don't know
it it just seems like there was always something to do
and oh they were they just the- they just keep you going
now was this a one parent or two parent family
uh one parent
i mean i would get there at eight o'clock in the morning
and she would get home at like five thirty in the afternoon
and they would have dinner
and then it was time for them to go to bed
um now at this particular time the children were two and six
but then i also
i've been baby-sitting this child uh for about eight years
and um you know i've watched him grow up
and he's like a little brother to me
and it's changed over the over the years um
and uh we do different things now
but now it's he likes to watch t v
and he's into wrestling
and um i kept him on friday night
we went sh- we went to go see a movie and um things like that
but i feel like i don't know when i have children i want to be able to spend a lot of time with them
you say your you go to school
and what are you studying
well sounds like your
i mean i love children
um i don't know
see when i was growing up my mom stayed at home with me and my brother until we were in junior high
and i don't
it would i think it was very beneficial to us
i mean like in the summer we were always in the library programs reading books
and we went skating a lot
and you know she was just always there for us
but nowadays if there are two parents to a family the mother works just as hard as the father does
and the children either stay at home and get into trouble
or they're stuck in a day care
and i just i just don't want my children to have to be raised like that
all my friends they their parents worked all the time
and when i was younger i thought they were lucky because they got to get away with things
but now i realize that it was better because um they have got into a lot of trouble
well that that certainly can happen now if
you you say you're in communications
uh what base of communications would you be most interested in getting in to
well i'm majoring in uh public relations
so so you would have a job with a company
rather than uh radio or television or newspapers or
and uh then you'd be willing to give up your job to stay home and with or stay with the children
well i would like to uh stay at home with my children for at least the first five years
but what what i plan to do in the future is um go ahead and get my upper education as far as my masters
and work on my doctorate and teach um college
and in that case then i'll be i'll be at home when my children are at home
but i'd like to stay at home with them until they get in at least into kindergarten
and then i would be at my school
well that that's uh is an advantage of being in the education field
oh i started out with college and then went to high school
and then i preferred the high school age level much better than i did the college
oh did you
because you have a closer relationship with the uh students
oh oh i started out as a p e major
i uh i found that uh it was a perfect combination from the standpoint of having vacations off at the same time
and uh and it worked out fine from that standpoint uh plus the fact that uh when i left uh
usually uh my husband was seldom home for maybe forty-five minutes or so
and then our son he had to get on the bus
and he did get on the bus
and he never ever thought of uh not going to school he said in view of the fact that he was certain i had a hot line to his school
because uh i uh
well i i was in physical education then
and i just kept getting pushed into administration
he thought surely that i or i would have bought a hot line
and i wouldn't have checked on him
however uh there are there are points both directions in that uh from the standpoint of parents working and not working
uh i listened to more than one parent say i don't know what this child wants
and uh i think out
because that is the way of getting attention
well see whenever my mom stayed home with us we did without a lot
i mean we were
but we did
and and we lived in a trailer for eighteen years
and um you know we we only had one car
we only had one telephone you know
but i i feel like that it helped me now because i appreciate the value of the dollar
and um i also had the supervision that i needed while i was growing up
and i hope that i can provide that for my child too
and we certainly uh we need more of that
though we've had such a breakdown in the family structure
oh we have
from the standpoint of of uh church and school and everything along the way
and that i think has contributed much to uh the delinquency that works grant and the poor school results that we're having uh that the students uh parents have just not really taken enough interest in them from the very very beginning
and i think my feeling was that the very best teachers should be in grades one two and three to get the students off to a good start let them have positive um uh experiences
from the lower levels so they want to continue learning and uh keep going and not wait until they're they're in the ninth and tenth grades
and uh while parents very often will be involved with the school activities when the child's in the elementary school
and they get into the high schools so often they seem to drop away at that point
and that is just as valuable
and the parent really needs to be there for the child
and uh the child needs to take pride in the fact that their parent is doing something
uh we were fortunate in view of the fact that my son did play football
and i did keep statistics for his team
and we tried to be a part of it but not overshadowing him or making him feel that we had to be there all the time
so wh- i feel that i learned a great deal from my students uh with regard to what their biggest complaints were with parents
and a thing such as uh
uh was um carrying their
and i know i never ever said that because i knew that that was one thing that was really irritating to young people
well i guess that was good that you were you were hearing it from other students
and i had to deal with their problems
and i could talk about the kinds of problems which they were bringing that they had just in general aspect
and our son would share this
and then he would have to make decisions for himself along those same types of of uh lines so that
he uh works uh for a different company
but when he went away to coll-
and he was on the lawns from the time he was in the seventh grade and uh a small and all the way through college
and he held three jobs wally was in college
and we didn't even know it
uh that he had three jobs
but when he graduated he had a five thousand dollar bank account
and uh we had told him that if he ever wanted to go to college he could go
is that that was it right
uh who wants to start this one
i've been i've been sitting here thinking
because it was you know took a couple tries before i found somebody
well you know i'm like i'm not really sure what i think about this
um uh i mean the first thing is the uh if it's going to be mandatory it's got to be mandatory
i mean everybody not just like you know poor people and all that you know but
you know senators' sons and all that stuff too
i mean everybody's got to do it
um i don't know
it'd probably be it'd probably be good
i just don't know if you know i was eighteen or whatever i'd want to be stuck doing it for a year or whatever
uh i mean that that doesn't sound right
um i guess i see overall beneficial if if we're going from that point of view
um i- you know in the past
i don't know i don't know how old you are
but when i was uh in high school it was the beginning of vietnam and so forth
and many of my peers were being drafted
and i could see that many of them had conscientious objections to war or whatever
but i i felt strongly then that even if they didn't feel like they could kill someone or go into a military situation that they could help the country in other ways be it cleaning out uh lots in in their neighborhood or
and i guess i see that as as not so much a demand but but a privilege
it's it's kind of uh uh
it is uh
since we live here and we all benefit rich poor or in between uh there are benefits even for those who have it the hardest i just see that as maybe a good idea
uh and i find ways to to turn some of that back to to others
uh and i i guess i i can't see that as being something to really object to
well i guess it would still depend on how
i mean if if you're talking about any- if you're talking about something that's like a full time you know one year full time you know this is what you do you know
you're going to go and and fill pot holes and you know and you know all that stuff
i could see a a full a run- a gamut of different kinds of opportunities
that wou- that could be done in an hour or two
uh a day or several hours of the week like a half of a day on saturday or something like that in addition to what one does
uh besides that
i i can't imagine what kind of uh uh bureaucracies we'd get into and expense having it be full time
oh you're going to go to this camp
and you're going to you know
like um back in the depression the c c c
and we got some great public works out of it
but um i don't see that as being necessary now
i can see it being done uh on a regular schedule
uh everybody has to put in so many hours of uh public service in a given time perhaps
uh i i guess i see all of us benefiting
and i i don't see it just relegated to the young
but i see i i see so much going on that that's bad
and this would give them a chance to have some positive self-esteem
and also you know you you feel more like you know you're actually part of the community if you've done something
you take pride in that and and get some some positive feedback from those who benefit
and i i see it being most beneficial if it's in the neighborhood where or or at least the area where the person lives
it might not be the same neighborhood but the same city or county because then you're you're coming in contact with it
it's it almost needs to be something that has more impact for the individual on going
but as far as putting that into work i don't want to
oh that would
and just i mean just getting getting it going
i i see a lot of things like uh scouting uh
boys clubs girls clubs things like that that kind of get into that citizenship uh the uh looking after the environment sort of thing and i guess i don't see uh this being that different but even more beneficial because it would be something that everybody participated in
oh well good
th- you'll have a little time think about that
i guess i i have uh
when i was teaching school i saw many so many kids that were at loose ends and that didn't really have a purpose
and i can see you know some some really significant things coming out of it
i know you've got to get past that that grudge attitude that many have
but that's uh tha- that would be a part of selling it to the community
the adults uh ahead of it would probably never serve and and to each succeeding generation there definitely would have to be a major p r campaign in each community each county
uh parish or however the state was divided up
um i may
well i don't know
boy scout troops or church groups or civic clubs will uh police a uh a couple of miles of the highway and kee-
and i i've seen it in other states too
that here um
they've got um in most of the states around here i think uh
you know down in north carolina there was a big controversy for a while because they uh the local chapter of the k k k wanted to uh
uh to participate in it
and there were those that said no
well uh it was it was interesting because that's an interesting question you know
and i hadn't even thought about that uh the the other end of that
that that's an interesting uh situation
and i thought i had seen when we were traveling around the state some similar signs up that indicated that certain sections were being policed and cleaned up
and i know maryland does
and we just we went to indianapolis last weekend and back
and um i'm pretty sure i saw yeah stuff in ohio and indi- indiana about it and pennsylvania maybe pennsylvania
and i don't know about your part of the country
but uh down here in the last oh year plus i it was las- beginning with last year's earth day there's just been more of a turn toward uh environmental concerns
and e- i work for texas instruments
and they they've started some recycling campaigns that a year before that had been turned down because they said well it's not feasible
and but then they lost
i see that as being i i see that as being a a a change uh for the positive kind of along the same line as as as the mandatory thing
it's just thing a part of everyone's consciousness
well the thing about that is though it's got a
i mean because it was i mean it was big you remember like in the early seventies and all that
and you know and then it kind of just went out of vogue
and i i'm worried that it it might you know it'll it the same thing will happen
it's like you know environmentalism was really big for a couple of years
and then people like well you know
i'd ruther rather spend you know fifty cents less on uh on on such and such you know
and even if it's not environmentally safe who cares you know
uh there have been too many other things that it's done that for just in my life
and if you look at history at all you see that you know uh we go from one side to the other on just about any subject
that you one might care to bring up
but it is comforting to me to see uh more concern about some of these things that that cost us money
especially when we have dwindling uh resources such as oil that's burning out of control in the persian gulf and and so forth
just just every little bit does
it it makes me feel like well there may be something left for my children my nieces and nephews and so forth
well yeah uh
well uh wouldn't
it's just probably a good thing that the oil's burning and may may make some people realize that hey you know this stuff runs out
that's that's right because
of course that's probably blasphemy for you to say uh coming from where you are
what was it seventy-four when we had the the last last oil crisis
and uh we started getting smart
and and we were looking all these alternative sources of the energy and so forth
and as soon as the oil prices came back down we the pendulum swang the other way
and we need those reminders
uh or we'll suddenly be in the dark and say oh my goodness now we don't have the ability to go on to some new technology
well my dad's in the in the solar energy business
you know we're acutely aware of a lot of this
but you know on the other hand he voted for george bush
well i thi- you know
uh makes um uh decisions that i just can't go along with
but that's why they're there and not me
i don't want the i don't want the stress
well the the thing with bush
i was just trying to think about how i how i dress for work you know
and uh what i usually do on the weekend is is lay out five outfits
and uh on monday i i wear the the worst looking one
because it doesn't seem like people are really ar- you know are that alive on monday you know
and then progressively through the week i'll i'll wear nicer looking things
and then on friday most everybody wears jeans jeans and sweatshirts or you know jeans and blouses or something like that
uh but mostly what i wear are skirts and blouses or you know skirts and uh pullover sweaters or uh you know little two piece dress suit suits like
you know that's a good way to approach it
i've never thought about um
so i don't repeat an outfit
but um i've never thought about wearing your worst outfit on monday because really no one's paying attention
but anyway um i really i don't work outside of school
um i work in the computer lab at school
so i can just wear whatever i have on for school
an and um and really it's
i try to dre- dress presentable but very comfortable
like um in the warm weather it's always shorts and a t-shirt or a button up or something like that
and then in the winter time it's jeans or or pants
i usually uh you know
you really don't want to dress up unless you you uh have a job
and you have to be there right after school or something like that
like where i work it's it's pretty casual uh
it's it's i guess it's more like a a college campus
also i mean there's hundre- you know hundreds of people work for t i
and uh a lot of people just just wear jeans and and uh sweats all the time
and they dress up like when customers are coming in
or uh when we have department meetings or something like that
and uh you know a lot of people like those that work in the legal department for their the real uh higher ups
like the the lawy- the t i lawyers and uh those that work for the the higher executives those secretaries they uh they really dress up all the time
so there's a good combination in the hallways all the time you know
well that's good that they're so casual
i mean uh my brother works for t i
and he's a computer programmer or computer engineer
and uh you know whenever he was going to school he was expecting to having to wear uh a tie or a dress shirt everyday
but uh he goes to work in his blue jeans t-shirt
and he just loves it
and that's very acceptable at t i
i believe at i b m they they make you wear a blue suit and uh some kind of colored shirt and a tie
i wo- i would hate to be in that atmosphere
but uh i mean they they just moved into the new building
and um and so they were they were going to try to take their blue jean code with them and trying to get all the all the upper level to start wearing blue jeans
but he just left for italy today at four
and he'll be over there until july first setting up some kind of computers for them
over in t i mean for t i but over in italy
oh t i is everywhere
but uh he didn't carry any ties or anything because he he just went over there with the that attitude well if i don't take it then they won't make me wear it
because uh he just he didn't you know
but you know if he had the preference i mean his his preference is um blue jeans and a t-shirt
but i think that's great about t i
and also uh to get off the clothing the smokers you know how they have the the different designated areas for smokers and stuff
and if you happen to go into one of areas that is a smoke smoke area and you don't smoke you almost strangle
areas the smoking area you know it's closed in
and if you don- if you don't smoke and you go in there
tha- everybody that goes in there smokes
so it's full of smoke when when you go in there
i think that's um
well um y- you mentioned your daughter had graduated from college
well when she was in high school did she always have to have all the new fashions
she always had uh yeah she always had to have a lot of clothes
see that's how that's how i am
but my mamma was not raised like that
i i wasn't either
she my daughter she's real good at finding sales though you know
oh me to
sh- she'll buy a lot of sh- yeah she'll buy a lot clothes at the end of seasons you know
and uh just have them for the next year
and she you know she finds all the outlets and all the discount places and uh buys clothes
uh whe- you know when they were coming up i i didn't sew
but now i've i've learned how to sew
so i'm well i'm i'm still learning how
but i'm ge- and i'm getting much better at it
and i i'm going to be able to make my own clothes
but i just haven't fit it into my schedule yet
but that i mean that can really benefit
um that's something that i'd be very interested in very interested in learning
because clothes are s- are really expensive
uh they're outrageous
uh uh a little simple shell shell blouse you know that you can make for about say ten dollars at you know at at the most out of a decent fabric
just a little shell to go under a suit you know
yeah it's it's marked up
it is it is really outrageous
but uh i mean like whenever i i was growing up and all my mom
but i do now
but she never would buy me like the new designer jeans that had come out that were thirty dollars
or um or she wouldn't buy me the fifty dollar tennis shoes and stuff like that
and she always told me it was because i was still growing
and she wasn't going to buy me something i was going to grow out of next week
i have a friend who uh
she had a she had a ba- a little boy
and uh she used to dress him out of neiman marcus
she dressed him uh fabulously
and then seems like every time she turned around he was outgrowing stuff
and she finally learned that you just can not do this you know
so now she finds the basement sales and just like you know everybody else
i mean i always thought my mom was being mean to me
but i look back at it now
and my child is going to
i mean i'm going to raise mine the same way
um i don't know
i just they're just so outrageously priced
i try to uh always catch the sales
and you just have to keep buying them you know
if you if you if you're not buying the most expensive clothes out there the the quality is really not that great you know for the price that you pay
it it depends on um
there's there's always a reason why they're on sale
so that that has a lot to do with it
like i bought i bought the most beautiful swe- uh sweater from uh i believe it was ross dress for less
and it wa- it was really pretty
it was just you know it was just plain a plain uh ro- you know round uh necked uh sw- sweater
and it had like it was embellished around the the top you know
it had uh leather leather designs and um some other other little things on it
and i just thought it was so pretty
and i go- i got it at a real good price
oh that's great
and it was so pretty
and after i wore it a couple of times i realized why
there was in the middle of the back of it there was
and they had like just sewed it back together
right in the middle of the back you know
wasn't a seam or anything you know
and that's why it was so cheap although it's not it's not really noticeable
but but still it's you know it's really not not not a good quality
and then i was told by somebody that works for j c penney's that uh ross ross is just one of those places that sell sells seconds
um they don't really buy the first quality
and uh places like j c penney's that they'll reject the seconds
but places like ross dress for less and uh t j max
well uh the roles have definitely changed in the last generation or so
um i think a lot of it has to do with women working
in like in the future i think all women are going to work
i mean they may let you off for a day or two to have your baby
but that will be it
or either they'll have a computer at home and in the hospital where you can just you know just continue right on with your work
i mean i- it really is coming to that because most women now days cannot afford the time that they could take off unless the company pays them
they can't even afford to take off you know to have children it seems like
and it and it seems if you're going to have kids uh that you are you know society has decided for you how many you can really have and make it
and uh because if you have you know two well if you go to work you're just working to pay for day care
two or three you know um
now i was real lucky because my husband had a good enough job where when my kids were you know when i had them and when they were small
until they got in junior high school my youngest got in junior high i didn't have to work
oh that is good
i mean i didn't work
i i needed to
but i didn't
steve's steve has a sister who has four
she just had her fourth one in uh march
and she doesn't have to work either
i don- i don't know how people do it with one
you know um obviousl-
and and i don't i think that's part of the role reversal is it's okay to get married and not have kids
and i think for society for such a long time said well you know you're married now you need to sa- have have your family
and i don't think it's been until recently that that they had decided that two people was a family
you know and
well it's getting where you can't hardly afford if you're going to give your kids any kind of education and stuff you can't hardly afford to have over two
and i mean it's hard with two
uh my youngest one
and my youngest one is going to be graduating from college soon
and if i had a third one
and uh you know it
but still it cost a lot
i mean just the you know the cost of living and loans don't pay for groceries and stuff
and cars and all their books
and the books are outrageous
oh i know
i mean absolutely outrageous
and they're getting worse
uh my daughter brought home a book the other day that she was going to have to have for her one of her next classes
and it was like ninety-six dollars
and this book is a little bitty skinny book
i said my goodness what is it lined in gold you know uh
but it is it's getting worse
and if i'd of probably had three or four children i don't see how we could have made it you know without me working
but that's that's probably because you know if you had three you you know would say if i'd of had four
i guess it's always not not being able to picture one more
but in essence you probably would have worked out fine
but i think i would have had to work
you know even though he brings in a real good living and everything in order for me to keep up i would have had to work
but i think it's getting more and more like
when you have one child now that's it you know
and you work
because if you have two or three kids by the e- way the inflation's going i think a woman's always going to have to work
and it's just going to be an accepted thing
there isn't going to be any of this you know very few people will ever stay home
and and that's all right with me because i don't want to stay home you know i think i'm just part of tha- the new stuff that is just
i don't know i think i would just go nuts sitting at home all day long
well you know i can't imagine how i did because now i work all the time
and um well i work all week
and um i can't imagine how i stayed home
you know i think to myself what did i do
and i think it just it revolutionized an where a woman thinks that a way you know just like
now my daughter there's no way that she can imagine herself married at the age that she's at now
to her everything is you've got to go through college you've got to get a job you know
and then when everything's set up then you look for somebody that you want to spend the rest of your life with
i mean it is so far down the road
where now when i graduated high school
that's you did that's what you did
and then you got married
and then you had a family
i mean that's just the way it was you know
and uh that's like when my mo-
and the woman stayed home and took care of them
i uh i i like the way it is
it's uh being
see we're from houston and so it's not so hard for people
you know you've been married three or so years
and you don't have kids well it's okay no- nobody does
but you come to a place like belton
and a lot of people in our su-
and they can't have children who don't have children
and they can't imagine why we would want to have children
and i'm going well you know there's more to life you know there's life in there that's
you know not everybody has to have kids
and i'd rather spend the time with my husband than you know spending time
here it's your turn you know
but you know that now even
and we got married right out of high school well a year after i got out of high school
and uh i didn't have kids for four and a half years
but that was because i wanted to work
and i wasn't ready for kids
and everybody thought oh my gosh what is the matter with her you know
they're probably going oh i bet she can't get pregnant
i mean they thought that it was terrible you know
and then when i'd tell them you know well i'm just not ready for children yet
oh but that you know you better you better just get ready now
well you don't just get ready
but i was kind of odd because as a general rule the people that married during my time they had kids within a year
and i just was not ready for kids
and i wanted to travel and stuff like that which we did
and uh kids didn't fit in right then
but it's getting more and more like that where there's more and more couples
and really if you don't want the kids then it's not the time to have
and i think that more and more the attitude's getting that a way
because that's like my daughter
now she says that you know maybe when she's thirty she might want a child then
and uh even though i'd like to have grandchildren i can see her point
steve's mom finally uh finally s- you know said that that god will take care of us when it's our time
she finally admitted you know she finally told me it's okay if you don't
but it took every nerve in her body to say that because she's from a very very old fashioned family
and she stayed home and raised her kids
and and she expected all of her kids to do that too
and their wives and to be the the housewife and have dinner ready by five and and you know be there at every beck and call
and i was raised totally opposite
but because my mother had six girls
and you know she worked too
and i guess i just
and i saw how life was when she stayed home
and it was rough
and it really is
just like now you know there's there's so much more now
i mean it really does
accept for what we give to my daughter to you know put her through college and stuff
but the rest of it
or we go on trips or you know just the more or less like entertainment stuff
i think you've you've earned that though
i feel like i have you know because well we're just a age now
but i'm older
and uh i got to stay home with my kids which i really wanted to do
but now i could not go back and do it
and i mean i did stuff
and i think it's just the new way that people are thinking
i think it would be neat if if they could incorporate into small and large businesses both a built in day cares where the children were there in the facility but not necessarily right there with you
well you know more and more of them are
but where i am the just like all the hospitals
but the reason they had to do this was because so many people you know so many women could not afford
so uh more and more of our hospitals especially over here are getting them
and then some of the bigger companies
but it's mainly the hospitals
i know i know nobody around here does it
we're it's too small around here
well i can go ahead and start and tell you mine
and that's where i grew up
so i was used to the heat out here right now
gosh it gets to about seventies high seventies
and it gets very cold at night
and monterey it's um right on the coast
and i don't know if your familiar with california coastline
but we're we're about two hours about a two hour drive south of san francisco
and it's uh really nice
it's a big area for people to come from the different uh countries mostly like japan germany and england
and they usually go to carmel and vacation on the beaches
so it's it's pretty nice uh year round
but uh cool always cool in the evenings and warm warm in the summer
but it's stays pretty cold even uh during the winter for as nice as it is
and um we usually get a fog uh right about i guess about four o'clock
and it kind of rolls in over the coast
and uh then it usually breaks back off again the next morning
and if you go just a little bit ways in i'd say about a fifteen minute drive in towards salinas
uh the weather completely changes
and it gets very hot and dry
and the fog never makes it that far
but along here it's uh very
well right now we're we're having the little bit of spring that we have
well at least you've got some
we've got we had one of those blow through tonight
oh well that's good
and i think we got the same thing in the forecast for the next two or three days
have y'all been having any heat waves or like the ninety degree
it's gotten up to uh ninety a couple of times
but basically it's been in the low seventies and eighties
so do y'all have many bluebonnets and stuff this year
well the season is just about over for that
uh in fact we drove down to corpus last week and uh there were still some paint brushes and bluebonnets down along the way
oh i miss that
and i spoke to somebody else this morning from san antonio
and we came back
and they had a big rainstorm come through there part of the same thing we're getting now i guess
oh oh well that's real nice because i can remember two years ago that in about february the hundred degree weather started in san antonio and just continued
um we've had a few down here but not anything like kansas
but this is the season for that
they do they do pop up occasionally
so we get a bit of a relief
so when it's july and august i'm pretty well used to the
the biggest problem with with the weather and the rain in this area is the soil
oh is that what dallas is
you know it's not sandy like most of the state is
so it doesn't absorb the water real well
you know once it rains a little bit it's it's filled up and everything else just runs off
it's it's a complete mess everything floods all the under passes
and there's a section in south dallas that's had a whole lot of flooding problems because of the rain
well we could use some rain up here
we're like in the bottom of the fourth year of drought
and they had a pretty good early spring
and we got quite a bit of rain
but it wasn't enough to offset what they lost over the last four years
and uh so they're still talking water rationing this summer
so it would seem strange because in san antonio
we had lived out um west of san antonio in castroville
and the water in medina lake and that area was really going down that they were considering that they might have to do water rationing
and i thought oh gee i'm so glad to get out of there and get up here to the california pacific coast where it rains and everything has flowers
and there's no problem with water
and then i came here and found out they were in the you know four year draught
so i said well gee this is pretty much like texas
and it pretty much is in the middle of summer
um they turn to golden dead grass
but um it's a really nice area
it's just it's just such a change from uh texas because i had grown up with uh the heat
and used to essentially
and then you have the hot summer spring
and uh to come here it's kind of the temperate weather all year round
it's kind of like uh spring i guess if you year round except
and then in the winter
and then it seems sort of like a san antonio early winter or fall
so it seems like we only have two springs which is or two seasons
and that would be spring and fall
but it's a really nice uh change of pace
um we do a lot of you know
when you do a lot of outside like running and stuff it's just so much easier
and you don't have to worry about the high humidity
or is it pretty dry
but it's nothing like i guess san antonio summers
or east texas is a little more humid
because i had lived in san antonio for about twenty years
and it just seemed like every year it just got more and more humid more and more humid
and here it's uh well it's right by the ocean
but um it's not the same as corpus
but here um well the water is extremely cold up here
but if you want to go wind suffering or diving or swimming you have to wear a wet suit
for some reason because of the cold uh ocean uh water the air is always cool
so i really like that about this area
and uh we just hadn't expected it
we were used to what uh gulf coast weather was like
and it's much nicer
and the air doesn't feel anything like it does along the gulf coast region
but you um
but we like it
so it's a nice change
so we'll be here a couple of years
and we thought well we'll take advantage of it and see what all the pacific coast is like
so it's been good
well my wife's originally from virginia
and we lived there for about nine months
and that was a real change for me
oh i imagine
um parts do
we we're over in the western edge in the mountains
and they have of course some pretty severe storms winter storms snow and that type of thing
but they're so good about clearing the roads that you know it doesn't usually bother you very much
and uh i've just never really been in that region of the country
and i guess i'm going to have to try that area sometime and see what it's like
because a lot of people that are from that north carolina region really like it
and uh they get the snow
but they said it doesn't really get messy
and it doesn't really hang around that long
so they the people i know that are from there uh they always miss it
and they want to go back
but anyway well
well as we were talking the weather came on
and there's a flash flood watch and
well i hope it moves up this way
but i'm sure it won't
because we could sure use it
well you think that takes care of the time and
well i sure appreciate hearing how things are going in texas and uh
well i enjoyed talking with you lisa
well what movies have you seen recently valerie
oh we haven't seen that one yet
well don't bother
well oh from a woman's point of view and it was very uh chauvinistic as far as women go
uh it was it was entertaining
i don't think the general audience would would go for it
the most recent one that uh my wife and i have seen was the city slicker
it was just a really a really funny movie
i mean it just ran the gamut of emotion
and but it was just enter- all around entertaining
uh it's still on to the best of my knowledge
but i mean time wise how long
uh it's i think it's less than two hours
we we rented one recently that seemed to go on forever
but this one it was fairly long
i i'm guessing probably an hour and forty-five minutes maybe
and uh it
was it oh good
but excellent acting by billy crystal and bruno kirby
uh who was the
oh jack palance had an excellent part in there as the old cowboy
so we really enjoyed that
oh well i'm looking forward to seeing that one
i think that uh i can highly recommend that movie this to see
uh we generally rent a couple a week
uh in order to get a decent movie to have on a weekend you've got to rent it on thursday
they get they get taken up at the store
and uh with luck you'll have one or two that are good
and we usually have oh
quite frequently we have our grandchildren on the weekends and uh we'll try to rent something that they can see as well as something else that we can see
uh generally try to stay in the at least p g range
the uh the oldest is nine
but the the nine year old will watch anything that's on t v
we've been waiting for a a good movie out this summer for the kids to see
and uh they enjoyed that
but uh i missed that one
my wife took uh i think the kids to see that one
but we can generally find something at the store
well that's a good deal
uh oh we saw this movie
presumed innocent was the one we rented uh last weekend
it's uh he is a prosecuting attorney
but course it's one of these with a twist where it looks like he's the one that wound up killing her
so it's and it's an extremely long movie
it's it's over two hours long
uh my wife enj- she likes the suspense movies
and then my husband wasn't going to be able to watch it with me
so i thought i better save that one for another day
because i think he'd like that one
i think you it's uh it's something i think you would enjoy
well that's a good one to put on the list
it it's like most suspense movies
so once once you seen one that's a suspenseful type movie like that then it's it's not good for a second watching particularly
it's it's a shame
and my one grandson and i
but we like bill and ted's excellent adventure
but we haven't seen that one either
i i have a theory
i don't want to uh go away depressed from watching a movie
well i've certainly enjoyed talking with you
well you too jim
and uh i hope you see a good movie soon
well i guess i enjoy eating out um uh here and there
or it's it's a good change and a good change from cooking and eating at home
and i guess i like a variety of a variety of restaurants
uh sometimes it's fun to go out and just have a hamburger and french fries and and sort of a hamburger and french fry meal
and sometimes it's i enjoy it's i enjoy going out having a formal meal
and uh sometimes it's nice to go out and have a salad
something you know
do you usually go out uh with the children or without them
well a variety
i i like to go sometimes without them
sometimes i sometimes it's okay to take them along
so uh it just you know it just varies
and it wouldn't even really matter which restaurant it was just to you know have a moment of peace and quiet without
so but uh anyway where do you like to eat
uh well uh we don't have any children
so uh we tend to
and uh we're very attracted to exotic food
and uh we like indian food and thai cuisine and uh sort of gourmet mexican and uh things like that as well as tex-mex and italian and uh chinese and things and and things of that sort
and uh we probably go out one to two times a week
and uh uh we're pretty much regulars at an italian local italian restaurant
oh which one do you like
well it's been a long time since we've been in there
but uh but it's good
there's an italian restaurant over over by the mall over by uh plano parkway there
well it's good
i haven't my husband had been in there several times
and we went in there actually we went in there for lunch one day
and uh their pastas were great
tha- that's one of the things a good pasta means a lot to me
i i like different kinds of food
so when we go out i'm always looking for something other than the standard menu even if
it's a mexican restaurant like something other than uh you know the standard tacos enchiladas tamales and fajitas now
and once in a while things backfire
i mean we've gone for romanian food and lebanese food and things like that and i'm not fond of some of those things
but we'll try we'll try anything
ethiopian we've had ethiopian and uh not in plano of course
but we really we really do enjoy going out
and uh and um i'm pretty adventurous in cooking too which also occasionally
i think we're supposed to say what will bring us back to a restaurant or or what attracts us to a restaurant
how do you usually find a a new restaurant
uh well my husband's kind of the eth- he he's the ethnic fan
you know what we read we read the uh d magazine we we check that and uh the friday section in the newspaper the pull out section there
so uh we've uh we've usually we often save those and ventured out on from there uh just for something that had a high rating
we have found uh a number of restaurants either through d and the
friday paper and sometimes the the observer which my husband usually picks up
and you know when they say you know buy one get one free
that's that's right
so we'll go in
and very often we'll
and we'll stick with it
once they give they no longer give coupons we'll we'll uh we'll stay there
but we've found probably half of our sort of regular restaurants through coupons
and the other half through the through the newspaper reviews
oh oh yeah
we i guess we we use the coupons too
i mean it's wonderful particularly if you have more than two people and you've got say four or something like that
that that is really one of our
well i think that it's just that's ex-
sometimes i think going out to eat it's it's sort of a recreation
so uh just a just a change of pace from uh eating at home
so uh anyway i guess uh as far as as far as service when we go out gosh it's nice it's nice to have someone
and uh actually it's kind of nice to you know
uh a waitress or waiter that waits the table
but it's not nice when they're too attentive
so uh we've had experience with that too
m- m- m- my sister who also lives here in dallas uh tends to uh chat with waiters and waitresses and become their best friends during the course of dinner which drives me absolutely batty
uh chili's chili's is always fine
i guess if we go to dallas into dallas we like uh the routh is it routh street cafe
you know we've never been there
and that's supposed to be wonderful
it just we've we've taken people there several times
and uh they have a good they have a good choice of things that are very different sounding
but uh oh we had venison venison chili one time which was absolutely wonderful
and then i guess it must be seasonal
and we've been back
oh i guess it's in the winter season
well they've never had it when we've been back
so but uh well you ought to try that
it's it's it's very good
but you know just it's just not
uh that's that's supposed to be a wonderful place
w- uh uh uh here in plano well we tend to go to momo's a l- fairly often
and uh sometimes we'll go you know
we we also go to chili's and uh colter's bar b q
and and uh we go to lil- there is a little thai place that's over on park that we go to
a lot and because we're both were from the richardson north dallas area up until fairly recently
and uh we'll go down to uh blue mesa grill mexican food
oh that's good
so you probably have a job you need to get to pretty soon
oh you are
i'm already on my job so you you reached me at my job
well how do you dress for work
my my dress for work uh most of the time is uh rather comfortable and casual uh usually uh slacks and a soft colored shirt
the um thing that that distinguishes me a lot of the time when i have to dress real professionally for a meeting or something is i wear a clerical collar and a suit and uh all of that sort of thing
but when i don't need to dress up for a a meeting or a service of some sort i don't
so you're in a church there
well i'm working this is my first morning to work down at our little church preschool
and they've told me to wear just something terribly comfortable because these are two year olds
and they have a lot of uh they have bible lessons
and they have all the things during the morning
but they still have snack time and play time
so i'm going to be dressing just in casual slacks and t-shirts probably not blue jeans but little bit short of that just just tennis shoes and play clothes
well around there you can probably wear uh t-shirts and other things
but around here at this time of the year we are into sweaters and uh coats
well it's a beautiful day here
and it's in the sixties
but we still have a lot of hot afternoons
so you'll still see people
it it's kind of an in between change that they're in their play clothes i mean they're in their summer clothes during the afternoons because you just can't stand the sweaters
but in the mornings people are dressing for work in their sweaters because they just want it to be fall so badly
today today we we wear coats
and as the day uh warms up we may go to light jackets
but i don't think there's an escape from light jackets
well so are the people around you um dressing similar to you
so you don't have to you don't have to buy the lot of the wardrobe that some of the people in banking and that kind of thing do
well that's good
i'm not stuck with that kind of a uh situation
now yesterday i had to dress up and and uh be more formal because i had a a formal meeting at noon time
well that's wonderful
but then i can go home later in the day and and be a little more casual and then if i have a a meeting of people that i know i can be very casual in the evening
well my husband has to take the bus into dallas and doesn't return all day
so he has to dress
and he just really hates it
and even when his job is not going to be with people all day long he said it's just part of the uniform and the expected image that they have to dress
that's around here in a lot of places that's the way it is i mean there there are ex- expected uh dress codes and the people need to follow that
i think uh years ago i used to be far more uh committed to the idea of of a dress code but i've relaxed a lot more as i've gotten older and become more comfortable with myself
well i think that's i think that's great
from from that but now that i've broken away from it i'm i'm glad i have
well another interesting thing on the our our end here is how even in my forties how much younger i dress than my mother would have in her forties
and i will run around to the store in things in slacks and tennis shoes
so uh she tells me i dress young
but that's okay
well there's not a lot more i can think of to discuss on clothing
there you know
what kind what kind of shoes do they wear down there
well we wear
of course like i said if my husband's going downtown he's got the whole uh you know the dress men's dress shoes but for as out here just anything that the moms
we all kind of have our own little dress code of just either tennis shoes or little loafers and and uh tights and things that feel comfortable to us around our kids
we we can wear pretty much that although um tennis shoes are kind of out in in almost every every situation unless you want to look like a gook
well you all have a nice day there
and thank you for calling
and her name is thumper
i got her for christmas from my family and uh back when we lived in nebraska
and uh so i thought that if i had a good hunting dog like thumper that boy i could just go out and get all kinds of game
except we live in plano texas now so
i um i had a for many years i had a dog that was part springer spaniel
but she isn't alive any more
we had her for um fifteen years i think my family did and just loved her
she was the greatest greatest um went through two generations of children in my family and was always very gentle
and he's i um got him in arizona and when i used to live there
and he is huge
um i got him
he was um he was born in the wild like in a in a shed and had never been in a building when i got him
and he's he he must be part cross part with some kind of desert animal because he's very long and lanky
but he's a very tame spoiled house cat you know now that i've had him for seven years
and uh he's uh he's really spoiled though
so but he's really big
so lots of times he it he seems to get in fights
and when he was younger i think he started them
and now i think he barely makes it
well we went to a cat show at the plano center here in town
and uh we thought that we have a cat now
but we thought well if we ever get another cat you know we'd want something kind of unique
so we kind of looked around
and they had everything from hairless cats to siamese cats and persian cats
and we sort of fell in love with the uh maine coon cats
oh i've seen them
they um weren't they they were
actually i can't remember
they were used to be used on ships and in for for mousers you know
so they're very nautical too
uh i think i'm i think i'm being accurate in the in the area of folklore
but i'm not sure
well that's interesting
well my family didn't necessarily like like them as much as i did
but the manx is that the one that doesn't have a tail it sort of has a bob tail
i'm real a real cat lover
i'd have a lot more cats if my boyfriend would let u- let me
well i'll tell you an interesting story about how i got my dog
and then i suppose our five minutes will be up
and i went to uh omaha nebraska to recruit students
and i had some time off in the afternoon
so i went to a a pet shop
and i saw these little springer spaniels and so i decided well you know this would really be a nice dog to have
so when i got back home to carney nebraska i told my wife about it
and i said you know this is just a
i i i can just hear the dog crying for me now
and christmas is coming up hint hint
and so i had to go back the next week as well as a bunch of other people from the university
and one of the people uh that we went with uh they were friends of ours
and so we got to omaha
and i decided i'd take my friend over and show him the dog
and so i got over there
and she said oh that's too bad the dog has already been sold
and i didn't realize it
but this guy had somehow worked it out so that he got there a little bit earlier bought the dog
and she was in the back room
and so that night we had a reception for some of the uh potential high school students or college students
and and uh he had the dog the whole time in his room
and and i had no idea
and so we headed back to carney that night
and the dog rode in the car
and we stopped along the way and had a bite to eat
and they left the dog in the car
and i guess while we were inside eating thumper just tore the heck out of the inside
and uh finally we made it back to uh to carney
i guess we're be- recorded
cycling computers uh backpacking just about everything
in fact he's out there right now before it gets dark trying to get in his miles for the the time
uh do you have any do you do any handicraft type things i think was the question
i i do some things
uh oh i i like to decorate things
and i do sweatshirts and t-shirts
and i've gotten to where i start have started selling them at craft shows and things
oh that's pretty good
uh and i have have done fairly well at them
a a few of my little hobby projects have totally bombed
my only craft work is kind of like computers and you know go off to the little computer club meetings
and it's kind of nice because i've made money at it too
considering i i work for it a living
but i you know i i've got a couple of articles published
it's kind of kind of neat
what what does a computer club do
they just get around and and talk techy or or else uh uh you know
and the other half are like really not
and uh we kind of help out the people who are really not
you don't uh you're not in- into hacking or whatever
oh i i think i'm i think i'm a hacker
but i'm not not kind not the uh the you know dial around randomly trying to break into computers type hackers
i belong to a a boy scout troop
i just you know donate a whole bunch of my time to the boy scouts and have fun
well that's we have done that
uh our two older boys were in boy scouts
and my daughter was in girl scouts until just about a year ago so we've
that's a great thing to do you know really
uh well just last weekend went to davy crockett forest which is kind of out in east texas
and we go to uh places out in
uh uh let's see
what's that what's that state north of us
oh that one
uh oh by fort sill there
to another f- a uh old indian fort that's out there
have you gone like to fillmont with the boy scouts
when i was a kid uh we'd do the equivalent thing in the high sierras
does does your whole family like to do it
like you you know for a vacation you'd go backpacking
you just oh
and and you volunteer for the boy scouts huh
well s- sometimes uh
it's better than you know owning on them and making payments on them
and you know things like that
uh you said you did it in the high sierras
uh do you ever you know just vacation someplace where you strictly backpack
uh not recently because you know like the boy scouts makes it so that i go like once a month you know
but uh there's uh some some stuff that i want to do with like sierra club and go down to grand canyon or something like that
so you know they have lots of tours where they get a bunch of people together and off you go
which seems kind of reasonable because that means you don't have to take twenty thirteen year olds with you which seems a a just a tad more relaxing
and i i also
i've always been a a
well i tell you what that's y- count your blessings because uh it really is good when someone can do some things to a car themselves
a- although i'll tell you you know over the years the cars get more complicated
well that's why i don't do as much as i'd like
because they are i mean they've got they've gotten complicated haven't they
which after awhile i could you know take it apart in my sleep if i needed to
it it got to be pretty straightforward to understand
and now since then you know the closer a car is to a fifty-six buick the the more i know about it
and then start getting into these nissans and the like
and i just can't keep up
i i agree
but i used to always change my own oil and do the points and plugs and
course they don't use uh
and uh now brakes i've always done a lot of you know changing brakes
but i have on a lot a lot of times
and it's one i did not do myself
i have a seventy-nine el dorado took it to be inspected and the parking brake failed
so i got under there and messed with the the ten- that uh that adjustment
to make to t- tighten it up
and that didn't do the trick
and then i got there and tried to
well actually that wasn't even eventually the problem
i i did a lot of things that i i did everything that i could think to do
and eventually i brought it up to a a place called just brakes and it turns out that there's a
the parking brake i- in the rear
there's a there's disc brakes
and the parking brake is a piston deal
and because the parking brake hadn't been used in so many years the piston froze up
so they ended up having to pound it out
and one of them they
were able to get running uh kind of oiling it and playing with it
and the other one they just it was just frozen solid
so i ended up having to buy one
and altog- all total it was just under two hundred dollars believe it or not to get all that done
well it really wasn't quite s- as bad as you thought was it was it
actually i i think it was a lot of money
but i i don't like i s-
well it was a lot of money
well do you still do much work on them then
act- th- actually that was just a at at the beginning of september
and whenever i can i do try
i i've gotten to the point where i don't change the oil anymore only because
well that is one problem
but also these uh these fast oil change places you just can't beat them
for sixteen bucks they'll not only will they change the oil in ten minutes and do a f- you know as good a job as i can do but they'll uh lube too
i've i've quit doing that myself
and but one of the main reasons was the disposal of the oil you know
and the main reason that it's it's quick
well have you seen a new movie lately
well uh i am a student
and i have uh been actually watching more movies on video
than being able to go out to see uh movies at the store or at the theater
uh i st- i want to see the fisher king and and uh catch robin hood
i uh i haven't seen either one of those
uh what what are some of the shows that you have been able to rent though
uh let's see
uh i'm trying to just think of the ones that have come on
uh white palace which i thought was over rated over hyped um recently
well you're catching me at it uh uh at minds end here
well maybe you uh you have seen dances with wolves
um i thought the uh the cima- the cinematography was excellent
uh the story was
uh though it tended to be a little one sided uh it was good
uh it was it was believable
i uh i just moved down in fact from south dakota in in june
and that's when the movie was filmed
and uh we when when the movie came out we went
uh my dad lives in the state capital which is pierre and it was filmed right outside of pierre
in fact the buffalo the scene the big buffalo herd scene that was that was a live scene
uh there's a guy that has got a a buffalo farm
and he has got over ten thousand head of buffalo and and uh we my dad has got a little plane we flew over it all a- looked at the buffalo
but uh so we are watching the the movie in the movie theater in pierre and uh just every time i would start to get into the movie and it was getting good someone in the crowd would yell hey there's john red eagle you know
you know they'd start recognizing people
they knew they knew the extras or the
i'd go now now which one could that be you know
and i'd i'd start trying to focus in on people instead of of picking up the overall
so but i i thought it was a good film
but you are right
i think i think it was very one sided
it it was
but it's a side that hasn't been told uh as far as you know telling it from you know the indians as the good guys and the the white men as the bad guys
i i really thought about uh all the the westerns that we have seen for years and years
and it's just shoot the indians
and they are always the savages
it was a similar uh situation with the iroquois indians attacking a an army fort
um but it was an interesting movie
uh have you seen pretty woman
now i thought that was a good show
that was that was a good movie
um it was just kind of a get away movie
it didn't uh it didn't have any real social bearing
or uh and it wasn't really a comedy
but it was an enjoyable movie
it was it was kind of like the star wars s- series you know just something a little different
i had a i sure did have a mind lock about the movies i've seen
uh now are you are you going to see or do you are you much of a star trek fan
but i think i've missed one
and they showed all five in a row
oh they had it everywhere
uh every major city had one theater that did it
because we had one here in dallas
and they did it in houston
they did it well they did it everywhere
and it was it was really good to see all the movies and how the story developed
and the thing that i didn't realize is that if you watch the movies in a row uh time wise they happen one after another and just no no time between them
but you can watch the characters develop
and he was in arlington virginia
oh gosh oh gosh
well anyway we've got a easy subject
you know i used to
i have uh i have one favorite soap opera
and i tape because i'm not home
and uh let's see
and then uh at night uh i don't uh when i sit down i don't usually sit down till almost nine o'clock when my kids get in bed
and and uh then i watch
uh what do i watch at nine o'clock
oh well tuesday nights i guess we try to catch a couple of the shows that the kids like
and uh so we usually catch uh full house
and uh what's the one comes on after that
it's a new one uh
my kids are older so i don't i don't know some of those shows now like i used to
uh other than that uh oh gosh i watch knots landing on thursday nights
well i i like the comedies
oh now that is a good one
if i'm home on mondays then i i definitely watch her
and i really like coach
i think it's when it's good it's just a scream
well he's a good actor
well he's probably playing himself
half the time you see these people on an interview show they're they act just like they do in their parts
and he acted about the same
well he could very well be
so do you watch much t v
well i watch more now because well i i had been going to school for years and have really been too busy but this semester i'm only taking one course
and so i see murphy brown and coach and the wonder years
now i never see that
well i've got a friend that says that is just wonderful show
oh it's fabulous
it they are just gems of shows
i mean they really fabulous in every way
what now what night is that on now
oh that's wednesday at uh seven thirty
wednesdays i i go to church choir
well maybe maybe your husband could tape it for you sometime
it wouldn't take wouldn't take much to get hooked on those
so so i watch those
well you know i haven't oh
well it's not really new
but it's still kind of new
i mean they'll have some things in there that almost almost you know like supernatural or something
you know i mean somebody will see a figure from the past that nobody else does
or i mean it sounds weird
but it's very uh unique show and very well done
i i guess we just
it came on after something we used to watch and i guess we just kept sitting there
and then now we make a point of watching
well then it will be mostly reruns i guess
and by the end of february the way they do it nowadays
well we used to watch a lot of designing women
but uh i haven't seen that much lately
since they got rid of uh delta burke and uh brought on the new ones
was she the was she the best one was she the best one on that old show
oh she was just funny
and her character was good
oh that was awful
and who knows still what ha- really happened you know
well i know
gosh you never will probably
well i think the latest soap opera for people is the kennedy trial for those who have cable
oh i know
now i told
so uh i haven't been able to catch any of that
but just what little we caught on the news
oh i know it
and i think he's guilty as the devil
well i don't see how he couldn't be you know
oh and they said this lawyer is unbelievable
but they said she held up so well yesterday
and then in the paper said it
well the national enquirer says
well do you watch any uh any sports or anything like that
because i don't either
i can't i can't watch it on t v
you know occasionally some ice skating will come on on a sunday or during the olympics i always watch that
well i suppose we both have credit cards
well i do use them
uh i have a few favorites that i use more than others
and uh i try to keep my balances fairly reasonable
i i could probably pay them off any month if i wanted to
uh but occasionally they can get out of hand and get higher when when you start using more than a few and uh they all can build up
uh i think they're handy
i just get uh
i don't carry a lot of cash with me and uh i hate writing checks when you go shopping
well do you use credit cards
i uh i watched my grandmother go into debt
and so i've
and then i guess my mother
so my mother learned from that
and i guess she taught me
so basically uh i just keep them
i use them so that i build up a credit rating you know
but otherwise uh i generally
and my husband it turns out
but he has the same habit
and we just keep a few you know few of the major ones and then use them once in a while for something
oh that's that's wonderful
but we always pay it off right that month so that we don't pay any service charge
so that way we keep out of debt
and we keep on top of what we're spending
well the interest rates in credit cards is so high now compared to what you're savings is bringing
but i know some people can get get you know carried away with them and let them get out of hand
it's really easy just to forget you know that you you charged that or charged that
but sometimes i forget
and so you know s- a bill will come in
and i'll think oh no i didn't know it was going to be that high
but so far i've been able to we've been able to pay it off every time
well that's good
i'm looking right now i'm k- kind of looking for a visa that has a lower interest rate
it seems that some of them have gotten higher and uh i saw on t v they had a program on uh credit cards
and they're supposed to
i don't know if it was tennessee or arkansas or some some other state had a visa card that was the lowest one in the country
and i didn't write it down at the time
and then i went and looked and to see what my visa was
and i think it's eighteen percent or something so think i want to find something that has a lower rate
but you know
uh i think sears originally put it out
but it's uh it's pretty well taken all over the u s now
i mean uh i've haven't found many places that don't take discover
and there's no annual service fee which is good
you know and then uh they also give you they say cash back uh like at the end of the year
oh they give you money back for using your credit card
oh i didn't know that
and i think the service charge is pretty low too
but i'm not sure
um well you know sears was one of the few department stores that never would take any other credit cards
i worked w- at sears for over ten years
and uh it was only a sears card that they would take until i guess they decided to join the club and come up with their own credit card another credit card that was accepted
so you know now they'll take the discover
but i still don't know if sears will take visa or mastercard
but uh i never did apply for a discover card
i've got some that i you know i haven't even used at all uh past few years
but uh i i do like my dillard's
and i do use dillard's probably as more than any of the other department stores
well it was good talking to you
well got any problems on mockingbird with crime
or is that a crime free zone there
uh one evening i decided to retire early and heard sirens and noises and thought oh well something's happens on mockingbird and then heard yells and screams
and the next thing i know there are policemen all around my house
and they had stopped a uh b- a stolen car and caught one of the men in the hedge
and then the other one was on the roof in the back
b- on my house
oh my goodness
aye aye aye
so i'm very much aware of uh crime in the cities and the and the concern about it
that's that's got to be a frightening way to spend an evening
i uh i kept hearing noises
and so i i knew that i was not going to sleep until i got up and went out and checked the garage
so i got a g- my gun and walked to the you know through the house into the garage
but i wanted to be sure
i think uh you know as any city grows up uh you get the hoods and the roof- riffraff and everybody else in there
and i think
uh you know fortunately the sirens and everything we hear are over on spring creek
but uh we've been we've lived here sixteen years
and now you you know you can tell the change for sure
well i was thinking if you've been there that long you've seen plano grow from what was really a a small town to a city
well with all the uh central expressway uh
with all the stores and the uh restaurants and the uh convenience stores and all that kind of stuff it's just prime pickings for people driving by
you know and
well i was appalled to read the other day about the uh uh shooting on the tollway
that's that couldn't be too far from you neither
uh well it's farther west of me
uh it was really frightening to
think that uh it's not even safe to drive onto the tollway
uh i never thought about someone robbing those
but apparently they do
i don't know uh how a few bucks can be worth shooting somebody
it's kind of kind of stupid isn't it
but i guess when people do those things they don't really give a thought of the consequences at the time
and away you go right
and i think the drugs play a tremendous part in uh the theft and the the violence that we see
i think you're right uh although i think that may be an excuse for people too
it it is convenient isn't it
and i think people uh i think when you have haves and have nots you're always going to find people that are too lazy to figure a way to earn money and find it's easier if you can get a gun to go out and hold something up than it is to figure out a way to legitimately earn the money
and i work in south dallas for the dallas school system
and uh uh
uh do you know where oakland and hatcher are
that uh is that amelia earhart school there
uh just not far off south central expressway
oh my goodness
and uh you know you watch the people
and the kids see that
and uh they know that they can earn several hundred dollars in a day where uh you know running for uh drug dealers if
definitely that area that that's big time
that's the worst neighborhood in the whole c- area
it's uh a little scary sometimes
and uh i manage the
and i live in te- texas too
do do you also
uh you ready to begin
and how do you feel about putting someone in the nursing home
well i don't think that uh any of my relatives would really like to go there
i i believe if i am in a position uh like when my mother gets to a point where she needs special care that i will be able to just bring her into my home uh-huh
and my father also and uh or have someone go into their home you know and uh and look after them
i would find it very difficult uh to uh place eit- my father or my step-mother uh in a place like that particularly since i know how they feel about it
it's basically it's more how they feel about it
and it is like they feel they are uh the way my mother would put it like somebody had thrown them away
i do think that there are some significant kinds of things to to look for you know if you are faced with placing someone
in a place like that uh you know aside from the cleanliness and the medical care that is offered and such
but attitude of staff makes such a tremendous difference
and i have a a friend who is partly paralyzed and is in a nursing home and has no family who you know could care for her
and uh i know that the cheerful pleasant people who treat her kindly make all the difference in the world in how she feels about uh her situation
and another thing to think about uh on the positive side of the nursing homes here
i use to work in one of the offices in a nursing home and i got to see a lot of the things that they did they uh they had a lot of crafts and they had a lot of games
and uh they get together and just do they they do all sorts of things
and then there
some some of the uh the people that are in there are real you know very nice and friendly to everybody and uh then there are others that are
uh it is just a job
and they just you know want to go in and do what they have to do and get out go home
uh the the attitude of the staff as you said is really very very important
i think it would matter too uh kinds of uh disabilities that the nursing home accepts
because there are some uh who poor things you know don't have uh any real grasp on reality any longer
and they may be ambulatory
but they tend to behave like children small children and that would be very difficult i think for an adult who wasn't in that situation to to have to deal with on a daily basis
well it is like wel- the one that i worked in uh you would see some of them just like in wheelchairs all day
and and they would enjoy enjoy themselves with activities
and then you would see see some of the others that are were like distant from the other group
and they they just didn't like participate together with the others because they had some some uh i guess uh slight mental disabilities and things like that
and that can
so frank what uh type of uh budget do you or your family have
i have a set amount that i that i save
actually well actually there is a a way
uh my wife uh has so much uh gets so much to do shopping with every couple of weeks
and uh we allot each of us so much money per week for our personal stuff gas and things like that
and besides that i uh you know i have a set amount that i save every month
that's uh sounds like probably a tighter controlled budget than what i have
but i basically
so it makes it a little bit easier
uh and also i you know i try to save a certain amount each month as well and uh i try to try to have an idea of what my expenses are
and i am pretty consistent from month to month and uh whenever uh i need to uh whenever that changes i am pretty well aware of it without actually having to maintain a budget for it
well i found that uh you know things as i have gotten older
but before we use to have to have to have a very strict budget
and uh you know we planned out how much we were going to spend for food and how much for for this and for that
uh i guess one interesting aspect of the budgeting i do now is that i set aside uh i kind of fence off areas of my check book
for instance there are certain things that i know come up uh every so often
uh every six months i have to pay my taxes
so i take a set amount
i've got a money market account that i do a lot of uh uh saving in
and i also have got a checking account besides that
but what i do on my money market account my taxes for instance which amount to an average of two hundred and twenty dollars a month i will just take two hundred and twenty out
and i put it in parenthesis
and i guess that's a way of budgeting
i guess i kind of do a similar thing more uh medium or longer range
like i am
so i kind of have a an amount in my mind
and i am making every effort to to sal- put a little bit away and increase the amount that i need for a down payment or whatever
uh you know we've got two cars
and i like to drive pick up truck
so we are on a schedule where i try every uh three or four years to to buy a new one
and you know i am constantly making car payments
but i figure that's got to be the story of my life anyway is making car payments
so uh you know i get one paid for
and uh actually i am saving up for another one besides
so it's you know it's kind of a never ending thing
but you try to you try to schedule those things so that uh you only you're not paying for two of at the same time i guess is what i am saying
have you thought about uh leasing
well uh i have thought about it
but leasing wouldn't
you know i don't use it for my business
and i use mine just to go back and forth to work which is only ten miles away
but if you are rolling it over every three years
you know typically you if you purchase your own car you tend to make uh the best returns after you pay it off
uh i have uh been know to keep trucks or cars for oh ten or twelve years
but i find that after about four years they kind of start going down hill
and you got to put put stuff in them you know
mine's uh seven years old
and i think last year was that was a rough year for it
but uh i am hoping that most of them were just kind of
uh you know the
so i just went through that whole set last year
those things can really upset your budget when they when they come in
uh you know it's nice to have a little bit set aside for the for the unexpected shall we say
so that it doesn't uh kill you all in one month
oh i i start
well uh we keep a budget to an extent
uh and really i- i- we were really forced into keeping a budget because i'm i'm paid once a month which sort of sort of forces some uh uh restrictions
and you need to make sure all your bills are paid
uh about yourself
well i have to say i really don't have a budget
both my wife and i uh grew up in uh families of rather modest means
and uh our family income at this point is comfortable upper middle class i guess you might say
and uh we're both so uh frugal that uh we really don't need a budget you know
well i guess that really is sort of uh keeping a budget
well we stay within our means
you know you stay within your uh within your means
but we don't do it uh by conscious effort
although we just moved to california
and uh the cost of living here in california is uh i would say rather pathological
uh housing prices are you know like from four to ten times more expensive than uh uh
oh you moved from dallas to san francisco
so uh uh that presents a a real shock
ac- ac- actually our standard of living has gone down somewhat since we've moved to california
but you have good sour dough
and it's a beautiful place to live
uh and one way you know that is that only god can afford it
uh so budget is not a problem for us
uh at least it hasn't been
it may may be at this point
but uh up until this point it really hasn't been
when i uh was in uh undergraduate school a long long time ago i uh noted that the monthly salary starting average monthly salary
and uh i noted at that point that i was you know if that's what my salary was that i drew then i would be making almost twice as much as my father made during his best year ever
so i stopped worrying about money
well that that's a system too
sometimes uh it's a bit of a a problem you know because i guess i don't really manage my money the way i should
but uh i suppose i've lost money on not taking good advantage of of uh investments
well then again you know you said you you are able to take trips
and you do obviously have enough to live on
so i guess you're indirectly budgeting
uh just bye-bye the fact that you said you're both very frugal uh in spending the money
so i mean that's that's a form of budgeting i would think
it's it's kind of a strange topic to to try to for two people who don't really have a budget to talk about budgeting and how they manage their money
well i guess we're both lucky in that regard then
uh well we're we have one on the way
uh my wife
and then we're we're having one on the way in uh in uh september
you whe- once you get ten children though you may have
oh all right
uh one nine and one thirteen
and they are beginning to be a budget problem but uh have not been really up until this up to this point
i mean do you have them on an allowance
i give them a i give them an allowance
and they uh
and i put half of it in the bank
and i give give him the other half in cold cash
and uh he has a teller card so he can uh do what he wi- do what he wishes with the money that i put in the bank
but at least it isn't you know burning a hole in his pocket
and that usually
capital punishment uh i guess out in california is has had a lot of uh a lot of you know discourse in the paper
uh apparently you know there's they haven't uh executed anybody since nineteen sixty-seven i believe
that's that's as far back as i can remember
well that's before my time actually
well i we were we uh we just started we lived in redwood city when we were out there
and uh and we found that uh
but the uh i i really feel that that the law enforcement community uh you know puts these people behind bars
and then they they uh uh you know lawyers these lawyer groups get together
and they uh they i think extend beyond the normal uh appeal process uh you know and just drag these this guy uh his his uh ultimate uh demise out for ten or fifteen years
uh and i i think that uh that there's something that has to be changed in the system to to do that
i think capital punishment uh uh was or probably stringent enough
but i think the appeal process is really getting in the way
do do you feel as though there should be uh
well i think that currently the way the law stands isn't so much that the laws are enforceable or not
it's at that point where they're saying like here you're you're going on death row
but you'll stay there for twenty years
and nothing is being done about it
uh the laws exist and are frequently upheld in in uh in appeals court just because of technicalities
and it's it's really getting out of hand in many states
uh uh you know has to has to separate the difference between somebody who is being set up in which uh grievous
or whether uh an- and whether the rights of that individual are been have been you know impuned
but but you know the the merits of the case in terms of you know
now i i'm a- a- at this juncture
i you know i'm i'm not sure you know what constitutes a a technicality
you know that that's what all c- these these hearings are about
and that's what all these you know court cases are about
i mean our uh our our glorious uh you know mayor here in washington is six days away from getting out of out of the can
and you know it didn't work
but be that as it may everybody who got enough money will pump the appeal process dry
uh in in the old days you know and say round about times of battle of hastings you know and the villages if you were a transgressor they they either you know drove you out in the woods or you became a ward of somebody
and he you were his slave
and if he didn't like what you did he killed you
and that has that's pretty effective
uh you know it's not good for civil rights i guess
but it's pretty effective in that you know you've got to get along in the community
and if you don't you'll perish either by the hand of your your your master or by being pushed out in the woods
so i i i mean as as man has gotten more complicated so all of the uh imaginations to uh you know protect him from from being uh dumped on by uh civilian authority in in so- in criminal actions especially you know murder cases and that sort of thing
well it seems like
and the whole idea behind the current criminal process system
um for instance um there's a case a few years back where uh
and where his
old evidence was there the witnesses were there the everything was conclusively pointing to this individual yet
and uh i know the the government is uh you know gives drug tests an- to all new entrants all new appli- applicants coming into government
and and i quite frankly don't see anything wrong with it
i i'm i guess i'm not a good civil libertarian
and and i i feel as though uh that uh uh you know that if you you're a drug user you have a hidden agenda that's difficult unless you really go into a deep background
of course we're we're
being involved in my organization uh we we have deep background checks
and and so uh but but sometimes you know drug use can can escape that
and uh i have absolutely no compunction about uh using any and all means to to uh uh you know work out figure out who has a drug program or who has a drug problem and uh and putting that guy into into therapy to whatever it is to to you know break this uh activity
and there isn't anything
but getting stoned or high is is the only thing in life that seems to be meaningful then maybe there is no hope
what's your uh feeling
uh well i guess i i guess i'm probably a little more to toward the other direction
uh well i guess mainly because uh it's i well
like there's two sides to it i guess
uh one is that uh if you're coming to work under the influence of any sort of drug alcohol whatever or you know even if it's smoking inhibits you know your ability to function then i i think that that you know i don't have any problem at all with testing that individual you know on the spot
uh but i guess i feel more like whatever you're doing in your own private life is your own private business
uh and i guess part of the reason there is because of the fact that uh things like drug laws seem to come and go
you know we had prohibition for awhile
and then we didn't have prohibition
uh you know we've had i guess laws against uh you know various other forms of drugs for the last what sixty or seventy years i guess
well i think uh the dr- the laws on uh uh uh the first morphine laws were were like ninety or nineteen ten or nineteen five something like that
so ei- eighty years or so
uh so i
you know it's it's hard to i guess for me to justify what so- seems like you know basically a breach of the first amen- you know freedom from uh search and seizure you know uh on something that may or may not stand as a law you know fifty years from now or even twenty or ten
i mean prohibition certainly didn't last
well the thing of it is the the tha- tha- that that is uh uh in in many respects uh uh you know just just i think an over simplification
i i think there th- th- th- there's so much criminal activity uh that people go into to to support drug habits
well but you got to look at prohibition though
you know they they support drug habits with uh with uh you know with things like uh you know burglary or or prostitution or stuff like that
well it goes back to that again
if you look at prohibition i mean because it's illegal it costs more
i mean face it you can buy pharmaceutical grade cocaine for what ten or twenty dollars an ounce
i i i
and clearly if you're into coke and all you want to do is you know snort your brains out all day long if it was legal you could do it real cheap
and you know you'd be a menace to nobody but yourself as long as you stayed at home and did it
i i must admit that the production costs of of these drugs are are zippo compared to the street market costs and and the costs to society
well that's why there's you know people dealing it because there's money in it you know
but i i i i think that that the that you know the being in law enforcement you know th- th- th- they i i probably have a kind of a draconian philistine attitude toward it
and but but the uh uh i i really feel as though the interdiction effort is is
as soon as you you get rid of one goon that's that's that's involved in drugs and tha-
and then another another one will jump up
i mean there's no way you're ever going to win that
but we we see
i mean that's a losing fight
a- a- as soon as we wind up uh uh you know for
well if we can just destroy the market by destroying the demand
but but people want to get get stoned
and i i don't see that
it goes back to you know what right what can society impose on people
i mean can you force somebody to be a good productive citizen
i mean you know i'm you know was raised with being a very strong bible work ethic
so you know i'm one of these you know ten twelve fifteen twenty hour a day type people
so you know yeah
you know i don't have any you know love lost for people who are on the public dole just because they're too lazy to get a job or that kind of stuff
but you know
and and you know the pay is regular
but uh you know sometimes you don't get tuned in to what's going on
and i i think the biggest benefit or the biggest benefit other than wages that that uh that anybody could get in in dealing with a large company is to be in a situation where you you get to know what's going on
and maybe that's that's probably the toughest thing in the whole world to to do
what's what's your feeling about benefits
uh my uh my husband works for mcdonald douglas
and so his benefits his medical benefits are so excellent you know
you know i work for uh wes- a bank western financial
and uh they don't let me know really about anything that's going on
and all of a sudden we know we've got changes made
we're changing doing other kinds of things which to me is is disturbing
i mean i feel like if i i don't necessarily need to uh be involved since i'm pretty much on a low level
you are you are right there
you know i'm pretty much on a low level as far as uh the company is concerned
but i i do kind of like to know what's going on and what's happening
and i think i can be a better and more effective employee if if i had a little bit more information along that line
i i well i work for the government
and uh actually i work for the f b i
oh my gosh
and uh and so you know we we don't there's lots of things that we don't get told for good reason
but uh but basically uh there's lots of things that that we should know about projects
i'm an engineer you know
i'm i'm a cotr
and i i worked in the same lab with a guy
and we didn't really know that much about each other's projects for two years
and we should have
you know we're we're now collaborating
and it it
but uh but our organization is doing something else t- on monday
uh we're having a for all unclassified programs we're we're having little tables put up in front of lab in the hallways
and every all the other employees are going to come around and see what sort of things we do which i thought was kind of interesting and but uh but that that sort sort of thing
but if you i think you can tolerate a lot of problems if you understand what's going on
and and but of course most time most of the time management has a hard time distributing or getting the word out to the people who must know
and you know if you don't really count if you're not part of the program you might not get told for months
or you might you know if it doesn't impact you directly or if your management doesn't think that
but but regard to benefits you know most companies have most big organizations have decent you know benefits like retirement and that sort of thing
in the private sector i would think that one of the major uh situations especially when you reach you know the the mid-fifties wa- is
and engineers are uh
and uh it's very much like the military
you know you you think well boy i'm getting more money
and i'm getting more responsibility
but as you climb up that tree pretty soon you're the the branches get smaller on the top of the tree and pretty soon somebody falls off
i i've fallen off twice in the private sector
it it seems to be be kind of kind of scary you know because you think of
uh see my son's eighteen right now
and he he's uh
and the the the branches of engineering that he wants to go into is now kind of open
and he's interested in basically three different areas
but uh it's difficult for me to try to give him any kind of advice or to advise him or anything like that
he needs to do his own course of investigation and and see what he can do because who knows what's going to happen in another thirty years
and in thirty years it becomes pretty critical
i mean my uh brother-in-law is like uh i mean he's sixty
but his company is is uh is uh closing up
and because of the defense cutbacks and all that kind of stuff and all the nuclear and stuff which is what he what he was working on he's getting cut back
and he's not ready to retire
budgeting activity in our household i has is uh uh kind of an informal kind of situation
we we you know put
actually what happens is uh is my check gets automatically deposited
and you know and all those people are counting on me to have my wife pay them you see
and so our our budgeting
w- we really don't have a formal budgeting situation
every time i've ever tried one it's uh i've just got wrapped in my inertia
and uh i've just decided not to pursue it
uh what what's your budget situation
well actually uh i've i've had a couple of different situations
uh at a certain point in life
an- my husband my ex-husband was an alcoholic
and we got divorced back in the mid-seventies
and that left me with three teenagers
and you know well a- a- actually that kind of situation is just wonderful for budgets
but at any rate what happened was that i i just absolutely put away all the credit cards
because there was one that it was really handy to have
but uh mostly we just spent cash whatever we had
and if we didn't have it we absolutely didn't spend it
but then as things improved you know
once once i got them all through college uh it came to the point where uh
well my you know my my parents too
you you you were born in in the in the late thirties or early forties
and uh my mother hardly ever spent anything on herself or on the house
and that's kind of the way i was raised
and so i'm not a very demanding person in in that aspect
so for quite a period of time i just flat didn't spend any money
now meanwhile i got had a a building bank balance
and my intent was that whenever something went on sale that i really had to have i would have the cash to buy it right then and there
well that that's good
and that that's the way i've operated ever since then
and you know if if something goes on sale and i don't have the money i still don't buy it
and and we put twenty-eight hundred dollars on the charge along with my trip to japan which was was fourteen or fifteen hundred dollars
and you know
i mean we just we got a monster you know bill coming in
but but we also have zero in- interest being paid
and we pay it off as as it goes
and that's the way i do my credit cards now
so we never really get that much over uh over extended
but it's the fact that i have enough of a of a cushion in the bank so that when they come i can pay them in full
we're we're doing that
we have you know uh
th- this is our our our big uh
two you know two new pieces in the ref- in the family room and new carpet
i mean we just uh we've just been spending spending spending
bu- but we haven't really done anything for a long time because we've we've had two kids in college that just have graduated in the past year
so we're you know we don't have that
it's uh it's about time that we did that
but th- the the terrible part about it i've looked at it all
and it all looks still pretty good to me
i mean uh i say it might go for another thirteen
but uh too late we'll never find that out
but you're lucky to have her because if you're like me and you have difficulty spending money you need somebody to help you spend it
i mean certain things really do need to be done whether or not you think they should
you know i i
i just uh we just sort of have had uh you know too many obligations to you know
we sort of take care of the kids when they were school and they they got through school
and that was the major you know decade of expenses you know
so we we feel as uh
but as far as any formal budgeting uh you know i i we just apparently have been very fortunate
when we went want to go out to eat we go out to eat
but uh we don't have that uproarious a a lifestyle
we have we have gone through what might be called the four seasons uh in the last week
well i don't even want to tell you what ours has been like then
but then today the wind has dropped off and also the temperature so very cool uh
and that's cool for u-
or it feels cool compared to yesterday but very pleasant
and our yard work everything is in bloom
so our yard work is pretty tough the ground being dry
but i guess it also uh brings about allergies
and and the weather
and uh i think a lot of people have contracted uh spring fever too
so had a lot of people out at work you know for fishing and and uh
oh we have had uh as i've said we have had variable weather uh
and also we have a lot of green you know
and if you look outside you would like to go out and mow your lawn
but fortunately it rains
and you uh do not have to go out and buy the spark plug
but we've had an unusually uh uh warm spring
and well i guess we're still in winter
to speak of to speak of
we usually average oh anywhere from six to twelve inches during the winter
and this year as well as last year we have had less than four inches total accumulation
so it's been inordinately warm uh here for uh for this time of year
so uh in that regard it's fine
and of course we are um about two hours from the northern border straight south
and and uh very windy
because i have only lived in dallas for three years
and i cannot believe that the wind blows all the time
i can't remember you know a day that i walked out and the wind wasn't blowing
well i spent six years in graduate school at in indiana in the flatlands
and it was that way every day
so that uh
you you became accustomed to it i guess
but uh otherwise w- as i said we have had uh a relatively mild winter
oh rea- where did you go to school in indiana
i have a brother that lives in uh uh south bend indiana
and i had to always
but i didn't uh
well you are not from that area originally i can tell
and we lived in uh south bend for eighty eight years and uh then moved to uh tennessee actually
well i thought i heard a little tennessee in there somewhere
cause i i spent thirteen years there
and uh then moved to dallas about three years ago
you've moved almost moved around as much as i have
oh i see
well i worked for the government
so i i moved uh much more frequently than i had intended for sixteen years
but uh i guess the uh this is my first conversation in this uh uh series
i i received a call last night because of the uh
i had not received my uh personal identification number
so i had to call jack godfrey today to ask him what it was because i i had to abort the call last evening because i couldn't get on the line
so uh is there any
it's um it's just as long as you want to
i mean it's just uh as long as you want to and just you know a reasonable lengthy conversation
uh do you work for texas instruments
and i uh of course was i was sent a uh an application from uh from jack
so i was very much interested
in in being a speaker for this
well actually i i work for texas instruments
and uh i'm an a i'm an environmental engineer
oh i see
so that that's really strange
i i was wondering why we had somebody from maryland though
and um but i have uh i have been a speaker in other uh similar type of activities
and i know the reason why this is why the uh this is being gathered and the program and so forth
so i was interested as i said i was interested in being a speaker
well really it
and i always thought it's not necessary to measure your time just to go ahead and enjoy the conversation and and end it when needed
in environmental engineering uh
is that with regard to work place engineering or just you know environm- the work place environment
uh well it's actually um waste water
oh i see
taking taking care of uh
and we monitor um
or um we do have customers that um their concerns are in the work place
and we take care of that
within our department we take care of everything waste water uh solid waste and recycling and and air and
well i had
my the the call last evening was supposed to be about uh concerning recycling
and so i had uh i had thought a little bit about it um
but that that's interesting
i have a uh uh friend who is a planner
uh a city planner
and one of his
and he models uh city districts and so forth
uh does computer modeling
and one of the uh
he has inputs or gets inputs from uh an environmental engineer
we actually our division is corporate wide
and we take care of just the dallas area
but um we do air modeling also
oh i see
and and yeah i take care of all the air modeling specifically for the dallas area
what we do we have a weather station that we get all of this information you know temperature wind speed wind direction
and uh we have a huge chemical data base
well that's interesting
and uh our
and and um it's concentration
and if if anything ever happened god forbid you know a building explosion or something tha- we'd be able to track chemicals from that building with our weather station
okay um well
uh what do you think you would offer as far as uh information about selecting a school
well first i think they've got to have a pretty good idea of what they want to what they want to do
uh once they have that then they can start looking in all the various publications that give out all the information about schools and write to the schools themselves and start finding out about the different requirements for the programs and what kind of uh of job assistance and all that other kind of stuff they offer
do you do you feel that the first two years that the um
depending upon the field i know there are some fields which a person should go to the school that school all four years
but i know there are some fields where it's really not necessary
it's it's your core education your general requi- general education requirements
um if you know if they want to get a liberal arts degree i don't i don't know what advice i'd give them
uh political science
political science oh
and uh i have a friend
uh u t d
um something that i i think that i've noticed that
i i have a friend
i think if you're going into like uh law or medicine a very particular very specific field even even engineering you can get you can meet a lot of the requirements at a public um institution
and uh it's a lot cheaper
my parents my parents made a mistake in uh in sending my sister to a private institution for the first two years
and she found out after that
she said you know my parents they just they really wasted a lot of money
but uh well right now i just
i mean as far as selecting selecting a school i i i feel that uh a lot of it depends upon the major
it does um
i didn't know what i wanted to do after i got my my degree
um originally i had planned uh undergrad degree in political science and then a master's in public administration
and i went ahead and pursued that
i i got as far as the thesis and decided to hell with it
um and from that point i went to law school
and after a year and a half of that i decided i didn't want that either
and so but i i i really did enjoy the law
i mean that's that's where i wanted to be
but i didn't want to go through the uh the hassle that the law schools put you through because i never did want to be a practicing attorney
and i've since discovered that i would be far better off being in the paralegal field
and you don't have to put up with all the b s that the lawyers have to
so that's that's what i'm pursuing right now and i'm pretty happy with it so far
i'm i'm pursuing what they what's what's called an interdisciplinary field
i'm a speech therapy major and fortunately i have a lot of i have a good medical background
it's it's actually turning out to be more more useful than what i thought
and um i also have a good languages background linguistics
so it's all working together
oh good grief
the only field i'm not familiar with really is education which is required requires about four or five different fields really
so it's a
but i i quickly dispelled that idea when i became a substitute teacher for a while just to get my feet wet
i said uh i couldn't do this everyday
maybe maybe being a tenured professor would be one thing but being a public school teacher is entirely another thing
oh so you are a disgruntled graduate student
i am a dis- i am i am just a disgruntled person all around
i'm the uh i'm the uh original uh mister scrooge i guess
i i i think
i i i think uh law would be a fine field a fine profession fine field to go into
um i know one time i was in a political science class
and you know talking about fields people going into different fields i made an off off the cuff remark about lawyers
and i mean oh that was like a can of worms
probably you probably got everybody on you because they were probably all going to law school
and it was just
well that remark in itself is a slam
you know like like uh my best friends are blacks
it used to be jewish you know
now blacks and i guess i i guess iraqi now is the
law law was a lot of fun until you get to law school and it doesn't become fun anymore
i have a
she's studying she's going into law
i i i'm really i'm really concerned about you know
you know all of her dreams will be dispelled
if if if you've ever seen the program paper chase it's very much like that except worse
it's i i think it's probably more embarrassing and very painful
i see i see that happening
it's it's a lot of that um it it was enjoyable for a while um
but it's such a grind and you begin to wonder you know
if if i'm not i mean
i mean i wasted a year and a half of awfully hard
and i aged ten years
but i i i wouldn't trade the experience for
and and that was a it was a an un- i guess uh
and i i think probably the biggest
for myself i mean i think that military experience
it was just i just wish that there was something else
well i got i got tired of the service after a while i mean
what what was your job
uh command post
uh i was i was a linguist
i i thought maybe you might have had some experience with the uh r c one thirty-fives
i didn't i didn't go flight crew
matter of fact i didn't make it completely through that through that field
after about eighteen months of talking about the year and a half training you know it's it's something you know
i think that's why you know children really need to think about the field they're going to going into and i mean spend a lot of serious reading before they i mean not just thinking about
they actually should do some reading and they should study it
and it and if it's possible even get some experience at it or at least watch some people do it
i i i i think i think there's a lot to be said for kids working after school
i mean they they find out whether just how much of a people person they are
oh and i tell you what
and i i can tell you one thing
there are just some people that i you know
and oh i eventually worked in a lab in a la- as a lab technician
and i worked front desk
and i mean somebody could walk in the door
and i knew exactly what they were going to do and say
i i i hate um having to play such a nice guy
you know especially when it's all phony
especially when you got some uh jerk coming in
i'm uh i deal much better in research and books and stuff like that which is why i'm going to enjoy the paralegal field a lot
i was just wondering um getting back to the school thing so i i almost wish that there was something
so i'm not buying a car any time soon
i just bought mine uh
well i i like where all the controls are they're they're in good spots
and i i have an automatic i can't drive a standard
it's an it's supposedly real reliable
i had uh a mazda r x seven before that
and that was the worse car i've ever driven in my life
the buick was was great
and that was the only major problem that i had i mean
i had like little piddly things like i had to replace the muffler
and i had replaced the tires
and uh seems like it had a radiator leak once
but i never had any major anything
but it was a standard also
and the clutch went out on it toward the end
and the last year last two years it seemed to go out really easily
and that's that's a lot
and so i went ahead and bought another standard when i bought the honda
but i don't think i'm going to do that again
well i never well
but i've never owned one
so i hadn't i don't drive one a lot
so i don't feel comfortable in traffic with it
and for everything i've heard it's a lot easier to sell an automatic
and and resale value is really important to me
i did pretty well with my uh regal because it was in really good shape
the the interior was still really nice
and it had some some nice features
so i ended up okay with the buick
and i anticipate the same thing with the honda whenever i decide to sell it
that's what i did with the mazda drive it until the until the clutch went out and the wheels fell off
so probably what i'll do again
but i really like the hondas
and it was so small
and it's really impractical
so i wanted something with a real trunk and four doors something easy to get in and out of
and i looked at the galant
and those were really nice
and i can get them for a great price
but i found it hard to deal with the the dealership i was going through
so that's how i ended up with a honda
i uh i was thinking about buying a prelude from a friend who was moving to new york or something
so and she was going to sell her car because she didn't need it anymore
and it was only like a year old
and i had never driven uh a prelude
so i went to a dealership because they had like uh the same year and same model
and i went and i test drove it
and you know i just fell in love
with this brand new white prelude uh you know
um i love all those little things that you don't need
but they're so wonderful
and two days later i bought this car
i felt like i felt like that was the worst impulse that was that was largest impulse that i that i had ever made
the oth- the two
and i got it right after high school
so by the time i traded it in it was ready
i got i got my buick as a high school graduation gift
but i i guess this wasn't really an impulse i mean
buying it right then and you know right quickly was kind of impulsive
but i'd been thinking about buying a new car for about three years
and i was just scared to
buy a wha- ar- you
i i was going to buy one once
but i just i worry about who's driven them and what they've been through and the warranties and things like that
well um like on hondas they
and you can request whatever maintenance records exist on cars
and you can have them checked out by mechanics and stuff
i mean they can't stop you from doing it
well and even if they didn't you can still get a good idea from a if you can get a good mechanic to
well i guess that's all
well i enjoyed talking to you
anyway what are your what are your first comments on that
i would i would cut the prison systems and let them self-support
have private enter- enterprise do it
i mean they're talking about uh having it uh as a you know business uh to uh you know to so the you know the government doesn't have to deal with it
but uh yeah
because i think it's all funded either state or federally funded
so or uh obviously
so but uh
but to me it
but see they're they don't have enough uh uh you know there's there's not enough room in these prisons and that and that uh to continue funding it
they think they need to maybe have uh you know private you know business private enterprise come in
well see the other way i'm thinking about is they should be self-supporting like uh the prisoners make
it's the same thing like the whole criminal i shouldn't say criminal but the whole police department of the united states
uh someone gets picked up for drunk driving
so it's self defen- you know self-defense on that point
uh as far as my defense budget uh they're cutting it back now what twenty-five percent
but again i'd like to see something on the other
so i'm lost on that one
its tough to to say what uh you know what uh
but uh i was just talking to somebody else
and all those european countries they pay all the way through college and stuff like that
well not so much pay
but i'm just saying that even the differences uh is that you know some countries pay for students to go to through college and etcetera
but here it you know it's just up to high school
but see we don't even push the fact to the high school kids that there's other means of education out there rather than college
why not an apprentice out to a a company and learn from down on the bottom as a wood worker or you know just a technician
which of course again which m- would mean again
in a few years i mean it's not going to be overnight
but that would come down
i think the pro- you know that's one reason uh you know we do have the education is that what it takes for these companies to bring somebody on board uh
they're not willing to you know to put that you know
so uh it's you know as far as the technical side
but uh even like
one one of the biggest things now is like paralegals and stuff
i mean they they're trying to get more people into that field
but they can't just bring somebody in without even having gone to you know school in that area before they can work you know for a lawyer as a paralegal
excuse me i see it being done
and she's training her
i i'm well ya- i you know i'm assuming that it can be done uh
my perspective is that you know i've been with a couple of big companies now
and it's like they'd are unwilling to put the time in
you know they want somebody you know when they then when they bring them off bring them in that they have something you know a certain amount to contribute
obviously there's uh you know there's a lot to learn uh after that
but but uh that's true
i'm i'm sure there's a lot of uh
you know businesses are small you know small businesses that could uh
and all of a sudden we had a bad uh frequency there or something
so we had some interference
so i changed that
anyway so uh
but uh you know i think uh they maybe they need to uh help promote that more give incentives like uh if they do bring somebody on they will pay some of their costs or give tax breaks or whatever it is you know for them to train people
you know stuff like that programs like that you know
i don't know you know what kind of options they've got
well that's something about what germany's supposed to be doing something similar to that right now
and uh they have jobs out on you know bulletin boards so people know what is open for an apprentices in different fields
but see that again would cut some of our budget down for education but build up our education with the people at people per at high school level
they're they go on the unemployment list before we have turn around
and i'm for college
but there's a lot of people that don't want their higher education as far as quote quote college is concerned
it was like only it was either sixty percent or forty percent go to college
and then out of that percentage only so many can get their degree
so i thought that was interesting
but uh you know most people i knew have gone and got their degree
but there's a lot of them out there that haven't
well i ju- you know i
uh was basic in a you know middle upper middle class area
so i think uh that demographic area there you know a lot of them do go on
and they go to college etcetera
well it seems to me that kids that a- get out of high school that parents have gone to college and college here and college there that are really not interested in going to college and forced into it usually are your drop outs where if they're said hey it's just as advisable to go into something you enjoy and you like
because you can get just as far as being a journeyman carpenter or an electrician or plumber or anything else like that make as much money
and if they enjoy it more they'll make a lo- happier life for themselves
and they have so much to spend
and there's not enough money to spread around
but the deficit basically is that the trade surplus between the other countries and that we have more money or goo- you know more money going out and too many goods coming into this country you know
like japan still does not let us compete fairly in their country
and and obviously the the demand for their goods is quite high here
so they can get their goods in here
and uh you know to start even that out we need to continue to you know at least threaten that you know
we're going to give them higher tariffs etcetera to raise their prices to you know ours
but uh it's just that uh they're eh
i think you're you're going to find that just because the united states you know there is such a demand here the market you know
and uh uh the mone- you know money being spent and the goods flow in and we don't sell you know we don't uh sell products abroad as much as we bring in
i think uh
one of the news stations i couldn't even tell you which one i watched but they had on there where the the output from the united states was basically from smaller businesses rather than the larger ones are exporting
well uh i think she's mostly german shepherd
uh she was uh uh
a person lives across the street from me uh brought her home from work because a coworker of hers uh had this dog appear on its front doorstep
somebody somebody abandoned her
she's only about oh si- between six and eight six to eight weeks old
uh uh i can't understand why anyone would abandon this dog though
she's o- i mean she's that this young
and she's almost housebroken
i mean she actually asks to go out
and uh yeah
i can't imagine what uh would have been wrong with this dog
well i i have a dog that god gave us too
but we've had her now for about three years
and i just
i had a uh
last year i had ano- i had another german shepherd
now this one was purebred
and uh he when he was about seven months old got a gastrointestinal virus and was just about on death's door
but uh managed to get him to a veterinarian in time
and uh and on huge doses of antibiotics
and he actually got over it with y-
um but he had actually was able to get him over that
and then he was gaining weight again was just getting healthy
and uh he put on about fifteen to twenty pounds after the thing
and then he got hit by a cadillac
so i couldn't believe it
that was that was really hard
and that was even harder for
and the dog was being house sit or dog sit whatever by some friends of mine down the street
so they just felt absolutely awful
oh i bet
and i felt felt probably worse for them than than for me
because oh gosh they the uh this fellow's wife who was uh watching the dog pro- she i think she loved that dog more than i did
she was jus- really attached to it
but uh it's unfortunate
but now i've got another one
uh see he it it was just over a year
uh it was in march of last year
so uh yeah
it'd been didn't didn't have one for a whole year
well i had i had a german shepherd before this one
and when she died it just it just absolutely destroyed me
i mean i was just
and so i decided well that's it
and then god gave me this dog
he uh he had a beagle that he loved
and uh when that beagle passed away uh he didn't want he wasn't going to have another dog
how and then uh the he the beagle died in i guess about october
and by christmas time we went down to the pound and got him uh i or i gue- humane society and got uh got another one a stray
and she she turned out to be a great dog
and we had her for six years until she just passed away recently
and again dad went through the whole thing
well you just do
i- it's like it's like a kid
well hopefully this one here cocoa will live a full life
well when uh
my my doggie uh that we have now uh she's she's mostly golden retriever
the vet called her uh a golden mix
like who knows you know
but she's uh she's that sort of strawberry blonde reddish color you know
and uh and her nose is that pink you know
and her ey- she's sort of unicolor you know
so i named her rosebud
and uh a friend of mine said th- she that she gre-
this friend of mine grew up on a farm and said that she had uh a pet cow named rosebud
and she said there's a lot of longevity in that name
they're always always happy
and she's so easy going and so sociable
you know she loves everybody
and little kids can just you know maul all over her
and she just you know thinks it's great
this this friend of mine has th- well
it's the same guy that was watching uh my german shepherd when he got hit
but uh went fishing with him on friday and took
he's got a full a pure bred golden retriever
and then i had uh the puppy a little tiny puppy
and we went and took the two dogs up fishing
they just they had a ball romping around
and you know you can't get a golden retriever near water without it jumping in
and uh this golden retriever jumped in the the really fast moving uh river current
he's he's just about a year old himself and never had really
but he jumped in in the the river
well the puppy jumped in the into some of the pools but not into the
oh that's good
i was careful to keep her away from the the fast moving water
'cause if she fell in then i'd of been had to go in after her
and up here the waters probably about forty degrees right now
and i would not have been fun trying to retrieve her
but uh this dog dennis jumped in and got this look on his face like what do i do now as he's floating down the river then finally discovered that he could swim and uh actually paddled up against the current and uh made it back to the shore and climbed up
he he jumped in again
and he was swimming for quite a bit all afternoon
i pulled her out and uh then had to wrap her up in a sweatshirt because she was shivering so bad
and so but uh she got over it
well the german shepherd that i had before
we we had a little pool
and uh she was she did not want any part of swimming
but she liked to to get in the pool on the first step
you know in the summertime when it's really really hot
and she'd just lay there on that step and just you know cool off
i've i live right across the street from a a big lake here um
and i'm wondering if uh if she'll want to go out there and go swimming next year
i mean i've got
so she doesn't run loose
she could go in sometime when if i'm watching her
well the one that we had just didn't want any part of that
oh gee she hated baths worse than anything
it was it was just really a fight to you know get her clean
have you seen uh canine
the movie oh
and uh an part of the the movie is where he's trying to clean this dog up
and it's it's just hysterical
my my dog last german shepherd it was a real chore trying to give him a bath too
and that was the thing i couldn't figure out
because he would go in the lake
normally i mean he didn't seem to have a problem with getting wet
but if you wanted to get him wet forget it
well that's how cleo w- you know
but that was that was the only time she wanted to get wet
and she didn't want you getting her wet
but you really need to see that movie
i i w- we bought the movie
and i don- i don't know how many times i've seen it
and it came on t v the other night
and i was watching it again
and my husband heard me laughing
and he said i can't believe that you're still getting such a kick out of that movie
i saw the the uh previews for it and all
and it did look like it'd be a good mo- movie
uh really haven't had a whole lot of time to get out to see the movies lately
but i got to do more more fun things
well we always wait until we can rent them you know
well i'm uh i'm a second lieutenant in the air force
and so i travel a lot
i'm a engineer at uh at the laboratory rolm laboratory griffis air force base up here
that's how i got into uh into the switchboard project and all that
but it's nice having a dog here uh
un- un- uh
what's the unrequir- what's the word i'm looking for uh lots of affection no co- unconditional affection from the from the dog
well it's been nice talking to you
well uh i don't have strong feelings about changes to be made in the uh jury system do you
uh not at all
and this past semester i've taken two criminal justice classes and have discussed a lot on trials
uh well then you must know a lot more about this than i do
i don't think the judge should have i mean
uh i don't i don't even think that it should be unanimous either uh
well what about the idea that one is only guilty uh when proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt
i thought that was the point of uh a unanimous jury was the idea that if everyone agrees then there shouldn't be any reasonable doubt
but if there are some people who don't agree uh then there must be it seems to be there must be at least a reasonable doubt for some people
you you rarely hear you hear of course there's cases where someone has been put in in in uh prison uh falsely accused
but uh more than likely the people that are on the the jury know what they're doing
uh i mean you
but my friends my few friends who have uh say just the opposite
they say they're uh remarkably incompetent and uh don't know what they're doing and say one thing in the courtroom and then as soon as they get in the back room they just start letting all their prejudices hang out and to to air and all that
huh well you would think that they would get that in the uh
and i i know they automatically
when you go through uh when you're chosen is you're automatically like a a a professor in criminal justice or something like that
they don't want anyone with exper-
and they tend
and since anyone can get out of it who basically says they don't want to do it
i mean you know it's it's anyone can get out of jury just about
and uh so it it's uh it's not really my peers that
if i were ar- let's say i were arrested falsely or not and put up for a jury i wouldn't feel that uh i would be being tried by a jury of my peers
i'd be i mean i'd be tried by a jury of
i i get a little bit nervous about it
i've i've never
i i was called once
but i was out of the country
and apparently i apparently they thought i served
so i didn't i didn't make any noise about it
and they said the record showed i served
but i was out of the country at the time
so i'm pretty sure i didn't
i think the i guess there's a lot of problems with the legal system
and uh it seems to me that if you could just have a simple majority or something you could pretty much brow- you know
a majority in the of the a majority of the jury
uh so it's it's uh you know saying well look we don't like the way he looks
and let's uh let's throw the rascal in jail and stuff
and you also get a lot of uh juries are extremely uh
and from what i hear
i i have i have some friends who do expert wis- witness testimony
and they say that uh juries are extremely vulnerable to uh sort of emotional pitches you know
and uh or or uh if it's a corporation that was uh you know har- harming some individual or something like that they get very much well you know
it's just a big faceless corp- corporation
let's let's make them pay as much as possible
i i mean i'm
the problem is i can't guarantee that a judge would be necessarily be much better than a jury
but i'd be real nervous having a jury not at least fully agree on what the settlements would be
i uh i do- i i don't think the judge should just make the decision alone
least with the jury you have twelve people you know that are going to decide you know
you're the the person's fate
well how about having a j- jury and a judge work together on it somehow
but uh no
it's it's sad though that uh that the people though that
you you somebody's life is in twelve people's hands
and sometimes those twelve people could care less
and uh or they fool the the defense in thinking that they're you know
because when they go through those processes they kind of pick out who they want
oh of course
it's it's political maneuvering
the the one side is looking for someone whose face they think will you know want to hang everyone
and the other one is going to look for someone very sympathetic
they want to find a juror that's going to uh be most persuadable by their arguments you know
uh i wish it were a little bit harder to not serve on juries actually
i mean i know it it it's tricky
because i know you know an awful lot of intelligent people who just well
so i'll tell them that
and they won't or just you know just answer one of the questions the wrong way because you can do that you know
i guess it's just that maybe people are you know upset at court you know
if it was if it was a a family member of theirs though that was innocent
and then they'd want to be on that jury
course they'd be they would be barred
well it sounds like we both need to get out there and serve on a jury
they will they will eventually
well it was nice talking with you
um that's a good question
and and they did a full blood screen
but they didn't call that a drug test
i had i've had uh
and really i mean i don't mind them
and they get drug tested randomly
but that would probably bother me to wake up
well i guess it depends on if you got something to worry about
well i i i come from kind of a biased opinion because i'm a a therapist and a drug and alcohol counselor
and i've done employee assistant work
and i i know the kind of cost businesses go through in terms of accidents
and it's like in the billions of dollars every year um
and th- the only way that they can prevent that is
and you know the the problem in the work place is that that people are
like if your boss is your drinking buddy or whatever i mean you can come to come to work drunk and get in an accident
and he'll cover up for you
but c- you know ends up costing the company lots and lots of money
i think anyone in a in a public job like bus drivers and cab drivers and police officers and
you know secretaries aren't aren't really going to cost the company that much money if they fall face forward in their typewriter or something
i i'm kind of biased too because i don't do drugs
so i guess that's kind of biased
it's i i think one of the problems with it is it affects a lot of other folks on the job if somebody else is impaired
because generally you know it
uh you find out one way or another if somebody's got a problem on the job
and if e- even if like you say even if it's just the secretary
if her work or abilities start affecting her co-workers then it it's still a problem
but what do you do about
and you know it's it's been the whole weekend since they've done anything
and they happen to be tested monday morning
and they could be fired for that
you know that that's kind of unfair also
and in terms
so you're you're breaking the law anyway
probably the the biggest problem with those is they don't do a real good job of of assessing for alcohol
and that's probably the biggest problem there is
and i know a lot of companies that will
they would pay for an alcohol but they don't always pay for drug rehabilitation
well i guess that's one of the positive things that ha- have come out of it some of the employee assistance program
i think the benef- the company benefits in the long run
what what kind of testing do they do when you went
uh it's a urine test
and and you have to seal the bottle yourself and label it yourself and
well that happens
i ca- it's hard to believe
but i guess it does
there there are people that n- pay other people to
and they are those are expensive tests
it depends r- r- really on how how strong a test it is
as far as as how far back they can check
they've some companies that are doing uh hair tests
and they can apparently test um
because some of the the residue ends up in your hair follicles you know
oh that's weird
they they've got it pretty precise now
they can go back and look at in terms of growth in a in a hair when you used and and that type of thing
so i guess if they perfect that is not quite as cumbersome as having to go fill a bottle or give blood or something like that
well i did too
so tell me about china cry
china cry was basically the the true story written by this this lady who had uh
and her her time frame was prior to the nineteen forty-nine revolution
although she herself had never really accepted jesus or gone through any of the other uh christian uh portions of of the faith repentance baptisms et cetera et cetera she had always felt a very strong uh leaning in this direction
and whenever the cultural revolution of nineteen forty-nine occurred and most churches were either banned or their all the clergy and so forth were killed or or imprisoned or and the property confiscated she was safe because she had you know not officially joined the the christian movement
and and he was rather well you know rather well to do in the old regime
and the the chin- the commu- the communist chinese didn't like this at all
you know the bourgeoisie was was was definitely out of uh style then
and so they kept picking at him picking at his at her mother and uh finally uh started picking on her
and getting her to you know
they were starting to uh accuse her of of of uh crimes and atrocities before the the revolution and and had her write her own story over and over and over
now i think i'm leaving out a portion
she gr- she went through college and graduated very high up in her class and had uh gotten a job as as an instructor
and they had her teaching or were starting to have her teach history for the soldiers
when the they decided that that she needed to start recanting of all of her pre uh
so they kept on and on at at her
and in the meantime she and her husband uh were ex- ex- were expecting a child their own child
and uh the the people kept harassing her over you know over a period of months
and finally they uh carried her uh out into the courtyard to to either really to shoot her or to go through the motions of of shooting her uh with by firing or you know executing her by firing squad
and uh the lord just said no
this is not going to happen even though this lady has not really you know
she's she's one of mine
and uh the the soldiers were blinded when they shot
and she her life was spared
and this this frightened the the uh the commandant
and so he called this kind of stuff off and just put her in the labor camp
well uh and course here's this this woman who is heavy with child dragging rocks around
well she she put in for going going to uh
and her husband had escaped to hong kong uh
and then she put in to go see him
and over time she uh uh
finally through her perseverance and writing enough letters to enough different people embarrassed enough of the the middle uh bureauc- bureaucracy that they finally let her go
and of course she had to walk
you know they they stripped her of everything practically besides the the clothes on her back
and uh so she so she went across the border to her husband and another and other child that they'd already had uh to freedom
and they knew that she wasn't going to come back
but yeah she did years later when the uh liberalization you know in real life liberalization of china happened
and uh she was not persecuted or anything else like that
huh interesting story
uh very moving too
i uh i don't even remember seeing that advertised
and it was probably here and gone fairly quickly
well it was within oh ninety days
oh that recent
i mean it's it was it was advertised over a period of about ninety days
oh i see what you mean
but it wasn't
uh they didn't have it in uh too awfully many movie houses
but it was it was in the
it had large uh uh uh
well uh i guess what i what i saw most recently and luckily i saw it only a week ago
uh my husband and i had this great desire to go see a comedy
and and uh we ended up going to see green card
and uh he chose it
and uh it's got this wonderful french actor who's
it was his like his
and he's been a star in france and a wonderful actor who we've enjoyed for years
but he's never made an american film
oh i see
this was his american film debut and he speaks very broken english
and basically he played uh a frenchman who married an american girl uh in a marriage of convenience so that he could get his green card which is what an alien needs to work in this country
and uh because she could claim she was married she could get uh an apartment or a condominium in a very exclusive building in new york that had a garden an an an outside garden which is very unusual there
so she was a horticulturist
and that was sort of her dream
oh i see
of course you know they got married
and they never saw each other again
except except fate through them together
and the immigration and national- naturalization service uh started investigating
so they had to get back together and get their stories straight
but there was no proof whatsoever
and uh it was
well they fell into like at any rate
and and when they went to the query or inquisition or whatever uh
and then he said something because his english was so poor on for the most part
he he was so proud of himself for giving ex- all the correct answers that that on the last one he said oh i never remember that answer
and that clued the investigator that he had memorized a series of answers
well did you go to college
and where did you go
uh it was sweeper college of about seven hundred and fifty students
i had gone to a small school growing up uh
and a lot of my friends went to univert- university of michigan
but my parents were retiring in south carolina when i graduated and uh were looking for a southern school and uh also u of m seemed overwhelming in size
and uh what about you
oh so you're from the midwest too
uh i live in texas now
well i'm in texas
oh uh my brother's in austin
uh he lives lakeway
he uh had moved uh
oh austin is so pretty
oh i love it
and your daughter is going to be a sophomore
but my oldest will be will be a sophomore
is uh because you live in austin is she thinking about the university of texas
and uh you know having gone to the university of minnesota i know what a big university is like
and uh one thing that i did this summer which i thought might benefit both my daughters is my youngest daughter got involved in band
and baylor has a band camp
so she went for a week
and it was overnight
and they lived in the dorms
and i thought this would expose both of them to what it's you know like on a coll- a smaller college campus
and uh my oldest one just wasn't impressed at all with the idea of a small school
so uh i i i still think the exposure was good
the reason i ask if you went to college is i thought well you know
or you know there's all of these areas to look at in making the decision
those and those were several uh that we did consider
uh my parents uh certainly didn't push but wanted me to look in the south
and because i had been in a small school they suggested that i probably i
and so they suggested that i might want a smaller school because i was used to a lot of one-on-one uh or small group situations
and i did pick it because at the time i was interested in majoring in biology
and i also wanted to spend one year studying in europe
oh how exciting
uh i had had an a f s student from germany live with us our senior year and we just thought that would be a wonderful thing
and i ended up majoring in french
and i'd always loved working with children
uh and i found that i couldn't fit everything in
but because i had had a fair amount of french going in i was able to do my year's study in france and able to take a lot of the other courses that interested me
uh and so that was some of
oh that was that worked out very well for you
but several of the things you mentioned were the things that uh our son has talked a lot about texas a and m
he but he thinks he wants to be a writer
and i don't think that
well then he should come to u t
uh and really his his graduating class will probably be in the neighborhood of eight hundred and fifty to a thousand
uh and so he's used to a bigger size and because my brother is there uh he would have family close by
so there there are advantages uh
but i also
because i had so many friends who did go from our small school to university of michigan which was so large
and they really felt uh like they were numbers
oh i went from a large high school to a u- large university
and i definitely felt like i was a number
uh i mean it is a different feeling
but that was that was my only option
i i mean i just really couldn't look at anything else
that was the one and only thing i could really afford other than a jun- you know a junior college which i didn't want to do
so that's how you know my decision was made
well th- that's certainly
uh especially today with the cost of college
i mean that is a a major uh consideration
and i do feel fortunate that texas has so many good schools
and even though baylor uh
and when you mentioned that we we have friends who have children there who just love it
and for a private school it is not as expensive as most are
and it is a smaller size
and uh i do feel like there are a lot of options
even this year jay had an aptitude test uh
what what does
but he's really strong in math and science too
and we keep encouraging him to keep an open mind
oh she she has uh you know interests that are just you know going in all directions
and i don't know
and she may end up doing something with that
and i am a single mom
so i've been
and i made the mistake of dropping out of college to get married
so i'm trying to have my children not make the same mistake
and i'm you know showing them if you're strong in math and science kiddos this is one area where women can make some decent money
i mean i'm kind of really putting the practical application you know and and saying yet do something that you enjoy
by all means go get that piece of paper you know
well it sounds like he's got some really you know good strong ideas of what he wants to do
well he but he has even
now that he's in high school uh
and of course there's there is still time
but he's beginning to feel that as much as he enjoys writing he wonders if he can make a living at it
you know it's the it's
well do you do a lot of dining out
um we do it more when we have company come
um what about you
well we do s- some dining out
um i i do a lot of cooking
so um mostly like when we go out you know it's my husband and i
i we don't go out too often as a family
but um but we do enjoy dining out
one of our favorite places here in in the dallas area is atlantic cafe
but i haven't been there
i i've been to cafe pacific
th- now that's down in uh highland park
oh i love it
the area my brother uh lived in dallas for a number of years
and we came up one time when my father was visiting
and we all ate there
and oh their seafood was wonderful
oh it is it's fabulous
now where is the atlantic cafe
atlantic cafe is down on i believe it's on mckinney
um and o- originally the two the the guy who owns the cafe pacific and th- the guy who owns the atlantic cafe were partners in the atlantic cafe
and then they they separated
and the guy started cafe pacific
and i loved them both
you know what we'd really like if if we just have a a casual evening is houston's
but i've heard that's really good too
you have you have to expect to wait at least an hour
so you have to go knowing you're going to be sitting there there for an hour waiting to get in
and a- as long as you know that
but they have i think one just about the best prime rib um anywhere
and my husband really likes their ribs
so it's hysterical
and we sit there for an hour waiting to get in
and then we get there
and we don't even look at the menu
i know right away what we what we want
well we really enjoy prime rib too
and uh actually the the steak and ale out here
uh we've gone to uh
my in-laws also enjoy prime rib when they've had some of their specials on sunday monday or tuesday night and uh the time we went the prime rib was really good
i've nev- i've i've been there for like you know lunch but i've never been there for dinner
and it was good
oh that's great
another nice place for for prime rib is baby doe's maxwell's nice
oh i've heard about that too but no
and one place i'd never been that i would really like to go to uh is lawry's
i'd i had heard that too um
i've i've never been there
but i've heard it's real good
have you been to the little uh not for prime rib but the cafe de france um right here on central expressway
actually they have one in richardson that i've been to
uh they have real nice lunches
have you have you been there for lunch
yes uh primarily lunch well and breakfast sometimes
but uh during the week they often have a a limited menu choice but uh very reasonable complete dinners for six ninety-nine that included the soup an- or salad entrees and accompaniments and dessert
and uh the
my husband and i like veal uh a lot
and their veal dishes have been good
i keep hearing the advertisements of it and and they keep saying you know oh it's wonderful it's wonderful
and i was thinking you know it's supposed to be a family place over near plano super bowl
and uh i've i've not been there
i haven't either uh
and i've only been there for lunch
but uh i went with a friend
and we met her husband um down on greenville
oh i we just we-
and we had the uh we both enjoy mushroom soup
and linda had told me they had the best mushroom soup
and they did
but uh and we just had soup and salad so we could make room for the dessert
but or s-
oh i've heard of it
where where it's made
it's like it's like a
it's all chocolate like made like a paper bag and it's filled with what whip cream and and strawberries and something
and it had strawberries kiwis and raspberries in a raspberry uh puree
and it was plenty because it was very rich
but uh i wished i'd had a camera
oh i bet it was
and we took another friend with us
and so we had they had uh like a berry assortment
it was it was raspberries and blueberries and and strawberries on a plate with like a custard on the bottom
and you know they did like the raspberry puree just kind of like in a in a decoration on the
it was really really relatively simple
but oh it was good
well that's uh one of the things th- that i do enjoy when you get a good restaurant
uh i love fresh berries
and their their fruits are always exceptional
i don't i'm know
they must have a special source for getting them because even at the farmer's market uh
and uh i was home a few years ago
and my sister and brother-in-law were going to take us out for dinner
and uh i was really amazed you know
the the restaurants up there were kind of quaint
you know they were real real pretty
but they lacked
and they lacked the at- the just the i don't know
the restaurants down here seem like they have uh
and i thought
because well because we don't go out very often
when we do go out um in a way it's like a little mini vacation i guess
and uh it is it's a whole experience
but the atmosphere and service i think are important uh too
because the ones that aren't so good don't just don't make it
but it is wonderful
and it's at plano road and campbell
is uh kind of fun
and i had more of that in my childhood days than i have now
and i grew up in an area that uh was just a few feet from a rather large lake and a few more miles from that was a even larger lake
and we had
and we had every kind of things from canoes to paddle boats sailboats speedboats
and we did a lot of watering
but i think uh
couple of guys uh restored an old wooden boat that was built back in the mid-thirties and got a new canvas sail for it and had a real h- big old four- foot center board that went down in the middle to keep you upright when the waves
or the wind came from the side
and we got that thing in the water and had a real good time with it
it wasn't like the newer ones that have nice chambers that keep it afloat or keep it uh upright again
and uh sailing was was kind of nice to learn the maneuvers you had to make to work your way down a lake or work back up against the the wind as it were tacking back and forth
and uh more than once we'd get out there on a really stormy day
and uh the storm or the wind was due to the front blowing
and as soon as the front came over it was calm so you're out in the middle of nowhere with a paddle
and you paddle your way back in and hope it doesn't start raining on you right away
and that didn't always work
but uh it's it's a nice nice hobby to have
so things change i guess
uh about the only memories that i have of boating uh
my husband's family had a a motor boat uh when we got engaged
and they took us out on the lake several times
and uh i really did enjoy that
i i don't know that i ever learned to drive it or anything
but uh we did some water skiing of course and and uh driving around the lake in the boat and and just the basic safety rules and things i found real interesting uh you know
they they just didn't patrol you like they did with the automobile or whatever
the the laws were there
and if you didn't obey them uh you know
but uh i found the motor boating was real fun
i remember learning how to ski oh
and the lake that we learned on was the smaller of the two that we had access to
and it was maybe fifteen twenty acres
and it was uh
and i got all ready to go
and i was down in the water and and set to go
and uh and just as that boat took off a turtle bit me in the middle of the back
but it bit enough to where i let go
and the boat went off without me
and i reached back there and s- pushed him away and got out of the water a a while
and and uh it didn't even leave a mark
and so i told everybody what happened
and they go oh yeah sure you know
and so i get back down in there
and and i'll be if he didn't do it again
this time a little earlier and and i had let go before then and before they took off this time and and swatted him away
so i moved over a a few feet in the water and got out of his little realm where he was living underneath the dock and uh managed to get up
but i got up
and it it was a nice uh nice long skiing career
but now i've gotten to where skiing is just kind of wears me out more than it does thrill me
i've i've uh done about all i dare do on skis you know skiing on one and jumping around here and there
and i i i know how you can get injured doing much more than that
and i just can't risk it right now being a head of the family and the breadwinner and all that
just uh can't take the risk i did as a dumb teenager i guess
so life just changes a little bit in that respect
i'd kind of like someday to maybe end up on a pair of skis that that doesn't have a uh well
i haven't cr- managed to get a hold on that uh craft yet
it it would be kind of nice
but just from what i've seen you just kind of work your way up to it and turn around real quick
but uh i don't know
maybe someday i'll
well my son
well we haven't traveled outside the united states that much
uh we usually take family type vacations
oh that's great
when when both of my kids were much younger
and this time we're going to be going with just one daughter
and she's nine
so it ought to just be a ball
oh that's a perfect age for disneyworld
oh that's great
so we've been there a number of times
and uh we're going next year
well we go on a lot of business trips
i i don't work
so you travel a lot
well we do
and in the position he's in they don't care if i go along
so it's great
and uh disneyworld is the one for a week next year and it will be at this time of the year
and this year we're leaving uh uh matter of fact we're leaving next saturday for new orleans
oh that will be fun too
have have you ever been there
and i know they've changed it a lot and upgraded everything
but we used to have a lot of fun there
well you know we went there once
and we were on our way home
and we were driving
and we said let's go to new orleans
so when he said well this year you know i have a week there on a a project
and then i said well i'll going along
but that can be fun
it well and that's probably
and they do have a mardi gras night planned
and i'm kind of anxious for that
but uh yours to disneyworld sounds
well and with a daughter nine it is just
uh so well if you're working then you're probably on a limited amount of time per year that you can go
well not really
and i just save vacation for things like that
and uh just travel whenever we can
well i really i think travel
when i heard my topic today i thought okay that's my fav- that's my favorite
and really at our point of life our children are grown
and uh it has just
and it depends where he's going
and it's uh
and i like to sight see
and i love to shop
so that's perfect
and then got to pick and choose the places
well and one of my very favorite
i would have to say we both end up going to las vegas uh probably once every maybe year and a half
and presently we have quite a few frequent flyer miles and so i've just requested that they send us two of our coach tickets
because we have a lot of flying with continental and they're recommending that you use those because they don't know the future of continental
and i said now that we have all the miles
so we are thinking that we might go to las vegas during the winter this year sometime for just kind of a quick trip
uh when we normally go that way we like to go to california at the same time because we really don't get out there as often as you could probably from texas
our last big trip we drove through new mexico and colorado and went to the grand canyon and and uh back through silverton and durango
and oh it was fun
and the kids were old enough to really enjoy it
and really for the children to learn as well for a family vacation that would be excellent
and it takes a while just to even get to the what i would call the more picturesque part of the country
and then we rented a car for two weeks
and we went through the northern route and through utah and as far west as las vegas
and then we returned through uh new mexico that you just mentioned
and it was oh it was just great
oh there's too much to see really
oh i i think that's that's
uh i work at t i
and we have uh of course started drug testing uh
and uh i haven't gotten called yet
but uh i feel that it's probably pre- it's pretty good if if they feel like there is a vast majority of the people at the company doing drugs
uh i think that they thought that there was a lot of drug usage here at t i
but i think our latest sat- statistic said something like ninety-nine point nine eight percent were uh testing negative on all the dru- on on all the testing
but yet that can be carried to an extreme too
so i think it's a good idea
and i think just the idea that you know that you may be tested might keep you off of them or get you off of them because you're
because i think they may put
and uh you know you go through the program
but you know i would i'm i'm in favor of of that type of thing
that uh you
and it it is possible that you know that they can't do as good a job uh as they might do
oh and of course they can also cause injury to other people
if they're if they're not uh you know fully functional mentally while they're doing their job they could cause you know serious injury to oth- another people
and you never know they could just go off the deep end on on a on something uh that
and and it would be uh you know out of the question
also i guess you can you know get the wrong kind of stuff and kill yourself just by having a wrong mix of or watered down or or whatever all kinds
they they talk a lot about drugs there
and i think it's good that they're trying to start some programs down in the elementary schools
but you know i think they can test all they want for drugs
and if they need to do that as a condition for employment
and i know many of them are doing it
i know my son has had to do it for both sam's and wal-mart and i don't know how many others are doing that
and and i think that's good because
it's just a problem that p- no one is sure just how to handle i think
you know i think personally i'm for it
there's several reason why i i could think of right now why we shouldn't have it such as drug testing
and oh yeah
and uh i didn't get a raise this year
because nobody in our company got a raise
but yet they spend all the money on drug testing
and if they weren't spending all the money on drug testing people could have got a raise
so see there you know there's different
i don't think that that's that i think that's more of a personal view of mine other than a a yes sir we should have drug testing because there's really a problem
and i know that
but then i have other views to it
i just i didn't think it was that expensive because my son was in probably a week and a half period and sam's and wal-mart are are owned by the same people he took one for for uh wal-mart for job hiring
and then sam's called him
because you know if it's a thousand dollars that's a thousand dollars they wasted
well maybe they run
i don't know you know
or maybe it's under a health type program that it it it would catch a lot of things
for all the the pub-
i i just can't imagine them screening all these employees paying a thousand dollars to get them
so have you done any painting projects lately
was not not a big deal two little deals
the first one um
and it was very easy
it was it
and i've never painted anyth-
so you know you'd have to hire someone if you needed to paint inside your house or something but i know i can do it
and the second one was i bought some toys at a um at a craft fair
and so i decided to paint them
and that wasn't as easy as painting the apartment
well it's uh it that's half the problem right there is that it wasn't it was a oil base
so i had to get
and when i painted them i didn't realize that we didn't have any turpentine or paint thinner or anything in the house
so i had it had it all over my hands
at first i didn't realize you know
so i didn't realize that i needed that
i mean i kind of knew in the back of my mind
so you can't use oil on wood
but i just had it all over my hands
and i went to wash the brushes out and uh wash my hands
and you can't wash it off with water
you have to get the uh a solution
i had to drive to the store with paper towels all over my hands to go buy some paint thinner and and everything like that
and then um downstairs in the apartment i just us- we just used a latex base
and so you can drip it on you know
oh is is that what you usually use in the house is latex
and and it it just like
it's just important to look for one that doesn't have lead in it you know
i guess a friend of mine had a uh well
she she just started up a day care center
and uh the one of the real strict uh restrictions was the fact that she had to have a special kind of paint that was fire proof and lead free and all that other good stuff so uh she had that done
well um so to speak i had to paint this uh the inside of this warehouse thing
that you keep some um farm equipment in and um what i had to do is just coat this bare wood with a sealer
and uh i had this big five gallon jug
and it was like paint thinner
i mean i you know it looked just like it was the viscosity of paint thinner but uh you just took a roller and put it on there
and uh if you saw that the wood was getting wet you know that was that was all you needed
so well i guess it worked out
i think though um we're lucky that we didn't have to do any detail work because i don't know if i could you know
well what about the trim in your house
it was j- it was really easy
i just like what
we had a couple of different size brushes you know real easy
and if it
and there was wall paper
like i was do just doing just the trim outs that around the doors and windows
and there was wall paper
it came right off so there was no major mistakes
did you have uh one coat or two
uh two actually um and it
there was um
you know around the windows if you got it on the glass we let it dry and scraped it after that
that would be really time uh a time saver
if you just you know
but it wasn't you know
i don't know it's it's funny
it's like if you just go slow you don't get or at least i didn't get that many mistakes i didn't make that many mistakes
oh me i would have had to have taped the whole thing and then brushed around the edges
and and then i'd have probably rolled it on
i'd it would have taken me forever
well the first time it'd probably would have taken me forever
but my friend said oh just go ahead you just go ahead
well how long did it take you all
well a couple of week ends
so there was two of you all
there was they were doing all sorts of repairs
and there was i was just painting because i don't know how to do anything else
so there's a whole bunch of people
so now i feel like if i ever buy a house i can probably paint if nothing else
i think i could probably do it uh as long as the hardware store told me what to buy then i could do it
but you know i went in to a hardware store to get paint for those toys
and the guy said oh get this it's a nice shiny gloss which was true
but i didn't realize what you know pain it is to clean the brushes and everything if you don't have latex
well how did you like that topic
uh i don't know
i think uh i think a company should be able to test at any any employee any time they see fit
i just i just don't think there's a place in our environment you know in the work force for drugs or alcohol either
well i don't believe in drugs or alcohol
but if you'll remember when the teachers had to take the t cat they were talking about drug testing us and we were laughing that we'd have to go to that examination to prove we could read and write with a specimen of urine and we found it belittling
uh-huh well i can sort of understand that uh
but not being a teacher as you are you know i i was not quite as sympathetic as you know as i probably would have been if if kay were a teacher or something
but then you know at the same token i'm not against
because i look at airline pilots bus drivers you know people that really have other peoples' lives in their hands truck drivers it's supposed to be a huge problem with truck drivers using drugs and alcohol
uh that's right and i think it is a big problem with them using drugs from what you read you know
you know in those areas i really you know do believe that maybe we should clean up our you know house
i i agree with it
uh i know kay's company you know
and so many of the people even the professional people were boy they were so against them doing that you know
and i thought jeez to me it's quite simple
uh you either need a job or you don't
the the job is what provides all of your needs
and uh if they say hey you can't do this work i'd say hey i agree i don't i won't do that
and i think most of them have agreed to that now although they didn't like it at first
i think it's just like anything else a new concept you know
that is belittling you know i'd probably feel the same way if i had to do that
but at the same token in education we can't do drug random drug testing on kids you know i mean their rights are protected
oh gosh they they would really raise a stink if that was to happen
what well but why if you're going to do teachers or professionals why not do the kids
when we see them and they're you know under the influence
i i i wouldn't be opposed to it at all
and the clicker comes in when it's time to
oh well we'd better keep talking because i've not heard it have we
well do we agree or unless it's not me
if you agree that uh
you know here we go again i mean yeah you know i believe that truck drivers and people that have
even though teachers have other kids lives in their hands and if they come in stoned or they come in drunk and there was an incident in my children's high school where a teacher stayed drunk
when i think of drug testing i'm thinking of the you know outside of education
uh well no
but uh you don't think of that first hand normally
you know we are as susceptible a society as anybody else and uh yeah
well did you hear on the news where the teacher of the year was up for child molestation
isn't that isn't that mind boggling
it it is it's mind bog- you know well you know
i know teachers are just like everybody else same problems the same uh good qualities as anybody else
then i think you know if if it came push came to shove i'd probably be drug tested you know
because it does you know
you you think the benefit would be greater than the
because you know as i say i'm sitting there fussing and fussing
and yet i know of you know one teacher who was an alcoholic in school as well as you know i presume out
and that was in your children's high school
and you know my children brought it to my attention
if it if it's if it was true there i'm sure it's true with just about probably to some degree every school there is you know because they represent a pretty good
and that's not giving a good example to students
i'm i'm a putterer
it's it's it's very
i was just in the shower after finishing mowing the lawn and you know mowing the lawn and removing some old petunias out of the garden
this type of thing is working right in to start planting fall fall bulbs
and so many of the summer flowers are still pretty enough that you hate to pull them up
but you know you need to pretty soon
well that's the way this was
the the petunias were really great
our mums are are beautiful
uh i don't know if we i don't think we've had a frost up here
i've been i was down in for a week
so i don't know what happened last week uh but uh it seems like it's i don't know if it's late
so i can get a lot of stuff down out here
uh i i enjoy it
we came here we just moved into this well we moved in in november and put all all the landscaping in this this year
we came from nine years in a condo uh
and working in that condo you didn't have to do anything you know unless you really wanted to
so now you have the chance to really create and and spread out
you know i can't
this is my third third house i think i've owned um
but uh it's interesting you know
and it sort of gets away from me if you're not with it
so but uh i i enjoy most of it
and about this time of year there is it starts getting a little old
and i start looking forward to you know having other things to do with my
well it is it is for me
because i've been doing a lot of fertilizing
we had a drought and uh took a lot of watering and a lot of fertilizing
and now it's really growing
and i'm trying to establish a good root root growth you know for the winter
um ours seems to have slowed down here
we're not having to mow every week religiously but we're still fighting bugs and ready to change some of the the summer flowers out i still have caladiums that are pretty which is a surprise this late in the year
but like today it's eighty-five degrees it's really strange
oh yeah yeah
but that'll change real quick
well he always
and then he calls us
oh my gosh
well texas has gotten to where it's a real problem as far as plants because our summers are so terribly hot and we have ice storms every year
and there just aren't that many plants and shrubs that can take both of those extremes
i was you know i was like conditioned to it they they have to be hardened to it
that's that's strange with me
you know you think dallas you know almost semitropical you wouldn't have that kind of that kind of problem
well for the most part we don't
but we have usually just a pocket of really bad hot and really bad cold
well the summers have gotten where they're a lot hotter but the the ice storms really are stressful on all the the plants that we have around
oh do they
we've noticed that crepe myrtles don't do as well as they used to and uh pittosporum
that used to be the kind of things we could plant all the time you you really take a chance with them freezing
i love the uh the landscaping
and i really enjoy getting around and seeing the different areas with different gardens
and texas is
d- dallas is very nice
and my wife and i
and when we get to other parts of the country where the trees are so beautiful we really miss it
that we have you know ohio's a very pretty state
we moved in seventy-six we moved to chicago
and i remember the first time i took my wife there on a house hunt
uh we were coming in
and before the plane landed she looked out the window
and she said she said there's no trees down there
and when we got out to the area where we decided we were going to live and buy a house there were no trees because the farmers had cleared all the land and now all of a sudden it was being developed
and the first thing i did was planted all kinds of trees
uh discussion or on child care
uh they're all grown up
oh well you know all about it then
i have grandchildren but uh haven't really been into selecting child care for
and it's been quite a few years since i've had to think about that
or do they stay at
oh that's nice
uh m- my daughter that has three stays home with her children
and one of my daughters has one
but an aunt keeps the baby
oh that's nice
but i would i would not really know how to go about selecting one nowadays
but i would imagine it's very hard
i i think so
i have worked in anoth- at some other ones that were not very good in my opinion
but this one that i'm in now is is very good
and one of the key things is how many adults are there in ratio to the children
and like in pennsylvania for babies that's what i work with there has to be a one to four ratio at the most
but we keep it down to like two to one
oh well that's good
i've always thought you know it would be really tough
oh i know
you know you'd have to be able to get them all out
what we do is we have these cribs in the back room where they sleep that are um low to the ground
and they're reenforced real strong
and they'll sit four babies
and they roll real well and maneuver
oh well that's that's a
but i was thinking oh my gosh if they had very many babies they couldn't possibly get them all out
but you could put them in one of these cribs and then roll the crib out i guess
oh well that's neat
well do most of your day-care workers really care about the children
or is it just a job for them
uh most everyone has a college degree in like early childhood education
and really there's only like eight children per room
and then there's like two or three mostly three care givers in each room
and that enables them to spend more time with the children
so it's nice to be able to play with them and really get to know them
how old a group how old are the children go with this center where you work
um in my room they go from eight weeks to nine months
and throughout the center it goes up to like age twelve
so i have the real real young ones
those are the probably the bestes- the best group to have
they're you know they're wonderful
and they're fun
and they're not quite big enough to be getting into everything yet
and you have to be real careful all the everything is baby proof
you know all the doors have latches and stuff so they can't get into anything
but they try
because w- i live in a college town in penn state university so i
there is a lot of
and uh in general though i've i've been really disappointed with a lot of other centers i've worked at and it all and all
it's not my choice for when when i have children
but but some people don't have a choice
i hear a lot of the girls i work with uh constantly oh
i wish i could find someplace i really felt good about you know
and it's really bad you know
and then they called her one afternoon and said well we thought we'd better call and tell you before you got over here
and we just now found her
oh my god
and so immediately she says well i can't have any confidence in them anymore
but one of the teachers happened to walk by and see her pounding on the window trying to get out of the bus
oh my god
and this was four hours later you know
and uh so you know i-
so she has switched to a different center now
well just to let you know i have uh two uh children of my own
i've got two boys uh one four year old and one two years old
so i'm just starting out
well i guess uh in one of the things that that i like to do with my boys when uh when i get home is i like to try and spend a lot of time with them
you know they're not very old
so they couldn't do a whole lot yet
but they like to uh spend time with me
we just oh just do various things nothing really
but you know the weather's trying to turn now
are are you down here in texas
i i'm i'm in uh dallas
you know what i meant with rain huh
what w- well
one of the things i've noticed is one of the trends i've i've noticed is that uh it's always too easy to just plop your kids down in front of the t v and let them watch movies or
and one of the things we try to do is we try to avoid doing that as much as possible
although it really is very easy to do that type of thing just plop them down in front of the t v and let them be uh entertained that way
and uh seeing as you've got some older children i i'm wondering how did you handle that
in fact i i think things were were quite a bit different
uh when my my big kids were were little uh you know ev- ev- all the mothers were home
you know the the kids got up in the morning and ate breakfast and poked around
and then when they felt like it they went out to play you know when they were were little like that
and other than that i mean there was basically there was not educational t v
or uh you know you got some cartoons
and that was it
but they they were never that interested in it anyway
they'd rather i mean they'd take their trucks out in the backyard
we did a lot of stuff like that with uh
and course when they got bigger uh they were both quite into sports
and and you know so whatever you know they would do we'd go along with and uh
so they're very very different
but uh y-
kind of the same thing our you know
is uh you know going to you know
like last night was a band concert and she plays on her school volleyball team and uh stuff like that
but uh we we still uh oh like to pack up you know just go someplace for the day or uh you know just stuff like that
oh that's nice
one of our older kids now is going to graduate school down at college station so that's uh
we go down there fairly often you know for a weekend for you know family get-togethers and stuff like that
i know we'd i'd like to get into do more camping and outings and things
and i think we probably will soon as the boys get a little bit older
but uh you know for right now they don't you know
because they like just being outside
i i think our kids just always dearly loved that you know play bounce the ball or just uh
course when our big ones were little we lived up north you know
and this time of the year it it the fun thing was to go out and swoosh around in the leaves
and and uh you know we also come winter time we'd stick them on sleds
and uh we had a pond across the street
and and from little on you know
it's it's so different down here where y- you go take lessons to learn to ice skate or something
you know when our kids were little you you got them a pair of skates
well i'm in a i'm in an urban area
and we're finding that crime is going up very quickly and has become a major problem uh even a more major problem
uh in dallas some of the major problems uh
drugs seems to be re- related to quite a bit of the crime we have now
there is a lot of theft a lot of assault dealing with uh people trying to get money for drugs
and uh i think that's a national problem though
it it it's pretty bad here too
well now we're pretty close to the golden triangle aren't you
and uh i'm sure you have a lot of students there uh and a lot of researchers
so you you may have a you know perhaps a little better economic climate
but in all your cities now it seems like th- there is a a crowd that's really effected by this bill
it's it's really it's
and i've seen in more in durham than i have in raleigh or or or chapel hill
chapel hill is kind of a a ritzy city or whatever
i mean it's kind of
i'm i'm sure there is problems with it
but it has a pretty low crime rate compare compared to to durham has probably got the worst
they've had like forty-eight murders since the beginning of the year
and over half of it has been drug related
um well here uh i'm not sure how many dallas has had
i i don't know
a a number every week
uh dallas is having quite a few
seems like most of ours are occurring in late at night or or like i say drug related
uh i guess the other thing was that are causing a lot of the crime now is the decrease in values
seems like a a lot of people don't hold human life quite as high as perhaps they used to
and the and the economy is so bad
and and so many people have been laid off and stuff
we had a lot of bank robberies and different lot of break ins and stuff
i live in a in a town house which is you know
and this lady was going to work
and nobody thought any different
boy that really that really takes someone who is bold to do that
it's it's it's pretty bad
well now do you find that security is very good in in a in a town home
uh i would say so for the majority in in our in my little section of the neighborhood because there is always somebody at home and we all know one another
and and on our one little section of the street we all know one another and know that we're not moving
i i'm i'm probably the one of the youngest people that live over here
most people are are retired
or or or you know they're they're in their forties or or whatever
so and i'm in my twenties
so i i'm i'm out more than they are
but they're at home at night
so i really don't worry about anything
well i think you hit on one point there is you know each other
i'm i'm in a neighborhood where we try to keep up with everything
uh i am oh about three blocks off a major road and uh a couple of blocks off another road that kind of runs
i guess you would say the neighborhood road it runs between the high school and the the commercial districts
and uh i'm over the northeast part of dallas
it's a in a nice neighborhood
the houses here uh before the recession were running two hundred thousand or so
and course everything's down ten to twenty percent now
see that's the same thing here
but we have uh
one one thing that effects us is we have apartments that are probably about a half mile away
and now the economy is bad
so they've dropped the uh
and course that's kind of like a cancer in an apartment complex
and then before you know it you have drugs and a lot of other things
so uh i'm sure that aggravates it also
but unemployment now in dallas or in texas is up around six point
well lots right
what what do you do now
well we have saved our newspapers for years and years because the uh boy scouts our boys have been involved in have uh had a huge recycling bin
but since the price of paper has gone down
like it's about a fifth of what it used to be so the boy scout troop quit doing it when the city took it over
so now we just put ours out for the city of plano
and i'm so glad when they brought out those recycling bins
although just just about a week ago some of my volunteer mothers that uh work in the library for me said they hadn't gotten theirs
oh that's why i asked you
i guess it
you know it does go in cycles
and not everyone got theirs right away
and i i was so relieved because i've been making a real concerted effort make you know recycling the aluminum and the newspapers and even got into plastic because wal-mart collected it
and uh my garage was just getting overwhelmed
and of course i didn't go weekly
so it became quite a big thing
i do news mostly newspapers and uh plastic two liter diet coke bottles
but i don't use as many of those
i guess the ones that are hard to convince yourself to do are the ones that you have to really that are really dirty that you have to wash out
well i found out after washing out many a peanut butter jar that they're not a recycling number one or two
so it was wasting a lot of time
well i guess there are some places uh in the north in particular that uh have a real definite way of encouraging you to recycle
because they charge you let's see they charge you for your garbage pick up by the weight
so if you recycle things of course then you don't have all that weight in there
i do find that i don't have as much to throw away because all the bulky things are are being tossed in with the recycling
and uh i don't know what they could do more of exactly around here right now other than uh
oh one thing i thought about the other day were batteries
supposedly you know leak and and contaminate the landfills
and yet what am i going to do when i have a couple double a batteries to toss out
and they don't take
well there are places that take car batteries
but i wonder if they would take
i mean not that it would
kind of a pain to you know drive over somewhere special just for that for two little tiny batteries
but i think the city one could possibly look into that or something
uh if they've got these bins for all the other little items
i'm sure if p- people will have batteries uh you know quite often to to toss out
uh when i was home those few days around thanksgiving and the uh the truck came by well we all ran out to watch it because you know we'd never
oh is that right
and one thing i thought was interesting was that the driver had something on his belt that he uh scanned across the little bar code on our bin as soon as he took the stuff
and he just pulled this thing kind of out of his pocket and just you know scanned it
so i don't know why what that was reading it for but uh they must be trying to keep track of you know who is doing it or what i guess
ooh for those who are really cooperating
now that would encourage it
well except i know it would just not be cost effective
they've already got all this money out on hiring uh getting the trucks and hiring people to work them
but the garbage uh
now there is just one garbage man that comes on the truck instead of two
so that's interesting
uh also slightly off the subject but our our big green garbage thing got stolen
oh it did
and we c-
and they did not charge us
and they said that between three and four hundred have been stolen
oh my goodness
oh and they must be
or our taxes do
yeah really expensive
i mean of course we were hoping we weren't we weren't going to have to pay for it you know but i mean what would somebody do with them
now since i got somebody from arlington virginia one day
well i never thought about that
but there is an arlington
like i had a call the other day from birmingham michigan you know
and i was thinking yeah and i was thinking
it's funny how many names have been used uh all over the country
well tell me what kind of books have you read
well to tell you the truth i've been going to college for the last four years
but i i really tend to like biographies a lot not necessarily always heavy ones but you know sometimes biogr-
because you know that's it's really and truly a true thing
you know i read one about bob hope that i liked
if it's not a heavy biography you know i enjoy it
i when i was younger i read about every king and queen that lived
i was trying to think uh
i read a uh a novel that used the names of like princess di and prince phillip coming over here to be entertained and all
and there was a murder
oh it sounds like fun
it was a lot of fun because they used these real names you know
wonder if it was by one of those famous writers you know
and i thought well this will be great
and it was
i've heard that she's done real- you know her books are really interesting
and they always sell well
well when you use real people like that i think royalty especially you know
i know uh the bri- some of the british people laugh at us because we're so enthralled with their
but you know that's like them being enthralled with our football and so forth you know
because it's totally different concept to us
i haven't i haven't had a chance to read a lot lately either
i have read uh mostly novels
i went to visit my daughter in florida and i took a novel with me uh and read it at thanksgiving time
oh i always like those
and uh it was uh one of those generation novels you know starts out when they're small and continues through generations and i like that
oh she is wonderful
oh once you st-
i i just live to read
i'll i'll skip everything just to get back to the book
i stayed up one night i think until two in the morning finishing one of hers because i star- i could not put it down
does she how often does she come out with them
it seems like she doesn't write as often as oh well like danielle steele and those silly things
well she can she can turn them out overnight i swear
and and they're the same silly things
i mean if you've read one i mean it's it it's practically the same thing over and over you know
and think how rich she is
wouldn't i you know
and wouldn't i like to have her money because they go from hardback to paperback
and she has millions of them
you know mini series and so forth
and it seems to me like susan howatch does not write as often
well hers are so involved
and they're so such a higher intellectual level because she quotes a lot you know
so she couldn't possibly turn them out like some of these popular writers
but oh her books are just incredible
and i've often wondered why haven't you
you know i
yes well no uh
but there's just
maybe they're just too involved for the average person to go and sit through them you know
they're so big they're such you know
and maybe that turns people off
but look at gone with the wind you know
oh i know
uh have you uh gotten into scarlett yet
in the beginning when it was on you know on route coming out i heard mixed publicity kind of good and bad
and then when it came out all i heard was just oh how bad it was that i didn't even want to get it
well it wouldn't surprise me
now tell me your favorite team
i i don't follow baseball that that closely
but uh you know since i live here so close to arlington uh that's the team that i've been kind of following
so we'll have to talk about the future with the rangers
well i think that uh you know with uh so much controversy over ruben sierra not signing and asking us for so much money it's um you know i think
do you know anything about ruben sierra's uh
well i heard tonight on the news that he is willing to come down
he was willing to come down a little bit and
uh if the rangers will go up a little bit
and the rangers go up a little bit
but a little bit from three you know from thirty million dollars or thirty-five mil-
and i think this is absolutely ridiculous
and i really think i really think that uh that they ought to
i think they should uh uh pay him what his salary is going to be uh and let him
because he's got one more year before he turns into a free agent
and then uh who knows
but if he doesn't then his market value will go down
and they can pick him up for for a lot less than than they would uh if they paid him the si- you know the six million dollars a year this year
bu- buechele was back just to visit
but you know what he
oh i'm sure it was
and and uh he just signed on uh
i think it was like a five year deal with uh pittsburgh
so you know he's real happy there
as far as the rangers are concerned i think i think they need some definitely need some pitching
uh and so i you know i
well what do you think of howse who is the coach for the pitchers
well you know i was just looking at the news tonight
and they showed a a a black guy that was go- was helping out uh
and i think that's a a great addition
i mean he seemed to know what he was doing
and and uh
oh you don't like howse huh
and i'm not going to stand up you know on my
and i'm not fond of grieves
oh tom grieve
i'm i'm not sure that um that they're ready to get rid of of uh tom grieve yet
but howse might be a different uh situation
and i think you're probably right that they that they need some you know some changes in uh pitching coach maybe
well i'm just gullible enough that i think bobby valentine is um uh doing all right
and i'm sure
you do huh
but i would like so much for these rangers to get their act together and give um
you know it's too bad that uh it has to be a forty-two year old guy to to lead the uh the rangers you know
they need to have some some young guys that can take the lead
well i just
but i think with their new stadium they should go and let
well if you're from iowa you must be very artsy crafty
and before then i was from utah
i didn't know anyone ever moved from california to kan- iowa
well i grew up in california
and then i went to school in utah
and i got married there
and we stayed there for a while
and then now we're in u- iowa
i really like i like the midwest
but i married a texan
and they have a way of dragging you back home
do you um do you have any hobbies that that you do things with your hands um
well i crochet
and i do water color
and i um sew
and i do fabric painting
oh you do a lot then
um i've done some cross stitching
um actually i i'm pretty untalented
i used to do a lot of knitting and crocheting um
but i i don't know
but i have all these friends that wherever you go they they sit down and the next thing you know they pull out of their uh
bags some their most recent uh needle craft and in december everyone was doing stockings you know these gorgeous detailed minute tiny stitch stockings
well those take a lot of time
i only can do things that are pretty fast because we just um got our baby last year
and i just don't have the patience to just you know do something
um i crocheted an afghan for our bed
and and i did a quilt
let's see i've done a quilt for our baby
and i've done a quilt for our bed
but i mean
or how did you make a quilt
um our baby's quilt it was a pre like the design
but you actually hand quilted it yourself
did did you need a loom
or were you a-
um i put it on the frame the quilting frame
have you are you familiar with that
but um my again my mother back in indiana
and she would she would quilt whole quilts by herself
oh my god
i have one of them um
but uh you know to have the quilting frame and then to actually do that it's a tremendous amount of work
well i haven't done tons of them
but um i used to do more before um before i had before we got our baby
oh you think children
you can um use crafts to make wonderful things for children
i think afghans and and the crocheted little sweaters and are are wonderful
and and they'll wear them
and i usually sew sew around the flower whatever first
and then i paint around it
so you can't see the stitching as much
does does that make sense to you
it's uh funny that you said
and they were matching
and they were lovely
but when i washed them although i took the precaution of turning them inside out i really didn't do anything else
and truly everything fell off or most of it
so i had i went and bought just some cloth glue and glued it all back
and i bought the paint and redid most of the edges and and it was salvageable
so i'm familiar with that
but i think you're very clever to um sew around the edges
someone told me that that it that they had done it both ways
and i've always after hearing that i always sewed it on even even with the uh a loose zigzag even helps
so how do you just figure
well you know it depends upon our weather here you know
it was like uh uh summer day
so so i dressed in uh uh a light weight skirt
it's a uh ultra suede skirt and a blouse with a sweater cardigan over it
and so i had to dress up anyway
and then i wore heels you know
but when it rains a lot which is has been doing here a lot lately uh very often you know wear uh pants and boots you know
so how do you dress
um when i was a teacher um in utah i would generally wear um dresses and heels and things like that
and even when it um rained and snowed i just braved it
and i wore heels anyway
i i can see
i i've been a teacher so has my daughter
and i know that we very often wore heels despite the fact that
but you're going to look nice for the kids
and it always makes you feel like you're a bigger person than the kids right
oh oh yeah
well i need all the height i can get
we too um
but then i would change um into heels
of course we wear uh an unlined boots you know
and we wear them you know
and as i said they have a regular heel on them high heel
and they wear them we wear them a lot with shirts and things
uh it's kind of a
but they're just a real pretty boot
but they keep your feet nice and toasty from the rain
as i have a private high school that i run here and so when i'm interviewing a parent of course i feel like i need to wear heels you know and look like i'm a business
you know because the children will tease about where's your motorcycle
if you wear boots too often you know
huh well um
so i did
oh my goodness
so then you had to
and then the third year we um got heating
so it was nice
but of course here we wear a light weight jacket a lot you know you know
oh that's nice
and uh that's very seldom
we it depends upon our winter
we have a few days you might wear a coat winter coat you know
but most of the time you can wear a sweater
and we just don't wear coats much
we we moved to iowa
and um i'm working at a day care right now
and so the way i dress is really different because i'm working in the nursery room with kids from six months to like twenty months
oh so you don't wear heels anymore i'll bet
i wear uh tennis shoes
and jeans and things that you know are sort of um
when you were teaching did you ever have uh uh a blue jean day or anything like that
but i never wore jeans because um i thought that was too casual
i know that some of the schools they have uh country western day or something like that one you know or tacky day
and i always thought it was kind of out of got out of hand when the teachers looked real
but i didn't think teachers should you know
do you like uh uh iowa
but i've seen a lot of things i'm not used to yet um
um we lived in utah before
and and i grew up in california
oh well that's quite a change from california to utah
well uh what is your favorite kind of music
well i have to say my favorite type of music would probably be uh classical music
oh same here
or what era
oh well i guess i like a wide range uh everything from uh from baroque through at least some modern music
and my wife and i these days are especially into opera
um do you go to the operas that they sing english or go to the ones that they sing other languages
well we uh generally
i i haven't gotten into that too much because i uh if i don't know the story line and um i don't speak the language then i have difficult time comprehending what's going on
well one thing that's helped us a lot is that uh you you know you can buy a lot of these operas now on video casse- uh video tape
and so we have quite a collection of those
and you watch them at home
and they have subtitles
so you you figure out what's going on after a while
and then you can enjoy it in the uh theater
but you know the uh dallas opera now has uh super titles on on all their performances i think
well they they give an uh an english translation on a on a screen up above the stage
oh i didn't know that
so i'd say
vivaldi is probably my favorite uh composer
well i really like vivaldi
uh he's uh definitely one of the one of the top of that era
i like full body music uh with the um um with brass and winds woodwinds instruments you know
course i like uh also string instruments
and i have two string instruments in my house uh instrument players
and the other one plays the viola
so i get to go to at least four or five concerts a year
how how old are they
so they're doing this in school or what
well you've got half a string quartet there
so uh um i try to enjoy all of it
well since you seem to like uh italian music have you ever uh gotten into gabrielli or anybody there in that era the uh period right before actually before vivaldi i guess
um a little bit
but um a lot of the um music i don't know about uh as far as the titles
and i have to listen to it and and figure out
um i do belong to a musical heritage society
but i think i know what it is
isn't that a uh uh see
uh they know have them on compact disc or or uh or cassettes or l p
and uh they do their they do a lot of original recordings themselves
i think uh
but they also uh they also uh go to the different composers or the different i guess
they go to conductors uh
and and they actually have them perform the music
and they record it
so they're actually commissioned performances
or they will kno- find out when they're performing
and they will uh record the music at that time
and so uh it is uh uh high quality grade music
and of course now they're getting they also have a jazz section
and they also have a uh more contemporary and american uh composer section
well i had go- heard good things about the uh music heritage society
but if i get involved in one of those things i end up spending all my money on on music
well you can control it
i almost uh almost uh bankrupted myself out of college as a freshman when i got into the columbia record club many years ago
and i got a lot of bills
so we have to watch that
well that's good
uh do you play any instrument yourself
i i play guitar and and early years played saxophone
huh well um you know i guess it's pretty deep feelings uh
i just uh went back and rented uh the movie what is it good morning viet nam and uh
got that uh uh some insight there to to kind of help me put together the feelings
i really appreciated the the whole uh english class where the uh the uh fellow just wouldn't do it you know
the guy's gouging gouging your eyes out
you know what for him to finish me off
and uh it it was uh good to remember the uh that that kind of asian philosophy that uh
well were you ever in viet nam
i was kind of an in-between uh finally drew a high draft number
um i was much too young
um you know both my well both my brothers were um draft age
but neither of them wound up going over which i think they were very happy for
well i personally uh you know uh i just went in limbo
i had a passport and was ready to go or um out of the country or join special forces either one
i mean i just didn't know
well um so well do you do you feel that it was worth what we did over there
now well mark um what was that again
um do you think i mean do you think our invest- the investment in lives and money was worth it
not not really
i totally agree with that um
what what effects do you think it's had on our country
downside um uh well
the says we should uh go into the grief that that's there
and you know presidents have always avoided that as a country
so it's pretty serious really you know
i think you know that's pretty typical that of the entire entire involvement over that you know that nothing was really addressed
it was- it wasn't you know it was never
we we announced that we were going to war
it was such a gradual and subtle you know thi- um you know increasement of of force that
gulf of tonkin uh resolution
and was it a dolphin or a torpedo
i vaguely remember we um we had a we had a um spy ship torpedoed or something
only only it was foggy
and finally president johnson said well they're weren't really sure whether it was a dolphin or a torpedo
so um do do do you think that like uh um for example like in in this past war in the persian gulf war that uh that you see it seemed to me that that bush was going going to extraordinary lengths to um you know prepare the country for war
hey mark i've got to go um
uh i wasn't really keeping count
but i guess
so uh mike what are your opinions on uh trial by jury
well i work for an insurance company
so i see a lot of uh verdicts that are
and i know in england the judges set all of the awards
you know juries will decide the guilt or innocence
but then they leave the awards up to more learned people
and i think maybe that avoids some of these totally ridiculous you know like millions and millions of dollars
that that seems to make sense
but leave it up to the more experienced person who knows how it fits into the uh kind of the rate for different
but then really doesn't pen- wind up penalizing the person that they went after
you know they're not going to sit there and lose money
th- they ha-
so it all comes filtering down to us all in- individually
and uh granted some people need to be compensated if they have really been wronged
how do you feel about setting like well for example a car type accident where uh or some incident where someone loses a limb
you know some of the health insurance is written that way you know that uh if you buy an accident and death or dismemberment policy you know it s- pre specified in the policy so much
but i don't know that you can necessarily put a
i think maybe you look at uh the age of the person and their station in life and and uh how much longer they have of work years that they would have to put up you know with with that
i mean maybe you don't award an eighty-five year old guy the same thing that you would award a twenty-one year old
i i think it has to be some kind of common sense applied there
and there may be where the judiciary is a little more learned about that type of thing because they can be schooled in that kind of thing
you know to get into the economics of things uh
because if they wheel somebody into a courtroom and the jury's heart goes out to that person and they do one of these mega awards
it really you know ultimately is not penalizing the person that they're trying for get away
oh out of thei- r-
i think those should have to be paid by the corporation itself that that did the damage
as opposed to the corporat- insurance paying the bills
for for honest mistakes where they've done something and and something happens
sure that's what they buy insurance for
do they get they get insured they get insured from other insurance companies
or how does that work
well i was just talking about any company
uh somebody is on the premises
and one of the employees actually is driving by with a forklift
and he pushes the wrong button
and he drops a load of lumber on somebody
and it injures
but in some instances you're going to put companies out of business by taking that stance if they have to take it out of their own retained earnings
well i'm not talking about any loss
and then they are awarding a second amount as punishment to the company which is a l- usually a lot less
but it's an an amount their designed to sting them a little for their
for oh th-
and unfortunately the ch- the
so again it never really penalizes
and if if they know some practice is wrong you know
i'm talking more about the you know the thing that they know
and they continue to do it even after they become aware of that
the uh subject is child care and how to determine child care
and that's uh an interesting one for me to talk about since i have no children
but i did run a child care facility for a while
and uh have some
well you should you should have some opinions on that then
uh it's uh an interesting experience to be a surrogate parent for or parent for a lot of people there
and uh it's also very interesting in terms of how people choose the child care facilities
well i guess if i were going to choose i mean my first consideration would be safety
and uh i guess my third consideration would be uh
uh in texas we have to meet certain state standards in order to operate on a at an institutional level and at a like a small home level
but then after that there's there's a lot more
i think it's important as the safety and health and that kind of stuff is qualification of people who work there and in hiring people who would work at the uh day care the child care facility was very difficult to find qualified people uh in terms of not just just
because somebody has a child or uh likes children doesn't really mean that they're qualified to give the child the kind of supervision and training that that uh
as a matter of fact i believe that the safety and and health uh issues uh depend in a very direct way on the people who are working with the children
and that was the most difficult thing of all to find the the right people the qualified people
and it's the most difficult of all for a parent judge uh because a person can be very nice and warm and loving
but if he's a space cadet and doesn't watch the children and be aware of what the safety hazards are
and the other thing that's difficult in uh it's a too small setting like a day care center is to find the right program of enrichment for the child because you don't want to just warehouse the child
and i didn't want to run an institution where that was the case where all we were doing were warehousing because the first four five years or so important
and you have to have the right kind of enrichment
and that that includes uh an atmosphere in which the child is safe and and he's watched and his physical needs are cared for
but also his uh developmental needs are cared for too
maybe the right thing to do is to uh
in other words they probably would not work may not en- may end up not working at all d- in the twenties uh
well that's an interesting thought because
but then they have to work from age thirty or or forty to age seventy or eighty or ninety
that would that would help on the other end too in in terms of not warehousing people and letting people be productive for as long as they can be
well you know the uh uh the world is changing f- uh from instit- from uh industrial uh base to uh information base
and so what that means is you don't have to be physically powerful to work
and i believe that uh mental acuity is easy to sustain maintain if you just simply continue to exercise your mind
if they didn't have to do a lot of physical uh labor they could main- maintain uh
uh i don't think they should abolish it
i think i think if they put it into force more often they wouldn't have as many problems as they've got
but not for petty theft
for major things like premeditated murder mass murders uh you know that type of thing
or should it be used uh
a- to prevent further uh crime
by you know some technicality
and they go down the line ten years
and then on some little technicality they get out and on the streets again doing the same they did before
and you know that's about the only thing
like for petty for theft and and stuff like that or manslaughter you know
well you know there's this old uh jewish is it saying about an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
oh well i guess
if i if it was someone in my family i'd probably feel that way
you know i've never had anybody in my immediate family uh murdered
and so i really wouldn't know
but but i feel like if i did i probably would feel that way
well one of the things i was thinking about
so if you have someone that that destroys that value uh then what you want to take steps to uh minimize the loss
so if you terminate him that's a loss of value
well that's true
so you know if you weight everyone equally then you have to say well the likelihood of not terminating him
in other words you'd have to you'd have to murder more than one other person uh in order to justify taking his life
but one way of doing it is uh by income
which is often times the case then then he's obviously not worth very much
and so uh the likelihood that you know maybe expected expected murders by him is is uh integrated over the income of the people uh that he murders is maybe you know a loss of
uh but if he only uh integrated you know integrated income over the expected remainder of his life of is uh
of course one of the things that happens if you use that algorithm is you find that it's more easy it's easier to uh to uh terminate older people than younger people since the integration of their income over the rest of their lives is going to be less
which means well
i suppose you could say well that has something to do with potential
i mean that's that's the key right there potential
now are they are they rehabilitative or or not
now that's all fine and well and and uh good philosophical
but if you're involved yourself personally uh i know i have a friend whose uh son was murdered uh on the night before his sixteenth birthday
and let me tell you uh i i knew them personally uh not intimately but quite well
the father you know
and he is on trial for capital murder
so it hasn't been a long time ago
uh well actually he has i i'm sorry he was convicted uh
and of course now you know and you go through two or three hundred years of appeals process
that appeals process i mean it's what you know really you know just drags out and out and out
my brother-in-law here in texas his by marriage my sister's uh husband his sister was murdered down here by a guy in in well actually in houston
and uh he
uh well you know uh i think public service is a worthy thing
and as a matter of fact there are a lot of programs uh such as peace corps that promote that
probably the most popular one but uh one that is not typically recognized as such is the boy scouts
uh i know that f- because my son is a a scout now and uh is thinking about his eagle
and uh in order to get eagle you have to have merit badges in uh citizenship in the community citizenship in the nation citizenship in the world
and you have to do a public service project
uh in which leadership is the key element
and of course pe- the peace corps the boy scouts is a o- is a voluntary activity
i i think that might be talking referring to uh something kind of uh alternative to the draft you know
either you have uh military service or some sort of alternative nonmilitary service for a few years
of course uh uh military service falls under the category uh of a public service
and so uh one of the things that would fulfill the at least the nominal uh qualifications set forth in the charge is military service or draft
but i agree with you that probably is not what was comprehended
there are other things such as civil service uh which many people uh are lifelong employees of but i suspect that was not what they had in mind either
for for years there has been an idea batted around of having some sort of alternative uh public service for uh young people to go into uh after high school
uh kind of in lieu of the draft for for people who don't uh who you know are conscientious objectors or don't otherwise want e- e- to be in the military you know
well you can go into the military
or you can do this other thing for one or two years to kind of serve the community and and learn about things
and i- it's interesting because i i'm not a particular fan of the military
but i have seen a lot of people a lot of young guys go in that don't have really a clue as to what they want to do with their lives and aren't terribly disciplined you know even just personal discipline about what they want to do
and they come out
and they they at least have now they have at least some marginally marketable skills and more discipline
and they have uh you know in in some cases they have a greater self-esteem because they can say they can see that you know if i do something or sub- submit my own will to the will of the sargent or whatever at least for a short period of time i can accomplish a lot
and it it's a good lesson for a lot of young men to learn that they don't need to be you know cowboys
they don't need to be out there and uh you know constantly flaunting their ego to get things accomplished
and you know for some for some young men that's good
for me it would have been lousy i- idea uh because i i did have th- the personal discipline
and i went to college for four years and got out you know
so but uh you know for some people that's good
i i don't particular like the fact that it's the military you know
and the whole point of the military is to kill people essentially as as an instrument of u s policy
and and you know and that that's another debate
but uh it's uh
well it depends on whether you whether we figure that we have that we have a defense oriented military or an aggressive aggression oriented military
and well it's it it seems pretty aggre- aggressive oriented
i mean you you look at the last mis- military action which was in the persian gulf and wasn't anywhere near the united states
and it was uh you know it was definitely a projection of u s power on the other side of the globe
so at at any rate this is getting off the topic
my my point was that there is for people who don't want to do the military service there it would be neat if there were an alternative that could instill the same sort of personal discipline and sense of purpose and uh sense of community that the boy scouts
and i have really resisted the impulse to
uh up until i guess maybe about a year and a half ago
i got one for my son a a macintosh uh l c
it's a real easy to use color uh computer
and i got a very nice printer that goes along with it
and he uses it for his school work
well i've i'm currently in school
so i i've had an i b m clone i guess for a couple of years now which i've been trying continually upgrading i guess
and uh i've found i've found that i pretty much become addicted to it
and i can't really
i've found that most of homework assignments really require some sort of computer uh simulation or analysis
so it it's pr- very essential for me
uh but lot of times so difficult to get on them at school
it's very easy it's much more convenient to have one at home
so that explains wha- all the uh computer assignments
well do you use your p c for things other than explicit computer work
and uh uh
so i can like check up on the weather around the country or whatever which is a hobby
so it provides other means other than just strict uh you know computations and so on
so have you do you have a computer for yourself at home
and i really sort of have the feeling that word processing is a big market for home computing
at wo- at work uh
and i in the past have done a great deal of of uh system development just through uh software development programming
uh but now i find myself using the computer
even the computer at work is primarily a uh word processing system and a communication system
emil is probably pulls down a third a- of all my time
i i uh i have modem night computer
so i can log into the sys- the uh network at georgia tech and access my account through there which is which can be useful
but uh yeah
that's that and word processing is
i mean obviously i do most of my almost all of my report
so it's it's really become i don't know really become my mainstay i guess
actually i don't think i've ever used a typewriter in in my life to do a a to do a report because my family when i was growing up we got a basic computer t r s eighty when they first came out
and i even used that to do my first reports when i was in junior high
huh well i'm a old-timer
i did my master's thesis on uh a typewriter
uh i rented an i b m selectric
and it was a pretty big deal
i i did my master's thesis uh last year
and i did that on a computer
and it seems like
it must have been just so much so much work
it uh well you know it's just it was just a completely different world then
so uh so yo- you used your son's macintosh then
do you do you find it do you like that kind of computer
i i see the packages on it uh that are available
and it's nice
uh i when i come home from work i i like to stay far away from computers and electronic things
uh so i let my son do it
uh of course you know there's uh there's an intellectual evolution taking place where
but it's really true
and the kids they just take to it like candy
well i- if if if the interface is there so that it's like fun to use and the challenge
regarding uh taxes i you know
taxes are really a necessary evil and in a civilized society
but really people get upset at taxes because you it's more efficient to do things yourself
and uh and so as as a result uh you know it's it's a trade-off you know for the common good you know for for the benefit of others you know
how much of your resource should you dedicate to uh making things work for others
have you uh you know ever thought you know just how much of that money should should go to other people that really don't deserve it
i know it's it's a lot you know
but they're giving it to other people that don't really need it ei- either
but yet they accept it
well the thing of it is
if i wanted to just uh you know permanently become a book reader i guess i could just uh you know uh go on public assistance uh you know lo- lo- look for uh look for people to uh take care of me
and uh probably a good woman
and then you don't have to be on the tax roll
but uh but taxes are are very difficult kind of thing
and everybody really hates it
i i i always over pay my my deductions
so i wind up with my
getting money back on my uh from my uh withholding
so uh you know that that's always a smile
but of course you know i've i've paid it in
and i should calculate it better
i i i work for the f b i
so i i'm a federal employee
guess i don't sound like it huh
i think that people that work for the government are just as against taxes as as everybody else you know
oh i i've got all four feet in the trough you know being a federal employee
and and so but but i can understand that uh that you know the uh who gets benefits
like every every time there is a a bond issue you know i vote no on every one of them
this is this is tax not tax revolt country
i mean there's too many
every one of us most of us have our have all four feet in the trough you know plus our snout right up to our ears
so you know it's not exactly that kind of a place that that you want to you know get into a tax revolt situation
but uh uh the uh the local taxes here i i
i- in this particular area uh you know i've uh i think i pay about uh oh thirty-five hundred for for taxes on my four bedroom house you know
and which is a lot of money
an- and uh and so as as people get older and older uh you know they think about retirement and that sort of thing and and they they're building old peoples homes uh you know at tax expense
well i think you know the old people ought to just bail out of here and go where it's cheaper
why i i could go down to bulverde and probably rent a rent a house for that
you know in in instead it's it's the taxes here
course i don't know whether i want to go to bulverde or not you know or seguin or someplace like that
but uh there's certainly lots of inexpensive places where the services are poorer
and and i think really the only place you can really reduce the amount of taxes you pay is to move to an area where the services are poorer
if you're not going to use them then you want to be in in environment
that's a strategy i think tha- that the people have to have to take is is how to be able to to lessen their cost of living you know
i'm i'm five or six years before i'm eligible to retire
and and i'm saying well you know i really can't stay here uh as a retiree
i'm going to have go out and you know in you know east fork someplace
and and do my thing you know
my parents are in the same situation you know
they their home is paid for
but still their taxes are so high that you know my father doesn't feel like he can
and they have no children in school or you know anything now
they they redecorated in nineteen seventy-five you know
and they're not doing it a- again you know
so well it's certainly uh uh
i i don't work
uh generally i get uh you know most of my news uh in the you know weekly magazines like time newsweek and and uh u s news and world report with with occasional smatterings of of uh you know the wall street journal and of course the local paper
but uh my my only complaint is i really don't enough time to to look at the articles every day and and go through a paper you know exhaust the details
so that's why i concentrate on weekly magazines
i i well i i don't think i have the time to really become a student in every article
and and so i i i like the weekly magazines uh because i- it gives me you know the high points of what's going on
uh but many times uh
but here i am you know cheek by jowl with our nation's capital
it's almost a uh bedroom community for the capital
well when when the capital gang always talk about the people inside the beltway i'm saying to myself hey guys i'm inside the beltway
but uh i- it turns out that uh that that the c n n is i think is great
and for for things like hurricanes and fast breaking events
but generally they're they're they're more sound bitish you know kind of thing
and and i don't really uh you know i don't really feel as though i've a gotten sufficient uh you know dose of news that way
uh which i like
uh i i think it's fairly objective
and i always like the letters that they read which tend to accuse them of being too liberal and too conservative
and while there's an inherent uh filtering process going on just by the letters they choose to read uh i always figure it's a good thing when any given group is being accused by each side of uh favoring the other side
that's that's potential indication of balance
and generally i really do believe they are pretty balanced
uh i also read time magazine
and we get one of the daily newspapers around here where we go through various sections of the uh various uh of the articles and the front section
well the mercury and the and the and the chronicle are the only things that are really can stand up there
oh you st-
uh redwood city
we we get the mercury which i generally think is actually a pretty good newspaper
the newspaper i really been impressed with it when i've read it at times i- at well the los angeles times
which i've found to be a uh
and i like a lot of the articles there
th- the other thing when you said we don't have cable t v so but the other thing that you referred to that always sounds really interesting to me is is called c span
i i've i enjoy
see they have uh we have two the both c spans here
but but really the th- on the public t v you know macneil lehrer is one is an hour's program that i always
if if i watch any news program it will be macneil lehrer
and and occasionally c span
i i like a i saw the uh the uh the the tapes that were that were run of marion berry's drug bust
was the whole thing was was run on that
and and and a- also they have the uh the uh uh parliament's question and answer period
i i think that's always fascinating
i wish i wish we had something
when wh- when it first uh you know when it first tuned in on that i you know
and everybody was you know making noise in the background
but it's usually the prime minister
here's this dude in a wig and i said to myself it's another monty python that i didn't know about
and then and then up jumps margaret thatcher off her green bench
and i said oh it's parliament
so i i thought to myself i can't wait
i'm going over to to britain in mid you know in mid-may
i i i'm going to uh you know a- you know apr- approach my uh you know
this is how i discovered you know the que- the prime minister's you know question and answer period you know
i i have seen that
and uh a aside from the level of wit which is much higher than generally in american politics uh which i really enjoy i really like the fact that they have a chance to ask hard real questions i think
and it's unlike the fairly controlled uh press conferences that presidents of the united states have here where they they always seem
and it has been for a long time
but i feel almost ashamed to say that to anybody now because i have never met anybody who likes it
well wouldn't you know
and uh i have particularly enjoy the english comedies
i like uh
well that's the reason why i like both of those programs is because they're kind of based on books
and the plots are more um challenging you know than the sitcoms of regular t v
well unfortunately for us at least here in the united states we the only access we have to that of course is public television
i'm i'm not a great television watcher in any respect
but uh the watching
what i do watch is uh usually news and whatever is on public television
i also uh am very fond of great performances
oh that was a scream
as a matter of fact uh turner broadcasting
has been uh broadcasting all of the james bond movies
so i have concentrated on watching james bond movies
well they're showing uh live and let die at this moment
and it is the first appearance of roger moore as double oh seven
oh he can never cut it
well in some of the later movies he looks very effeminate
whereas uh sean connery has maintained the uh how would you uh ruddy look
and he can even be in movies that are not uh uh sexually oriented
and he still comes off great
well you know he was when was it last year or year before last he was voted the sexiest actor in movies
but uh but otherwise you know we
uh with p b s and so forth
and i i particularly enjoy i don't know whether you've had a chance to watch it on p b s but uh the series uh yes minister
oh what's that about
that was about a the interior minister
the interior minister of in england
i i've seen it several times
but i have to go to bed
i have to get up and and work the next morning
and it should
well i i i'm not much of a television watcher
i i read as i said
and uh quite a bit
what what do you do
and i work for a tire service
oh i see
well the last two people who have called both worked for t i
and i just wondered
but i needed the money
oh we're not even supposed to be talking about this though are we
well i work you know
and that's my field of work also
so i i know the people at t i who are doing this
and i heard about it
so i called them and asked if i could participate and uh
you know send in the forms et cetera and uh so forth
i've heard that it's really against the well i mean that it's coming out with the idea that the bible's not true
uh i i think what they are trying to say is that there is a great deal of historical truth
but the interpretation that actually got into the writing of the bible itself is probably
well for example in greek there are seven different words for love
so you can have
there's one word for love of your brother one word for love of your wife one word for you know uh love of your father and that sort of thing
so in as to those types of interpretations uh really made a difference in how one might interpret the bible now and what it's at
so that's you know
but there's too much historical fact involved just from the uh the histories that are were developed around that time that are available
so you know it depends on how you look at it
you can look at it you know
well you can interpret that the what the t v show in the same way that you can interpret the bible
but uh as as far as that goes i we at least agree on what we enjoy
but uh i don't know if there is there is a time limit on this
and have a good evening
well my favorite probably all time t v show is star trek
and i would it like that
i i like the adventure of it
and the idea that that we would survive long enough to get to that point and be able to do these fantastic things in space
and then i like the
which it's an all new cast but kind of the same idea going out to new places and and doing new things and finding out about different people
and i've i've always liked that show probably the very best
i think i've actually seen a number of star treks one way or another over the years uh although i never watched it regularly
i'm certainly acquainted with the character the characters
and then i've seen some of the star trek movies
and i i guess all most of the shows i like are are kind of along the same line because they're all adventure
when i when i started thinking about this that those are some of my favorite shows mcgyver because it's it's only one person there more than uh you know instead of a cast of people
but he's always going out and inventing new things out of scrap and grabbing what he can and you know pieces of baling wire and and a few tires and all of a sudden he's got a hang glider
i don't think i i've even heard of that show
and what is what is he
he's like a semigovernment type agent who goes out then to uh works for the phoenix foundation supposedly
and uh h- his big thing is that he can take pieces of little bits and pieces of string and baling wire and turn them into fantastic different things
do you like the uh news shows twenty twenty sixty minutes those kind of things
well uh i used to watch sixty minutes as a matter of fact
and uh and i used to like the show very much
but unfortunately i find getting rid of your t v set you do throw out some some of the baby
and uh i just decided i had to do that i think in part because it was easy for me to become addicted to it
i mean i could just sit mindlessly in front of a t v set for hours
and i just realized i was sort of like an alcoholic
i have more or less i have my favorite shows
and i usually make time in my day or my week you know to watch those
but for the most part i try i have small kids and i try and keep it on just a minimum amount of time really when they're up
i guess that that that falls
and one of my other favorite shows is sesame street because of the kids
well when my kids were little i did have a t v set
and i did watch a lot of sesame street and a lot of electric company as well
well that would be a shame
i i remember it when i was younger of you know catching it on p b s
but uh i don't think they show
but they're not making new ones
but sesame street is still really good
but they repeat all the old ones
so that's still a real good show too
sesame street comes on from like nine to ten which is a good time
and everybody is up and had breakfast and dressed and ready to go
the timing of of it is good besides the amo- what's on
so they like that
they come on like from nine to ten and then from uh five to six
that's another thing that's
when it comes on right in the dinner hour i f- can feel like i can let them sit in front of the t v and watch
and they're watching something worthwhile while i can make dinner and do things i need to do without them under foot
little with little kids the t v set really is a i mean
but they turned out okay
uh it didn't hurt them any
i think some shows some
the idea i i think that's one of the things i like about star trek
and is is the
but the imagination of look what we can do you know in the future this is perhaps this will be possible
well i think we've covered most of my favorite t v shows
well i'm trying to think if i ever even had a favorite one at one time uh
let's see how about uh man from uncle
is that the one where they uh he always got this this tape recording that self-destructed
i've i've seen some of them on repeats
it kind of kept you guessing on on uh what was going to happen next
and uh i remember as a kid my parents watching the ed sullivan show
i gu- i guess it was a saturday night
and i went to see the movie the doors a couple of days ago
and they had this scene uh that por- portraying the doors appearance on the ed sullivan show
and it was very very funny
i think it was the funniest part of the of that movie
well i don't know
i was i was
well i guess i have to admit that i am
my folks didn't my folks
they probably didn't have a t v until i got to be you know grade school or so
and the shows that i like now they wouldn't let me watch
that's that's interesting
uh i think it's interesting that parents think that their small children learn violence from tv
but i guess that's that's a different topic
well i think that's about uh that's about covered it for me
so i think i'll say good-bye
and we'll talk another time perhaps
well it was nice talking to you
tell me tell me where you're calling from
oh my goodness
i think they're doing it trying to do it or i hope they're trying to do it all over the country because they need to collect all kinds of different different dialects
well it was nice talking to you
uh the last movie that i saw
i i don't go to that many
so i'll just have to talk about the ones that i went to see
uh it was awakenings with uh robin williams and uh peter deniro
the uh the show is about these uh catatonic type people that
this doctor discovers a drug that brings them back to the the living more or less
but it wears off
and the way it wears off is he goes through all these spastic you know uh
and then it gets to where he can't you know control his movements at all
and it was just so realistic
the way you know you have to just keep reminding yourself that he's an actor
what does uh
robby robin williams does he have a funny part in it
it was very serious very se-
oh how does he do serious
he's he's talented
but uh well what was that show um
but that wasn't it
uh garp the world according to garp
i didn't read see the the movie
well what have you seen
oh i saw it
it was telling a friend i i said i only cried twice
but each was about half an hour long
um let's see
when i each time that i thought that the indians were going to get killed i cried
um i cried the first time when the um the wagon man got killed when they attacked him
and uh i think from there on all the way through the movie
let's see what else did it um what other parts
and then he uh the next day he looked out there and saw those buzzards you know
and that horse has been such a pal to him
oh i thought it was awful
i mean i hadn't even imagined it you know
um i had a friend who had fixed some uh chili buffalo chili and about a week before went to see the movie
of course they raise them now you know to eat
but she we were both feeling so guilty about enjoying this chili after seeing that
well at least you know that it wasn't same situation that the buffalo died in
um i thought the scenes when the buffalos running though were beautiful
like that was great
and there were so many of them
so that was pretty
and to think about how it just changed the whole landscape you know you could follow this this beaten down path
and it sounded like thunder and earthquakes and that sort of thing
uh have you seen any of the behind the scenes uh of of that movie
they tried to keep it you know as very close to real
i mean like kevin costner did all of his own scenes
and uh they had to teach a wolf how to to howl
and that's all they'd have to do
well that's funny
well i think we've made it
oh is that five minutes
well i think we're we're we've done okay though
well thank you for calling
well thank you
and i hope you enjoy some more good movies late-
most of mine's been pretty good although i'm i guess i'm like a lot of other people now
i'm trying to to pay off my credit cards
and and uh i've done pretty good at it
well i do fairly good until i go in the store and i see something i want
you know not need want
but most of mine that i use is strictly gasoline
i i do that
but the rest like i said the rest of them i've been trying to to pay off and uh get back on a cash basis except for gas
it's too easy to to run into the gas station
oh it sure is especially when you work out of town and everything that way
i've i've talked to some who's really had some bad experience
and kind of knock on wood i haven't yet not bad
you know i just i'm just shocked at the end of the month
well i've been pretty lucky in that respect
i don't charge like i say i've i been trying to to not charge except for emergencies
and uh so but i haven't really had any bad problems with credit cards
there's you know
they have uh wonderful features
you know like in emergencies or whatever
and then they have bad drawbacks too
it's it's awfully easy
i mean high interest
i did switch to one uh sponsored by the credit union though that seems to be a pretty low interest
yeah compared to some of the other ones
and you don't have an annual fee there
and that helps
uh we used to have you know like several
but right now we're just more or less at american express
and that way we can go ahead and pay it off when it comes in
that's one way to do it because that that forces you to pay for it instead of saying well i'll just pay on it this month
and when you pay fifteen dollars a month it sure takes a long time
and now without the benefits of being able to deduct interest off off your income tax that's you know
but this is the last year you can take anything
well i've enjoyed talking to you
well i've enjoyed talking to you
and maybe we'll get to talk again
well i can tell you pretty much my two favorite shows and they kind of are in different spectrums i think um
one of them is quantum leap and the other one is night court
and i think i think they're real different i mean
um quantum leap has i mean quantum leap is kind of a comedy in its own way i guess
but uh mostly it's it's kind of science fiction
and it's um it's adventure and things like that and then night court is just pure you know weird fun you know
just it's it's nothing serious about it at all
so i don't know why the two of them happen
but they that's the way it is
it's funny that those are my two my husband's two favorite shows too
and i enjoy both watching both of them
but i used to didn't like night court and i
and the only reason i think i like it now is because i've seen it so much
and i'm involved with the characters
i used to think um dan fielding was just too too vulgar and too crude for me
and i told my husband that's the whole point
but sometimes it just
well they they really have changed him though
if if you've watched it this season um he's becoming i mean he still is in his own way degrading and everything
but uh he's involved in that charity
and uh it's taking up so much of his time and so much of his thought that he really has
in fact there was one show that he even turned down a date with some you know beautiful woman just because the idea that he was his mind was on the ozone layer and you know global warming and all this other kind of stuff
and he you know was too depressed you know to
so that was part of i guess his character building or whatever
i think it adds a probably adds a little bit of depth to his character
i haven't watched um yeah
even though the person is involved in so many other people's lives you still see a a real person in those situations
he gets um he's doing amazing things but he's doing them within the bounds of what a normal person would do and i think that's
so what do you what do you consider your favorite shows
um i think my favorite show is hunter
and i i like the old ser- series better when um dede was in there
yeah and um so uh uh and then the blond that they took out the one that got killed yeah
and i think that's what they try to do
but i think we wanted to see dede there or somebody like her
well but see i read an article about in t v guide about uh about hunter and about his you know latest you know his three girls whatever you want to call them and they say that uh that there was abso- that there was like a conflict between her and him uh that they never really could get her into uh any character that they could use
i mean you know uh yeah
the second one the blond you know if you think about it they didn't really interact hardly at all i mean they were never partners
and he would do his
and i think that's what i didn't like
and and and even even at the beginning dede and and hunter would decide that one of them would go do this while the other one would do would go this
but uh it seemed like it was almost two different organizations you know
like hunter was the boss
and this other girl was not
and you know you kind of you're wondering you know well when did this happen
i i kind of agree with that
and i like the new lady better
but i'd just as soon that they didn't have the romance there
i'd just as soon have the the police story without all the romance
well i'm afraid that's what they they really wanted to do um
and then they went away from it and now they're starting to go back to it
and maybe that's what the public wants
but i just i like the the cut and dry solve the mystery
and that's what i always enjoyed about it
well see there was that spark between dede and hunter for a while but they they like started it
and then they'd pull it back
and they'd start it and pull it back
and that really made it a very interesting uh show to where you never really knew which which one was going to show up you know whether it was going to where they're going to be real close or whether they're just going to be partners you know and that that i kind of thought was good
but um you know it's i guess you know
and you see these two people together
and you always wonder why they don't you know get together or whatever
and so i guess that's what they decide to do yeah
but it's it's always been a formula uh for t v that the minute that two people that the two main stars get married that the show ends up you know dying
a a good example of this and you know this is probabl-
they had get smart for uh ten hours a day from seven o'clock at night until six or until five o'clock the next morning
well the the last day all they did was the last season to where the two of them got married and that was i mean that was the killer
well go ahead
i didn't i was going to say i didn't ever watch moonlighting
but i heard that's what killed it that uh interplay died when they got married
and so the show died
it seems like you can do so much more of the subtle hints and the subtle little plays on things before they they before they get married you know
and and well of course another one of their mistakes i think is they have a tendency to change characters or to change the characters' uh uh personalities well especially after they get married
um couple of examples would be um well like i said this one about max s- or get well smart the female character barbara feldon she had been at the beginning the the intelligent one the the one who always solved the things and and figured out and kept max from getting real messed up
well in short whenever they got married she got dingy
you know why would they do that
i i'm guess it's falling back into our traditional stereotype which a lot of shows yeah
well do you you watch um what is that show who's the boss
that's uh that's on tuesday nights i think
but i don't watch it regularly
well i i hardly ever watch it
but as as i've seen it they've they've done sort of the same thing to where they've they started to let them get together
and then they pulled them apart and i think they're thinking about that exact thing about the idea that if the show lets them uh get together then you lose part of what the show's all about
so i always thought that was kind of weird
it's funny how we uh we we romanticize people like for instance where as the teenager you know you romance a romanticize a rock star
but when he gets married then you don't care any more or something like that
and i think it's the same with your characters on t v
now i don't particularly like either one of them but um uh their marriage was so highly publicized that there was no way that they could stay together or at least that's the way i look at it
so i don't know
i just the the publicity in and of itself much less the i mean
so having twenty million people watch you do that
so um well that's kind of interesting
so um well i guess that's about all we need to do isn't it
so this is a change
well i think i've um
you've had a little bit of variety huh
well thanks so much
well like i was saying burlington's crime it doesn't involve children
and what you see on the t v from you know in washington and new york
so what i believe the people want
the subject is is big city crime which is something that i don't have any first hand experiences about
but i have you know concerns
and i have a few ideas of um how to combat it
i mean i don't i don't think ideally you know you need money to do everything
so that's one thing
that that's that's crime that you can't fight it if you need that money
well when uh we lived in san antonio
and it's always been a very large uh city and increasingly growing
um there's a lot of retired military uh individuals that live there
and then there's a very large hispanic population there
and the one thing that we noticed that over the years has gotten worse and worse is hispanic uh gang crime in the city and that has uh been the worse thing that we've seen happening
does it spread out of the neighborhoods into the more the uh retired people's community
or does it stay in the bad neighborhoods
um the majority of the actual gang crimes like the pat- the drive by shootings and stuff stays in the neighborhoods
but the crime spreads out into the more affluent divisions through robberies rape and uh car crime
there's a very large uh or very high percentage of car theft
and san an- san antonio's not far from the border to mexico
so a lot of the uh cars go to uh you know shops
and they take them apart
and a lot of them go over the border especially like mercedes
a lot of those those in the the z uh the z cars the datsun cars end up over the border
so that's a big concern if you live there
and uh very much so
in fact for a while there they had downtown if you were to come to a stop light they had a rash of where people were when people were stopped at stop signs that people would get in their car and hold a knife and hold them up
so now ever since then when you drive into the city most people keep their doors locked while they're in the car until they get down there
and once you've reached the the river walk area which is the tourist area it's usually pretty safe during the day if you're just kind of cautious and don't go down the back streets or alleys and um you know or alone
but at at evening um again you they have the high tourist area the river walk area which is nice
but you don't want to get off the beaten track
um there's a lot of parking garages there because parking is very tight
and so you don't want to get caught in the parking garage uh alone
oh my it sounds like um san juan puerto rico
we were there just well for a lay over and um well it wasn't a lay over
we were we had we were staying at the other end of the island
and we drove into san juan to catch our plane
and this boy really wanted to go on the beach
and they look at you crazy you don't go on the beach
well it's a big tourist town you know
don't they don't people go for a walk on the beach at night
and they said no
it's very safe in the daytime but at night they even have the policemen come around at dusk and sound their sirens pretty much telling people be wary you know and get off the beach
it's just so sad you know
it is just really so sad you know
um in san antonio i don't know what the answer is
um so many of the kids are drop outs
um uh there's a lot of drugs that go on and that they just have hopeless lives
they they lead themselves down hopeless tunnels
um then again i don't know really what steps there are that they
well what they what they say they try to do is to get the kids um early and young
and what we have here in burlington which it doesn't cost a lot of money but they have a kids council that they have all these after school activities for kids
and they have also organized fun activities like gyms going to the beach and playing volleyball at the beach in the summer
and they have gyms open
and it seems that the younger you can get them and get them involved with programs after school you might keep them but you again you need that one on one like a big brother trying to keep the younger kid you know tell him hey stay in school
it'll get better you know
so that your mom doesn't have a job and she doesn't work
you don't have to live on the you know for a street life
but it's so cheap they don't have a problem here
i mean um they can deal with that scale
when you have five thousand troubled youths plus when you're getting into th- well the kids now it's twelve years old
and they're selling drugs and they've got a fifteen year old that's their boss that is carrying a gun
it's just it's the morals of the people which i mean i guess we everybody's responsible for the society
but if i had a child that that did things so bad
it's not they don't care about anybody these people they're stealing from they're just the big bad rich guy and we don't have it
so we deserve it
and we should take it
i i don't know where you start or with a lot of these kids
um so many of them all they see is just the gangs and unless you can take them out of the environment enough to where they don't have the peer pressure from the gangs as soon as they come home from school
well i think a lot of it is the parents are totally irresponsible too
the parents might be thirty years old and i'm thirty years old
and i'm kind of irresponsible
but i have the morals that keep me from you know
these people you know they bring their their johns home
and they bring their drugs home
and the kids are just sitting there in the same room
it's just that they have absolutely no no morals and it's really sad
and i don't know how you combat that
i don't know what the answer is to that problem you know
but i like your idea of education
and what do those kids do
i i feel i feel for them
or you know because it they can't remove themselves
they can't just leave and say okay well it's not acceptable
and i'm i'm going off you know
like if they did have a big brother big sister program those those people trying to help the kids
the parents might have hostilities towards them you know
and i'm not good enough to raise my child which basically is true it's it's it's
i'm glad i don't live in a big city just because i mean not just because i wouldn't feel safe
and i might see it on a you know a sixty minutes special
in san antonio it was like every day
but san antonio is considered a nice clean city believe it or not
i mean they have all kinds of nice write ups about it but any big city has a bad section
but but there's a lot of them
and um there's hardly
and um those that aren't
and there's a lot of crime there um migrant hispanic farm workers people that are down and out
and uh they all seem to congregate in celinas not so much here in monterrey
so it's it's pretty quiet you know
and uh people run in the park
and you know you're just
even uh even in the worst crime areas in burlington
i i can walk the streets
i if i did it every night i think there would be trouble in our house
so you wouldn't get confronted or anything but i don't think you would uh
but they're not going to grab you steal you- your money and slit your throat which in a lot of big cities i mean that's what you your going to have to expect that to happen
i i believe in the trial by jury
i think if it was up to the judge alone that there would be real possible for uh payoffs you know briberies uh
and i also like the unanimous decision because you have to persuade everybody to be a hundred percent absolutely sure before you convict somebody
i i really agree with the uh innocent until proven guilty theory
i think that's that's a good way to do it
well i think i think basically
but for anything involving that trial by jury certainly should be mandatory
but there should be with our overworked uh judicial system
it seems to me like there ought to be a means of of um not having to take everything before a
maybe there ought to be some kind of of uh
and maybe instead of of uh
and during that week you're kind of an ad hoc let's hear about it group of i don't know twenty-five instead of twelve and each case is presented to that group of twenty-five
and those cases are uh lesser degrees of magnitude you know
and he had his pockets full of stuff you know when he was caught you know that kind of stuff you can just turn to the judge and say your pleasure your honor
and there's not a lot of discussion about that kind of thing
but the way our system our court system works that guy is going to have to hang around in jail or out on bail or something like that for an extreme period of time
and we're starting to stretch the true meaning of of right to a speedy trial
that's that's a good idea
maybe this pre group of people could decide you know which kind of uh you know where they could go from there
do they need a big lengthy twelve person ju- jury
or do they need a six person jury or you know those kinds of things
and the degree of the of the you know the seriousness of it you know
is this open and shut you know like you were saying
or do you need somebody to go off for three months
you know we
you know kind of off what we've been talking about here uh i believe that our we've become almost a litigious society where we everyone is very quick to sue or to threaten to sue and that kind of stuff
and although we supporting a whole segment of society called lawyers maybe we don't need to do that
you know maybe instead of being so quick to sue you uh if you have a disagreement with someone instead of tying up court and time and that kind of stuff maybe you nee- maybe you
and if you want to your lawyer or your your opponent
and let's you know let's get rid of some of this harassment suing
that's that's a good idea
in the bible it says uh if you have something against somebody to go to them first
and if that doesn't work then to go get somebody you know a little bit more wiser and older and take them with you and go to them
and if that doesn't work to take it to the whole church
so that's right off that same kind of principle
that's a that's a good idea
and if if we could all deal with those kinds of beliefs we wouldn't have half the
but uh you know that whole biblical concept like that
but it's based out of that
and uh so that you know that could work
there's a a real name for that like the judean law or something like that
um what is that called
well that may be right
uh and too the
uh that's sort of the old testament version
i did a sunday school lesson one time on the difference between the old testament and the new testament where where there's a vengeful lord in the old testament and there's a loving lord in the new testament
but that's a whole different subject
well i i think we have exhausted my pitifully small knowledge on on the legal system
but it's been a pleasure talking with you
what what part of the country are you from
in in texas
well that's quite all right
well i'm from the dallas area
well so am i
well that's that's neat
oh are you really
well i'll let you go
and it was nice talking to you
for instance jobs that require use of heavy machinery and things like that where there's where there's uh endangerment to their own life and other people's lives
uh i agree with that
people that are uh driving like uh truck driver's and things like that
and i'm not i'm not opposed to any testing
i mean because i know i certainly wouldn't want to to uh you know be endangered by somebody in a company that accidentally dropped something on me or or you know because he was on drugs while he was there
well how do you how do you feel about uh companies drug testing prior to hiring
oh uh i was tested uh within my company
i think it's kind of a push to uh weed out drugs in states
and because i don't know of any other countries that are doing this and i i feel like it's really just within the united states
it's uh it's okay
i think your record should stand for itself that you know if you've been tested at other companies and you've always come up negative or whatever then i don't see what the big deal is that they have to go to all the expense of testing you over and over and over
and once you've established the fact that you're not a drug user and especially if your personality proves that you're not i think they could uh save money by not doing that you know every time
say if you change jobs you wouldn't have to do it if you'd just been tested at your other work place
well what about random testing though
do you feel like that's an in- invasion of certain people's rights if not everyone is tested
uh not if it's done fairly
and that's probably my question is how how do you know it's done fairly
if it's random then it's random and that's not necessarily fair
well they might tell you it's random
but then you know it's kind of like a a lottery
well i ha- i know that for instance in the n c double a they drug test
and it's not random
oh i see
how'd how did they how do they pick their people
uh well i think all college players have to do an initial drug test at a certain point prior to the season and from that point on uh at the n c double a does have something to do with it
but it's almost discretionary on the coach's part of each in- individu- individual institution to identify the ones that have the problem
oh i see
so do you
and and the ones that test positive have to retest after a certain period of time
well do you think that should be implemented in the work place you know as like a manager or supervisor thinks or has suspicion that someone is using drugs
well not being a drug user i don't have a problem with that personally but i think that might be a violation of someone's rights
if someone's having personal problems for some reason that's causing them to h- behave differently and their manager assumes they have a drug problem i mean if someone assumed that of me i would be upset
it it would almost be like a a uh
and and it's and it's based on on a perception that someone has as how a drug user would behave when some drug users behave uh normal uh you know
and then how would you feel afterwards when you came up negative and you know your supervisor has accused you of using drugs
i i don't the i think almost the only way that drug testing can be done fairly is if it's across the board from from the janitors to the executive management
because i know personally myself i've been in the same job for three years
and i've already been drug tested three times
well i'm an environmental engineer and i've been drug tested three times
and i know many people that have never been tested in their lifetime
and the company i work for is sixty thousand people plus
so see i for some reason i've come up three times
well does your r- does your job require you to drive company equipment or to ap- operate any type of machinery that might endanger someone
well that doesn't
i mean i
it's a legal job you know so see it's really strange
i was drug tested uh not for the job i have now but for the prior job uh
but i know that they sent that the job i had before that well
the job i have have now requested my uh uh
well does your the company say for instance does the company you worked for bef- before have the right or do they have the ability to say hey we've already drug tested her
and she came up negative
i don't think they can they can force another company to not drug test me just by saying that i i didn't i mean
but i used to work for a power company
so it was very important that they make sure their employees especially linemen uh were clean
and since i was just you know one of the office folk i guess it wasn't as important to them that they test me regularly
but i know they test most of the service people fairly regularly reg- uh just across the board
and are they tested random
but again it depends on what job you're in
and the men that drive the trucks with with the guys that fix the power lines aren't tested as much
oh i see
but but see they make that clear to them as they hire those guys what what the drug testing schedule is
they say we we're testing you tomorrow
and we'll test you every three months thereafter while you work here
so they know that
it's it's made very clear upon hiring
well have we spent our at least five minutes
so what kind of car are you thinking about getting
well none at the moment
well when you decide to
i currently drive a a ford taurus
and i would ima- i would imagine that if i change or if i get another car a new car i will go with the taurus or something similar uh in that regard
so you like the ford
i have had it for about two years now and it's uh
uh i haven't had a minutes trouble with it and uh the only thing i have against it in that's it's a taurus
but i still feel a little even after two years i still feel uncomfortable driving it because i had a honda before that and so it's a little bit larger
but that's the only the only difference that i see really
but i would
my my criteria would be at the moment it would be uh american uh personally
and uh i loved it
but uh um i finally decided to go check out what the uh what the uh foreign cars were
so i bought myself a a a nissan a two forty s x
but even though i love the car i've got now i think my next car will probably be american again because if i can at all do it i'd like to stay american
well my wife drives a still has a a honda accord
and it's a very it's an excellent automobile
and uh but you know price and so forth
so i i i do not uh opt for uh something that would be
i want i want something that's serviceable serviceable something that i can use and uh and i
and with the taurus
i have a taurus uh l x
and it's you know
and as i said as far i'm concerned it it has been extremely uh uh serviceable and everything i wanted
well ford's done a real good job in the last uh say ten years or at least the last five to te- six years so of really turning around their um quality i think um
oh i think so too
now i you know
in travel and renting automobiles uh in
i've driven you know chevrolet automobiles and so for- and dodge
uh i had a chevrolet before i bought my taurus
i purchased a
and uh i was ready to get rid of it
and uh so i i shopped around
and i would i probably if i had thought i uh wanted to pay the amount of money i probably would have gone with uh uh an accord or even a a civic or something comparable from nissan or toyota
and uh but it was just
i had i have a friend who uh has a uh an auto shop
and he purchased one of the first sables that was uh manufactured for his wife a sable station wagon
and he just absolutely swore by it
and it was upon his recommendation and so forth for you know comparable comparably equipped you know with cruise control and air conditioning and a m f m radio and all these other things uh it was just
there was no there was no comparison uh
the only thing that i find you know if i would have anything against it is that it still has that soft american ride
uh not uh
that's about the only thing i find you know disadvantageous to it
but my criteria is simply something that looks good something that's serviceable
and i you know i drive around a lot
but uh and it's you know it's very comfortable on the highway
i can drive for you know ten hours or so and not really be tired in any way
but those are my criteria
and i i probably in another six months to a year or something will probably start looking around again
and if there's something out there that uh is comparable to what i have now i'll go ahead and get it
you know the only thing i'm looking
at right now um
i just i just bought you know the nissan that i've got about uh say nine months ago
so the only thing that that would get me to change cars right now would be if
see at the moment i'm single
and if i were to get married and have a family that would have to have something to do with it
but uh i don't have any plans for probably another two three years of even looking you know
uh cars are too expensive right now to uh to even think about buying new cars every couple of years you know
in our parking lots uh two or three days ago i saw one of the new honda sports cars
uh i i can't remember what the name is
and it looked it resembled a mazaratti
but to pay that much money for an automobile uh is just
i can't i can't conceive of doing that
i went to a a car show down here about uh about two weeks ago
and um you know of course they had the normal the ford the the chevrolet that stuff
but then you started looking at the uh uh
they had ferrari there they had uh b m w and all these other kinds of cars
and ferrari didn't even let you near the car
i mean they were
and then you saw uh hundred thousand dollar cars
and even even though i i i do enjoy cars i enjoy um driving them i enjoy uh riding in them and everything but i can't see buying or paying more for a car than i would for a house you know
that's true well
the difference there is too uh is between us is that i am not really crazy about driving
i never have been since you know my parents had to force me to get my driver's license when i was young when i was sixteen
so i've never really cared
now what i was you know
i never it was never my own car it was always someone else's
and that sort of thing i enjoy
but to go out and drive uh never has really been had any appeal to me in that regard
we won't we don't we won't get the recorder or the uh system to shut us off uh tonight
well it's very easy when you get a top- you get on a topic that you know you enjoy
like uh i think the one time i did it was on sau- the mid the mid east the crisis out there
that was had a great conversation
but uh then they came off and
well i was talking to a lady last evening
and we were talking about fishing
and uh we were cut off well
well you have a pleasant evening
so uh what do you think about it
well um i guess i i'm more concerned about public safety than i am about the um the concern for the private uh the idea of
the individual um
because i can't really see why anyone um who has nothing to hide would object
well there is always the uh the possibility even remote as it is of uh of mistaken uh of
that's of course that is certainly true
and see that bothers me
i'm i'm a i mean i'm i'm very much for drug testing
uh i really am
i mean i'm going i'm going to take the negative side just for a second
um see i have to take uh medication for a uh for for kidney transplant
and i'm going to be taking that the rest of my life
i don't know how that's going to affect uh
i mean i haven't had one yet
um t i
i work for texas instruments and and uh we you know we do have the random drug testing
but i've missed it so far
but i mean it in the back of my mind it always bothers me
and what happens if it you know if it if they catch it
they think that i'm you know i'm on drugs
and they send me and and have me uh you know go through this this
thing you know
but it seems to me that there are ways to accommodate that um
i agree that that some innocent person might be victimized
but i would think that um that some guidelines could be set up to avoid that
for example that one uh positive would not be uh accepted as an automatic um reason for whatever they might be going
to do if they found a positive uh dismissal or treatment or whatever but that that what it would do is it would trigger perhaps uh one or two more stages where further tests could be ta- uh done
because um there are there must be people like you or in other circumstances that could come up with with uh false positives for certain kind of drugs
on the other hand um i think there's certainly some professions that ought to be tested because of the of their responsibility for the public welfare and certainly people in uh industries well the transportation industry
for spe- uh you know specifically
but um in many many cases whether or not an individual has a problem with drugs it's not even going to effect anybody but his uh you know himself and his own family perhaps um depending on the kind of drug he might be on
but um and eventually that's going to show up anyway in the way he works
but there's so many things that it would make a difference
i guess i i uh i would not want to have anyone in my family uh victimized by someone who you know a a bus driver or a train engineer or something like that who um you know hadn't been tested
well i you know i'm like i said i'm i'm very much pro testing um
and and this is why
uh number one is i i'm i'm kind of
but i you know we are in a war against
i mean it's it's horrible
i mean you don't know whether the person sitting next to you anywhere is on drugs or not
and it takes some drastic steps at this point
and i think personally the drastic step has to be that um that you can't work if you continue taking drugs
i mean it's as simple as that
i mean make it so well make it uh ma- not necessarily difficult
but make it so that it's not glamorous
i mean it's glamorous taking drugs
or at least it seems that way
according to what you you hear
the people who um have serious problems i mean
we have um
really i guess we're kind of lucky
we really only know of one uh young man who uh who's a fam-
and it's the son and so on
and he was friends with my children
and he's really the only one that i know of personally who got himself really messed up um ha- having been involved with drugs
but i know of a number of other people who have you know gotten all messed up
and so i have a little more contact with that
but um the effect that it's had on this young man's life is so dramatic that it's heartbreaking and he may never really be a productive member of society
but sadder than that he may never be able to have a normal happy life because it has strung him out so that he has anxieties now that are are almost uncontrollable
i mean he he puts himself in the hospital fairly regularly thinking that you know he he's not sure if he's going try to commit suicide or not
i mean he's you know he's so messed up
and um this was a nice sweet young man who teenager you know
and he's now a young man about twenty i guess who um just got really down the wrong path
and uh you know i don't know that that his problem would ever have been detected by drug testing
but seeing what drugs did to him makes me see makes me realize what it could do to people you know in the work force as well
um it's horrible
let's let's answer the second half of the question
well the limits uh uh would i think have to do with what i'd alluded to before that there needs to be a further um that that one positive on a drug test
would not constitute uh dismissal or grounds for whatever the company or agency might uh have set up for those who genuinely have a problem
in other words there needs to be um more than
and there needs to be some some measure of uh certainty before anything drastic happens
there are lots of things that are involved there um such as perhaps insurance uh you know denial of insurance for someone um
and undoubtedly there are people who would be victimized by this um that would that you know
and people who are on medication for example or um even people who might be of the gay community
and i'm not an advocate for that particular
but um i think that there doesn't need to be fuel to the fire for discrimination because it makes a bigger problem um
so it seems to me that that um there needs to be some ground you know some rules that protect
i'm not sure though when we talk about what rules if any that we should say well certain segments should not have to be tested
it you know
i don't i don't know why it would be you know uh bad to test just every-
and it may be you know
but certainly random testing the fact that people know that that they
but the bottom line is that that if if you're going to stay clean and straight
well there's yeah there there's going to be some measure of incentive uh reward or whatever
but the reward ultimately comes down to what you want
so i i've got to agree with that
well it sounds like we agree anyway
i think we i think we did pretty good
well all right
well uh i guess that's about it
and i guess we've talked long enough
it was it was talk nice talking to you too
well do you own a p c
i have one at uh
so i can work at home
and it's just an old old compact that is super slow
and but it does it does it's job
um i don't know
um i do um television ratings
and i process some ratings and put do graphics for their television stations
it's basically just data entry and running you know some some software
so it doesn't really have to be anything sophisticated you know
but i've i've yeah i work for t i
well i have uh pretty fa- a fairly fancy one
it's an s p one thousand which has a it has a fast processor in it a three eighty-six
the the job that i do
and i have to develop uh functional specs and
so it's it's kind of fun
i mean i i always say that i need to buy a computer for the house
but i just haven't got around to doing it yet
but sometimes my husband my husband says usually i work on the computer all day at work
your husband what what group is your husband in
um something with the defense
i work on uh printers and
the peripheral products division basically uh
i work in the airline ma- marketing group
so we we do a lot of
i learned so many things that they they do
in for a while you know
he had a he had uh one of those what are they top secret things
you know where he couldn't talk about what he did so
but then he switched jobs
and i have uh
software design engineer so as they call it
but i have a degree in information management
which is computer you know
it's basically the more the bus- business end of it than the programming end of it you know
so but i've been at it for you know five years
so everything's changed so much i probably couldn't even
so you know they've made such advances in computers
so uh does your husband ever use uh a laptop or a notebook
sometimes he bri- he brought home a uh a portable one
but uh it it quit working
so he brought it brought it back
and he just hasn't brought another one home
but they did give him a new computer at work
oh i see
we we build uh laptop and notebook computers here in temple also
and those are really handy
i mean we they they have modems in them you can send a fax from your p c
oh how nice
but they're they're really
they're they're pretty handy because you know when i travel it's easy to check messages
just you know
well my husband doesn't have to travel
well at least you get to
so that kind of reeks havoc with plans
but it it's really not enough to become a big hassle
well that's good
but i don't think i'd like it
but they're so expensive
well i don't know
there you can get well
you can get real high powered stuff now for under two thousand dollars where you know just a few years ago it would have been six seven eight nine thousand dollars
yeah you know
i guess it's not it's all you know it's inexpensive compared to what it used to be
but it's a lot to put into one
it's still i mean
you know two thousand dollars isn't just just pocket change to a lot of people
it's it's not pocket change
so it's major
maybe when the kids get in school that will be you know
when they start needing something you know then that will be different
when i started at uh t i i was a summer development student
and so those papers really
i mean it was nice having access to the
equipment to uh
but you know he his was more for scientific stuff than for word processing you know
well how many different types of packages do you use
um all i
the packages i i don't really use
i what i use that outside development that we use most of it's just stuff that's been written in house that i use
up up at work anyway i use wordperfect and lotus and and which is uh uh a a line-draw package
i've just used wordperfect and lotus and the most
for your uh data entry stuff that your
a lot of the data entry stuff they used uh survey system and and um you know just in-house programs to do what they needed
do you get do you work at home all the time
and they just wanted me to continue working for them at home doing other things
oh that that was that worked out pretty good then
you know i don't do i don't really don't do basic a lot of what i used to do
i just do you know something really minor
and it's time consuming
so it keeps you in the company huh
that's right you know
it gives me a paycheck you know
it's only like the works only you know three weeks
goes for like three to four weeks three times a year
you know it's not something that's continual because you know the television ratings don't come out you know all the time
and i've got lots of documentation i need to review and some i need to revise
but you know i need to be at the office too
my hu- he took one home when they when they had it you know they had a big deadline coming up
and it was looking a little touchy to meet
well i've i've done that before on a couple times
but that would make it just that much easier
instead of bringing home a computer you just bring home a few floppy disks you know
i thought that would be you know
because it's real nice with this because i don't even have to go into the office
i've maybe been into the office once in the past three years you know
they just um they just send me everything and pick it up courier or whatever
so you know
it is real nice you know
but i you know worked
i know most of them well
but most people know who i am
but i don't know who they are you know
so but well it's been good talking to you
well we'll talk to you later
okay well thanks
it it's kind of hard to find time sometimes
and have a family
uh i don't have a family
but i i usually work about fifty hours a week
uh well for a dinner party i think one of my favorite things is baked chicken and white wine
that's that's really weird that you said that because for a dinner party mine is is a is a chicken in a marsala wine sauce
well mine actually came from the um texas instruments cafeteria
and um the cafeteria is real good about putting out recipes you know like once a month
and i tried it
and it was really good
what is uh is a marsala wine a sweeter wine
and it uh it's a it's a red wine
and uh i'm trying to think what else
i i roll it in bread crumbs and uh parmesan cheese
and then i rub it with a little bit i rub the chicken with a little bit of oil
and pour the wine sauce over it as like the last twenty minutes
oh so it kind of browns
and then you put wine over it
and it's really easy too
i like to serve um a wild rice with it
uh do you like angel food cake
and then i mix up uh some cream cheese and a little bit of amaretta wi- and some cool whip
and i make a thickened blueberry sauce
and i layer it with uh angel food cake and the blueberries and then that topping
it is it's great
but since there's only two of us
i i try to avoid making anything that too fancy that
i know i know what you mean
but i i guess one that that i really like that i haven't made in awhile
and it's it's called a fruit pizza
and you take a uh sugar cookie uh recipe
and and spread it out on a pizza pan
so you make it like a pizza crust
and then you you bake that
and then you um take things like kiwi
and you mix that with um
and i can't remember what else is in it
and you make kind of a glaze
and then you layer your fresh fruit on that
oh and pour that over it
and it it's real light
depending on the fruit you use it's you know it's real colorful
especially with like the kiwi and the strawberries
so but usually i just opt for brownies and vanilla ice cream
and i've been making a hot sandwich
and then i make a little honey mustard dressing and put over it
and that's some- that's something that just you know it doesn't take a long time to fix
and it's really good for you
and we eat out a lot
and there are sometimes you just don't feel like eating out
and i wish i had something a little bit different
mix up a little uh mayonnaise with some dijon mustard
and it's real good
and it keeps in the refrigerator
do you well
oh it keeps a long time
and you wouldn't have to mix that much together even
and i put a little um oh yogurt in it too
oh are you
and i have been debating what to cook because one of my guests is a vegetarian
so we're going to
we might try to to um to grill some flounder or salmon steaks
and i usually
and um definitely go with it will have to be a rice dish lots of vegetables
i had a recipe from that um international cookbook two that's a great salad in summertime
do you do you garden or not
and some a lot of times they'll give us something
and i put it on a glass plate because it looks real pretty
and just a little bit of um basil
and everybody loves it
and it's so easy
and it's delicious
it doesn't sound like it it would be hard at all
and you can put some cucumber slices on too
and it's got beaut- all these beautiful pictures
but it was not expensive
well the ones that i've been i've been wanting to get um
i've been i've been wanting to get those because we eat a lot of chicken
and we do eat a lot of pasta
so we we just said the other night it wouldn't be too difficult to be to do without red meat
you know we don't have that much of it now
some uh beef and broccoli strips
but it didn't have much beef in it
i've got a i've got a wok that we don't use near as often as we used to
we used to stir fry a lot especially um a lot of chicken and and a lot of rice dishes
but usually if i'm if i'm if i take a day off or on the weekend especially i try to cook
real real food
and at least cook a couple of dishes ahead
so that we can have those to enjoy
cause we have some some local ones
and we have a share alike column in the paper
where people you know write in and share recipes or write in and say i'm looking for this recipe
and that's where i get a lot of my recipes
they are good usually good aren't they
and i got i got a real good one from a doctor's office one time
oh is that right
it's uh it's a baked bean recipe
and you mix baked beans and lima beans
and uh let's see i guess
you buy the canned baked canned baked beans
and brown sugar and molasses and bake them in catsup you know
and and you just bake it
and it's just it's like a a spicier baked bean dish
oh that sounds
and you can add hamburger if you want
so i i try to always keep my eyes open and because a lot of time you can find find really good recipes where you wouldn't even think about it
so i try to always keep a little notebook in my purse
jot them down huh
but it's been
well hang on
well let me try it once more
well i think we're on maybe
so in maryland are you uh are you a skins fan
um well not not really from you know
so uh the teams i really root for in football are the niners and the seahawks um
you know like i like seattle because i like seattle
and besides i like the city
so you were out there in san francisco
san jose actually but but close
it's um um other than the uh the big catch uh with the forty-niners and the cowboys ba-
but uh i i don't know
i i never really was a cowboys fan until i moved down to texas
oh is that where you are now
and uh uh i guess when you're down here in dallas you finally get indoctrinated into the cowboys um because uh you know this is a big football territory down here
and uh uh unfortunately of course the cowboys have been doing so bad in the past few years
that uh uh
but uh it's not like it used to be
well you know you you back the winners
and you don't back them when they're not doing well
but i think uh actually uh in in trying to follow uh you know the cowboys over the years i think uh uh they used to have a um a philosophy for well i don't know probably the last twenty-five years except for about the last about five or six years uh they always went out and tried to draft the the best um athletes
but they would go out and try to go for uh the best people and then mold them into different areas or find their natural niche
and then about five years ago four or five years ago uh they started going after uh uh specific players or positions you know
like the press would get down on landry
and this is when schramm was still there
and um they'd go after them saying uh jeez what you really need is a defensive end
so they'd go out and try to find a defensive end
and when they when they drafted somebody and he didn't workout at that spot it really wasn't a good enough athlete to move to any place else
and uh so i think it was kind ever interesting
i think the decline of the uh of the cowboys as a powerhouse really kind of started with uh not drafting people the best athletes
it makes sense because you know you you've got the flexibility if they're good athlete they can you know do a bunch of different things
and i don't you know
my my my my main sport is baseball
but you know um i've been enjoying football
but i don't know it as well
um i just you know um
is it is it this year they don't have a draft pick because of the walker trade
or what was the whole deal on that
uh they still have some some uh some draft picks uh
actually they picked up some from minnesota
i think it was uh minnesota's
oh that's right
they gave up they they traded wa- herschel
they um um
i've got a friend that uh lives right next to the cowboys' training camp
and uh uh he gets he sees them out running a lot
and every once in a while gets a chance to talk to some of the guys
and they're all uh they're all thinking that uh man they they they really got something going this year
but i i guess uh when you have a whole bunch of uh professional athletes that get together at the beginning of the year everybody's got great hopes
know i guess it's the same way with baseball or or anybody you know
spring training until you actually start going out and getting uh getting out against the competition everything probably looks pretty good
i mean you know if you go to
i i you know i'm sure if you go to any of the twenty-eight coaches in football in training camp they say oh we're going to be super bowl champs
i know i know in baseball you know any manager you go to say well we're going to be in the world series
even though you know there's not a prayer
well kim i mean didn't the cowboys even finish
they did as a matter of fact uh
because they only won one game the year before right
i i i live near baltimore
and um i mean i'm really
they'r- they they got a big thing because of the you know the the expansion going on in baseball
d c is like talking about how how they're going to get a baseball team and everything
but of course you know the the the one the griping is that if you know if if washington doesn't get a uh a baseball team then baltimore shouldn't get a football team which is probably true
but anyway um i just i've never liked d c a whole lot
and a really hate the redskins
well of course
and a lot of it's because you know i got a lot of people you know at work with and everything that are big redskin fans
i've i've never liked ph- philadelphia the city a whole lot
the only reason i really enjoy the eagles at all is because uh i really like randall cunningham
it was buddy ryan the one that i can't uh uh stand too much
well considering how how well he gets along with uh jimmy johnson that doesn't surprise me
there was um uh there was this uh ther- ther- in
the baltimore sun has this uh cartoonist in the sports section
i guess it was january when um jimmy johnson got named coach of the year or whatever
and uh he had this cartoon in there about jimmy johnson's big day you know
the first thing is the phone call from the you know from the league saying he was uh um you know uh was coach of the year
and the second was this phone call from buddy ryan i got fired can you believe that
actually uh you said you lived near uh baltimore
you're out uh
and uh actually i used to drive a lot between baltimore and washington
uh it's just west of baltimore off off route seventy
but basical- well route seventy and and uh route forty
that's not far from where the uh the new football stadium would be if we got an n f l team
well they've they've built a new stadium downtown um
is that near near the what do they
is it the the wharf or the the uh inner harbor
it's um a couple of blocks west
there's a big um
and then there's uh an old station
and they're building the stadium on the other side of the shed from the inner harbor which is really stupid because one of the big selling points of the new stadium is supposed to be this view of the inner harbor
and the only way you're going to have a view of is this big brick wall
and they've got land set aside for a football stadium if they ever get a n f l team
so it's um real easy access from from south of baltimore like um like the airport or more importantly for the orioles from washington d c
the orioles say they get twenty-five percent of their population i mean uh their attendance from d c
the colts still you know still to me are the baltimore colts
i uh never been real thrilled with well not you know
i uh i went to purdue university for a couple of years and uh
and um i was not real happy when uh when they uh left to go go there of all places
so uh uh you know did you graduate from purdue
i i uh i transferred to delaware and graduated there
oh there's not a whole lot in delaware
but it's close to philadelphia and baltimore
uh kind of all over the place but
eas- east coast lately
i have uh one a five year old daughter
she was um
and then i had her at a private sitter for i guess two two and a half years after that
and how did you choose that sitter
um she was referred to me by a couple of people
and she turned out to be wonderful
i didn't want to s- send her straight to a day care
and even though she was that old i still didn't want her to go to a day care
and this lady you would think it was her own
and um now i have got her in a montessori school
and she's really really doing good and learning a lot
well that's neat
i guess i'm going to quit as soon as school the school season's over
but uh i really enjoyed being with her up there
they they go f- uh year-round uh teach them
now in the summer they have like a lot of field trips
but but they still go through all their uh curriculum as usual
well we went over to her house
so we told her you know pro-
well we didn't tell her we just told here we'd be over that day
so that way i didn't think y- you know the house would be y- you know cleaned or anything for me specifically
and um she had a daughter
and i want to say her daughter was like six or seven right around first second grade
but it was only like a part-time basis
and uh we really seem to be pleased with her
did you did you introduce your daughter to her before you made
and she still loves her to death
mean when they see each other you know they just love each other to death
and she literally spent almost the entire amount that i paid her on my daughter
so we're real real lucky
but aft- uh
so she stayed with her about roughly two years
and she um she had to go back to work
so she had to go i guess get a real job
so what made you decide to put her in a montessori school
well i checked a lot of places out you know the kinder cares and the
and uh i live in garland
and there's this montessori school that's nearby
and um it had been recommended by some friends of ours
but uh it it's an older place
and so i uh checked out all the new places that were near us
and then i checked that place out
and uh even though it was older it was it was real comfortable and
and they didn't just play all day long you know
like i noticed a lot of these other schools that i went
and then they
and i thought well gosh that must be pretty good you know if everybody's trying to incorporate a little bit of it into into
and they made sure they pointed it out you know
but after i looked at this place and i took randi with me uh
and i just kind of let her go see see what she felt like doing
and that place boy
if somebody came and she liked them and she went outside with them and it's hard to drag her away
so i felt more comfortable at
and she was real comfortable
and she has really really done good
but she seems to me to be you know pretty quick and smart
and she's already reading and writing and stuff
and she just turned five last month
i mean i didn't want to rush school at her the whole time
and oh my god here we go
do you have any l- nieces or nephews
well that's a shame
i w- i was petrified
i mean that's uh
and that's why
and that's one reason i like working up there a little bit is
because you don't know uh
because like at her school
and they have car callers
and and some kid goes out and gets the kid
well at first that always kind of bothered me
i mean not bothered me
but i thought well you know i'd like to see what she's doing you
but now that i'm there i mean it's it's a lot more convenient because there's so many kids that doddle
you know when their parents come
and it's hard to get them out
and a lot of parents have places to go and and things like that
and it's late at night
so you know now it doesn't bother me at all
is it off of near country club
i i i've seen the signs
but i've never actually seen the place itself you
it's pretty set far back
and that's something i like too
because a lot of those places are
you know it's right there on
but it's set back
i'm scared i would be scared to death my child might accidentally get out
or or if that seems like a real accessible place to where you could
you know go
or you know or a car accident
and it was it it was brand new when i checked it out
and of course it was beautiful and
you know i that
i do know why because you know
d- drugs and
and that scares me
i mean you're just with them
they've um they've
but of course they still have no concept of
and what to do when they're faced with it
but i just think of her you know
next year she's going to be five six years old in kindergarten in same school with you know uh i guess ten year olds
six sixth sixth grade you know
and that's a big gap
and that's uh that i can honestly see the peer pressure there
oh i can
and i'm i'm probably a little too over protective
well nowadays you have to be
i don't i don't think there's anything wrong with that
so i at first thought you know when i didn't have kids
i was going god how can you be so protective
but it's easy now
and i do
well are you ever are you b- are you are you married
well that's good
because they're really neat
in building which building
well are you summit or are you uh
oh this is fun
i'm building uh one
oh i'm building two
so how's the build- how's the weather in building two
typical t i or t i
i'm i'm a transplant
so what do you think of the texas weather
oh five years now
i've been here long en- pretty long
you you you know about august then
oh i've been through five of those
a lot of people try to leave the state for a couple of weeks in august for you know
we went up to wyoming this last uh summer during that time
and it was like you know eighty degrees up there
well that's that's the even even farther away
it is so cool you wear a jacket you know
even in the summer time huh
because it's it rains a lot in alaska
but it you know
and it's lovely
and then it rains just enough to keep everything nice and moist and very green
oh my goodness it's pretty
well texas isn't bad
i have to think every year to try to remember what it was what's it supposed to like this time of year
because march we usually get a lot of rain in march you know
it'll seem the news the harold taft you know on the local news
and we've had this many inches
and you know we're right on target you know
and just seem like we were getting a lot of rain in march
but i it's hard to remember twelve months ago what it was like
oh we always we always do though
yeah i wish i just wish it wouldn't come all at once
and then we get all that heat
well it's just that you know
in california you get these nice lovely rains you know nothing really down- you know like downpours like you have here
oh you got into that bad stuff
i mean just so noisy hitting the house
and the glass on the windows
but we went out there afterwards
and there's ice balls the size of marbles all over our lawn
you pick them up you know
and they're perfectly round
and i go gee how did they form you know so perfect like that
i think that's one of the strange strange things
and you very seldom see it though
i've seen hail you know
but usually the size you know of uh tiny tiny pebbles
you know really small you know
but this was uh really large
so it had come it's a drop of water that had come through quite a few rain clouds apparently
uh i don't know how hail is formed to tell you the truth
i think i think that's
you don't think it's cold enough you know to
but in the clouds it is
and then i think you know all that falling would warm it up and melt it
but maybe that's what rounds it i don't know but tumbling
i was in um florida for a week on business
and i had called back to the house
and i called back to the house
i said okay you know and i watched the news
and i thought ha ha that's garland that's not plano
but i guess you just tend to think of of where your house is you know and nothing else
and close to that what's called duck creek that runs through part of garland that's the part that always seems to get hardest hit when there's there's the hard rain
oh oh i see
and a lot of houses a lot of houses around that creek seem to to get flooded the streets and stuff around that area
the house that house
uh uh not quite
but i live close by there in north far north garland
it's getting built up you know with more new new shopping centers and things you know
the house that the house that i bought was really really nice
really really nice home very pretty uh
but you're not living there right now
oh i see
it's it's investment property
but it is really it's a very nice place
uh i i would cheerfully live there
and i've lived in my home in well almost ten years
and you know i've got everything just exactly like i want it
but if i were to live some place else it certainly meets my standards
and i'll be honest with you
but it's in the estates that adjoin it
well that's a nice area
that one nine that one ninety is just going to be the mo- the outer- outermost loop around
another belt line just uh farther out
i've lived in san diego for six years when i was a ki- younger and l a area
and my parents live in anaheim right now
uh there is an area beyond thousand oaks north of los angeles that is really an eerie strange looking area with boulders
is it along the coast or or inland
well you know it may be a little bit more inland
uh i had to go up to t i on business a couple years ago and we went up that coastline
and i was just amazed how unusual that looks
oh okay maybe maybe i'm used to texas
but but the
i didn't i don't remember seeing that part of it
and they've built some new highways out to that area and things lately
i i know exactly that area
uh texas i don't know
i think i don't think it's quite as green you know
but it's just
oh it's green sometime
but it's just you know
well it doesn't stay green you know the really
and in all honesty
and we built a pool in eighty-two
um well i'm not
i mean i read a lot
but i don't i don't read a whole
uh and i'm a uh i'm a big baseball fan
so i tend to read a lot of the baseball books
and uh i read a lot of science fiction
well i like
and so during the school year i just don't have time to read
and i you know i would love to to be able to read more because i i enjoy it so much
but with correcting papers and and i two o- kids of my own i just don't have time
but in the summer i try to read a lot
and and of course being a woman i like romance novels and stuff like that a whole lot
i really enjoy that because it's kind of a a getaway type thing
so i i read a lot of that
but i also love sports
and uh uh i i don't have time to read in
but i do read sports illustrated i- during the the year because my son gets that
and uh but uh i don't read a lot of nonfiction
and i really should because there's so many self-improvement books out right now that would would be benefit me greatly
but i just don't
i um i don't really i pro-
i uh um i'll get like uh books on history and stuff like that that look interesting
and i uh of course i don't ever get around to reading them
you know i got uh um
i b- i belong to quality paperback book club
oh do you
and i'll get get stuff out of that
like i got battle cry of freedom you know
like a couple of years ago
and i started reading and got about sixty pages into it
and it's like eight hundred pages
oh my word
and it was like uh i want to read something else for a while
but after you get into them they're really good
but it's just tough to get through that first two hundred pages or so
well especially you know well
battle cry of freedom starts off you know in the eighteen forties you know
and it's like
wait the war wasn't until the eightee- you know
it's like okay
and i realize these things you know
these things take awhile like to move up
but it's you know it's hard sometimes
i find though that if when i find an author
uh and you don't read a lot of fiction you said
but when i find
i i do the same thing
because you you get used to their style and you really enjoy it
uh there's one science fiction writer named uh allen dean foster
i must have like fifty or sixty books by him
i mean i have you know i have everything he's ever well almost everything he's ever done
and um you know i i know that when i you know when i get his book i'm i'm usually going to enjoy it
um so it's really you know
it's it's fun to to do that uh
well he does a lot of like um uh movie adaptations and things like that
oh does he really
and uh his adaptations are usually really good
um it's it's funny he um
the the novelization of star wars was list-
you know it it was out in the uh in the stores as being by george lucas
but it turns out that uh foster actually uh ghost wrote it for him
wh- which you know
when i read it i should have realized that because i mean it had foster's style written all over it
well i i've never read anything of his
but i've heard about him
but wouldn't you think he would
oh i'm sure he does
well i would think he would
well i mean he's doing all right probably
oh i'm sure he is
but sometimes the more you get the more you want too
you you're a baseball fan
you're you're aware of that kind of thing
i in fact i'm a sports fan period
i mean th- that's why i like to read sports illustrated so much
because there's everything in it
i had a uh had a subscription to that last year
but i'm uh i'm mostly a baseball fan
so i'm i'm not as inter- you know
but um i was mostly interested in the baseball stuff
so you're probably uh a baltimore fan right an oriole fan
uh actually i'm a red sox fan more than anything
oh well that's good too
um but uh i i i do like the orioles also
i'm i'm sure you do
well i'm a ranger fan simply because i live here
but i i was uh
so i've always followed the tigers because you know i was i was born and raised in toledo
went to a uh to a mud hens double header
oh i love the mud hens
was a b- really big article on the mud hens in sports illustrated last year
i saved that issue actually
um that's when i had the subscription
i we used to go there all the time
and they have the iowa oaks
and we used to go
but i don't know if they play
oh they must they must have changed then because it used well
so and i haven't been back to des moines in a long time
but we used to always go to their games
and it was kind of fun
it's almost uh more fun than going to a major league game
it's not quite so serious you know
and it's a lot cheaper
there's a city just west of freder- of uh baltimore called frederick
and they have a minor league team
and i go out there almost as much as the orioles
i mean it's free parking
and three bu- bu- you know four bucks now to get in
and you know the hot dogs are a dollar
and and it's just great
well how like how much is an oriole game
the ticket the ch- the cheapest ticket you can normally get is like six fifty to seven fifty
see it's higher than the rangers
and um hot dogs like start at a dollar fifty
but uh you can get a good seat for uh well
but i think it's gone up to fo- four dollars this year
oh that's nice
but you know it's in the bleachers way out in the you know in center field
but it's still nice
and uh we usually sit there unless somebody gives
well how much are the box seats there
box seats run from oh like eight dollars to twelve dollars
that's um that's a little steeper
i think the uh most expensive seats in memorial are eleven bucks
but we're getting a new stadium next year
oh so it'll go up
and if it opens
it's uh something we're really irritated about around here
or some people are really irritated about
they're they're building this new sta- they built the new stadium downtown
and they're saying how there's going to be a lot more parking for the stadium
but i park for free up at at memorial stadium because i know where i can do it for free
and um i'm not going to be able to do that downtown
uh that's yeah that's a bummer
well see baseball here though is the cheapest game in town because the cowboys
it's out- it's outrageous to go to the cowboy game
and the mavericks are t-
so baseball's cheap
well that didn't go s- over
oh it d- it didn't
they they they decided you know george bush who who's the main owner of the rangers decided that uh they'd stay in arlington
so arlington's going to build a stadium a bigger one
so we're going to they're going to stay there which is fine because arlington's got a lot of things to offer
and and that was their main main money making you know
and it would have devastated them if they would have taken it away
and and it you know that's
and and they
so i'm kind of glad they're staying there because it's right in the middle of fort worth-dallas
and you know
that's that's what i'd always heard
we you know we i like it there
and i think dallas has enough to offer that they don't have to hog everything
so i'm glad that they're staying in arlington
and it's takes us maybe uh we- well thirty-five to forty minutes to get there from plano which is not too bad at all
it's actu- it actually funny that um i live just outside of baltimore
and it takes me almost the same amount of time to go to frederick but as it does to go to the the ballpark in me- in uh baltimore
because um to go out to frederick i just jump on the interstate
because i live just south of the interstate
h- hop on the interstate
and the stadium's right off the interstate
so it's like i drive west
and i'm there
and you know and then to go into baltimore i mean it well it's fewer miles
but i've got to go stop and go traffic and everything
do you read um
but you don't read many sports books
well not really
now my son does
i have i have a son that just turned sixteen
and he reads everything he gets he gets his get his hands on
he's a basketball fan because he he plays for the high school he goes to
and uh just loves d- dick vitelle
so but he's reading it
and he says he's so interesting mom
and he's really enjoying that
and he said mom you need to read it after i get finished
so maybe i will
there was uh i understand there was a really good basketball b- book called uh a season on the brink
uh i was listening to something on the radio about uh
you know a talk show about sports books
and they and they mentioned that one
and uh i was thinking about
there was a i saw a book kicking around on the history of the a b a which
oh that would be good
i get in to even when i don't like the sport so much
uh do you have any friends that have children
and what do they say about finding adequate child care
there uh relatively nonexistent from uh from what i hear from my friends
it seems like uh even when they have consulted day care centers that are quote unquote reputable that are sort of like a chain if i can use that word uh still you have to deal with the people that you know happen to be operating it locally
and uh it's just a matter of of trust you know
i think they feel that these people are um under qualified basically and underpaid
and i think that sort of goes hand in hand
so it's it's difficult for them
well we certainly found that to be true
uh indeed we've
and we moved away from institutionalized child care if we can call those chain kind of things
like that uh by that name
and found that uh more creative avenues were the right answer for us
uh at one point in time we've had au pairs
and that worked for a while
but they were really adequate ones were really tough to find
i do have a friend that uh uh
and they loved it
they had stayed with this family from the time these children were small you know four or five years old up until they were well into grade school
and uh she was paid very well because they the parents trusted them
and they you know had done such a good job
so um i can see where someone you know in a position like that in a live-in capacity would definitely be the way to go if you're you're lucky enough to have the financial to be able to do that
well that's true
and that's something that we're struggling with now
it's uh you know it's a terrible thing to say when your speaking of children in that way
but you still have to be realistic as well i think
and that's that's that's bad to have to admit too
but uh you know it's just there's so much pressure when you're talking about two people that work outside the home
and and i think that is one reason why i continue to be without children
it's just such a responsibility and and when i've had friends that have said
when you hear people say it it alters your life forever please take heed
so it's uh such a responsibility
well it certainly is uh
well i just have to be honest about it
there are those times when i think gee if i didn't have children i could be out playing bridge or golf
but you know it's funny
i did i had a friend that said you know before we always said we don't want children because we can't go off on the spur of the moment or this or that and the other
and she got older
and she said but you know we never do those things anyway
it's it's just the way your attitude changes
and you mature i suppose
but the thing about the child care i you know i have friends that struggle financially and and they both do have to work
it's a matter not necessarily uh that she might want to stay home or he as well
but you know they need the money
and uh when i seen some of my friends that have taken that six week old baby you know to someone else it's just i can imagine how emotional it must be and and you know multiplied by the fact that you don't really trust the person or you're uncomfortable with the situation as far as child care um
well we were lucky when our children were that age
and having lived in a community for a while and we knew the person to whom we were entrusting our children
and felt that that
and feeling of safety
and were leaving them small children
but we also learned something from that experience as our children got older
i think your patient level must needs to increase as the child gets older
i think that might be part of the problem with some people you know
but when you have them in their their little feet are moving
and you have to chase them down constantly
well you sound like your pretty well passed the worst of it as far as worrying about
oh you don't know what happens after they get in school
now we have uh one takes piano lessons
and the other one of course can't do the same thing
oh of course not
but we are helping you know
and it's almost everyday
the stamina that you must you know draw from yourself to deal with it
well i've been finding out that i really am a nice person
because i didn't need it
and now i need it
and it stays low a lot
well are your children now
do you feel comfortable um with them coming home after school until you and your wife get home
i mean one of them i would i would leave unsupervised any time any place any where
uh the other one i wouldn't leave unsupervised two minutes
and it's it's the one that's going downhill
is it is it the one that needs needs more supervision that has a bad influence on the older or more mature one
you don't think you don't think that good prevails
well i i i'm living in a dream world
and i'm an only child
so i've never been around children
so uh i'm sort of at a loss where that's concerned
but i do hear my friends talk about it
we we're having such fun
and we just couldn't wait to have two children so they would be such friends
i i i have to admit i was self- selfish as a child
and now that i'm older of course it's different
you know i think about uh wouldn't it be nice
but uh anyway
and so they just sort of you know adopted me as their eleventh child
so that worked out pretty well
so i guess that's an alternative
if you could just um
and of course people are denying it
and uh it's just frightening
well what what's frightening is a parent to see things that that you don't really don't understand
and then you don't really know what happened
we gave up on one baby sitter because we came home one night and found pieces of um ribbon you know hair ribbon tied in a chair where obviously she had had
oh i sure do
th- the dog is joey
oh my goodness
and we just got a new addition to the family so to speak
a cross between a catfish and uh i don't know what a salamander
well did you all catch it
oh the mud dog
uh we had a friend give it to us
and it's all alone in that aquarium
but um uh we haven't found one yet
so how about you
well at the present time i have two dogs
an english setter you know
and it has
uh yellow spots on it which they call i think uh liver spots
and that's a male
and i have a wonderful female lab black lab
quite a long time uh probably five or six years
and unfortunately the black lab that's a female it tha- it's it's the most wonderful animal we've ever had
when she was about three years old we noticed that she was having pro- uh problems limping and so forth
and it's in that breed
but now i think there are tests that can be conducted uh to tell whether or not the puppies have the have it
but i think
apparently they've been so in well i don't know inbred or what
oh is that right
but it um
and if if you should have one uh that also has hip dysplasia you cannot breed it uh
i hadn't didn't even know that
but she's wonderful
um our dog joey has uh a back problem
um like ha-
uh he he's got a bad back
but he's seven uh
i guess he's abo- almost eight years old
what are the what are the symptoms
um he just uh
he uh yo- he rolls o-
but otherwise he can jump uh you know just as long as he doesn't bend a certain way
um well uh i have had just wonderful luck with this lab uh
uh let's see winter before last we would bring her in and uh when it was cold
and she wouldn't
i you know
and she wouldn't
i couldn't get her up without p- picking her up and which it was pretty hard to do at eighty pounds
anyway i uh met my son's uh college roommate is a vet
and he said um let's give her some race horse shots
and you know in
i'm i'm kind of glad to be able to tell people about this but you because you all the time you know run into people with problems
anyway that's when we lived in oklahoma
and uh so he gave this dog a series of
they give it to race horses uh to get rid of uh cartilage
and it's called
anyway it's a series of six shots once a week
and then i noticed after two shots she was
well i could have
but i can't give a shot
and uh after the the second shot she was significantly better
then i didn't notice any improvement till the after the sixth one
and ever since
and he said uh a booster uh every year or two
i mean maybe every six months or or something like that
and when i notice in the winter when it's worse you know it's cold weather and so forth then i have uh gotten a booster for her
but not many people in this part of the country know anything about
but they've really never used it
so dogs that get down in the hips
like i think german shepherds do it and probably large dogs
and uh it's just wonderful
or does he just run out in the backyard
um um well we're living now in an area where we we we're in the woods
and we take walks
uh uh go away from me
but we take walks through the woods twice a day
oh that's nice
and uh i can over do it on her
but anyway at least she can go
and she's not limping along and all that
oh stripper well he started out being a little orphan
and we we took him in
and uh he's about two years old now
and he loves his treats
uh both uh joey and uh stripper get treats
and uh let's see
and is um stripper an inside cat or outside
oh well he's outside
so he gets to go in and out whenever he wants to
well of course
he has to go out whenever uh we ask him
and when he when we ask him he uh he barks
and he'll tell you which one he wants
well he just can
well he has been trained
and you've ke- you've kept u- it up haven't you
i i have some neighbors across the field
and um they
when we first moved here uh when the dogs and i didn't fe-
but but since i i didn't want to
i wa- i just wanted to let them be able to be free for a while
so i kept watch and never let them get away
but now every couple weeks they wou- one would slip away
and my neighbor said to me oh i noticed those dogs dogs are so well trained
so that made me very proud
well have we been talking five minutes
well um so it sounds like you keep your pets for pleasure
oh okay um
so i didn't know if they stop you when the time is up
i i glanced at the clock when um we started
and i think it's been probably about five and a half minutes or something
but one day i was talking to a lady about gardening
and i'm i love gardening
and she did too
after after about twelve minutes or something
but it's been so much fun too uh talk
well my best friend in virginia's daughter is a part of this project in texas
oh i see
and so she knew that i had the time and would be would enjoy it
i mean i
but i have a hard time getting anybody because i guess
and probably just got home
so um during the day i me-
and i understand also they want men
but uh this is a great project that they're working on
and it's really going to lead the way uh for a lot of econ- um applications and and development in the voice area
wh- i think so too
and i haven't helped them out on the me- on men particularly
but my husband had been ma- in fact he's been probably has made a few more calls than i have because i tend to not make them around dinner time
i try to you know make them do during the day
but nobody's home
well this is the perfect time for me
well maybe i'll get you next time
it so fo- much fun to talk to you
well i i i guess if i was having a dinner party i depending on the number of people i might cook a like a brisket or a roast or a maybe a chicken dish and um i guess i usually plan probably a lettuce salad and a a potato dish
and we usually serve fresh fruit and uh then make a dessert
oh that sounds good
so that makes
uh we're not uh real wealthy at the moment
and i used my mother's recipe
it's got um
you cook the noodles and make and brown hamburger and put tomato sauce in with it
and i'm not sure she even puts
well that sounds good
but um for the cheese part you mix uh sour cream and cream cheese and cottage cheese and uh layer all that
and then uh uh tossed salad and and um
oh well lasagna's always wonderful for large crowds
i've heard you know i've heard a lot of people say it the short cut on the cooking for lasagna
they they've told me that they go to sam's and buy a great big pan of lasagna
i've heard that sam's has a really good lasagna in fact i think i had it at a at a party once
well i i know people that have have served it
and they say gosh if you have company coming when you don't want to be always in the kitchen it's easy
and she said it's they said it's good
so that that's always sounds good to me um
i feel like i feel like i'm in the kitchen cooking a lot
oh i know
i cook guess i cook a seems like i cook a lot of dinners oh not always for company just for just for family
so feels like i'm often in the kitchen
but a time consuming place
and you fry it like a taco shell and you uh
for all the inside parts you brown hamburger and put some um tomato sauce in it
and and i like to just add picante sauce to get the mexican flavor
so you don't have to mess with spices and stuff
and then um let's see
and then and you heat up refried beans
and you cut up tomatoes and lettuce and grated cheese
and what you do to make it you take the shell and you spread the beans on first
and then you put um
then and i i usually put the cut up tomatoes next and then the um lettuce
and you can put uh like guacamole and
well get a towel or go change
we we don't make it very often i guess
oh do they
usually when we get avocados my kids just like to eat them plain so yeah
oh that's good
or it's always good on top of something in the sandwich
oh well we made i made guacamole that i would take to a pool party across the street the other day
and and everyone there said they never made guacamole salad
well i don't know
they must they just said they never had it at home
so i i was concerned that i thought oh taking this you know taking this as a dip i thought gosh you know sometimes when we have it at home it it turns dark on the top so quickly
so i just
it helps if you i helps if you leave the pit in it
oh does that help
that's supposed to help keep the um keep it from turning brown so quick
well i'll have to remember that
well i just i that day i just took extra lemon and just squeezed across the top
and it really stayed longer than i ever thought it would
oh that's good
so oh well i guess we bought a lot of
so even though you know
the ground turkey it's the meat is softer
so sometimes it seems to be cheaper too
so we often buy it we buy it
so we bought that
or we bought the the filets and then the chicken or turkey nuggets
and i don't think anybody in my house knows the difference
less cho- less cholesterol
well i guess that's probably all we need to do for tonight
i i can't think of any other specific things i like to serve um
uh you mix um cottage cheese and a package of jello and a thing of uh like cool whip that's good and quick and easy
probably probably the only family recipe that we we make and it's really for special occasions is cheese cake
and we take a recipe from my grandmother you know it's probably fairly typical cream cheese and egg and sugar and the insides of a
well this is the season for vacations
and uh i guess for places i like to go i enjoy going to the beach and having having outdoor being outdoors somewhere
as far as maybe maybe as the summer heat comes along i would sort of like going somewhere where it's not so hot and being able to be outside enjoy outsor- outside activities
so i like to have a tennis court there
or or if it's at the beach the beach is great
where where do you usually go
oh well let's see
we have plans this year to drive up to the uh to colorado
and we will be going to estes park and colorado springs
boy that's a nice a nice place to visit
there's a nice nice train ride that goes up to the city of silverton where they used to do a lot of silver mining
and uh and then actually north north of that is another town and a smaller on a smaller scale i guess than silverton
but i and then there's lots and lots of real of mountains that are covered with uh boulders
so i guess people jeep through that area
and we did not have a chance to do that
but i sure would like to go back there and do that again
we are uh we have not had a vacation in several years
we are going to go to uh destin florida which is a very nice beach area if you are not familiar with it
but i have heard it's wonderful
oh it's it's gorgeous
uh we used to go quite a bit uh before i moved out here
we were closer and uh used to go almost every summer uh and rent a condo there on the beach
uh there's quite a few uh there's a lot of development of of condominiums there on the beach front
and they have quite a few rooms and uh so we we will usually rent one for about a week or so
it's uh it's beautiful white sand and very clear blue green water and a
lot of nice waves usually uh
enough enough to make it
uh there's not as many sea shells along there uh
um if you go further down uh you will usually find some but not right in there
uh i do not know why it is
but uh it just
it seems not it seems not to have as many there right there
but uh we we enjoy it uh
the place where we stay is we usually stay at the same place every year
oh where do you stay
it's a place called jetty east uh j e t t y e a s t
and it's uh called that because it's at the very end of uh a jetty there which is
uh sort of at the end of this little little point
and uh it's a at the very end
and it's uh it's very nice uh
it's not very expensive uh
and uh they have a we have a uh i think it's three bedroom or two bedroom uh condominium which will sleep
six or eight and uh cause it's got you know pull out couches and all that
and uh i think it's going to cost us per couple about three hundred dollars for the week
because uh the uh you know it has got its own kitchen full size
and this one i think has two baths
the one we got is on the on the beach side
and uh just
you know it's really a nice stay uh
we i had won a trip to the bahamas but did not get to take it on our honeymoon time
so we instead went there uh and loved it just as much as as if we had gone to the bahamas
we in fact we stayed an extra day or so because we liked
the uh the particular ro- uh uh uh suite we had gotten was very nice
but uh it's a pretty nice place
well we have just we have just
it will take uh a day and a half to get there probably
well we are
starting well starting at the end of july we will have two vacation weeks in october and two vacation weeks in march
so that will be an interesting turn on vacations for our family
uh what does what does that mean alternate
and uh in and in the summer would be more like a two month two month break
so and they hope to boost the they hope to boost the learning of the children
kind of scattering the vacation out throughout the year
so anyway so maybe maybe within a year we will see how that falls
we will head for we will head for florida maybe in somewhat of an off season instead of summer
well that's probably ne- all we need to do today
and and your occupation is teaching
i'm a i'm a substitute teacher
is is this pat i'm talking to now
it is it is
well i was just trying to make an introduction here
but oh and and i haven't told you i'm going to be at a different school this year now
i've just gotten a another job at an elementary library at barron
well i bet you're you're you may dress differently then for that
well not really
i've got the every day i've got to uh read to kindergartners
so i'm going to be down on the floor with them
i've got about forty kindergartners i'm going to be doing working with every day for uh you know a half hour
so i'll be i'll probably be wearing slacks as often as i do because i'm i'm if i'm going to be down on the floor messing with them i'm not going to wear nylons and you know well
what i wear sometimes depends on on how cold i think the school might be or what room i might be in since i'm a sub and have different rooms to go to and always carry a sweater
well of course you've been at clark enough that you know it's always cold
but you don't know uh i guess at some of the other schools you go to unless you've been there
you try to layer so you can add or or or take off
and it's it's interesting to notice when you go to different schools that some are a little more fancier than others and have a very casual uh
i i think some of the dress codes are different at different schools
that's one of things one of the things i ask about you know whether whether she would allow slacks
and she said she doesn't have a problem with that
and and i said well you know that was okay
basically i just you know i wear slacks year round except every about once a week i try to wear a skirt
and and in the winter you know i just add a maybe wear longer sleeve shirts than i do in the summer and add a heavier jacket or you know wear jackets more in the winter than i do in the summer
i don't i don't really work in a profession that requires that i wear a business suit and you know look really
and well for me sometimes they even have dress up days
or they you know have have spirit week that that you wear your different outfits and you have to have the color for that particular school if you if you choose to participate in spirit week
and one might be a hat day where you have to come up with some sort of hat
and you never know that though sometimes when you're going in do you
but because i sort of stick to several schools uh i'm usually aware that there might be a spirit week going on and and might might remember to do it
and then many schools on a particular day during uh i guess football season maybe all year long they wear the school colors for uh game day which
on what thursd- thursday
and it may be friday for the senior high schools
so that would kind of give you a a clue i guess
and and sometimes you get the long term stuff
so you're aware ahead of time of what's going on
and i don't know you know
i i think about well the dress code they have for the kids you know
they put one on the parents or the teachers and say they have to the men have to wear ties
and there can be no blue jeans worn
and because some of the teachers i know wear uh dress up jeans not sloppy looking jeans but tapered jeans that they've had dry cleaned so they have got the crease
and uh you know they'll wear it with a nice top
and and uh i don't know that that looks that bad
but if you're going to tell the kids they c- have to dress up i guess you can tell the teachers that too
i think the elementary school teachers or maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier than than some of the high school teachers i think
but it i think it varies it it just so much
anything anything can go
and you can see in some of the departments in some of the schools like history at clark they're all pretty fancy
but they're just sort of into clothes
and then there's other departments that aren't
and they'll just wear your common ordinary you know whatever you might
there's a couple teachers up there that that do dress up more than others
and so you try to maybe follow those if you know you're going there
well and you always
course it's a standing joke you know when the when the men come in in a a tie and a suit coat you say you know what have you got a job interview today
or you're going to be observed
there there's there's usually yeah there's usually something going on that that uh and would would uh cause that to happen and i i don't know how a coach would feel if that teaches health or eng- you know english or whatever that they had to wear a tie
and a t-shirt
i mean we've got coaches that teach health for five periods and then have athletics sixth period
they they dress pretty good i would say
and then they go to their coaching
and they they put their shorts on there
well see that's what i would think
but they they don't look you know they don't wear their sweat pants or or anything
they're they dress like any other teacher would in in a classroom situation not in p e
course we had had one coach one period he'd teach p e and the next period health and then a period of p e and and that's hard
you know so he just left warm-ups on
but but uh no
i think really probably they could they could uh really
and i don't know if if they put make uniforms the thing for the kids
i r- don't really know if they still do
well some of them yes they do
and and it's not at some of the private schools
but even there's a couple public schools in dallas where where the kids wear uniforms and the teachers you know dress in accordance with that
well it's certainly cheaper and easier in the long run i think that you don't have to be concerned about your wardrobe
well i i think it would make a difference at school
i i don't think we should be spending time saying somebody's wearing torn clothing or wearing sh- too shorts too short
or they've got the really short skirt and the black nylons and the high you know
i mean it's a lot of trouble to to take care of that
and of course the kids say then why bother just let me wear what i want
and and yet we can't to that either
i'd like to see them go to to not necessarily a uniform but saying that they've got to wear a button down shirt you know
that would that would alleviate any t-shirts with sayings on them
but if they could wear a button-down shirt and a pair of dark slacks and they could buy them anywhere they wanted
and then the girls
but i doubt that that would come ab- that that will come about
they may get a- but they said in the dallas schools that that helps their educational process there
well i think it does
it it takes their minds off of of trying to compete
and then i think that's going to push teachers to dress a lot more professionally than they do
i i don't think a lot of teachers are very professional
we've got uh a pickup twice a week that they come out
and they have their own special bin that they hand it out to everybody
and it's twice a week
recently started uh a bin program here in plano where uh
used to be we we put all of our trash in green bags and the trash men came out twice a week and picked up
and now they have uh these large green containers
and you have to put your trash that you don't recycle in there
and then they haven't started curbside recycling yet
but they're but they're planning on doing it very soon
apparently the trucks that they had um lined up they needed the parts for
and so that put off
but uh do you recycle
um my kids do
they they've been recycling cans for extra money
so that's that's been their summer money
and they're fixing to go to disneyland
oh well that's great
well that's the way we started too
to camp goddard um which is through the plano school system you know in the fall couple of years ago
and she had to earn money for it
and she was too young to baby-sit
so that's how she started
and from there we now recycle glass and newspapers and uh aluminum cans and plastics
is is that the same way as with the aluminum cans
um the rest of it we just do because
and so you know we don't get paid for that
but that's okay
you know it's it's not that much of a bother really
and we use a lot of
two liter bottles um and like milk cartons and things like that
because when the kids first went down i said that you know that's great
and i was thinking you know maybe i'd help supplement it you know when they turned them in
well all that stuff
and how much how much we have reduced our waste
you know that we we're generating a week
um i know our neighbors when we first went to this bin program said oh there's no way you know we're going to have to have pickup twice a week
but they weren't they were only picking up once a week
and we said to them if you recycle you'll you know you'll go two weeks without having to put out the green container
and uh it's it's really amazing
he he got a little mulcher thing
and we mow once a week
you know no no more often then that
and then the clippings just get mulched up and then just lay on the on on the uh
and it's amazing
and that that has cut down a lot in what we throw out
we don't e- we don't catch it either mainly because my husband rarely has time to mow the yard
so if it mows gets mowed i do it normally
and i can't mow the yard with the grass catch on it
so i just m-
actually they say that you're wasting fertilizer if you're not uh if you're catching your grass clippings
that that's that much fertilizer you have to use because it does fertilize the lawn
oh i like it better doing it
well i i really think you're going to get hooked on plastics and paper
it's it's really not that much trouble
we keep a large plastic uh just a you know a garbage bag in the garage
and as soon as we use something you know we crush it up and put it out there
and then you know every few weeks we have recycling a recycling center like near wal-mart
they're they have the containers that you can just go over there and drop it in
and it's really no trouble
and uh i feel like at least we're doing something
you know um i read a book one time or a m- a magazine article
and they said something about how you don't realize even just your small contribution it seems like a small contribution
but it's not
if everyone were to recycle just their newspapers they would s- save thousands and thousands of trees a day a day just from not throwing out your newspapers
and uh when you read that you think well gee maybe it is a big deal
what what makes me sick is is when they show the dump sites you know and and how big they are
or like in new york the barges that that go up and down the the river and they don't have any place to put it
and it just floats in the
it's like ugh
and that's and that's really not necessary
so i'm excited about the recycling program in plano
i i can't wait for them to get it started
um because it'll be that much easier for us
you know like i said now we have to take it over to to wal-mart
it it's it's convenient out here for them to do it
now what what do they pick up
they pick up the the plastic the glass and the newspaper
oh they do
and do you have to sort that
and they will do the alum-
or do you just put it all in
and and i guess they do the sorting
but um they'll do the aluminum cans too
but we don't give them those
so you're doing that now
well we don't we don't take the newspaper to begin with when neither one of us are home t- to read it
so we don't have the newspapers but the the plastic and the glass
at first when it first started it it it was hard
you know because you're just used to throwing things
he would get he would get all upset
and i'd say
and now we think before we throw anything away
i mean it's really funny
we we really
it's just it's just making it a habit that's hard
oh i know
well the kids have even got to the point where they if they see anybody going in the trash can with a can you know they they're oh no don't do that
and they go to the sink they rinse them out and they put them upside down they let them drain
and i put them in a big bag anyway and then they dump the bag out
and then they crush them
so that's their activity thing to go out there and crush
oh that's a lot of fun
well that's great
well i'm to hear you're
and they have a deposit on all their bottles and cans
uh the air pollution isn't too bad in our area
so we're very fortunate huh
and they were doing an overview of los angeles uh from an area that was up higher
and you literally could see the band of smog
well i think it would be terrible to live in an area like that
and unfortunately i think there are a lot of areas that are that that bad
particularly in the areas where there are industries uh where they are burning a lot of coal
and oil up more up north i guess uh
i think uh air isn't as bad it once was from the cars because we certainly have plenty of cars in our area
well i know uh that's been the concern in europe
uh we have friends in germany and uh
and now they're doing that
and i guess it started in the last few years because they have found that in that particular part of the country that's the only pollution that's been there
but they were losing a lot of uh trees and a lot of
um i guess from from something that the car was uh was giving
i think it gives off uh in the emissions it gives off gases which combine up in the atmosphere uh and form a a weak acid
and after a period of time i think that accumulates in uh trees because they take it up through their roots as well as it landing on the leaves on surfaces
like you've seen what it's done to buildings even where it's really bad
it was actually it was put on by the power companies and about the various sources of energy and how much pollution there was
and there wasn't from various kinds of of energy
and uh at that point in time one person that was a speaker brought up the topic of acid rain
and it was kind of pooh-poohed you know
oh you're making a mountain out of a molehill kind of thing
and it's turned out that that's been very true what he was forecasting about the accumulation of of the pollutants in the air and the acid rain and what it would do to foliage
so it's kind of interesting the change in perspective from when i took that course
uh i'm not afraid of nuclear having had that course because of how the nuclear that uh they use is not bomb quality
and we're so strict with all our controls in the united states the chances of of an accident are slight
and it doesn't pollute the air at all
so i don't know
and they recycle the fuel
and then instead of of
some people are really afraid to recycle the fuel because they're afraid it could become uh bomb quality
but that's the only sensible thing to do is recycle and reuse the fuel and not store it down in the ground as far as i'm concerned where it could eventually perhaps there's some problem uh pollute the groundwater
so i don't know what the answer is
the best answer of course would be solar or uh
well we've got a problem on the line
i i get that sometimes um
but uh solar of course would be the clean the cleanest
well i know it's um
and uh oddly enough i thought our part of the country was ideal
i don't know what uh i i don't know what the problem is
but uh when we lived in houston we had a solar water heater
and we had thought this part of the country would be ideal for
and we have enough clouds that uh there are other areas that would be better suited
we have a tremendous amount of um sunny days
and and it
and it can help
but uh that was a problem that they were still working on
it it's still got a long way to go
it's just you know a possible solution in the future i think maybe to help in some ways
because that's perfectly clean
so it isn't not at all
and you can't control it unless you gotten a huge electromagnetic field
so that's not going to work at least not now
i i think
uh i hope so
well i do think um
i mean you've already mentioned several things i think uh just the change in attitude and the fact that more people are aware there is a problem and more people are interested in uh
and we got to take care of it
well and and for the future generations too uh
i've noticed students are are much more you know young young people are much more receptive to ideas about the environment and protecting the earth
and so if we can raise it uh you know generations with those concerns we'll solve a lot of our problems
i know i was part of the me generation where they didn't so many of them didn't people didn't care
it's whatever you know
recycle well if it's a problem forget that
uh not throw the trash out the car window
and leave it in the car and then throw it away
now i've always done those kinds of things because i just didn't like messes
oh i'm pretty much for it
well like um
i c- think that i
one of the reasons that i'm against it is that uh um i'm afraid of someone losing their life for s- um wrongly
right and uh another reason
one of the arguments that really i really actually have been kind of ambivalent about it but one of the arguments that really
uh made me feel kind of strongly against it is that uh
but then i thought about it
and i thought well the loss that i would feel at losing my mother
well i guess you know i i guess i can see it from several different perspectives
but you know when i hear about things like you know what they've what they've been reporting about in milwaukee you know i i to me i don't see any way of rehabilitating the guy
you know maybe there is i don't know
but you know and you know he's never going to be to me a functioning part of society
he's already been either paroled or whatever for child molestation
i mean i don't know
i just i really have a hard time with that because he really sounds like a real sicko
and you know for the things he's done
i guess it's either you know put him in jail for the rest of his life you know or or capital punishment i guess you know
well you know
that's true because um m- b- a lot of um these conversations i've had on this program this these telephone conversations have revolved around um
you know justice
and most of the time i hear myself saying
well you know we don't have enough room left in the jails
and people crime is still climbing
and we need to have different punishments you know
but i just am scared of capital punishment
well i can underst-
i i mean you know there there is always that chance
but you know i guess to some people it'd almost be better to die to them than to spend life in prison or whatever i don't i mean i don't know
but uh you know but that would be a situation where if somebody you know was gonna be you know
you you you really throw a lot on the courts hopefully that they won't do that you know for any for any situation really
but uh you know when i you find somebody just like that situation i mean it was disgusting when i read about it today
and and when you find someone like that that you know is guilty he confessed already to killing eleven i i'd you know i guess i have a hard time feeling merciful toward him
and you know
and trying to rehabilitate him too
and you know
and uh you know nobody wants that
you know everybody would be just as scared to death you know
we we've had a real problem here in texas with uh prison overcrowding
and they've been releasing people left and right
and you know they've committed murders and rapes and everything else
and you know you just think you know where's the justice here
i mean you know they're not even having to serve out what they should be serving
you know i just recently moved to massachusetts
and that was one of the questions
but uh i do know that they are notorious for paroling
when they're when
and then having them reconvicted for violent crimes
and i guess they said you know sh- do you think it should be restricted
i guess if it were if if
you know violent crimes with no uh with just malicious intent
well you know that's exactly i mean i'm i'm not saying i i think capital murder or capital punishment is the perfect solution in every case you know especially because there are some cases when you just don't know
and i i think there's a a shadow of a doubt you know like with this this guy in in milwaukee
i mean it
i mean they you know
just everything i mean cannibalism and everything else uh
i really would have a hard time especially if i was on a jury not wanting him to you know be executed
because i mean that's just awful
and what is he going to do prison to the other people
well i have a hun- i have a hunch that you know the other prisoners aren't going to be too happy with him anyway either
i mean you know they
from from what i hear about jail life is not any way to live
but uh i don't know it's just
well i was i saw on a human interest story or whatever today there was a woman who was just being paroled and trying to make it back
but she said uh you know in prison you can get
it it's just like being outside
you know people find ways around
and there's a power structure that you have bow to
and and it really isn't for some people tha- who have been there for over and over and over it really isn't uh as bad
i mean there's
it's not that bad of a life as it should be b- for the punishment aspect
but the society is turned against punishment and more towards rehabilitation
well you know especially like repeat offenders
it it just appalls me that they can be out you know they even get a ten year sentence and be out in in two or three or four years
you know that's that's scary because you know i'm not sure i think we're paroling them without even knowing if they're you know going to be committing any more violent acts or not
and what they're going to be doing when they get out
and it it's it's really scary
i me- you know
i i don't know what the perfect solution to that is
but i know that especially with violent crimes where you know you're nearly a hundred percent
for instance i mean that's just
i could see capital punishment in a case like that and you know for for other people too that do things like that
but uh when
uh my wife and i are both participating in this survey
and she picked up the phone
and when she
so she was uh
oh oh i see
so she tried to enter her number
and it wouldn't work
so she said whew it's for you
so but uh you know i don't know
i i struggle with it
but i i really think that in in terms of like this i'd i think that it it might not be
you know i i i'm su-
well maybe if they could uh
if they had more money or more more resources to
i mean deep down i think every every human
what what do you feel is the the major change that's been going on
they they no longer feel it's uh it's no big deal to to stay home and raise your family any more
well it has no credibility any more
and i i think i think that's really sad because i think there's going to be a generation of kids that are going to grow up raised by somebody else
well i'm a school teacher
and i'm in charge of raising them
so i can appreciate it
you don't well
i'm i'm still home with with my last one
and i wouldn't trade change a minute of it for anything
oh good for you
but i i can't i can't help but think that eventually the pendulum's going to swing back the other way again
well you know it's interesting because when i heard the topic i was thinking uh
and one woman had four children
it it's sad
and her husband said she wasn't pulling her own weight in the family that's frightening and it you know it was almost from the audience participation it was almost a social issue you know people were siding with the husband saying you've got to go to work if you have these four children you've got to support them
and nobody would give her credit for being home and raising them
i i think too many people feel they need to live a more extravagant life-style than necessary uh you know to
i i don't think you know the kids don't benefit from the bigger house and the fancier cars and and and this type of thing
i think that they would from the you know attention or whatever uh but it
i uh i i don't know
i i see it as a major problem
and i think it's going to have to swing back the other way because i think we're going to have an awful lot of kids who are going to have major problems from all this
well you know i as i said i teach school and gosh i'm trying to think
i have one woman one mother that i know is home
but she also has ten children
what what grade do you teach
i've got a chi- uh
and uh i know there aren't very many
but do you see um you know do you ever do you ever see problems you know that you feel you know that the kids are left alone too much
i've got one child um that stays with me every day until five because his mother doesn't come home until seven
and he doesn't want to be home from three thirty until seven by himself
and the school allows that
well he stays with me and i have a tendency to work late
i work until six so he stays with me until five thirty and then goes home and you know i have lots of kids because they know i'm there late i'm a slow mover to say the least
but um they'll come in and say can i stay with you because i don't want to go home to an empty house
and that's frightening because you know the
when i said i i'm i'm raising them i am
and we're talking about what the girl said in class
and you know what's right because there's no mother at home and um it makes a difference
and just the social values
well i've just
do you do you feel it will swing back the other way
i i don't know
or do you feel there's just going to be a big push to uh you know for for more more and more day care type situations
i i have a feeling we're going to go more and more
and i've got twenty-two year old male chil- child children
and i listen to my daughter
and she's going to work
and she's going to buy her house
and she's going to get her car
and then she's going to have her children
and then when you know they go on one salary will they be able to sustain what their life-style is
and they're back to work
and you know i agree with you
i was raised in a generation we didn't need all those things and we lived without them
i've got a you know
and then that's get half of the government rid of the half of the government payroll
and and we really wouldn't feel it in our services
i you know i don't know if you've ever been to washington d c
uh you you've seen that which was on there and the offices
and in light of these uh hearings we've all been sitting through the last two weeks we have very definitely decided that every department there is just overstaffed
and the other thing is uh besides that i think uh two things that very definitely need looking at one is foreign aid
uh again being just a voter and a taxpayer you know working through our congressman i don't think there's too much that i'm going to be able to do about it
but i believe in taking an active part in politics
one one thing that really bothers me beyond beyond cutting what they spend is that just really aggravates me when the big businesses do not end up paying taxes
and the um
and then the uh corporate you know industries just don't seem to not pay proportionally
i think that that would would help a lot
and uh seems like some rather large chunks of money could come from from that direction
they don't they don't seem to well
and then the taft-rudman act is supposed to help that
i mean this nonsense that's coming through now about uh uh lowering payments on social security and a few other things that bush has in mind in order t- to boost the economy because people have n- more money as it's gets it's ridiculous
not not going to help
it's nev- never helped my my personal situation
i i can't say it would help with theirs either
and thank god we don't operate our budget
the way they operate theirs or we'd all be in in dire trouble
but that's uh
but i guess it's sitting around so long that it's sort of like our mortgages
so i guess why
it seems seems to be
i you know i
it really does bother me when i think about you know leaving our children with with this sort of uh a national problem that we can't seem to find an an answer to it uh
i i don't think it ever will really
maybe if they ever get to the point the biggest you know the biggest outlaid expense has always been either wars or defense
if they were to take half of what they spend on that and put it on some economic you know inter- intergovernmental or inter united states like programs that one really might
i i believe in paying my share
and i don't mind uh paying for some of these fringe benefits that people are entitled to
but i just i just sometimes feel like i'm being used
but uh again i don't think we'll be able to do anything about it
well that's that's quite possible
i guess we have to have to keep plugging away a little bit
or it will just
but i i don't know
i i do
oh that's a shame
she's not the one going to washington huh
but i think that will probably do it
so it was nice talking to you
oh you know i used to like st elsewhere
um and that's
so i'll just ignore it
um and now i i did like thirty something oh yes
and how old are you
oh so you're little bit younger than i am
and i like it
now see i we are so busy with all of our kids are in sports
and i hardly ever watch t v
but that's one that that we watch
and then sunday nights we watch uh life goes on
that's that's a good show too
it was a uh uh
the the new character on there did
uh it is twenty minutes to nine
oh my gosh
see i'm twenty minutes to six here
uh let's see i like a lot of different shows
let's see um i like murder she wrote
oh i never i never watched that ever in my entire life
and matlock is another good one i watch
um then during daytimes i like i like all my children
oh that's mine
that's the only one i watch whenever i oh
i've i'm sure i watched it for more than that probably
so that was a long time ago
i used to watch it was in high school and college when laura's mother got killed
i read the reason she got they they killed her off was because they couldn't settle a contract
and i said well if they're going to do that to her i won't watch it
well i do like all my children
and i and i like it you know i don't know
i like the people on it i guess you know
i i i like it
well tad's going to come back i bet do you think
i kind of wish that uh nina would come back because she because the story you know
like daisy pops in once in a while
and i forgot about nina and cliff right
oh he is
so he's out for good
uh that's how they left the show but not in real life
and she's happily married
and that's the reason she left the show
oh see i i i watch it maybe twice a month
so i don't watch it everyday like i did when i had babies
oh well i i watch
because i play lots of tennis
and i'm gone a lot
so i don't get to watch
oh no kidding
i use to be i used to be like that
now isn't designing women don't they have a new chick on there instead of the instead of what's her name
there's um uh jan hooks from saturday night life
and then and then uh
oh yeah oh
well i i just know which one she is
i don't you know
and then jan hooks has taken charlene's part
well see i never watch that one either
i really don't watch a whole lot of t v just you know on sunday nights
and my whole family's home because i don't allow the kids out on sunday night you know because they've got to go to bed and go to school the next day
and so we we sit around and eat popcorn
and oh then we watch america's funniest home videos
well murder she wrote comes on opposite of that
oh so you don't watch that one instead of
i i pick nights pretty much so on t v that i watch different networks
but beverly hills nine oh two one oh i i watch it religiously
um we're discussing the capital punishment i believe
i i suppose i should have
i am am pro capital punishment except that i don't like the way it's done
uh i uh i guess i i hate to see anyone die uh but uh i guess these people that go around and and kill children and women and everything else without any remorse uh i don't think they deserve to to live and be supported by us the rest of their lives
i i agree
capital punishment is necessary in in many cases
but uh the
it's not a deterrent um or our jails would not be so full
i think it needs to be something uh uh a throwback to where they did a uh public execution where it's visible
uh something you know not gruesome
but but something more where people know that it it was a deterrent and it was equal for all people
and it was going to happen to you
no no loopholes
well and even even that i don't really know if that would help
i think a lot of these people do it uh mainly because of of t v
the double reason ma- they they see it being done on t v and also the fact of of notoriety
i mean they become well known
they are almost like like a big star
but but they they know that their chances of actually receiving the death penalty are minimal
that that that's a reward uh for a heinous crime rather than uh having them pay the penalty which is forfeiture of their life
in in complete uh
well i i i think if they went according to uh the bible where it does say
uh you take a life you give yours
uh uh that's for sure
uh there's exceptions to the rule
i mean if if it's an accidental taking then uh you look at that
but you know most of these people that down right go right and and do it out of pure pleasure uh i don't uh like to see that
it is a deterrent in the in the sense that that person will never do it again
not not not if he's killed he can't
well that's correct
ye- if if he indeed receives the death penalty and it is it is executed
but but the the the chances are not great that that will happen
but there's a greater chance that he'll be back out on the streets in twelve years
well i i guess i'm also looking at beyond even that
i i i guess i been thinking about it
and i don't have a definite opinion
but uh repeat uh crimes uh maybe not the the more mild ones but you know a more severe ones especially on on armed robbery and stuff where they been taking from elderly people
and i guess you've got to look at something like that
do they deserve to uh remain on this earth too
and and you know that as soon as you let them out on the streets they are going to do this
unfortunately the way our system of jurisprudence is set up um you only receive the death penalty for capital crimes
and of course uh of battery or assault or that is not a capital crime see
you you wouldn't be able to under our system
now china and a few other countries have a little different view of that
um you get caught with dope there and you die period
there is there is no no appeals
well i don't know what to do about the federal budget
um there certainly have been ideas surfaced uh recently uh matter of fact repeatedly by many people
and i sort of wondered what your what thoughts you had on that area
the the first one is we need people in there that that understand uh numbers the numbers that are being thrown around when when we're talking in trillions of dollars
uh which is an astronomical sum
and and the people that are talking this numbers have no concept of what that number means
now are you are you talking about the elected people
or are you talking about others
our our our senate and congress and and people that that deal everyday and and what's going to be done with those monies um and don't really understand what that is or how a budget even works
uh we need to elect people that are more uh
i mean if
well let's let's make them have a degree in economy uh or economics
so you would trust the decision making dec- economists
but but people that that know the value of a dollar that understand the value of a dollar
um and wh-
in in in
the the uh lobbyists
needs them to be eliminated uh
from congress um
they make a decision based on consti- constituency instead of a decision based on what they really believe
um you know th- or they tack on this uh pork bellies and and do things that that are good for their area to pass something that is that is not good for the country
so so you would favor a law which said there could not be lobbyists
i mean right now lobbyists require to register you'd just say
oh i i definitely would
ma- make them all
i i think that any company or anything that wants to contribute to a fund should be able to do that and be registered with what they ever contribute
but they should not have a one-on-one relationship with the people making the decisions that affect them
that that's a conflict of interest as far as i'm concerned
when you are talking again uh billions and trillions of dollars uh you're you're jeopardizing the future of the country uh for today
so uh you talk about jeopardizing the future
i i think to bring it in line you are going to have to have a generation that's going to really bite the bullet to bring it in line
uh i i forget the figures on the interest rate
but it's something like uh hundreds of thousands of dollars a second in interest
we we buy from intimate international banking
and and i i i really feel that that that is part of the problem that we we've let things get so out of control that that we don't want to put the brakes on them
but wha- what practical steps could on- could one take um
by by having a a a budget that is is feasible that is reasonable
well but everybody will say that he is for that uh
oh of course
and how will you
and then add on to it
if you make forty million dollars uh then you're going to pay four million
and and that's it
so that that's it
that's i mean
i i agree with that
and is it your expectation that that would raise the total revenues collected or or lower them or what
well what's your favorite baseball team rita
well i suppose i'm supposed to say the rangers right
well that isn't a a true false or right or wrong test here
uh uh you know i would like to say the rangers
but unfortunately they're not
and my favorite team was the white sox
not a cubbies fan huh
my family my dad was
but i turned out to be a white sox fan
well that's all right
well i'll tell you
i just uh moved down from south dakota in july
and uh in south dakota the minnesota twins are the closest professional sports team to where i was living and so everybody was a twins fan
and i was kind of uh didn't have much interest in the twins you know
it was it was kind of pathetic i mean
and one of them broadcast every twins game live you know
and and the other one was country
there's was twins there or you know skip williams
oh uh and i was routing for the twins myself because uh they a couple of ranger players that i had watched when we first moved here uh went to minnesota
and we used to tease about my son
and i used to have a bet going about some of the players that had moved from here to minnesota
but it was int- it certainly was an exciting series anyway
or can we predict
well i i would like to a- a- assume that they're going to do do better this coming year
when we moved down uh i was able to go to my first you know baseball game and thought this is great this is incredible
so i became a rangers fan
so i adopted the rangers
or rather they adopted me i guess and uh it was just exciting you know
and they hit the long ball
and it looks like wow they really hit that ball
but when you go to the ball park it's really not all that far you know
and it's so much more exciting watching a ball come at you
oh isn't it though
you know but oh i i think going to the ball park just really makes it because then you watch it on t v you feel like you're more a part of it too
well i'm a great sports enthusiast
so i love you know baseball teams
he was being he was put in the which i never knew existed the restaurant hall of fame
and he uh says he's coming back you know uh
he doesn't know how many years i mean to pitch
and he said he's been saying one more and it's been two and three might be two and three more
that's right and he's still doing great still doing excellent
you know and he said i get a kick out of it you know
he's he's such a nice man
well didn't he just sign a twelve year contract with the rangers
you know when he quits at being active he will go into you know being a managing and yeah you know being a coach i'm sure
but he's uh he certainly is a good example uh for the kids
you know you like to have someone like that you could point to say see what a fine man that he is
you know some of the
like uh ivan rodriguez wasn't even born when when uh nolan ryan started pitching
and it's just incredible to think that there's uh there are players who are the sons of ball players that used to play against nolan or with nolan you know
and now their sons are
oh he's been a legend for so many years you know
and i don't know
were you here had you moved here yet when he did the exhibition at u t with his son
and he pitched for an exhibition game for the rangers
was it nolan against uh ryan against ryan huh
well that is neat
his son pitched for u t and uh only uh ryan didn't want too much publicity on it because he didn't want his son getting too nervous about this whole thing
a game is a game you know
well the rangers really uh knocked the socks off of them which you would expect you know anyway
but nolan i think took himself out after a couple of innings or something you know of the game
well how do you feel about capital punishment
oh you did
i was on the jury uh
and the topic was uh something about juries
so i am just hitting it right
uh how do i feel about it
i i don't know
well i guess it is right in certain cases uh
well the one i was just on i don't
so i don't know what was decided
but uh what i found out
once once i was declared an alternate and i was dismissed we met with the judge the two alternates did
and i remember hearing about it
uh he was he was involved in another one another capital murder the very next month
and he was caught just
they they drove up
the police drove up just as he fired the g- gun and killed the guy
so he was caught
and uh it's interesting because the county i live in
i'm i'm pretty far north of dallas
uh county i live in in the past ten years only had t- two capital murders
and last year there were six
and this guy is indicted on three of them
so you have to wonder
well the cases like that they should
i mean if he's going to be drastic somebody has to be drastic back
although you know it's not really revenge because it doesn't mean anything to him
you know he he has no concept of what he has done
he just well
from what i can tell i mean i didn't talk to the guy or anything
but i mean he doesn't seem to have any regard for anythi- anybody's life including his own
so it's it's kind of strange that you know
no no remorse whatsoever huh
well i guess in cases like that you know where the guy would obviously go out and do it again i mean you've got to do something
well it's funny because when you know they interview you before you go on the jury and for capital murder i was interviewed by four attorneys for about five hours
but you know at the time when the guy kept saying could you ever convict someone
and do you think you'd ever know beyond a doubt
and i said i can't imagine
but i can't imagine you ever making me that sure of something
but they really did
it was it was really amazing
well i guess if the police came out and saw him fire the gun
well that was a subsequent case that we didn't know about
but this particular case i mean they had a complete confession from the guy with a lot of things that that the police hadn't released
so no one else would have known
it was it was really pretty interesting
well they can't they can i think in the punishment phase but not in the guilt or innocence because he hasn't been he hasn't been found guilty of it
of that crime but he was found guilty of anoth-
well they pushing the death penalty
uh and in texas there is there is a couple of questions you have to ask uh in the punishment phase
uh for example was the guy provoked and was the response reasonable given the provocation
and there is a number of questions
and just depending on whether you say yes or no uh you you can give him capital punishment
and if you're up to the point where if he still qualifies for capital punishment
so there is a lot of outs
but the only result is otherwise he gets life in prison
and i'm really kind of against life in prison anyway because it costs so dog gone much
and and to me i mean you take away a person's freedom you've taken away most of their life
i mean if you're going to put him in prison for life with no chance for parole
but then you have to look at reality
i mean i think you know normally they they may get out
but what is it worth
i mean i don't know whether i'd stay in prison or not
so you said you're from mississippi
and do they have the death penalty there
they've had a a number of cases here
i mean not a whole lot
well jackson i heard just the other day had their sixty-first murder this year
it was like last like year they had forty-nine
so that's going up
and i visited the prison up here and at parchman
and i've been
but they'll let you look down the hall
and and it's kind of a weird feeling
i've been they took us around on a tour you know
but i guess just going up there and seeing the surroundings and stuff the people up there
well uh let's see
well i'd like to have a corvette
so uh i'm engaged to get married
so i'll more likely get a car for economic reasons
and uh so uh to drive back and forth to work is all i'll need a car for pretty much
and we have a truck
so probably a economic size car or uh
because uh i drive out of town a lot of the weekends and uh i would like my next car to have good gas mileage
and uh same here uh
you know a nice car american made
and uh you know a a nice car but not too expensive
because uh i couldn't afford like a brand new like lamborghini
but while we're talking
while we're talking my next car i'd like to be sporty and you know nice
but you know it's expensive
and then insurance is really high for that too
oh i know
something with a that's not too sporty because of insurance then
or is it real high up there
and uh i'm not sure really how much i pay
my mom's helping me out you know because i'm a college i'm in college
and uh so i just give her the money
i mean that insurance is high dollars
and the more expensive the car the higher it is
uh in kenosha
oh it just is
i mean in wisconsin they drive them little four wheelers or four wheel drive
or do you all need four wheel drives up there because of snow and everything
we we have a jeep with four wheel drive because uh because of the snow you mean
we usually only get like once a year or so
kind of strange to you all huh
oh don't tell me that
how how cold is it there
well actually it's been warm
and that's that's really warm
uh and it's supposed to rain tomorrow
and it was really bad
and then it all melted like within the week
and now there is no snow
but um so what what is your dream car
uh i haven't really thought about it
i mean i don't know the names and stuff
but if i were to go to a car lot and like look at them
uh for a car
like if it you know was just an average middle class car
but if i were to get a sports car maybe white or red
so what kind of car do you drive right now
uh it's a sky hawk buick
uh like eighty-two thousand miles
and i hope it does though
i like i like smaller cars
oh i'm sure
i could i could see why
so you been down here before
it's different i bet huh
i remember uh swimming on easter day
and it was like really cold up here
but came back with a little tan
so that was nice
it's like you know
well i guess
w- which one have you got right now
well i uh
and i got a leading edge
and i got a american one and had a i b m one
uh i've got an omega
and i've got a uh generic three eighty or four eighty-six machine
and and uh upgraded it and put things in there and dibbled and dabbled
and now now it's now it's a fast machine
uh i'm a contract programmer
i mean like business programs
uh i've done business programming scien- you know scientific applications like you know petroleum science stuff and
uh uh test equipment
and i did the i i did one that was the demonstration of a touch touch screen for a company that sells uh touch screens
and make it look like things like uh you know attack simulators and and all sorts of little things you'd want to put your finger on the screen for
matter of fact uh i guess you do uh you get a lot of graphics in there i imagine huh
unfortunately the little portable p c that was plugged on the back was only a seven and a half megahertz eighty eighty-six
it's like slow
that will that will
well i i do uh uh programming for c n c turret presses and uh cat cam system type things
and uh really need a faster system
uh i got a new line that i i sell metal fabricating equipment and cat cam systems and tooling et cetera
i know a guy that upgrades uh for a reasonable cost
and my notebook is somewhere around here
uh he's uh up in
oh that works
and as they and as they go to the next one i just keep the
uh here it is
and where are they at
uh do you know where uh custer is
he's uh uh south of renner on on custer
and there is a little bitty mall that looks kind of like or strip kind of center
there is a mobil and all that kind of s- uh on that one corner
it's it's it's just south of there
kind of uh little guy in there
like i i traded my uh three eighty-six for the four eighty-six for about six hundred
well that's a good deal
but uh uh he
and he does a good job
and he s- he he uh guarantees everything he sells
uh there is a lot
so i i don't know where those guys are at these days
uh they they're up there in that mall uh just below campbell
or that strip strip center
you know it's like wow
and boy that thing screams now
well i thought was funny that they kept pushing the three eighty-six s x even though the the price difference is about ten dollars
it when it comes on the manufacturing floor it's about ten bucks
our most recent series of projects i guess was inside was uh we remodeled a bathroom recently
well how did it go
well it went pretty well uh other than the fact that we encountered some uh problems that you run across in older homes with plumbing which one thing led to another
and eventually we ended up replacing all the pipes from the sink clear back to the main drain
gee like starting over i guess
it started out as a sunday project and by by the next sunday
boy that sounds like uh
course uh i don't know
um you've got an older house
well that's the thing that surprised me because once i got into the plumbing everything in there was copper
and it was all soldered
oh is that right
that's what drove me bananas because you know i'm going to the hardware store saying give me plastic pipe and and cement to fit them together
and nothing wanted to go
so it was like i had to go all the way back to the main drain and start all over
and just start at square one
well and then if you do it wrong
fortunately i was very fortunate uh in the fact that uh when i made the installation of the sink and everything bolted up and we turned the water on nothing leaked
and i just said that's marvelous
well i expected something to leak you know left a fitting loose or didn't use teflon tape on one of them or something like that
but it all came together
so i i felt pretty fortunate about that
all worked out all right huh
well um well probably the last thing i did was uh paint and wallpaper kids room and uh i learned to
this wasn't must have not been a very good quality because it just hasn't stood up very well
it was a latex paint paint
it was flat and i wonder if maybe i should have used a gloss
uh but they say you ought to use your gloss mainly in your kitchens and things like that
but i think maybe uh
well it it is a latex paint
but it just kind of is is
so you know so it's supposed to wash you're supposed to be able to wash it
it's kind of got uh oh just kind of a worn look to it
did you uh require more than one can of paint
and it's a small room
but i think it only took one uh can
we did uh oh
you do mix the color as far as you start with uh white
and then they add the color
but you only had one can of paint that you did the entire room with
and then i wall papered a couple of walls
well that was the first time i've ever wallpapered
but uh the dye lots uh must have been a little bit different from
repeating patterns is what you have to check for when you when you buy your paper
and i didn't think about that
and so a lot is wasted
so you know how
see i didn't even think to look for that
and then the
one of them was just a different color different color pink is what it ended up being
or did you start at the edge
then you had to cut around the closet and cut around a window but uh
and i'll start with a plumb line
and start right there
and start in the middle of the wall and and go from there and go all the way around the room
or what's the
well you you
i have two two boys twelve and sixteen
well i have three
and uh they're five and three and nineteen months
so we kind of got different ball game
you actually of course spend less time with them when they get older
but it's of course still really important
um i work two nights a week at a
i'm a librarian and i work two nights a week at the senior high school library
they keep it open you know for kids to do their work and he um and then they the school district hires an aide you know to work for me
well my son is my aide
oh well that's nice
i mean some nights it's just real real quiet
so we i have sort of a captive audience
so i really do spend probably more time with him than than most you know
but uh of course i'm away from my other son those hours too
but his dad's at home pretty much that time
and so that kind of gives him uh time with his dad then
but but it is hard once they get that age
i mean their friends are the most important thing there is
and they want to be able to spend uh
well i've even noticed that with my five year old she started kindergarten this year
and every day that she's not at school uh she thinks we need to have someone over and play
i think uh i find myself getting my little projects going and not taking the time that i should
i'm more worried about oh
and and i need to re- remind myself to slow down
and it'll still be there tomorrow
but that's kind of hard to do you know
well if you're kind of a person that likes things you know organized or neat or you know then i think it it is hard
i think one of the nice things about holidays is that you know it does give you the opportunity to spend more time yeah with family
we have we often go to illinois for christmas
and we're not this year
and it's just really nice because we can do you know the things you want to do
you can do uh more than than when you travel
but uh that's an opportunity to get out the games
see we usually do that
my my kids even have already gotten out um
of co- of course
my twelve year old got out the legos which of course he hasn't touched since last summer but you know but every now and then i mean he's got a lot of those technic those hard kind
you know and he wants to be an engineer
so he still likes all that kind of building stuff
and um we have the train
and we haven't had that lego train together for years
and um so he sat down
and i told him i really wanted him to build the train
and we would put it under the tree and that i would keep it together
and every year i'd have the lego train under the tree
and um so he worked on that for the longest time ever since school
and um then his sixteen year old brother started helping too you know
you know these are kind of things like during the normal rat race those kinds of things never happen but
and i think that's a lot of the breakdown of the communication and the communication that would take place in a family
and there's always a few people in the family that when they stare at it
and you can't communicate while you're doing that right
whereas uh i'm the type of person i could not sit well
but be very hard for me to sit down and watch a program all the way through without doing something
i don't watch very much of it at all e- to to the extent that sometimes i feel almost embarrassed at work and stuff like that yeah
and i huh
you know how can you watch that you know
uh what do you think about it
uh drug testing procedures would have to be refined
oh i didn't realize that
uh there have been people who have been turned down for jobs because there was a drug showed up in their in their uh test
but they didn't know for sure what it was
but it was a drug
so they got turned down
and uh turns out it was a prescription or people getting somebody else's blood test
same sort of problem that happens sometimes is these some of these uh like aids tests and such
uh i don't remember what they call it sort of like a positive negatives or some some kind of word they use when a uh you get a uh a positive indication of drugs
but there's not really there weren't really any there
uh every now and then there's an error
and people are really upset about that when it comes to their rights and their rights being violated
i i work here at texas instruments
so uh we we do a let me think do we yeah everyone coming in
everyone coming in uh goes through the drug
and they talk about it as a you know as as better for the country and better for the working conditions
so if they uh they test for drugs
i i'm i can't even remember if we do random sampling anymore
but i don't know if once your in they continue to do it
but i guess you're always on
i not very long ago worked for wal-mart and about a year and a half ago they instituted a uh
it's it's not a random through the s-
but i think the big problem though is is they send these
so your big beef with it is the uh
is is it's a good idea
but like you said the drug testing procedures need to be defined a little better
i i i tend to agree with you david
my brother uh brother used to work for wal-mart
and then i don't know if he still does or what because i don't know if sam's is actually part of it
good company uh
you all uh have some
and you have a have a little taken out of your check each each payday to put against uh uh stock portfolio
uh not portfolio just you know against wal-mart stock
but uh you can build a pretty fair amount of stock after a while
that's good good new- good deal
well uh how long were we s-
uh you're supposed to get five minutes
uh think what else i can say about that uh
uh do you have any idea uh
you were you were tested for drugs as you got into t as as you got into t i
uh everyone coming in gets goes through the drug test
uh now uh were you asked to wait before starting to work until the drug test came through
well let me think about that
it was after i w- i had already been hired uh
seems to me i remember that uh i was hired came in and went through some orientation
and i thought i
boy i can't remember
so it's hard for me to remember where i was when all that happened
but uh i guess just like other companies other friends i've been hearing about that have been moving around
it's it's before
so i'm sure that happened to me too
what what about oh
they just instituted it there at wal-mart so
they they it was after i was already working there
and they weren't testing any of those who were already working
now then you heard the question
what what do you like to do for yourself in car automobile repairs
well i'll tell you i used to do a lot more repairs when cars were easy to work on than i do now
i do uh i do the easy stuff now
uh and then what some people would consider a little more difficult i i'll change spark plugs
and i'll change you know points and you you know do air filters that kind of stuff
but uh i can't do as much as i used to
um i used to do a whole lot more but not any more
or are you so busy you don't have time to do it
well that's part of it yeah
well being a female and being alone you i don't do anything but put gasoline
but uh have you had any major repairs recently
well um on this car i've got now no
but i had a van before
and it was only two years old
and it had transmission go out on it
but fortunately that was covered under the warranty
well you should be feel very fortunate
i had to have a transmission replaced in an eighty-six automobile and i'll declare that's an expensive
oh it just
well i have a very comfortable car and i have a health problem that i need a large comfortable car
so um anyway i have a new transmission
and i'm sure that any of them would have cost al- or charged me almost the same amount
but it hurts it hurts real bad
oh i see
i had um
these people were recommended by a neighbor and you know that's the only thing
oh i see
so that means i have to depend on on trustworthy friends and that's
anyway it's fixed
and i pray that i get my thirteen hundred dollars out of it
it's going to run for a li- for a while yet
oh i know it
uh i i work for t i
i i work in the networking area
i have just retired from um the southwest medical center
yeah where there are a lot of people down there that could help me with my car
but they're all too busy
and that's find someone and pay them to do it
so i certainly hope you have a nice new year
i'm i'm planning on it
oh it can't be any worse than last year
oh it could be
but i don't much think so
i'm well we're starting out a new one
so let's make it a good one
all right well i enjoyed the conversation
all right thank you
or you know
sometimes um usually the reason i will turn it on is to hear the news
but i don't think of that every day even
um i think i get most of my current events
well i get them from everywhere
but i work um at a
and uh there's a
and so i often drop in on a break and and read it
and i keep the radio on quite a bit when i'm home
and then i i figure if there's big big news i'll hear it from my husband when he gets home or
someone else you know
now i also
and i ha- we have a news
you know we get the newspaper and uh um magazines an- anything
you know i'm
so i get
um you know i'm i'm really up on uh current affairs
i get you know the news and and everything
um well i'm not getting an-
i'm not getting any news magazines but um you know as as i said i do
it's uh it's easy to keep up on current event- you know on cert- you know especially when you um you know you get a paper every day
uh i don't know
i you know
and i don't know you know what what's i mean what are we supposed to uh compare it to
you know i uh
i mean i
uh you know they they're supposedly covering everything that happens
well i do feel like a little bit like
being from california and wanting to hear like
and i don't ever hear it in the news here
well uh sometimes it's such a
you know it's it's so um slight you know like the tremors are so slight that they don't even bother putting it in the paper
but most of the ti- the times i find that even if there are you know they do have like tremors out there you know there'll be a small article in the paper about it
i sometimes feel like um the dallas paper and the dallas news um the top headlines are always a murder you know
that that's because there's a high crime rate
that's um that's been like that since they the first newspaper you know
you know but um i don't know
i i guess i'm satisfied
i don't uh
i mean what basis you know of comparison do we have really
we don't get a you know
i mean we we can get news
you know i mean there's even the c n n channel where we can get world news twenty-four hours a day
it's all so negative you know
well we have to keep talking i guess
it's just whenever we're um
oh is it really
i don't i don't uh
we're sup- i guess we're supposed to wait
you know like one uh well
was it last week we were supposed to talk about gardening uh
i i i mixed it made the call
and it happened to be my friend who lives
and it was really
i mean but you know we don't really do any gardening
so like that took like a minute and then we just talked about you know whatever i mean
you know i mean some topics
really now you know now this topic this is i mean
and then you know if it's uh if they're satisfied
and that's about it really
well i guess i can just say i it bothers me that i hear a lot about um you know on the news that
well it seems like i don't know some things are sensationalized or some things are um
you know you'll hear one report
and then you'll hear that it you know they didn't um
so what are your favorite shows
um i like watching colombo and um matlock and oh really
that was that was pretty good
i like uh i like northern exposure and uh home improvement
oh i well i haven't seen either of those
um i also like to watch star trek
but it's on so late here that i don't always get to see it
and they're you know already out with number six by now
but so i haven't seen any of the movies yet
oh you haven't seen any of them
oh well they're good
they're uh they're getting rid of the old cast for the movies though
is there one you prefer better the older one or the youn- the newer one
but i like i like the older ones because at that time you know they were really futuristic you know
and the newer ones are i guess the newer ones are real
but i like i like both of them
i mean he almost hates the new ones
because he he thinks the newer ones is like a soap opera and the other one isn't or something
oh i think
but but it's
but that's true
i mean you you learn more about the characters and stuff
but that's the way all shows are now
well let's see
um i like to watch colombo because it's like a mystery thing
but colombo is way tricky
well did you see the one
or is this is there a series on
there's like one on
well we see it thursdays at seven
and it was
this last time it was about this um movie director
see that was a rerun
oh i guess i nev-
i wondered if that's see i don't know if that's a the movie of the week or or what
but it seems like there's only about four or five different ones
and then then they keep showing them over and over
oh i guess i've i haven't seen it before
and he had that gal killed
but um there's no never anything good on saturdays though
well star trek's on at five
but i'm never home
there's something i watch something i watch on saturdays
and i can't remember what it is
now i used to watch twin peaks
they'll say so and so from twin peaks or something you know
but it was it was a different type of show
oh did they end the whole series
they didn't they only did it for i think two years
but it's all over now
oh another show i like to watch is mash
so how's your products been
um i really haven't had uh too many problems
uh seems to me that everything that i buy goes bad just after the warranty runs out
and uh i really don't have any recourse
so i had to call and have them all repaired and that
so you didn't get anything
even all the all the warranties were out
the warranty on the refrigerator uh
but the ice maker itself passed it's three years
and it was three years and two months
so we had to buy all those too
uh watch out
the only thing i've had problems with is um
i buy a lot of wood working equipment through the mail and i bought this paint stripper where they advertise
and when you get the product it ends up being toxic and all these warnings
but that's about the only thing i've had gone wrong
but i just uh
and the the ice maker was uh had to have a new pump
and the uh microwave had to have uh some kind of something i can't even pronounce
and they uh
so it was about almost three hundred dollars for all three of them
and they all went out at the same time
uh within two days of each other
or two days
and plus the place that i'd bought them all had gone out of business
so even if i i think even if i had uh had kept the warranty the service agreements were with the companies that that manufactured
but still they were through that retailer
so i don't know if i could have taken it to another retailer or not
but i didn't have to worry about all that because they weren't under warranty
so it was a call to the local appliance dealer who came out and fixed them all
the only other things that i've ever had trouble with uh
and the other two weren't
but i just
other than that you know t v and things like that i haven't ever had any trouble with
see i'm in the manufacturing
and make um automotive air bags the safety air bags
and i thin-
well it's it's changed a lot with the manufacturing environment
and so our testing is pretty thorough
do you do you test each individual one or do you just test
like if you've got ten you test one
and by the test results of the one you assume that the other nine are okay
um the tests that
well we test every one electrically
i think they test four or five a day actually exploding the air bags and but we do test after during the assembly project product um after we assemble each part of the inflator or what explodes the bag we check to make sure it's there after we install it
so each assembly process has an inspection right after it's done
and then we do electrical tests on them during the process
well that's something i've never had to use
it's never i've never been involved in an automobile accident
so luckily that's a product that i haven't had to test
but i think it's a great idea
well they do the all the testing that we have to do through the government
oh i'm sure they want to be thorough before they
but uh even
you know i don't mind spending the extra money on the car if you know even if they pass the savings the cost onto the consumer because it just seems like a real worthwhile thing
well jackie uh on taxes i i guess i would have to say that i that my opinion is that i do think american's are paying too much in taxes
uh what's your feeling about that
uh where you live do you have a state income tax and a sales tax both
in new hampshire we have uh uh no no what we call broad base taxes
uh we tax business uh eight percent
and we have what we call the five b s uh th- for our taxes booze uh butts cigarettes beds uh hotel room tax bellies a meal tax and bets gambling
so uh we do have a very low tax rate
but you know combined with the federal income tax i think that american's generally do pay too much in taxes
i i agree
and i think it's about the time of the year when you just start getting
well if you do get money back from
i'm still a student so uh i only work part time
so i i get a check back
well that's nice
so from from taxes
nice nice to get a refund
do you think that uh for whatever taxes we do pay that uh we are getting value for it
uh my my opinion of taxes is that we just send money to washington or to the state
and they say they are going to send some back
it's like giving yourself a tra- it's like one arm giving the other a transfusion
uh it it really uh
i should say one arm giving another arm a transfusion through a leaky tube because right because uh there's an old saying in amongst taxes and politicians that there's a fly paper effect
and that is that money tends to stick where it lands first
and when you send it to washington or send it to your state capitol uh a lot of it stays there and not that much comes back to you
i mean there's plans there
and now that they are voting and people you know getting into drug and that stuff
and uh but
and then you know they try to raise taxes more
and i don't what happens with
you know but taxes get raise
so i don't know
i'm not really into politics uh i don't really understand it but it's just you know
well it does it it does seem that the more taxes that are raised the more the politicians spend
uh it's almost like they will spend as much as the they're allowed to collect you know
uh there is an interesting proposal that's been going around now for a few years of having a flat tax uh ten percent or thirteen percent
i mean you would take your income tax
i mean you would take you total salary those who made under a certain amount wouldn't owe any taxes
and then there would be a set amount for however many people you know dependent you have
and you would just pay a flat tax no exemptions no deductions or anything else after you know after you figure up who's in your family
and that would eliminate a lot of the bureaucracy in the i r s
and it would eliminate all these loop holes that the fat cats get away with
i i'd like to see something like that
and it would put a you know a lot of the tax attorneys our of business
and i am sure they will fight it tooth and nail
but i really think a flat tax would be a lot fairer for all americans
i mean it doesn't seem right that somebody that makes twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars pays four or five thousand dollars in taxes while somebody that makes two hundred and fifty thousand dollars might pay nothing in taxes
i think your taxes in wisconsin are pretty high i i if i am not mistaken aren't they i mean for your state
what is do you know what your state income tax rate is
um no i i have no idea
just you just pay it huh
you're like you're like my daughter who is in college down in massachusetts
and uh she works as a waitress
and she is attending college full time also and she sends her taxes to me
and i figure them up
um well actually usually uh in the mornings i am getting ready to either go to work uh
uh n b c
so i really don't have much time to like read the newspapers and stuff so i get a lot of stuff through the grapevine which is really isn't too great sometimes
i usually tend to just you know rely on you know t v uh again you know just through the grapevine just just to know like you know like what today's stories are
and i usually like go out an buy a newspaper if you know i'm interested in any particular one
do you think that t v is uh pretty accurate
i mean sometimes do you think it gets pretty commercialized
well what i really don't like about t v especially local news as compared to like national news is just uh it seems it seems like everything is very spoon feed
and you know it's it's more like the news shows is now is now you know an entertainment show like a sitcom or like the news because they would always have like the wonderful investigative reports you know is you're kids bus driver smoking crack
on the way to school you know
they mainly go with like popular topics just not like basic news
also also i have the observation of uh with the press is that like any any stories that i had any first hand knowledge of that i see in the press you know which only happened like ten times in my life you know first thing you know for anything of you know or anything that actually had had more than just a blurb about it that the press has managed to just mess up some aspect of the story it's something wrong
they're looks like they're going more for ratings
i think you know the
i am from a small town too here in texas and so that then like local news is really who grew the biggest tomato
well in uh in dallas i don't know if you heard about the killing where the guy drove into luby's
and the story was uh
was that like he started shooting people people in this cafeteria or something
and the news covered it right you know hours after it happened
and they were taping people who were crying who
and then like three days later this uh local news station was using as as their promo to promote themselves
i just thought that was really that's kind of cold
you know uh channel x gives you the best coverage
you know we were on the scene with our team players
and it was just
they were showing like these dead people and they were showing people crying i mean just taking advantage of you know
they are trying to get the you know most emotional response for
but just the play on people's emotions
i mean somewhere there's it's lost a lot of the quality that they use to have like in walter cronkite that if you know and everything
you know i've pretty much stopped watching local news totally you know uh
uh i fou- i found it very one sided
uh you know it it just seemed to lack any sort of debate
uh you know not saying that we shou- that we actually should have been there or shouldn't have been there
but it just seemed like you know
they kept just showing you know how great we were doing
and it never really showed what actually the damage that really happened that's a lot of times like the news coverage showed all the you know the guys who didn't get hurt coming home and all the big parties and they kind of you know
if they were going to show that why didn't they show the guys who you know got really hurt and everything
and i really think that you know in the involvement that the press states you know that the the military basically sets the press
think about uh taxes
well i think they're a necessary evil
uh i wish the government would operate on the same premise that uh businesses operate on
and that is uh you you don't spend more than you than you bring in
i think that the general idea is to s- you know spend uh during a time of recession that you know for the deficit spending to help pick up the economy
but they're running under the assump-
you know the way they're running it now they're h- you know running it under a deficit spending you know while we're not under a recession
so there's never any surplus coming in to counter the deficit that we're running
so that's kind of a basic thing of economics i guess
uh uh roads are very expensive uh commodity and so is uh utilities they supply and police and fire department uh
you know they need to make a living
but uh then again uh it's the hard to justify with all the wastefulness of money that the government spends on all levels of of uh government including municipalities as well as state and federal governments
i'm i'm a student right now
and i don't make a whole lot of money
and so i i kind of don't pay a proportionate amount of taxes to i guess uh compared to what i get because i you know all my my education is state sponsored
and uh my education all up through high school and stuff
so i guess i'm kind of in debt i i suppose because i don't you know been paying taxes all that all that long
my parents i guess h- h- however have contributed to that you know for the education side of it and everything
but uh i usually end up getting money back
uh you're very fortunate
uh we pay in a substantial amount uh
we do think that uh sometimes uh we have a reverse of a regressive tax a progressive tax
and progressive tax i think uh does not give people incentive to make more money
and what i mean by that the more income you make the more tax you pay
and uh that percentage ought to be an equitable amount
uh last year when they passed the tax laws for the uh nineteen ninety ninety-one whatever nineteen ninety-one uh i added up all the taxes that we were going to pay on all these different specific luxury items and travel expenses and everything else
and i totaled them all up
and basically uh we were going to be paying seventy or eighty percent tax
now that was the assumption that you spent that same dollar for every for every item on there even though there's uh taxes on different things
but you know there's f- there's a lot of taxes you pay that you're not even aware of that you're paying uh
there's a lot yeah lot of hidden taxes
you pay gasoline taxes every time you pump something into your your tank
the the the income tax is a lot more visible portion of the taxes you pay i guess
but you probably pay more percentage wise in other taxes
one of the democratic candidates had a proposal for doing away with all the the tax codes they have now and implementing a f- i think a flat percentage something like that
if you impl- implemented a flat percentage it would encourage people uh to make more money
and the what people need to understand in my opinion now this is just my opinion okay uh is that businesses create jobs and jobs create income and income pays taxes
and so if they penalize businesses business people are smart enough to say here's my break point i'm not going to work any harder and make any more or create any more jobs
that's because until like eight
up until like eighty-five or something was the
well actually uh
i i don't think i'm in the uh majority of in in texas
uh i wouldn't say that
when i was younger i thought it was uh
but um uh maybe slowly changing my opinion
but i'm beginning to believe this is less civilized society than i thought
she has very very black and white
there's no gray in her opinions you know
she she probably would agree more with you
but but i don't know
i've never had a a punishment or a a crime like a murder touch my immediate family but i still feel very strongly that capital punishment is a good way to to punish especially criminals who seem to have absolutely no remorse for what they've done
and we see that more and more
like in our state right now there's a fourteen year old boy who raped and then killed a seven year old girl you know that's fourteen years old
i certainly don't uh advocate turning people like that loose
i'm not sure executing them uh does anymore than keeping them in jail
that that's a factor
i mean i work and i pay my taxes
and i lived out in texas for a little while
and that's a pretty heavy state compared to georgia
i mean you guys are are a lot more uh for to each his own even than we are in georgia
but even in georgia that's the attitude for the most part
but when i've got to work to pay my dues and your dues
but it's but i think it's relatively unimportant compared to what's the most effective way of
and i guess i would like
the european countries certainly uh none of them have capital punishment
and they they don't have a crime problem either
and i don't believe they do in germany or italy either
and they don't have the crime problems we do
i guess what worries me about capital punishment is uh when i see people enthusiastic about it and uh uh sort of bloodthirsty i think it brings out the worst in the in the people who do the punishing
and the that that bothers me
i mean i i'd hate to be the person to pull the switch you know
i would never in a million years want that job but i do believe it's necessary
on the one hand i i guess i admire the person who has the guts to do it because i couldn't i couldn't stand behind a gun and shoot somebody for nothing
and i couldn't pull the switch
well actually i wha-
the other thing that bothers me is when it becomes a political issue because i don't really think it uh i don't really think it's a very important aspect of fighting crime or law and order or anything else
i think it just becomes a uh
so i would like for it to be settled once for all and uh get in the background while the more important issues get discussed uh uh
now i'm i'm not so sure of that
i'm i i wouldn't vote against somebody just because it was for capital punishment and nor the other way around
what what's making you become more convinced that it might be a good way of punishing
uh i guess i'm i'm
i'm beginning to believe that some people are simply not rehabilitatable and uh that uh uh
costs and other factors justify uh uh executing people
maybe it's more a symbolic gesture that uh
and uh i've also never been a victim although i have some i have two friends whose wives were murdered
i mean what do you drive now
uh i have a ford pickup
and uh the family car is a uh a dodge caravan
and uh because we have three kids and they're under thirteen
so uh they sort of fit our requirement
i have a one of those uh pickups with the uh seat with a seat in the back
and so they just fit in there
right now i can right now i can throw them all in the back when we have room
and uh and since i do a lot of projects i throw things in the back
and i kind of like having a pickup truck
actually i think of it as a
and i don't care about comfort
so i'm pretty happy
i wanted a truck that i i wanted something that i could throw people in the back too
so i got a four runner
so i wouldn't hesitate to get another one
i i never buy new
so i wouldn't hesitate to get another used truck
i don't i don't need to pay for the glitz
i'll let somebody else uh have the showroom shine
and i'll pay for the rest of it
and uh the van we're sor-
we might go again on a on a van
we we could probably do with a a something just a little bit larger than a compact in a sedan next time
we have to we we'll have to face it in a couple of years
i i guess we had a small toyota wagon
and uh th- it certainly had that
i i got a like i say i got one of those toyota four runners and uh it pretty much does everything i need it to
i mean it it'll tow three thousand pounds
so i can tow everything
and uh it's real reliable
i i mean i've had it for almost four years now
and up until oh say two weeks ago it had never had anything
and then of course two weeks ago
but it blew a head gasket
uh i caught it real early
at how at how many miles
uh oh ninety-seven thousand
so it's not real early
i smell i smelled the uh i smelled the coolant
saw it was saw where it was coming from
well that was
and that was it
because i d- i have that
and then i have a a kawasaki motorcycle
which is actually the usually my preferred mode of transportation if i can take it and it's not raining
it it's a
i have one colleague that uh commutes to work on one when it's not raining
and uh uh he's a
i don't think it's much of a sport for him i guess uh
but i bet you he really enjoys riding it
so you know yo-
and i go out twice a week on the bike so
i i mean the only thing i think i might get a new car or not necessarily a new car but a another car
uh i would consider going to a a non to a normal pickup rather than a a covered pickup like the one i've got just because there's a lot of times i wished i had ju- just an open bed to throw stuff in
i'm sure i'm sure that that's very
i mean you got one
it's that's really convenient to be able to throw that sort of stuff in the back
if i only had some place that i could store the uh camper top i would have it off most of the time
i really leave it on there just for just to have it out of the way because you put it on the ground it gets dirty
but uh they're solid
uh trucks are built uh i mean
uh even though you know the jap the little jap trucks are are good there too
but so are the
i think they i think the fords tend to last a little longer
i i kind of like mine
so mine's a ford
a friend of mine just bought bought like a year ago it it's a really nice truck
i mean i don't like dodges at all
but one of the dodges they have out now has a uh the cummins turbo diesel on it
oh i heard about that
oh it's beautiful
that thing that thing will last forever i mean
that that's a serious truck
that thing's uh
i i know a contractor who just got one of those
and uh but uh that's about the the uh the extent of it
but but but when
i really am a- am concerned about is that uh so many of these child care places are are coming under uh uh you know investigation for for uh you know child molestation
and i and i and i'm saying to myself well you know y- you dump your your your little turnip off to uh you know this child care place
and they don't pay very much
and w- why why would they be interested in in your little turnip unless you know one of the motivations in the hidden agenda is well that's somebody to molest you know
and uh that's a terrible kind of thing
and i don't think my children have ever been subject to that
but my wife didn't work
and so we really didn't have that much exposure to it
well i am a working mother
and my children since i uh since they were very young
i've had various um different alternatives child care arrangements
and like most working mothers
i personally feel uh in our particular situation i'm a much better mother when i work out of the home
and my kids i think are very very secure well raised children
so i i i e-
you know it is a problem
and but as you pointed out i i think the real problem is the low pay child facilities
and that is sometimes what some women who have to work that is all they can afford
when our children were very young we had a pay a live in paid baby-sitter that was wonderful
and then as they got older they went to uh i preferred to call them schools
and they were really all day preschools
and they were wonderful
and i think they got exposed to a lot of neat things
oh well that's interesting
but we did we really truly did pay a fortune
i mean we were paying
oh my god
well you must have a just one hero ace professional job to support something like that
oh well yeah
i'm a physician uh and as is my husband
and and i felt uh very good about working
i'm a pediatrician actually
so uh but i think there are some wonderful child care opportunities out there for children
but and we all know the kind of things that you're supposed to look for i think
well not not all of us
you know what the kind of things you're supposed to look for
oh well i think it's real important that you have a place that first of all parents have a lot of input into and that they're always welcome and that they have a lot of activities where parents come in during the day and that at any time you can drop in
and we had a really wonderful arrangement uh
i'm with the university actually and they had a wonderful uh program that started at age three
and it was about a block away from the hospital where i work
and so many times at lunchtime i would go over and visit the children and eat with them and see what they were doing
and they had wonderful
and just they had a four to one uh teacher student ratio
so that that sort of an
most of the teachers had degrees uh
it was incredible actually
but it was good
i mean it was it
and they were in special programs
and each one was a little over two hundred a week
and then in addition i paid a little bit extra
but the kids were
i mean they really had some great opportunities
but tha- what you were alluding to earlier is you know women who work for minimal wage an- and and really have t- feel they have to put their children
sometimes they do put them in uh fairly low paying sit- situations
you know they could
and you know that's a good starting wage
but boy three hundred dollars a week doesn't go very far on child care
even that that really i think i don't
so it's been a little while since i've looked into actually daycare centers
but they are you know the good ones do cost maybe sixty dollars a week since
i mean we used
but mi- mine are twenty-two twenty-three and twenty-seven
so you know that
well you know but you made the comment earlier why would someone be interested in children
i mean it has been a real uh
th- there have been some good entrepreneurial
and i think i think they have captured a certain market
but then there are baby-sitting groups
um let's see
um actually i wore corduroy shorts with a white blouse um and flat shoes
so can you dress pretty casually
um on occasion on occasion
um i do vary
um you know i wear suits
um how about you
well i um run a business out of my home
so i tend to get up in the morning put on
um you know there's real no no real dress code where i work
um you see people wearing you know all different attire
i um don't like to wear heels that really tires me out
so i predominantly wear flat shoes
um you know in the winter i wear sweaters
in summer i you know i like one piece dresses short sleeves things like that
i've recently um tried to update my wardrobe trying to put suits together that i can interchange the
i can only have a a limited wardrobe since i'm only
um but still it gives it some variety
i mean at home i predominantly wear
well they're um you know they're like ber-
they're like black corduroy ber- bermuda shorts
and sometimes i wear a blazer with them
and i get really a lot of compliments on them
um where i work is predominantly male
so you know they
their attire is always the same you know suits or slacks
you know jeans whatever
and um but i'm really the only woman i guess at work that does that
but seems to work for me
in fact i just bought i i just got a new outfit as a gift that um
you know th-
so i think that'll be good for work too
i guess down here uh
so my wardrobe has changed quite a bit
um we moved from colorado where
and i have a closet full of sweaters
well see i live in virginia
oh that's interesting
you know like right now today was in about you know the fifties
but um you know i i do wear a lot of sweaters and things like sweater dresses
today was uh definitely a shorts day around here
we're still pretty much you know in winter as far as that goes here
this is pretty un- unseasonal
but uh at least we
you know it it it feels good
it gets uh
what now uh what particularly particularly what kind of music do you like
well i mostly listen to popular music
i uh listen to it all the time in in my car
so i i tend to be one of those people who switches stations a lot because i don't like commercials
uh i find myself listening to popular music
and uh quite honestly i i have some little children
and i unfortunately found myself listening to a lot of nursery rhyme music here lately
but that's not by my choice
i i do i do listen to a lot of
you know i do i switch the stations a lot because i don't have a cassette player in my car
um um uh-huh
uh uh however i i do i do like a lot of different forms of music
so i switch quite often
um i think i like
i i'm really particular about the type of music that i listen to
but the uh
i think i like a lot i like a little bit of a lot of different types of music
you know i i i like music that is that i feel
but if if it's not then i won't
i i really don't
well i i don't really have anything against rap music
the one thing i do object to about rap music is is when it becomes militant
or if it's uh violence oriented
i i have strong objections to that
um actually i listen to
one time i remember this was back when even uh
and uh it was about
the the piece of music the piece of music was about i think about forty or fifty years old
and it was incredible i mean the parallel you know between it and rap
and um you you listen a lot
if you if you hear a lot of old gospel uh uh especially well the black gospel
you know you will you know you can really pick it up i mean
a lot of times you'll hear songs that you know they're not original
and uh sounds it sounds so much different
and yet i i have a much younger sister who listens to a lot of rap music
and uh she thinks its pretty funny how often i know all of the words to songs that she's listening to
they they do they do copy versions they do cover versions of of you know like standards i guess you could call it
i guess there was even a a bit of ruckus caused by the m c hammer who's really you know
seems to be the hot one of of today
he used um wild thing
do you remember that that song
he used um
well ma- maybe it wasn't that one
because it was a living it was a living person that i'm i'm thinking of that um that said you know hey that those are my words
and uh i guess that they because they hadn't originally gotten um permission
and he he since then has has amended that and paid them his royalties every time the the song goes on
it may have it may have been somebody else because i think i think that even jimi hendrix did it
you know come to think of it i think that was a cover version of like a john lee hooker song or something
i mean it was just like
i i can't think
i mean i i
there are a lot there are so many different songs
i mean like the whole thing about cover versions a lot of times i mean i've heard some songs that that i just thought were horrendous cover versions of
i'm like you know i i don't want to listen to this
you know oh that was really great
that was a you know a really good piece of work
and then when you hear the cover it's like you know god what are they doing
and then the cover version i think i mean i thought was absolutely it was pitiful
i i remember seeing the video of it on m t v
and i thought it was hideous
but you know whatever became of peter frampton
i mean there was nothing
i me- there was no reason for him to really come into you know great stardom or anything
i think i think it
i remember i saw him in a huge stadium in uh philadelphia
i've i graduated back in seventy-nine
um um uh-huh
but but i've really
i i loved
i mean i was i was really into the album oriented music even then
so i was really familiar with a lot with a lot of of the a o r type music
um the album oriented like the uh james taylor
and the uh the beatles
and you know i mean a lot of people they go they're better than the beatles
and i'm like you know
i mean the comparison made between new kids on the block with the beatles
you know well i guess i can just humor them you know
i guess our age is showing when we we think that
but well you know i i i've liked a lot of the new music
i think um
i saw some promise you know with with a lot of the new wave when it when it came out uh
and then um i don't know
music is kind of in a weird it's in a very weird position right now
i mean i like you know things like to hear you know what they call world music which is you know using all these natural forms of music
well you know really that's not world music
but what what paul simon's doing i think is is is great because he's you know i think i think that using i guess what they call it is eclectic you know
drawing from a lot of different sources and making you know a synthesis of a new type of music um
well world music is um
a lot of the a lot of where they where they make music that they adapt to a to another kind of to another type of listener
uh for example let's say you're taking like an original brazilian form of music and with a certain style
and then you try to make it a little bit more listenable for let's say another audience let's say a north american
and then when they hear it it it's a really it's another form of music and
you know sort of um trying to draw out the best sources
the the best of every type of music
because i mean there are some i mean
i i li-
there are some you know types of heavy metal that i really like
but but i wouldn't i wouldn't say that i i completely like heavy metal
i i think
you know and it's the same way with
you know world music takes the forms that have really been um
you know the best example or you know the cream of the crop i guess you could say
and then and then taking those those qualities and then applying in the styles that are really um that are extremely enjoyable and then taking
so then it becomes a kind of music of of it's own so to speak
i mean when you listen to it it's um uh
so you know well a lot of the stuff you hear coming from south africa now and from west africa that's considered world music because it's not particularly using certain types of folk styles
but they're they're trying to make it somewhat more modern
i i i
a good another good example was i heard miles davis
and miles davis worked with robbie shoncar
if you can believe it i mean
and then he's playing with robbie shoncar
who's a very good he's a very good arranger
uh arrangement to uh
but i mean when i heard his album i heard it and it was just incredible
i i listened
and i heard
you know you hear this guitar
and then you hear the muted trumpet
and you never would think that they that they can actually play together
well um let's see
i i think there's a lot of people that don't vote because they don't really think their their uh opinion is going to be heard
and you know there's such a small voice and such a huge number of people in the united states
and that you know
their yo- votes not going to make that much difference
and whether you vote for one person or the other person the issues is what you know what you believe in
and that person is going to have a lot of uh
so it would be really difficult to have that one pers- perfect person that believed exactly what you believed
you know a lot of people uh uh
i think the that it ends up the people that uh vote every time uh elections come around are more the the polly uh the party type followers the guys that uh you know follow the party lines you know
they you know just go in
and if they're republican they vo- vote republican every year you know
and uh the people that are independent you know are the ones that don't uh don't really uh show up every year because they can't seem to to decide which are the good aspects and which are the bad aspects of a candidate
it was back when anderson was running i was hoping that things would change and he'd actually get elected and party politics would start going down the tubes
there's uh a lot of extremes on the parties too with the you know the real uh far side of the democrats
they're real liberal now and to where probably fifty or a hundred years ago um the democrat party being liberal like they are now you know would never be thought of
it would be the other way that the republicans were real liberal minded as far as like uh moral standings and those kinds of things
and then and then people always get upset about it too because you know every year the the the politicians are the ones that are usually pushing for more people to vote
they they each think that uh if more people vote they'll get more votes huh
i'm always amazed at that that each candidate thinks it's going to be the people that come out that will vote for him you know
that's that's true
i think in uh the texas governor elections i think more people turned out to vote against somebody than for somebody this time
well that uh
i know that there's certain issues that can really motivate people because we live in a pr- pr- predominately catholic type area
and when things start uh
when when abortion comes on the issues and people just get all insp- inspired you know
and uh still on the other hand we're also uh
but uh uh down in d c where where things are a little bit different uh you know it's it's women's rights and the and that sort of movement
and so it's uh quite the opposite
so elections start getting very uh
that's true that the different places in america that uh you know different issues would be a lot more important than say in another place
i can understand why why some of the the rural areas the voter turnout isn't as much because it does seem sometimes like the lobbyists in d c are like controlling things for the the midwest
and uh it doesn't matter who they put in office they're going to fall subject to uh the pressure that the lobbyists can put
and it's uh real true that uh you know they'll say one thing
and then once they do get elected they don't have the power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they promised you know beforehand
you know maybe it just wasn't possible at all in the first place you know like the no new taxes thing
you know that's uh
well i don't think he's going to have to worry about that next year
that really uh
so they won't even bother turning out
uh that's true
they'll just say oh well you know the republicans have this election
well that's what they they keep saying that it seems like people with old-fashioned values are the ones that aren't turning out at the at the booths
they they say that these older voters that uh you know they they feel like the kids are running the the country
so they they don't come out turn out to vote
and they're the ones that uh you know really know what's going on have the experience and seen you know how politicians can you know screwup or what ever
but i know my grandmother hasn't voted in years
you know neither has mine as a matter of fact
they i think they look at it as well everybody the majority of the people think this way when that's not necessarily true
because you know that's what the media says
well the majority believes this way
so uh they don't even bother turning out to vote to express their uh opinions
so that's that's true
wonder if they're going to take into account this computerized conversation that there's little children you know bouncing in your knee
and they went off
but anyway that's
i guess we've uh talked long enough
uh washington d c
i'm in from
well i figured with texas instruments they'd probably have a few uh texans on the line now and then
do do you work for t i in any way
how did you how did they get you
um they they went through engineering companies
and uh we're communications
i i work in a communications company
so we saw it on the uh t news one day
and i thought wow that might be interesting
they called me at uh ten o'clock one night
so maybe i'll figure it out
but anyway it was nice to talk to you and uh sort of meet you
well if your ever in uh d c come look up wayne sherman you'll say oh yeah talked to that guy
i'm i'm kyle hunt
too if you ever come to to dallas area
all right i'll talk to you later
the uh uh
you know there are so many ramifications to this entire thing of woman how women have changed
uh look at them
margaret thatcher was prime minister uh indira ghandi uh in india
so many uh women are heads of state
and i you know we we keep saying oh yes we feel some day a woman will be president
but uh i have some question whether or not they will ever really get around to that
i think we'll have a black president b- before we have a women president
and uh i don't know whether that's bad or good
i i i truly believe that that before that that we have to address the racial racial issues in the united states
um because it is so you know it's
uh oh i think we're we're supposed to hang up
well it wasn't the matter of wealth
well i'll talk to you later
uh what do you think about uh the idea of having volunteer service for everyone
uh and you know i mean
and i've talked with several
and i think they've gotten a lot out of it
well are you doing any kind of volunteer work now
but i have done uh red clo- cross work
and uh i've taught c p r training
what about when when would people do it when they finished high school
i think probably as soon as they finished high school it would be ideal because a lot of times i- if they go straight into college i think they're going in too quick
and i think there's a there's a real challenge there
there's also this this issue of of uh you know whether you're really ready
and i think it gives a different perspective
i i think if you've been out of school a year year and a half before you start to college you appreciate college more
the only complication is is is how do you fund something like this
there are uh some groups that have their children you know go away for a year
i think the mormon church has sends out missionaries that
and the parents fund them for the whole year year and a half that they're gone
that's uh it's interesting
it gets them away from home and and gets them to do something useful
although the kids today though it it seems that almost that their concern for money
i we were doing some investigating colleges and said the kids are much more interested today in in trying to find a job study something that will give them a job as opposed to be curious be curious
if there was if there was mandatory you could choose the option of either a mandatory military service or voluntary
in in israel the even the women are are required to to be in the military for a certain period of time
uh i was in the military
and i personally feel if if they have draf- the draft that they should draft women as quickly as they do the men
well but the the issue of of of which
what what would what would you find what would you have them do
you know there are a lot of people around with
or say say the volunteer
say that say that it was mandatory
well i i i think that they ought to have something for the the unemployed in a voluntary field like the uh
i don't know if you know remember about the w p a
i mean you know uh it's not the best thing in the world
but uh it gave them something to do
well it seems that there's some things like the uh the programs at least just go around and and and clean up streets and and and pick up trash and even aluminum cans and some of these kinds of things
or go into the the more depressed areas and help repair the houses
in fact we we helped with uh oh help to help humanities
and that was a that was a good experience
but you take the kids out
uh we've been doing this three or four minutes
i think that uh
so well it was good talking to you betty
uh and christian literature
uh i've kind of
i used to read a lot of uh novels
but it seems as though if you really want to set a t- side time to read the bible and you work and and whatever uh that pretty well takes up your time for reading
and i i been praying that god would put a desire to read the bible
and he really has
uh a lot of times i do just read magazines and stuff like that for you know because i don't have a lot of time
but when i do get to sit down and and read i like to read the bible
and i like to read
and uh i like to read you know bi-
i have bible storybooks so i like reading those to her
and she really enjoys those
so that's good
and it and it's kind of short because we don't woe don't have a lot of time
to to read
so it's real enjoyable
uh this present darkness and uh uh i forget the t- the other
well he uh he's also written a lot of children
and they're all spiritually
because uh i love to read his his uh children's books just
well that's good
oh they're good
and it's like uh uh usually about a family of uh archaeologists and the spiritual fights that they get into
like uh uh digging in old ruins
and running across like uh the old gods and things
oh that sounds pretty neat
oh i'll have to look for those
and it also teaches them spiritual warfare you know
well that's neat
my daughter has precious moments collection and i like that because it's a it's real easy to uh follow for her
you know uh gosh if if i read straight out of the bible to her she'd
well it's hard for me
it is it is real hard to to follow and understand
and uh i've got a bible that uh has a little bit of a uh
and it helps explain who people are
that's that's about the hardest thing is who's related to who
and especially it's hard to keep your interest in those begats
but but it is good reading
and it's good for us
but then on the other extreme i like to read uh uh i guess ho- i don't know horror steven king type books
and i i like that
and ooh they just they're just so suspenseful
uh there's another guy
oh what can
you would well
you know when you're recording you can't re- remem-
uh oh dean uh kratz or kranz
and he he writes the same thing though
uh his last name ends in a z i know that
oh i think i know who you're talking about
uh i've seen
and i think i've seen his books in there
but they're real
did you ever read the uh uh oh
that oh that long thing
and that seems like all of his books have kind of come from that i mean
you know that
and i loved the shining
that was that was my favorite
oh those hedges when they started moving
he just brings stuff alive you know
and that was a pretty scary movie too
but they did give it you know do it justice
but uh most of the time they don't with when follow books very well
i liked uh i also liked uh cujo
and then uh
it was uh
dead dead zone
and then he has some under uh another name
or s- uh
uh i think his name was bachman
ooh i wish i could do that
oh i know it
and i have gone back
and after i i graduated i read some of the old classics that i just bluffed my way through and have found that i enjoy them quite a bit too uh
i love old good old
you know the l-
it's like it's english
but it's not the same english they speak today
so it's kind of hard to keep you know at it
but their worthwhile
that's that was one of my favorite subjects in school was uh literature
i used to love those old good good old books
i liked uh
gosh why can't i think of their names
the one that wrote uh wuthering heights
uh wasn't that jane ehre
uh well you know who i'm talking about
those are good old good old books and classics
because they'll take a classic and and uh televise it you know put it into a viewing format
i know it's it's really hard for me
i work two jobs and uh have my daughter and teach sunday school and go to school myself
well i can imagine
so it's it's hard for me to sit down and read
but when i do i just just love it
well i think we've accomplished five minutes
well what is your view do you consider the soviet union a threat
it it takes awhile to to get used to something
you know if if they have completely chain-
on the place has completely turned that much around to where they're not you know not what they used to be
it's it's hard to to know anymore if it's a a threat one way or another because uh it used to be s- so f- much in the past that whatever the top said the rest fell you know rank and file in behind it
and now that with gorbachev is introducing more i guess freedoms or expressions of freedom it doesn't look as though you know everybody's following the same pattern
the people who are you know the staunch military conservative people
you never know well gorbachev's future is like whereas whereas in the past it was seen as you know whoever was the head of the the communist party was seen as you know untouchable
the thing that keeps happening is happening so fast and so uh dramatic that you almost think now wait a minute you know we're getting stuck into something here you know
if if somebody's about to to clobber you the first thing they do is sort of say well you know we're we're ashamed we're not going to do that anymore
but i i
you know the evidence is that uh you know he's he's let some some stuff go you know the east german situation
you know if i'd have been asleep for five years
and read it in a book i said no no no that didn't couldn't have happened that way
well it's amazing just because of the drain that's been on you know both economies that our economy is of course been able to uh withstand that a little better
but uh the russian economy
they you know they
but i heard it one time
and finally you know who knows
maybe they're finally waking up and saying you know we can't afford this
uh the u s isn't the threat that we've always made them out to be
you know even if they're saying that beneath the doors
but it's hard to thing that just one person can bring that much of a radical change in that short of period
even if it is you know the best thing in the long run it just steps on too many people's toes
i i think you know what i'd have to
i i gues- i guess to answer the question directly i'm still just a a little bit you know leery of the whole thing
what i haven't seen is the uh you know a great stepping back in the military
you know it's it's one thing you know to let us go ahead and sort of disarm
and you know i even had a thought once that the whole iraqi thing might have been just a a deal to go ahead and let us uh you know
expend some some military hardware
and uh uh that that may have been a a a kind of far out way of thinking about it i don't know
well it's interesting anymore the world's getting so small that it doesn't seem to tolerate anymore any kind of the expansionism
philosophy that that was here in
you know twenty years ago
uh but of course the people who have challenged that or tried to do on- have cor- have not been world powers
so it's easier for us to say you know to an iraq you know
uh you can't do this get back you know or we're going to force you
or or we can do something about it
whereas you know if the soviet union would have who knows what taking over mongolia or or something like that who is really will we have been more just rhetoric
uh rather than going in there officially or you know
physically and try to to remove them
well the the china situation you know the when it looked like that thing was was turning around
and all of a sudden it was like somebody in the in the red square or wherever said okay
and that's enough
and the tanks came in and
you know pretty much took care of that
and i think he's actually honestly trying to do some change
but i don't believe that he in this first pass around you know being the first one to really turn things around or attempt to is going to be allowed to get away with it either
well this would be like if somebody was elected president of the united states and suddenly took off toward you know just some pretty hard by the socialism
and uh you know the the reaction uh
you know the the economic
well the uh the social structure of the soviet union you know it it's it's coming apart at the seams
you know and i've heard people say well you know it's just like the american civil war will there be a union or not
you know there was no
as as we are seeing now with a lot of those
you know they uh nobody vo-
you know a lot
you know a lot of my friends have a taken us down the stance of you know these people are just trying to be free and trying to get away
and i'm thinking more of it from a nationalistic
you know if i'm a soviet and if part of you know south let's say south dakota wanted to succ- you know succeed am i going to stand for that
now i realize that the origins are are different and that we all joined under a common direction and a common bond to begin with
but i you know i
it's easy to believe that they were probably more forced into a pact than uh a volunteer or willingness to join
there there was the whole thing was put together you know by force
there's there's no no real question about that
and some of the countries that were forced in at th- later dates is the three baltic countries you know came in in the forties
and uh it's well it's not that they came in it's they were conquered by the germans
and then the russians even
so that's a
well that whole a
the whole i- idea if you look at the russian history and i guess all countries the way it used to be is the only way to truly protect your borders was to have a buffer
and that was the whole idea why they had so many buffers
and maybe you know more and more people are seeing oh countries hopefully are seeing that that buffer isn't going to help you
well i guess like
with uh israel is a perfect example
the reason they have the angolan heights and the the uh all their buffer area is between jordan and the the sinai and and lebanon was just as a buffer
but you know as you can see with the the scuds go right over there
there's there's very little that that binds you anymore in today's technology
and they're going to land in other places
you know that's going to be the safest place to be
well uh i i guess what they'd have to do to
you know in in the in you know i hope that what's happening is exactly the way it appears
you know some reason or other you know is uh it's kind of a strange thing we've been trying to make something like this happen for so long that when it finally happens you say
you know what's uh
but you wonder how well this thing
w- who was it boris yeltsin the guy that's running the uh or evidently was elected president of the soviet
which is i guess the uh the biggest
i get confused between all the which is the soviet provinces versus which are the the russian provinces
well in the center
but you got a the the great big area that's just was traditionally known as russia
and then all these little nationality groups
around it you know that were you know was there nineteen of them or or whatever
you know and these were all the soviet economists us you know they had some real fancy names for them
what i read when the uh lee- uh united nations was setup in in san francisco one of the first things the russians wanted to do was bring in each one of the uh of these you know republics
oh as a
so there would be there would be nineteen
and uh the united states said well that mean we get to bring in forty-eight you know
and uh that sort of
you know they backed down on that
i thought it was interesting that recently here the warsaw pact no longer exists as a militor- military force
but it's merely an economic now
well wonder if that
well i mean at
wh- uh w-
what do you get shot by something that's called a an economic force or what is called a military pact
you know it's all
but i wonder if it's still exists
although i've seen some evidence that you know the uh the russian soldiers are
the funny thing there is they're not particularly welcome back home because there's they're having housing shortages now
and and all the
what do you do with all these troops that have been taken care of by uh bulgaria and and czechoslovakia
and now all of a sudden they're going home
and somebody's got to pay for their
well that's what they're saying the whole problem you know with if we were to demilitarize europe
well that's not
what's going to happen to the economies that are no longer have a a million plus people in the indu- you know
well since you live close i don't know if you know um about what louisville is doing with recycling
or are you familiar with any of that
well i know that we have some relatives that live around like the area in there
you know i read you know
when they first started doing that in the paper and i read about that
and you know we separate everything out and then have to haul it up to a metco
you know which is a real pain
so if they would come up
recycle because we there is some bins like behind wal-mart that take some things
well now have they moved them behind wal-mart
because i finally asked because you know we had all of those milk cartons
and there was nowhere else to take them
and they had it in front of wal-mart
and i ask in wal-mart
and they said they moved it just behind
because to take it to a metco you have to take it when they're open you know
and so when that thing came up in wal-mart parking lot we thought oh this is great
and we started taking them up there
and then all the sudden it disappeared you know
and we're going oh no there goes our recycling place
well we pretty much do um plastic milk cartons and um um um newspapers
plastic milk cartons newspapers and cans and glass i guess is the four is really the four things that we do
like aluminum cans
and really that's about that's really about it
is there anything any place else that really takes anything other than that that you know of
well i guess um down in kind of in north dallas there is a place that will take almost anything
uh i don't we just don't have the room to store all that much you know
you know at first you know you
at first it was a real it was a real hassle
and i'm wondering are we really going to do this
but you kind of get i guess into a little routine you know where it becomes is automatic now to throw
you know so i just go you know
and i've just got three trash cans sitting in there
you know we just kind of dump things in each one if you know
oh they do too
and they're impossible to crush
i mean you can't get the down to any size you know
if you get four milk cartons and that fills up trash bag you know
so you know
and there was so many baby food jars
and so you know when i found out some places to take it
and um like um they also take some things at the flower mound dump behind the fire station there
and i know that they're going to use you know the money for that to build some kind of multipurpose field and that type of thing
oh that will be good
so you know if i'm not going to get the money for aluminum i would just assume give it to the city of flower mound
to do something with you know
and they won't raise our taxes
well i was kind of hoping with
you know do you work for t i
and you know we're recycling aluminum cans up here and uh just what you would buy out of the machines and drink here
and there was crushers out in all of the hallways you know
you know t i doesn't give them any money all everything is made from that
and they had talked about having a thing like one saturday a month you could come and drop your aluminum cans off from home you know
and i'm kind of like yeah
they would do that because at least somebody was getting the money out of it you know that was going to use it for good
well it was good to talk to you
well it was nice to talk to you
oh do they really
so what do you think about it
well i think we need to do more
i mean i know i need to do more
they have programs around where you can reach the uh
but i have a hard time of being able of separating you know having a place separating my trash
and get all the cans from the paper
and you know i just haven't gotten that dedicated yet
and we try to do a lot but there's still a lot more we can do
you know i don't recycle my newspapers myself
but i noticed in one of the sales catalogs this weekend they have a like a a clothes hamper kind of thing that you know you lay your string in then you put your papers in there tie them all up and bundle them up
so i figured i might get me one of those because we don't always read the newspaper
and then we just chuck it
well i don't i don't get the paper every day
but you know i get it on
i try to buy you know the early edition for the coupons you know the sunday edition
but then i just you know bundle it up and put it on the front you know the front walk ev- you know every monday or every other monday and have them pick that up
but that's the extent of what i've done
the problem is with a lot of it is you have to go you know it takes a while to drive to these places where you recycle it you know it's not always convenient to do it
see and here in lubbock everything's so close
i'm not exactly sure where the you know the can thing is
but you know sometimes it's just so
see i went out to payless cashways here a couple of days ago as a matter of fact and got me one of those little can crushers that i could put on the wall and then i put me a little five gallon bucket
and it's just outside the garage door so every time we drink a coke or whatever we crush the can and just drop it into the bucket
and it's actually metal it's not plastic
because those things i think would just snap you know
but payless cashways has them
and they're metal
and i don't know what affiliate of payless cashways you have up there
but it was only like seven dollars not too bad
i'd have to check into something like that because i mean we don't drink a whole lot of soda around here you know
but um you know occasionally we have some around
but you know for other kind of cans just to it'd probably only take aluminum cans like that don't they
so i don't know
you could probably just you know
you know it's you know it
sometimes even with the newspaper they say they'll only take certain types of paper you know
yeah they won't yeah they won't take any lint free paper
or see i work at t i
but that's just now come on board
you know we've been throwing paper out there away for years
and we're just now getting on board to recycling ever since this big earth day thing came out you know
you know i haven't
i i like it
you know it makes
i think it's good that you see these you know like boxes cereal
they're now starting to make them you know the packages out of recycled paper
and and i've bought you know i've bought greeting cards that are made out of recycled paper
and i think they're just fine
and what it is is a recycled paper bag and it's just got happy birthday printing on it and a cute little phrase inside
and it's just a paper bag you know and it's really cute
but i think we're doing better and better all the time
yeah i think we're getting becoming more conscious because we just can't stick everything in landfills any more
so but i think we're getting better at it i think there's quite a bit more we could do
but you're right sometimes it does seem like it's more trouble than what it would be worth
i just wish it was a little more conv- convenient to do
you know seems like you're so busy anyway
and then that's just one more thing to have to worry about
i think if you know the cities locally you know they'd get more programs going so that you could do that it'd make it a lot easier
well they'll get at it sooner
you know they have
and we just don't have any place to store those kind of cans
you know if we go out and pick up a bunch of cans from people sure they'll save them for us there's no problem there
but what do you do with them in the meantime
now i don't want a can a garage full of cans
you know people don't have room for that kind of stuff
they're just not they're not prepared for it
and in texas they're just get things like that
so you don't
you know the more trash you have laying around the more bugs you get
you know pick it up
well i need to get get better at it
well if we all try a little bit a little bit goes a long way
well thank you for calling
i i i assume you have kids
uh we have one
oh well she she doesn't have to worry about public schools yet
well my degree is in teaching
i uh thought i wanted to be a teacher
so but before i went through all of that i wanted to see how i was going to like it
and and they uh
in alabama where i came from they they allow you to substitute if you got a four year degree
so i went out and played substitute for a while and decided nope not for me
but i taught junior high
and i expected it to be a lot of trouble
but it wasn't that bad
and well they don't call it remedial reading these days
but but anyway at the time that's what i taught
but it it wasn't too bad
we we got long real well
well i i sometimes wonder if i didn't mess up
i started out wanting to teach ele- lower like primary and then top primary and thought well no i don't like this as much and ended up moving up and got up until about the sixth
and so that's what i got my certification in
but i had decided long before i was even married that i wanted to if possible teach my kids at home and not put them in the public schools
um and my reason for that was i don't like the uh what's the right word the varied inappropriate influences that you find so much in the public schools
well that's a nice way of putting it
you can find a lot of good public schools if you if you look real hard
but i don't think they could cover everything that you could teach
and too most people don't have that option
you know and plus it also depends on the district your in as i mean on the
uh accept for the private ones of course we're talking about public
i mean you you pulled stunts like that and you were down at the principal's office and uh usually bending over to get five of the best
um but now nowadays they can't even they can barely scold the children for something you know without getting sued
and the the um the crime is just escalated and the drugs and
even in the
well the thing that really did it for me i was subbing in a fifth grade class
and uh this kid comes to school with his lunch box
and inside this lunch box he he's got easily two i'd say two hundred to two hundred and fifty dollars in one dollar bills
and i asked him uh what are you doing with that
and he says my father gave it to me
and i didn't believe it for a minute
well i have
i i i've full-
i think i understood what the what the kid was doing he was a uh
well let's just say he was one of th- those types that you wouldn't doubt that he was selling something
but not a lot i could do about it
well we had the problem when i was in
with teaching um
and if we did have a a student come in and they were drunk or they were on something you had the option of calling the police and have them taken out of the schools or trying to teach them something while they were there
and you don't know if you were reaching them or not
but we felt like you know maybe just going ahead and try to teaching them was bet- trying to teach them was better than have them taken out
because uh uh that just
i mean it
but it doesn't do anything for them
uh most the time if they were they were
i've only had two instances where i cou- it was really noticeable
but they were better behaved when they were um
but it ended up better
uh i don't know
i think there's a problem too with teachers trying to um
they've been a big drive in especially in the seventies to return back to the basics
and uh and i'm not completely just you know just teach the basics in schools
but i think there does need to be a reemphasis of those because
of our our lower grades in the standardized test and such
i mean i- i- it's indicative across the board that we we've done something wrong
and when you see uh koreans and chinese and japanese who are taking all the uh science jobs all the engineering jobs all the mathematical jobs
and you know here we are
we can't we can't balance a checkbook without a calculator
um i don't know
well i spent a year and a half in japan also
and i've seen how their school system works
and then at the end of the of a certain time period you spitted everything back out
and the better the memorizer you are the better your grades are going to be
so i don't completely agree with that either
but there there definitely needs to be a balance somewhere
that's that's a great deal what law schools like
oh is it
and uh i did the same sort of thing
and then you get one examine for the whole semester and it's how well you can remember it all
how how much can you stuff in your brain
and i found that a particularly useless way of studying
and consequently some of the very best students were had excellent memories
but they couldn't put two and two together as far as the law was concerned
goo- good question
money money is not the answer
i mean the- they're throwing more money at it now than ever before
and things are getting worse
i think it's like a lot of things in the in the united states
we've got so much built up in um in the in the uh bureaucracy and in the politics of it
and in the the power plays that it needs to be pulled down and started over again
and there's no way that that can be done
maybe on smaller smaller scales
well i don't know
and i think part of it is that they've got to give authority back to the local school
you know i mean it's it's silly that these that these people are handcuffed when it comes to discipline
right into the classroom it needs to be be able
i mean i i mean teachers are so afraid now of even saying something
to students because they're going get they're going to get complaints or they're going to get sued or something
you know they're kind of fearful of
well lawyers help create that
well at least i've heard that
i i i haven't fortunately been in a situation where it's
well i think i think i i mean what we've turned the school schools into now are just day-care centers you know somebody
and he's out of our hair
and the other part of it is parents have quit becoming parents
you know they're just
you you can you can have the best school system in the world if you don't get any- anything at home then it's it's not going to help either
so i don't know
it's an interesting interesting thing you want to do
you have to to prove that you're teaching them something
um they try to encourage you to follow a specific curriculum although you don't have to
and then if you have particular religious beliefs they have to be they're kind of monitored
you know they they will allow you to
but certain religious groups don't want their children in public schools because the influence
and maybe they were a group of mennonites or something like that
but um they they are monitored by the um by the state school board
i remembering reading a few cases about that when it when
i mean it seems silly that um we started
that's that's the way you got your education in this country
and then um
i grew up uh in the the sixties
and at that time uh it was is a changing time for the whole music scene i guess
and i grew up with the beatles and the rolling stones and the whole pot culture during that time and went through that phase and kind of stayed with it i guess for several years after i graduated from college and and thereafter
but have since uh
i grew up in a small town in in southern oklahoma
i have kind of gone back to uh more of a county uh flavor in music
um i'm not quite sure why that is
and it seems like almost a opposite
but i guess i got away from what i consider to be the pot uh sounding music
it didn't have what you know i guess what i was looking for at the time country tell's more of a a story
and i've i've become i guess more of a country fan over the years
when you say that you grew up uh in the sixties i take it that was the uh teenage type years
and and uh
we we're very similarly aged
so we probably have an in- interesting perspective on the music on the times
so i'm just a couple years older than you
um essentially i was one of the nerdy types in high school really which meant that i for one reason or another i didn't pay much attention to music
but as i look back now i realize it was very formative for me
and i became attached to that style of uh urban urban country if there is such a thing
i think with in a way one could talk about simon and garfunkel that way because they do tend uh to have a dramatic or story approach to their music uh usually tend to have some good or bad moral to it
uh over time i became very interested in in baroque classical
and i think that was just through experiencing contacting college and the fact that i found it it very relaxing for me
my tastes now run i guess to a upbeat uh simon
it's something that interests me uh combined with with the classical tastes i had mentioned
and my classical music tends to be confined to the seventeen hundreds early eighteen hundred music
i'm not a music um
and i i spent a good deal of time listening also to uh
but i'm not sch- schooled in it
and i i've enjoyed the times when i have listened to it
and i never have the discipline to stay with it
but when i do play uh and begin to reacquire skills i inevitably fall in love with country western music which tends to be in some ways easy to play for a for a new piano player
it is it's got uh basically an easy uh rhythm and and tone
and it's it's pretty fairly well easily to uh uh something to fall into
i i've gone through different periods of life uh in music from pop to classical
i guess one of the things was that influenced me was that i i've worked in radio stations as a d j for all my college years trying to support my way through there
but basically because that's where i worked
and i've developed a real love for uh classical music in probably junior high and high school because my band instructor was uh heavy into classical type music
he said he used to sit on saturday mornings and watch cartoons just to hear the music uh that they were using behind them because they used especially disney used a lot of classical music uh behind the cartoons
and so consequently we wind up wound up playing a lot of classical music there
and i think that uh got deep seated into me
one of things i especially like now in music regardless of what kind it is uh are those that call on those classical uh roots i guess uh barry manilow comes to mind for some reason there's there's not a whole
but he does have some things
uh and i think even electric light orchestra had some some real um influences by classical music
and i'm still still
uh a good example would be uh
i have connections but but not particularly deep ones to the vietnamese war type situations
uh and i found that i really like china beach
and i particularly like tour of duty
and both of them i had as much fascination of the background music i think going on as i did to the theme of the shows
uh and i i've uh thirty something i'm particularly interested
but it's the music
almost that i find myself listening to uh
our generation was uh so in tuned to music of that time that we identify goodness or badness with uh things now with the music that's behinds them
i i uh
a song by the uh uh
uh and if you recall how it goes downtown
uh all i have to do is hear that song and i get strongly evoked memories of of difficult times in school being behind on work
uh and my family now knows if they come into my study and uh i happen to have had a tough day at work and maybe i'm trying to get a project done uh at school uh and i'm humming or whistling in a sort of mad crazy way the tune to downtown they know to just stay away
when did you first take your uh first piano lesson
uh probably about first grade
and i have uh returned about every four or five years to thinking that i would like to do something about it
and then inevitably i am swept away by the the pressure of other types of things
in order to continue to to grow and
i i always think that i'll be able to do it
and then i inevitably discover that i have no innate music talent relative to composition and that i struggle and really can't quite understand what is that other people take for granted
uh but in a in a innate music sense there just seems to be something missing there which is always frustrating for me since i have pretty high math aptitude
but but it doesn't for me
it's making that that connection especially with the mechanical parts of it
i was never able to to master all that
in fact my brother and sister both they were oh thirteen sixteen years older than i they went through the uh parent thing where you've got to practice or you're not going out to play thing
and when it came to my turn the folks said no we're not going through that again
and is the turns out i was the only one who really had an interest in it and never got to
and i i really
in fact uh one of my favorite things to do now is sit down and listen to chopin that is played on uh piano
i just you know i can just drift off into some other world just listening to that for hours if i ever have the time to do that
you know i'm kind of like you maybe one of these days i'll get around to it
but probably not
so we both have a secret background that says somehow or another we just knew we were piano players and never got a chance uh
well it's a pleasure talking with you
and you sir
well i could barely hear what the switchboard operator was saying as what was the topic
um i like to do uh weight training and and cycling and just walking uh swimming
and the doctor said that running and jumping isn't real good for my knee anymore
so i had to kind of change my life-style a little bit
well let me ask a personal question
oh well then you should
see over thirty-five everything goes downhill flop
well the rest of me is in pretty good shape
oh you're lucky then
because i've battled arthritis all my life
i mean even since i was like about two or three
and usually most people are just absolutely crippled
and uh i do water aerobics
oh i bet that helps
and now i'm down to about four
but it's about the only thing that keeps my mobility in sh- in there
uh i tried weight training
and the shock on the system is is just too much
so i have stuck to water aerobics basically you know the weightless thing and
but you know it's hard to find
i mean it's really hard to find a place that's going to offer water aerobics because what i'm finding is that if they do offer it you get the crowd of women that are
or it's the geriatric crowd
so i've considered even becoming licensed to teach it
well i mean if if you know what your routine is you can do that by yourself
and you probably do
but you have to have an indoor pool
so to find an indoor pool where either you can do this by yourself without you know drawing a lot of looks means you're really going to do a strenuous workout activity
and that does look very odd in the water
have you tried the uh the pool at the spring creek fitness center
and you know that's the only place i haven't tried
and people have told me
now that's the texins facility
um a fairly a fairly good amount uh more on the weekends
uh i try to beat the traffic in the mornings when i workout in the mornings i try to come down to the dallas fitness center
i don't i don't work at t i
oh you don't
actually when i was working there i was the only woman that was pretty much in the industry
and i used to fill out those attitude surveys
and uh uh me and the insurance adjusters are are very familiar with each other
and my husband still works there
and um i get my attitude expressed through them
but i find it to be very
sometimes it's kind of shoot yourself in the foot short- mentality to save a few bucks
and i came down here
and you know they did an attitude survey like six weeks after i had been working here
and i asked about you know day care for the shift workers
and boy i was pulled in by my manager and told that you just don't say that you know
well it's not
and i was kind of horrified
now what year are we talking about
uh things have become much more enlightened since then
you know we still don't have a day care facility
but people are more sympathetic to it
i understand i understand that they're now covering women's preventative health care
and uh the reason i'm at home is when i had my kids and i was scheduled to go back and i tell you how much in the dark ages it was um i had been rated number one in the field
and then i took uh
and they put the baby on a heart lung monitor when i took her home
and the insurance carrier was not going to cover this because it was considered preventative treatment
and then they used to uh
and then i had a second one eighteen months later
and of course to maintain
and i was flat on my back for the last five months with the second one
and i don't even know it
and they they put me on twenty-four hour fetal monitoring then to to try to control the labor and see how far it was going
and after the baby was born since it wasn't premature then they said they wouldn't cover the cost of the monitor
because it was a uh thirteen thousand dollar bill
and that was when they had
and i was just outraged
i did not know that since i was on personal leave of absence that i had been uh terminated until i filed my insurance claims about four months later
and they didn't have any coverage under my name
and i went back
and i said what the hell is going on here you know
and they told me that uh oh well you know you know your husband works here
and he's got a good salary
and uh you know we've got people here that really you know need to be working
and so that we had just
you know it was this way we didn't have to layoff an active person
and we'd just let you go
and it took me about a year of arguing
i said you know i've got to put this in writing to me
and because until they put it in writing i couldn't get my insurance benefits
and i couldn't get my uh termination benefits either
i i can believe that
i still don't think that they after my experiences that they could you know get me to go back ever again
i i can understand
well it's been good talking with you
but let me ask you this since you use texans
oh shoot it's only about ten bucks a month
now that's for individual
i mean uh to add dependents is is you know maybe another dollar or something
now if you if you pay your monthly charge do you then pay separately for classes your taking
uh you do for classes for classes
but to i mean to use any of the facilities is is no extra charge
or or a depe-
do you have to be an active t i employee to join texans or or a depe-
oh seen that my my co-dependents have turned on the hose and are getting my neighbors fence
so my position for management to domestic goddess has been an adjustment
but boy i think i'm going to go contact texans
i mean that beats any offer i've heard in a long time
uh well it would depend on when you go
it's not it's not excessively crowded on the weekends
see i'd want to be there in the mornings like from nine thirty to ten thirty
oh i don't think that would be bad at all
if you're in richardson you'd probably wanted to come to the to the dallas site
oh well then you could go either one
and you'd probably like the pool there
oh god it sounds like i would
well thank you
um i guess um this is probably really a good subject for me because i really like to do uh hand work
uh mostly i do needlepoint i guess
um well i've made a lot of baby gifts
like especially lately there's been so many babies
i do crochet and a lot of uh things like that
and i have very little of my own stuff
and it's kind of embarrassing
oh well can you do it
a friend of mine gave me a clock kit and i i needlepointed the face
and i uh kept that because she gave me that
that that would be definitely something you'd want to keep
and it's real neat
was was the whole face done or just the numbers and and like minute marks
um basically the whole
but the minute marks are done they're like hearts
and then the
at the numbers they they're kind of outlined and stuff
it it was quite bit of work
but you know it was a lot of fun too
and then i got into the bargello
oh what's that
well it's an italian um needlework using using the uh
but the uh huh
i i've just gone blank
but it's used with yarn
and it usually takes long stitches over two or three openings in the cloth and you weave intricate patterns and use different colors
like it could be a flame stitch where so rather than drawing a picture you're making a design like a geometric or whatever
and it was used quite often in the colonial times to uh uh to upholster chairs and so forth as well as the crewel um embroidery work that was done on them
wow that's interesting
what did you what kind of things did you do
what i did when i was doing that was mostly pillows you know for sofas and so forth
and i can't find one that i've done
i did- i didn't give them away
but i didn't know if it's been my color choice or multiple moves or or what
but i have no idea where they are
i mean when you described it
i suspect you i suspect you have
i mean when you described it it sounded like something you know that would be around i guess
but i've never heard of it before
and it's really interesting
um i guess i've decorated baskets and stuff before in the past
but i've kind of gotten out of that
oh basically bows and lace uh ribbons
um i really wanted to do
you know so many of them now have the ribbons where i'm not sure how they do it
but the ribbons they make them they like
they make them hard you know
and those are so neat
i mean i would really like to do those
and there there they
but she has three kids all under the age of like six
and and they're all a handful
so it's got to be something she can do fairly easily and fairly quickly
when i do um crochet it's usually the lacy victorian type things like that
and i stiffen those with a a glue mixture
and it may be something similar to that that the fabric is dipped in and then um allowed to dry in those those draping bows i mean those draping streamers
there's bound to be some kind of fabric stiffener like that that's very similar that's not going to melt too much with uh uh high humidity
that's i think that's what my concern was was it really sure and how they would how they would last
well right now i'm looking at a little quilted uh uh hanging
it's like it's a flag
and i don't want to wash it because that would start breaking down the batting and so forth
but it's such a dust collector to be out and so forth
and most of my things are dust collectors
uh and i hate to dust
so first thing i think of is how easy would this
i don't do it quite as much as i used to um i guess because i i went back to school
so i don't have as much time
oh you don't have time
and i have two children also
but i really enjoy it when i do do it when i get the chance you know
and but once i get started i can't put it down
or i don't even want to get into it in the first place
and so i end up lots of time not doing anything at all
i started a project it's been over a year ago
well i didn't tell you what year
um well it's a it's uh cross stitch
and it's a picture
and it's a wildlife
and it's really beautiful
but it's going to be a lot of work
and you know i've i have worked on it quite a bit but not as much as i'd like to
you know it's just so hard
now this is done in the needlepoint
well i should-
it's counted cross stitch actually is what i'm doing
and so it's really since it's counted you know it's really a lot of work
but i decided that that's something that demands my tim- my my total attention
and so i've got to have total almost total silence
it is not does not sound like an easy one to finish
and i tell you really i could just kick myself for even starting it because i have a feeling i'm never going to get it done
oh i'm sure you'll get it done
but it just may not of the original
i i just don't know when i'm ever
you know it's just really hard
but i really do en-
like i said i really enjoy it when i do
and there's there's so many other things that i i have done you know in the meantime like i said so many baby gifts
and so you know those don't take much time at all
so it's no big deal for me to pick those up and do them
do you do you use patterns i mean like a book of patterns
or do you go out an buy a a kit like for a bib or something like that
and i just go with those
and then i buy the bibs separate
and then i just use whatever colors i want to
and it it depends on what it is you know
but some things especially letters if they suggest certain colors for letters i just go with whatever i want to
there's yeah there's a few designs i guess i've done myself but not very many
i've made i made a little uh little uh little thumb print and made it a bunny
i mean just just did a thumb print you know
and then see i didn't cross stitch the actual thumb print
you know that was just the ink
and then i made the ears and little eyes and nose and mouth
oh that sounds really neat
and then i just
did you do did you use like uh a stamp pad and ink
so what kind of movies have you seen lately i guess
um a lot
well the last movie i saw but it wasn't my choice was the ninja turtle movie
but my preference is the one we saw before that was silence of the lambs
um the last movie i saw was uh sleeping with the enemy
oh was that good
uh see i'm not a big julie roberts fan
but i was a lot i was a lot more impressed with her than i thought i would be
well that's good
i i'm ready to go
it's you know hasn't worked out that way yet
you know it's uh it looks good you know if you like thrillers anyway
and i do
oh i love them like that
i mean i i like all ranges of movies
it's really it was really interesting
well what other movies have you seen then lately
i mean i'm sure i'm going to be seeing it because in a week to amarillo where my sister lives and she's got two boys that i took to see the first one
so i'm sure i'm going to see the next one here real soon
my husband said it was um about the same lines
oh well then it won't be too bad
you know it wasn't impressive necessarily
but it was better than it could have been
and i was impressed with the fact that um it wasn't that childish
i mean she understood everything
she goes to almost all movies with us except you know r rated
and she really enjoyed it
but it was on a higher level you know where there were some things that kids didn't understand that adults did
and i liked that
i think that's important if you're going you know if you're going uh kids are going to uh parents are going to have to go you ought to make it at least semi- you know semi for them too
but we take her to just about every movie
and she uh she does really good
and she does real good
so if and when we ever get a baby-sitter like we did with silence of the lambs we go see it
do you take her or do you go to a lot of comedy movies
but something on the tip of my tongue
and i can't think of which one it was
uh gosh i can't remember
the last uh
but that that sounds good
well that really wasn't too bad
you know he's supposed
you know he's this actor right and he's playing a cop
or he's hanging around with a cop trying to pick up the stuff
i mean there there were times when he was like he'd be running with a gun or whatever
and i was so impressed with that because you know usually
because i mean everybody grows up looking at these cop movies and trying to you know to imitate them or whatever
and uh i thought he did such an excellent job of not going that far
now by the end he was looking more like a cop
but at the beginning of the movie and all through the middle part you know he was trying to trying to get it
but he wasn't there yet
and you could tell it
and i guess that i thought was a real good acting and writing job both you know because i think or directing job
and james woods i think is who it was did an excellent job as the cop
i mean you know he just
and there were there were some definite um should i say tense moments
i i i had seen it before christmas
but i took a date to it uh about a month ago
so i i i've seen it the second time not too long ago
of course the bad thing about it was uh the second time i saw it i didn't really enjoy it as much
and i was kind of surprised at that
i really was i was hoarse getting out of there
and maybe i just laughed so hard the first time that i didn't have it
i mean it just wasn't as funny the second time because i had just gone overboard the first time
i mean it was it was a great movie though
i'm looking forward to this summer uh naked gun two and a half is coming out
i mean they are just slapstick
well you have to see them more than that
i i i still catch things in airplane that i didn't catch
i mean it's amazing i love those movies i really do
so i'm looking forward to seeing that because that looks hilarious
it it's just getting so expensive
oh isn't it though
you know but that's at least the good thing about the texas organization letting you buy the tickets cheaper
but normally we don't think about it until
and then all of a sudden i'm saying i wish i'd bought these things
and then if you want popcorn and stuff it's just i mean uh it's incredible
you know popcorn is not that expensive
so they get you at the ticket booth and then try and get you at the popcorn and coke
and it it's just the idea that these uh these actors you know live in such lavish style
i mean it's as simple as that
and as long as we keep paying the money for it they are going to keep paying them
now have you seen dances with wolves
oh that was that was an excellent movie
it really and truly does because to get the feeling of like when the buffalos are when they're chasing the buffalos and everything you've got to be where you feel it
i mean i guess my first instinct was to wait for the video too
but i'm glad i didn't
i mean that mov- that was one movie i came out impressed
i mean i have absolutely no problems with them winning seven oscars
normally i'm one of these people that i don't like one one movie taking all the honors
but even though they were okay the girl in it
you know what i mean you know
now the best
but from what i heard the guy who got it was better
so i you know i can see that
oh well there are there is one spot that was just a little bit on the gory side
but um it's it's
it it's just the idea that there is this one spot where the white man has come by and killed a bunch a buffalo and just stripped its hide the hides
see that's the one that is the honest to god the one reason i don't want to see the movie is because i love buffalos for some weird reason
and and of course
and well yeah
that and plus i mean part of it is the idea that he goes with them on a buffalo hunt
so i mean they are killing buffalos in it
but they don't stress that very much
and i think it's an excellent movie for
if if she enjoys movies i think it'll work pretty good
oh that'll be good
it's it's it's a long movie
and i heard the video's even going to be longer
they said there's a lot that had been edited because of the length and that they wanted in
so they're going to put it in the video
and that way you can watch it at your leisure
there are certain things you can't do with a video and the idea that they may put a little extra in it i think is a good idea
because i mean when you rent a video
videos of course are not cheap either and so the idea of getting a little extra with it i think is a good idea because they they make bundles of money off those things
oh i do too
we keep holding out you know
i'm getting to the point where you know i watch well i watch nick at night
um do you have children
oh my goodness
uh do you work
and and uh brian's in a day care center
he's uh he was two in december
so he's not quite two and a half yet
uh i put him
i'm kind of had different different ideas from what probably the majority of people have
oh no kidding
and i just
i mean i i kind of looked at it like if you take him to a home with a with private individual
and i always figured at least in a day care center there are other people around
and if you get one bad apple there's are at least other people that can see it
and i just kind of always felt that the chances of something happening were less
you know how can you help depending on the day care center you know
have you ever noticed they're always like a family owned center where the mother and the daughter and the son run it you know kind of thing
it's like a family thing
so that's what i did
and i have had just excellent luck
i was just going to ask you how it you know if you liked the the
but obviously you do or you wouldn't have him there
well he was in he was in the same center for two years for the first two years
and uh it was wonderful
and i loved it
and i was so happy there
and the woman who owned it sold it
but i thought okay i'm going to keep an open mind here
and the people who came in it just wasn't it
and their their attitude and philosophy was just completely
and i left him there for about a month and just decided i can't do this anymore
but but he's done well
and i just feel so lucky
or do you get to stay home with them
well i got to stay home with my kids for the first ten years
or she's i guess
so i yeah i i was really happy that i was able to do that
that's what i wanted to because i uh you know i just couldn't wait to have kids
and so if i was
and i couldn't wait to have them it would be kind of silly you know to go back to work as soon as i had them
so it it it it was really great
and my youngest was only uh two and a half
i mean she was already two and a half
so it wasn't you know she wasn't an infant
so i felt real good about that
but uh boy i tell you with summer coming up i'm just pulling my hair out in terms of what i'm going to do
i i guess i
and uh i worked full time all last year
and now i'm going to school part time and uh
and i'm working part time
and so i'm still
but i only have half time salary
and uh when school lets out i just don't i haven't i have no idea what i'm going to do
well we did
we tried we had all different things
my daughter went home to visit my mom for a while and my son uh went to camp
and there we had uh i don't know some
but it was all uh really expensive
so now they're a year older
my daughter's eleven going to be eleven this summer
and my son will be
if i can work part of the day you know i'm going to leave them home
in fact i'm doing that right now with their afternoons when they get home before i do you know
but the four year old now i hav- i have had her since i went back to work or before i went back to work really in a home day care situation
and uh we've just been really thrilled
but i wasn't embarrassed to shop around you know
where do where do you live
and they have a number you can call
and all these people are registered with their association
and you know go like our our uh
oh that's wonderful
she gets home visitations by the s- i don't know the state boards i guess some of them and then some by the association
and they have weekly meetings and everything
and so it's just really really well regulated
and she's just great
in fact uh she's all upset because galen is going to go to kindergarten next fall
and she says this is it
and i said oh no don't count on that
so but we we've tried we've tried everything
and one year i guess last year when i went back to work i had
and uh we put him in amrein's day care after after
and you know i think they were fine
but the thing is he was in school all day
in in plano it's open classroom situation where they don't have walls
so there is like a hundred and twenty second graders
and uh and then he'd get on the amrein's bus to go to amrein's
and then there would be a whole ton of other kids all in the same room you know
you know what fun they had with these computer games
and then they'd go outside for awhile
but it was just like going to school until five thirty at night instead of being able to get home at two thirty
because he was always around with a crowd of kids and he just really missed being able to be by himself
or you know
so another thing that we tried to do
i i know your son's too young right now
but we're trying we tried to sign him up for after school scouts and
and we've already started about
you know i mean how young can they start t-ball and soccer
you know i mean i just
you know we both think of that that as just so important
i mean he's he's so much fun now
he's really he's really starting to get lots of fun
and i can't wait until stuff like that starts happening you know and you know we did the easter egg hunts
which was really the first year he was really able to and to know what we wan- know what he was doing you know and enjoy it
and it was so much fun
and gosh he went a couple of weekends ago and rode an elephant
oh my gosh
and god he got up on this elephant all by himself
and lord i couldn't believe it
oh that's great
and i thought i'm going to end up on this elephant with him
so stuff like that is starting to come along where it's really
and he like comes home with something new everyday you know
well that's great
i know i know they're working with him
and he's excited to get there in the morning
and he goes running
and he's always having fun when i pick him up
so you know yeah
this this day care is is
whenever you say bright steps everybody goes oh i've heard that's the best day care in town you know
and it's it's one of those that's very hard to get into
and they have this this this woman owns three day cares two in lewisville and one in irving
and she had to open the second one up in lewisville because
her waiting list was just like you know like a year old
oh my gosh
and she's got two day cares within like three blocks of each other
all the teachers like about half the teachers are degreed teachers
oh it makes a huge difference
and i think that really makes a difference
not because it's a job they could get because they didn't qualify for anything else you know
and his old day care as much as i loved it you know
and the owner i really liked her
and she worked really hard to get good people
but the people that she got were there because they weren't qualified to do anything else you know
and and i got lucky
and all of his teachers were
some sometimes that's fine
that's great you know
but then sometimes you know
well is it real expensive then
um it just went up the first of this month
uh seventy nine dollars a week for now
but but it's you know it's like where he was before i was only paying sixty three
so there's quite a little jump there
but i looked all over lewisville
and you know and there were places that were cheaper
but is it
you know your peace of mind is worth a little bit of money
and i have peace of mind
where he is and some of those other places i wouldn't have
see we do the same thing
we pay our our home care provider for our day care provider full time for a whole week
but she she's gone three mornings
but i said to her i said you know it doesn't matter if for whatever re-
well have you ever uh had a family reunion
and uh let me tell you
some of the other people the older people organized it
and what they did they had uh a book made up
and it was like
and then what they did was they asked every family to write something about their family
and like how many kids you had and who you had married
and you know it went through like
and it showed who my uh well who my husband's parents were you know
and who he married and then how many children we had and then like his brothers and sisters
and it went through the whole family and stuff
oh that's so neat
and it was so good
but it it really did
you know and plus it's got a lot more people interested in it because
so so did everybody send in their information and they made a book up
and then you could get it at the reunion
and everybody got a book
and it told like uh you know where the first connally's came over
and um it told what happened when they got there and how many kids they had
and it just kept coming on up through the generations
so it was really that was really neat
so do you have a big family
well he does
oh he does
but uh he has enough relatives to make up for me not having any
and he just has himself and his brother and his parents
and that's it
so he had to kind of get used to us
that's what that's what happened when i when i first uh met my husband
i said this can't be you know
because a lot of them lived in like a group you know down one highway
and there was a lake
and they all lived down there by it
oh how nice
and so we were going down
the highway you know
and he kept saying this is where my uncle lives
and this is where my aunt lives and my uncle
oh my gosh
and i kept thinking this guy is putting me on
nobody has this many relatives you know
at because nobody it seemed like liked the same thing
but you had a choice
and then you got to taste a lot of new dishes and stuff too
so did people come like from out of town to the reunion
or did you have hotel rooms
or how did you do it
um they just stayed with different ones of them
they just came down and like say okay this aunt and uncle kip uh all their kids and their grand kids and everything
and they had a church service ahead of it
you know and then they had uh
uh then they ate out on the ground
and they just brought food with them
did they just have like over a weekend
well i'm real curious because my family
so if we ever had a reunion we'd kind of all have to stay in a hotel
i mean you know there would be one person who lived there that would have a house
but they couldn't put everybody up
so it i think it would get kind of expensive
but you know what you can do
like uh it's a big place
i mean you know
and it's not very expensive that way
oh you mean
oh i see
so everybody could stay together
it's like a they have like a a convention type thing
and then it has little rooms off of it where
you know you'd go and sleep at night time
but then it has like a kitchenette and things like that
see that would be great because then you could spend so much more time together
and then every time you wanted to go eat with somebody you'd probably have to go to out eat or something
but they had
you know that
you know at area lakes and all
because now every time we plan anything just about we write to the chamber of commerce of where we're going because
that way than try to locate it you know
calling different places can r- really run you up a bill
but if you can find a centrally located place where everybody would have to come about the same distance
i mean you can't get it exact you know usually
but uh and then everybody goes to that place
and that is not bad at all
but they have lot of times they'll have like uh little cabins
and three or four or five families can stay in those cabins because they have you know just the single bunk beds and stuff
and they can all stay in those cabins
and then you know you can have cookouts and stuff like that
but that's uh you know that's the best way i found
now we had one
but it wasn't any of my immediate family anyway
they had uh uh thing where you could everybody could come and meet and go out to eat
but i didn't think that was as good because
it was like you know you couldn't really talk and stuff like you could when
or somewhere you know where you were out
and you have to sit at a table and just
and it just
well um did you
i mean did you have to draw a line
or did the people that had that reunion have to draw a line
like they just
what they did was well see what they did was okay they uh they wrote to all the initial people you know
the the oldest ones
and they had like
you know some of them if they didn't have their addresses and all on them
and you know
they told them that what we had to do was when we sent back in our information we had to tell them how many people were going to be coming you know
and then when they when they talked to us or when they sent us the letter it uh
it asked you know will you be willing to bring
and you had to check off what all you would be willing to bring
oh i see
and so really there wasn't any problem with
i mean there was just so many of them
but it turned out so much better like that
because everybody knew they knew ahead of time how many people to expect
now if there was a sickness or something like that i mean you know you're not going to lose that many
but how about like because of divorce and stuff like that
like my parents are divorced
and they are both remarried
and you know there i mean there's
well see then
then you would put you would have put that down on the list
and you would have sent you would have been the one that sent their invitation to them
i i'm kind of like in control over who comes uh just from my family
because once it went to the the oldest people and then they knew who they wanted to invite
who i was going to you know
whether i wanted my kids and you know my any of my family to come
and then you know it never did
like if i didn't want somebody to come then i just wouldn't send them one of the questionnaires
so there really wasn't a problem that way
well that's a real good idea
but i tell you what that's the neatest book we've got
course we've got we've still got it
and they charged us i think it was like it was like five or six dollars i can't remember exactly you know
and it's not uh it's not a hard back book it's just a oh like a you know folder type thing
but it has the entire
you know it has everybody that you could ever
and it will be something my kids will have you know
i was just thinking of that what you could tell your kids
but i know very little about before my grandparents
i mean very very little about it
but i can't remember who it was about
but i can't you know i remember these stories
but i have no idea who it was that was in those stories
so i mean i couldn't give an accurate
i couldn't tell my kids what you know those people were like
but i don't know who it was
but then usually when you find out some information from like your parents
then you can find out from you know you can find somebody else that can tell you something else about these
what uh what kind of camping is there in texas
well there there are quite a few um parks i guess state parks
and there's a couple of national parks i guess that you can camp at
um most of them have pretty good facilities
i don't know if the camping that i've done is really roughing it without a a whole lot of stuff
so you do uh like backpacking and the like
uh done a little bit of that mainly just um like camping out at the state parks
and there's some real nice ones in arkansas
um i think arkansas has one of the best parks departments around
so that's probably a pretty nice place to go
they've got uh real nice lake system and around their parks
one of them uh the gray i think that's one of the ones we've been to it's real nice there a bunch of lakes around it
there's a golf course and um just a whole bunch of camping sites
where have you uh
oh i've been camping for years not on a regular basis
but uh i first started camping out in the desert in california
and uh then i moved to north carolina
and i i didn't camp for a long time
and then i started to uh go camping again kind of in conjunction with white water rafting
so i'd go up somewhere and camp overnight and then do some rafting
and then maybe camp another night and drive home
and that was uh that was pretty good
so i went out and bought a whole bunch of camping gear
and uh you know i still do it once in a while
where where is raleigh in north carolina
uh well it's it's uh in terms of north south i would say it's uh a little a little more towards the northern border of the state and pretty much in the eastern half of it
so what i-
well it it's uh
actually the the blue ridge in virginia are closer to raleigh
and you can pick those up going west
but then you're talking about six to eight hours
but um it's a real it's a real nice place to go and camp
and there's some pretty decent campgrounds although i don't think raleigh i don't think the state of north carolina takes
but i didn't know how much how much camping areas there were along there
what what's it like camping in the desert and california
it's actually kind of incredible
um i like it better than almost anything i've ever done
you know you really can probably count thousands of stars
and uh it's it's just kind of nice
i like the uh
i think the desert has a rare kind of beauty which uh a lot of people don't realize
you know they hear desert
and they think of scorpions and snakes and sand and being real dry and lack of water
but it also has a certain quality of beauty that you just don't find anyway else except in a desert
so it's pretty nice
the uh the movie the doors has so- some nice desert scenes
but um the uh the shots are are pretty nice
and it's sort of like that
i mean it's just almost surreal in some places
or the the
i mean you got to you sort of have to choose your season carefully and know what's going to happen
but it's beautiful in february
i mean it's just beautiful
the days get up into the high eighties uh maybe the nineties
but it's it's quite bearable
and then the nights are reasonably warm you know sixties or seventies
we've talked about planning a trip up through um
i have a sister-in-law that lives in new mexico up through new mexico and into colorado and the grand canyon area
well that would be that would be pretty nice
i've been i have been camping on the south rim the grand canyon
that one one thing you said about the stars is really true
when you're close to a big city like dallas the the lights kind of wash wash off the star
so it's nice to to get away
how how much you miss
i mean i don't think i ever see the little dipper
but i don't think i ever see it except when i go get out of the city and go camping in the desert or in in the mountains
well i guess we've talked as much as we need to on the subject
well thanks for calling
well stephanie what's your position on gun control
well on a scale of one to ten uh being ten no kind of legislation and zero being uh total ban i probably would lean more towards six or seven
um i feel like a total ban on guns is just going to put the guns in the hands the criminals
um i lived in massachusetts for two years
and they have a total ban on guns
and i saw that it didn't stop crime in that state
now was that just on handguns or was that on rifles
any any kind of firearms
there's was a mandatory jail sentence if you were caught um with a firearm
and also i think there was a fine
and that didn't help at all
the the crime is not any better or any worse
i mean it's
i i shouldn't say i don't know if it was any worse
but it certainly didn't get any better
i guess i would tend myself to be more towards the the like three
where i don't think you should necessarily ban guns any by any means
but you should definitely have the character search and the seven day holding period and things along that nature uh
you know you shouldn't be able to go out there and just buy one and you know right off the shelf
i i i agree with that
i i think that the the law is on who can buy a gun are are way too lax
i think that i think that the
and so i think that kind of control is would be good
but the uh
i you know i'm trying to think of how many times you make the statement and just to kind of exam it a little bit
and i i know that any statement in absoluteness is not necessarily true uh
but how many times
i guess i have never heard of a a robbery being foiled or spoiled because the person who's being robbed had a gun
and maybe they just don't report those
or i'm not sure
or you know i can't think of ever hearing on the news or whatnot or hearing or knowing anybody who was being robbed
but good thing they had their gun on them
and they they thwarted the robbery attempt
i i'm i'm not really sure
i don't personally i don't own a gun
um and i don't think i probably ever would um although i would like to know how to handle one
and i think it's good that everyb- and i think everybody should learn how to handle one
um you just never know when you might come into contact with one
did did you were you brought up in a family that hunted
uh nobody in my family hunted
uh my father had had guns when i was in high school because he got them from a friend who lived in massachusetts
and he lived in massachusetts and had to get rid of all his guns
so we ended up uh with these guns
and my really my only experience with a gun was shooting a pistol and not knowing how to hold it right
and the hammer came back and hit me in the thumb and blood squirted everywhere
and so that was really the only experience that i've had with guns
and it it kind of scared me
but i think that if i learn how to use one i would i would feel better
i've also always thought about the idea you know most sports you know which are the n r a and people have their thing you know
if you ban guns you're just banning the the recreation the sport of hunting things of that nature
most of that's done with rifles and such uh though there's you know probably i'm sure some sector that does it with handguns
but just by the mere fact of outlawing handguns would make it so that it would be not as conspicuous
you could see someone coming or dressed inappropriately you know
you- if they had to have a rifle or was
you know made it more difficult to get a a uh a handgun
now of course you know in this world anytime you've freedom you can be able to get anything you want
but i guess to make it more difficult for the person who's just so irate and upset and you know temporarily a little bit uh offset or off keel
i don't know if that's a large percentage of uh crime or not
but i guess it would be some
but i i think definitely
like today they just introduced the what's called the brady bill the seven day mandatory waiting period
and i think that shoot that's a good idea
i i i agree the thing that scares me uh though about where i would i would wa- definitely want some sort of legislation
and coming from the north east i'm just not used to seeing um these
and i i know this may sound kind of stereo typical
you know and it kind of scares me especially with all the shootings that have been going on
and then you come here in in the dallas area um
i don't i don't believe that people should be allowed to carry guns in their vehicles
that's kind of kind of wild
um especially not in the back window
well that's all very interesting
well thanks for talking
sure you're welcome
well actually i'm a i'm a dodgers fan from way back
oh how way back i mean
like um late fifties early sixties
so wally moon moon shots and all that
it's a um
i i'm living in just west of baltimore and frederick um which is also just west of baltimore has a minor league team
and uh and wally moon is the manager of them
so he's still kicking around
i i also lived eight years in ohio before going to uh going away to college
and i used to go watch the toledo mudhens
oh i saw them
um um i was out there last summer
and i saw a game at ned skelton
uh i couldn't tell you for sure
so um there used to be a uh race track
so had a lot of fun
actually i mean i like minor league baseball a lot
well that's true
uh they've led the american league in batting fielding and pitching
but they've never been able to do more than one of those in any any given year
actually um they um
i mean the guy's twenty twenty-five home rums maybe thirty eighty some r b i-s
i mean he you know he can't field
and you know he strikes out a lot
but i mean he's done that for five years
really i mean he really has become a a very decent fielder
he's not a the liability that he was that he used to be
oh he fits right in with texas bunch of guys i mean with detroit bunch of guys that hit home runs and strike out a lot
of course get a guy like cecil fielder you know
well i mean with detroit i mean they can get away with one guy like that
i mean if i if i were in detroit i would start building the team around fielder
but that doesn't mean get three other guys who hit all they can do is hit home runs and strike out you know which they did
well i think the key for for l a this year is whether oral herschiser can come back
i i like them a lot
um and and i mean by saying i like them i like their chances
i i actually don't like the dodgers
well picking up darrell strawberry didn't hurt
but butler didn't hurt either
uh and bobby ojeda didn't hurt
uh who's the last one
um he's a a pretty decent pitcher
you know he
and uh that guy the short stop is going to be good
well it should be an interesting year
and i should have been to two
um the the team i live and die with actually is the red sox mostly die
but um i go to the orioles since they're here
and i you know i do enjoy them
um i've had an opening day on monday
you know i kind of wish that they had inter league play like they do in all the other sports so i could see some of the national league teams here once in a while
uh three hundred miles
it is it's incredible
you know we're we're pretty lucky because if i want to see a national league team i can usually go up to philadelphia
and um saw saw the cardinals and cubs last year and a bunch of teams the year before
um i try to see whatever i can
i mean i've been to like thirty or forty games each of the last few years
hope i'm going to do it this year because um uh having a kid this fall
so it's like so much for going to lots of baseball games
so so do it while you can
well it's been good talking with you
and and you'll be happy i think in october when the dodgers win
i'll be i'll be upset probably even though my prediction will be right
well god bless
and good talking with you
and good talking with you
uh i don't know
i'm not a real uh great football follower
and the other is the oklahoma sooners
uh being a native okie i uh i like to keep up with what the homeboys are doing uh
so you make it uh to that longhorns sooners game
uh i got out and got my bachelor's degree in uh seventy-three and uh never went to a game there and have never gone to a game since
but i always enjoyed watching them
and there's always been an interest there
well it's kind of same for me
and the local team was philadelphia
and they were like thirty miles right up the river
and i'm still pretty much an eagle fan i guess
i worked in uh missouri for a while
and uh i was probably the only one in the room several times when we were watching football on t v when the cowboys were playing the saint louis cardinals
and i was rooting for the cowboys
but they were kind of closer to home when when i struck up with them
and i think that's quite a bit of optimism around here that still there's a chance that maybe uh these guys are right maybe they will come through and and do something this year
boy they uh they sure did have a big turn around from a couple of years ago
uh they got rid of a lot of familiar names and got a lot of names in that we weren't weren't familiar with
uh some of them didn't
and you know maybe the stuff that uh jerry jones is talking about the construction and redefining the team and maybe the effort might be starting to pay off
i'm i keep waiting for the eagles to get over the hump
but they just have done absolutely nothing when they got there
and you know they've got a lot of the tools to do it
but doggone if they can't just put it together uh you know
they have got the quarterback there in randal cunningham who's just you know phenomenal
but he he's too streaky it seems
but they have always been a really strong team
and without a whole lot of big name players
and you know they they've managed with those guys
and i don't know
once the pressure gets turned on they they seem to loose it
see that's the typical trait of the dallas cowboys
it's it's been a rough tow a rough road to hoe ever since he left
i don't know why it's so hard to find uh a good quarterback these days
well that that says a lot for the for his ability though i think
for staubach's i mean
you know he was one of the few who come through in history that can really perform
uh we hope
but uh the guy winds up getting hurt every other game
i i tell you it's difficult in that guy's position coming into that because there he was just so highly touted by the press and everybody expected so many big things you know
uh it's funny watching them them play
he's probably like a lot of quarterbacks uh
and i haven't quite figured that out
if they figure they have got it won or if there's no real hurry because the first three quarters or uh if uh if something happens that that adrenalin starts flowing they say hey we got to do something now and then start playing the game the way the game should be played toward the last few minutes
so i don't know
so obviously though do you think they're going to do anything in the playoffs to make it to the super bowl this year
or who do you who do you like to do that this year
and they'll get close to it
uh that's a good question
uh i'm figuring either one either the eagles or possibly san francisco
so i don't know how these changes are going to help or hinder the team sometimes it brings in new motivation
and all you can do is get out of the way because here they come
i'm sure you know my sentimental favorite would have to be philadelphia
but i i sure am scared of them giants
well that's true
and they're big
and they are going to come right through you if you don't do something
that that sure was a fun super bowl to watch this year
i mean i wasn't pulling for either team
but that was just a good football game
and it's funny
you know you like to pull for the underdog
and for a long time i was pulling for denver
uh marino makes me just crazy mad sometimes because of some of the stupid stuff he does
but he's a good quarterback
i mean l a
has it been uh snowing up there
oh boy i was just up there
and it was about seven inches of snow on the ground
and it snowed all day
well that will make the skiers happy
it snowed that much in denver you know
they got that much up in the mountains you know just west of there
oh you bet
well good to talk to you
do i still can- still can feel that the soviet union as such is still a threat to the civilized western world
and my reasons are based upon not only from what i read in the newspapers what i see on the newspapers but up against some of the fun and exciting things i ran into during my six years as a soldier in the fifth special forces group
but i think just the instability of the country right now is sort of scary
well that's what makes it a powder keg
um naturally we were at the time
so we got lots quite a bit of information as well as indoctrination on soviet tactics and weapons
i went to lebanon in eighty-three before the marines ever got there with the u n peace keeping force and with the training i received prior to going there with captured weapons we kept running up against
these weren't these weren't chinese made copies
but there was also a bunch of russian advisors that were damn good shots
the team i was with we jumped in on the western tip of of the island down on point salinas
and for every cuban there was at least five russian advisors
and they were all shooting state of the art soviet weapons
and the equipment we were capturing and taking from the nicaraguans was brand new out of the crate soviet made material
and let me tell you they are nothing nice to go up against
when they when they graduate from there they can pull terrorist actions anywhere in the free world
and they are very very good at what they do
so until i see the entire quote old guard of the soviet military of the soviet government completely roll over and disappear preferably buried i still consider them a threat
their military is different from ours to where there are extremist gen- generals that actually control tens and thousands of troops
i guess that's what concerns me the most is they're they're so unstable that somebody like that could make uh decisions that would jeopardize a lot of people
well it's in- interesting watching the different soviet states albania lithuania doing their little revolts down there
if uprisings hap- happen in their sectors it is it's going to be a total blood bath
actually they're showing remarkable restraint
and they would level entire areas
you know basically the size of uh the area around richardson
and there won't be anything left alive
and they can do that in about four minutes
and they've got entire squadrons of those just standing by
they used them in afghanistan did re- remarkably well considering the terrain they were flying in
but on a highly populated area like some of the soviet cities would be with the weaponry that's attached on those things there is no place to hide
if the bombs don't get you if the bullets don't get you then then the nerve gas definitely will get you
but during that same time frame didn't you get some feeling that i mean they're getting all these weapons and stuff
you mean in the in the most recent conflict
i i'm i'm a little bit shocked to what the u s has done in terms of selling to iraq
i think we we kind of shoot ourselves in the foot that way too
uh the ones to the south are more regional conflict
they've got a screwed up situation i'll give them that from mexico all the way down into cen- central and south america
and it's very screwed up
and the governments which our government has technically supported for years are corrupt as all get out
and generally the people
and they're tired of it
and they're willing to try anything to get out from under it even if that means going to communism
well i think russia is getting to the point where they're they're about to do something to get out of communism
and he's had his problems with some of the old guard himself
so it may be trying to choose between the lesser of two evils
i understand when they pulled the troops out of uh or they reduced the number of troops in europe after the berlin wall went down
but by no means do i endorse or approve pulling everybody out
but you still better have the key players in place if something does go down even if it's a regional conflict
if united states is going to flex its muscle and be the super power that it is not only does it it can talk the talk but it's got to be able to walk the walk
it's got to have the stuff to back it back up what it's saying
i mean uh
so well this is an appropriate topic the day after earth day
um well what do you think is uh the pollutants the main pollutants in the air
i have trouble with the chemical plants and things like that i just uh i think they put off so much
and they're not regulated enough
well that's me too
on channel thirteen uh they had some some programs the day before
and i'm not sure that about yesterday we didn't really watch it too much yesterday
but the day before they had a lot of programs about the environment and you know how we're affecting the earth and things by what we do
and and they mentioned sulfur and carbon dioxide a lot
and that actually um as our population increases and you know our of course our our cars you know our number of cars increase per the population that's the problem but also like you said the industry pollution
and you know they're reg- they're regulation that's placed on them is i mean it's better than it used to be
but it's incredible that they still don't have you know they don't they're not made to regulate the amount of pollutants that they put into the air
you know i i just
and i know for a fact that they get away with a lot that
you know they're supposed to be regulated because we have a we have a plant i don't know about t i but we have a plant uh a pillsbury plant
in in a town adjacent to ours
and i know people that work there that
but they put out toxic chemicals there just in some of the um what they do uh to uh make their dough and st- to
i mean it's incredible
and um they said that they're you know they have a little creek that runs by them
and some of the people that work there have told me that when they have inspectors coming they you know shut down everything
and they clean up their act but on a normal basis that they're that they're dumping things
and i'm like if they're getting away with it
that's a that's a pillsbury plant
i wouldn't have thought that pillsbury could would the i mean or even had chem- you know well
you know to to break the flours down
and then they they also do testing there
and i don't
you know wh- when you consider you know it's probably not radioactive
but toxic can be can be anything that's cr- uh classified that can damage the earth
so there could be a lot of things that they could put you know that chemical wise that they use to uh that they are testing with
you know like in in packaging
and uh you know just goodness
but they do they do a lot of research
and they do um they do do a lot of the refining up there
uh only thing i can think is bleaching
but i mean i i don't know what's how they do the flour
but um we we're on the southwest side of houston
we don't have that much as far as uh aiming in the plants over on this uh the we- east side does
but uh and they're you know they're right there on the creek also
and uh they've been there for years
i mean you think about it it you know
but i would think it would be easier to detect those things because you could detect them down strean- or stream or such
or you can you can you know do uh testing on the ground itself at that point
but when they pollute into the air and you've got you know and you've got movement through the air it's going to move a lot of that off
so i don't see you know how they can do some of the te-
unless it just hangs there like in places where it's a lot of pollution you know like in los angeles or or the bigger cities where it it tends to get stuck there
you know per per uh per particles in the surrounding community because it's not moved away
and i think well what if somebody's dumped something back there in the and no one knows about it and you know it sinked in through the ground and all that
well i know out in some
it's it's where stillwater is or
i think it's uh
they've had a lot of problems because they've um introduced a lot of dairies there
so they have a lot of cattle in the area
i mean they've got like per per ya- uh per lot
you know they've got like a lot of head of cattle because dairies they don't th- th-
and i read in this article i couldn't believe it where you know like one cow produces like a day produces like a hundred or so pounds of manure
and this thing says that that you know it- people think well cow manure is good for fertilizer
but when you get that much manure it says it becomes a real problem because it's not it's not
when you know you buy cow manure at the store they've added stuff to it
and they've added humus and stuff that
and and this and this article said that they've got a real problem that um you've got toxins and and uh bacteria in the manure that is
what it's doing is it's going through uh
they don't have a very deep um o-
you know they're water they're natural water uh
i forget what that's called with you know
it's like a spring spring water
but it's below the surface
and all this stuff is seeping through to the water
and they're like they're afraid that you know within a certain amount of years that it's they're wa- they're water in that town will be totally polluted
and they won't be able to have any drinking water because they will have um polluted completely polluted so that they're you know there's too many toxins and bacterial growth
and the gr-
and i'm like my god you know
just from that one you know just from them introducing dairy farms
and the the ground will filter some of it but not all of it
i didn't realize a cow one cow produces that much manure
and they were talking like
thousands of cows you know they were talking thousands cows in one little tiny area
good grief these are well fed cows uh
well they are evidently
but um i mean ev- evidently a normal cow produces that much too
but they're just so spread out on ranches and stuff that it's not you know a problem
but when they get them in these tiny little areas you know and they've got a real big problem
and they they said that that what they were doing was scraping it with bulldozers and stuff and taking it to
uh these like ponds that they had to filter it with
but the ponds because they've had so much rain in the past few years they just
and they overflow into the the creeks and stuff in the area
so that just creates
you know there there's
and oh it was just disgusting
people people stand outside their houses and their watch the creeks foam brown and all
oh now that's bad
and i'm just like oh my gosh
and the smell is really bad they sa-
but i i don't know
it really frightens me though as far as the when you think about the you know thinking of just air pollution itself
and then and channel thirteen they're really um emphasizing the problem with acid rain you know
if we if we keep putting that stuff into the air and and you know if we keep creating the problem and not doing anything about it that it's really going to be a problem for um just the the earth you know what the earth is receiving back you know
and then cutting the trees you know that bothers me
as far as you know the
uh we've been wanting to
well not me
but uh it's been recommend- or suggested that we cut a few of the trees down here
you know for what's cut down here you know more will be cut down someplace else
and it will just take that longer to grow back
and trees help so that uh
well they do because what is it carbon dioxide
and they're synthesizing it for us
so uh yeah
i think there's lots that be that could be done to to improve how things are done now
i don't know personally you know
i suppose you know if you just make sure your car is is working properly
you know they're suppos-
but uh i think the only the main thing is just keep on the legis- your legislators back you know as far as
it it's really becoming a problem
what what are we going to have
and and what will we
well i don't know if i know anything or not
but i've i've got some opinions on it
see those type of people that that have the most opinions ones that don't know anything
well uh i've had teenagers
and i now have grandchildren that are teenagers
and i don't know that it might do them a little bit of good to see the world from a different perspective
uh i think this me generation has gone far too far
and the young people are overly impressed
and i think it wouldn't hurt them to step back from themselves just slightly and see things from a m- far more disadvantaged viewpoint
uh i personally know nothing about the peace corps though
um me either
i i went to college and then started working and then got married
but they have
and i'm i'm out on a limb here some type of college uh volunteer work for teachers that they are straight out of college
and they do one year of volunteer work teaching in the uh lower income brackets of the united states
i know that uh my sister
and when they graduated she went to uh teach in a small town down in south texas
and i know that like if you have college notes if you teach in a lower income bracket where they don't pay as much and they cancel part of your you know your college note or whatever
if it's like you know really a you know a lower paying job you know where in a small town you don't obviously you don't need as much as far as to you know to live
and this is money that she's borrowed to form her college education
but she got credits for it
and um i think it would be
i know that also one of my cousins who uh he is in like the therapy type thing
and he was um
but then he was required to go back and work for a certain number of years in this town at uh uh
i mean it's a nursing home or something like that
so you know if
i think that's a good way for people to you know maybe get people to come back to these small towns to work by helping people that normally might not be able to go to college and get the type of degree they want
and it's it's beneficial to the small towns too because
they really really have have a disadvantage that we wouldn't understand because we're in the metroplex
as far as ge- yeah getting doctors and all that stuff yeah
you know if if we had some really major health problem that required a specialist we could find one it wouldn't be convenient
but we could find one
so i i can see the advantage to that one
the peace corps itself is really a uh dying out isn't it
you know i i i think of the peace corps you know more like the sixties and that kind of stuff when
and don't they go into other countries and stuff
uh dig their own wells set up
but it definitely would give a lot of the kids now that have everything given to them that they want to see what it's like if you don't have all the money and can't have what you want when you want it
and but actually they're they're pretty good
but at the same time i think it would do them a world of good
but there's a
i don't i don't know that you could require everyone to
do that for yeah
mandatory just like like the draft
somebody's was didn't really want to be there and didn't have
i mean there would be loopholes just like there is in anything else
you know they they'd figure a way around that one in a heartbeat
and maybe this is why this has died out
and this wasn't the question
but it's it may be the more of the issue versus should young adults
can they go in there and can anyone go into well out of
but say i think bangladesh would have been a good example or some some really desperate situation
and teach them to farm and teach them
and it doesn't do any good
don't know that um if you step back from the current issue and look at it more intellectually there are forever over as long as we know there are races of people that are dropping out
you know we're losing certain
there are people now that are obsolete point and fact just just like endangered species of animals so there are quote tribes of people
and i'm just wondering if you're fighting a natural process there of being winnowed out
but i never can remember what it was
uh but but that they're they're being winnowed because they're where they are they're not adapted to their environment essentially
um and one of the quick examples is the aborigines
uh when we were in australia
sad little things uh i felt sorry for them because their society isn't there anymore
and their belief system and a- all their structured of theirs all the structures of their society are gone essentially
and they're just kind of more like a side show than anything else
and that's sad
but i don't think there's any way you could go uh the peace corps could go in and rescue those people
and i don't think you could have done it fifty or a hundred years ago either
so i i'm wondering if the peace corps is
we've got enough without lea- without a passport
and maybe rather than just require somebody to join like the peace corps for a year maybe like um during college you know maybe have some kind of course where they'd be required to do some kind of community service type work and help people in that area or people in the united states
and i've been out of school too long to answer this
but i wonder if there aren't some sociology courses
there probably are you know
but i'm sure
that's probably like people that do that are are the people that are going to go into social work and stuff
but i think that it wouldn't really be half bad for everybody not to do something you know and realize it's everybody's responsibility to um help these people you know
but i mean because they have to be taught to be
i mean i know that's what my father-in-law was talking about you know when you give these people money
they were bringing up points asking as far as whether they need to give um more money to these people
i mean and that's not really the answer i mean because if they're alcoholics they'll just go out and spend
it on you know booze or something like that
now come on let's be realistic
or you know to find a job where they can learn how to support themselves
i mean i guess we're getting kind of off the subject
i mean it's
that's more realistic than goin- making them go in the peace corps
uh i i think that we should be spending more time
and and again i don't think the the peace corps is is as successful now simply because it's not it doesn't fit the circumstance anymore
uh we've got plenty
you're in uh what r- flower mound
so we're a little fa- you know farther removed from like dallas and some of the areas where they probably have more of the homeless and that type of thing
have you ever have have you been downtown recent-
well right now they've got a kind of a central location off of the main highway
and they've got some great big bins there for newspaper um plastic um i think three bins for glass white green and whatev- whatever other combination there is
and and i think they've got a comp- uh some kind of container for aluminum
they have uh they start off putting out great big huge garbage cans
and of course it doesn't fit right now
but now we start in may breaking it down
and they're picking it all up
so they're going to by
and we have to separate our papers and our glass
and then uh they have one day for like um oh everything you picked up from your yard
and we put that in disposable bags
and they pick that up on monday
so it's really great
i i'm really going head you know completely for it
well that's good
well rowlett had sent sent out a survey not too long ago um in terms in how many people were interested in having a a pick up i guess on the days they do trash or something like that
and apparently a lot of people responded to it favorl- favorably because they're going to do it
i don't know how how soon they're going to do it or how organized it's going to be
but they're they're supposed to initiate that some- sometime in the next couple of months
well does your uh
um i've never noticed that
we don't have a a whole lot because we're in a hospital setting
so most of the things we have are through our cafeteria um
well down in the cafeteria do they have any place where you can put your you know pop cans and things like that
there's there's only one pop machine
and it's not accessible to the cafeteria now
so uh mainly what they serve in there is juice and coffee and tea
not not really
well i work at uh j c penny
and last week they brought
and they're going to recycle them
so it's getting people clean out their closets and such
and then like the week before that they said go through your cupboards and any food that is still good bring it in
and they brought it down to the shelters
and they have one two they have three i think that i know of for cans for people have pop
and they put them right near where they have the time cards
and it works great
and they have one in the room where the
so they're really going at it
and i think it's marvelous because
i i guess rowlett's done a lot for the size town it is
and i think they're trying to to make some changes
i i noticed at the library or someplace this past uh month month and a half ago they were having a speaker um talk about doing lawn work and h- how important it is to to cut your lawn without a bag just to kind of mulch it
rather than bag it up because of a- all the the grass that's being bagged and being hauled away by the garbage trucks and stuff
and it's uh i guess a lot more e- ecological to just mow the grass and let it work it's way back into the soil
well did you watch the program the other night on um was it save america
the only thing i g- thought um that i haven't been trying is when i you know go to take a shower to save the water
but i've already gone to
oh i started years ago i guess not years ago
i would say five years ago turning off my fountain i mean my water faucet
but i didn't realize that was the biggest waste of water
i missed that question totally i mean really bad
but i did exceeding well
but i didn't realize that our garbage isn't being decomposed
well there are a lot of things that aren't
that's uh one of the things i wonder about
uh one of the questions was do you think more should be done or something else
i i wonder about some of the prod- products that they don't take like some of the plastics and things that they don't take uh why why they couldn't do more recycling with those
well i was in uh bizmart the other day
and what i don't understand is there is recycled paper in there
and it cost more than regular paper
and it was only i think uh forty cents more you know fifty cents more
it upset me to realize that hey the recycling that they're going through the expense of recycling
but people aren't buying it
so the cost of it is higher
i s- i seen a lot of adds recently for organic fertilizers and and lawn additives and that type of thing
but the cost is is like double or sometimes triple
what the regular things you fertilizers and things you buy
so in in terms of that
you know and for the environment it's it's there's a good reason to do it
but the cost is kind of prohibitive
now see that's recycling you know
so that people would use this stuff re- over again
it's like when he was saying uh which one was recyclable which was reusable
and the recycle ones are better to use
but lots of times you don't even see the signs on the bottles
and if we're going to really do something they ought to put that stuff out bigger for people to see it
you haven't got enough nerve to say well put it back
i i'd heard something stranger
talk about bottles the other day on uh on the radio station i think it's k l t y they were talking about the
i think it's in canada they're using oh recyclable milk jugs plastic milk jugs
as a a reinforcement for roads
and apparently they they don't break down very easily
they don't expand or or contract when the weather changes
you know they're
along that same line they said they were using um
it was toilets you know the old ones
smashing them up because they're that stuff there is great for in road work
and i thought well that's good
and then i saw recycling on tires between uh
well hoses were being used
and uh uh soaker hoses made out of old tires
i was trying to remember what it was oh i can't think of it now
but i was i was trying to get my uh kids you know to see different things that we could come up with for recycling purposes
and just anything to you know recycle rather than keep throwing it away
but my biggest problem is i take the bags out of the store buy the bags to bring the back
and then i forget to bring them in the store
i wish they'd really push this recycling bit because i never realized i really didn't realize how much stuff i actually throw away
well i think the the more people are aware of it the the more they'll do
i think that's just the biggest problem is keeping it in in front of the public so they understand how serious the problem is and how important it is to do that
you know what i'd like to see a little more
but if they get the little tiny kids saving it now
i really amazed to find out that what is it eighty per cent are filled now in in garbage fills
i mean i might not have that much
but i wouldn't
you know they always offer credit cards for college students
so i went ahead and accepted every one that i was offered
so i p- i pack around a lot of them
but i only use a few of them
they make it really easy for people to uh to get credit cards especially college students
i have uh two daughters who who both are in college
or in fact one has finished now
but they both have
and they give you such high credit limits
it's it's easy to get caught up in the minimum payment trap
and then they they give you uh uh the credit limit
and then you're always s- seemingly up to that limit
now i have quite a few credit cards that i'm always almost up to the limit on most of them
and that's that's how a lot of people get into trouble
i've got i've got two that i you know that usually i'll have a balance on
and then all of the others i just try to use kind of like you would an american express card and and pay it off every month
and that way i feel like i'm getting you know a thirty day loan
but i don't have to worry about you know running them up too high except at christmas
then they usually go then they usually get run up pretty
well you have a lot of discipline
i uh i'm trying my best right now to pay off some of mine
i i've i've paid off about four credit cards this year
and uh but still i have some that are
and especially the visa card that you can go and get cash on
and it seems like every time i'm short of cash i just go get get it from visa
now that's one that's
can you use it like at a bank machine
well uh you can go in a bank and just hand them the visa card and say i want a cash advance
or if they've sent you a uh a number that you can use you know a a personal identification number that you can use in the uh impact machines or whatever you you can do that
because i have one that i don't have a pin number for
you know sometimes you have to ask them for that
and then i have one that uh just gave me the pin number automatically
now we got
that's that's funny you said that because we got a credit card uh my husband and i got credit cards in the mail one day that we hadn't even applied for
now a couple of weeks later we got we got pin numbers
and then we got uh a bill saying you know uh the yearly fee it was like forty dollars
and we we cut them up and sent them back because we we hadn't even applied for them
and we didn't want them
but they they had just automatically approved us and sent them without even contacting us
so i thought man i don't know if i trust this or not
ev- ev- everybody in the world will offer you a a credit card
but it's hard
i mean it's it's tempting when you see something to say well i'll just charge it
and sometimes i'll do that
but usually i i will try to pay everything off the next month
or the ones that usually have an outstanding balance all the time i'll i'll pay more than the minimum payment
just i fe- i feel like even that little bit helps
well you know the way the economy's going and inflation and the recession and all that i think we we really need to try to stay out of debt as much as possible
that's that's why i've i've really started to try to to pay off mine and get out of debt because we never know when we might you know get laid off or something
and they've had had a lot of of uh you know layoffs lately
well i work for t i too
and i think they're getting ready to to probably sell us out our division
they just they just announced that didn't they
so i mean it's it's kind of a bad time to be a slave to your credit cards
it it certainly is
i've uh i have worked on a part part time job uh where i was a collector
for uh uh a jewelry company
people uh that
i mean they have about a thousand collectors i guess
and uh there's just so many people that have bought jewelry which is really a luxury item and then they they just can't pay for it
something something happens
you know and you hear so many stories listening to them like uh you know they lost their job
or uh they they've signed for a friend
you know they got it in their name
but they got it for a friend
and then the friend
and now they're stuck with the bill
and it's ruining their credit
and you really have to watch it this you know
because every every month all of these credit cards report to the credit bureau you know automatically mo- most of them do
and if you if you're uh
it's bad because if you you know your bill is due on the fifteenth then i- y- y- y- you- you're not past due until the fifteenth of the next month
but you know if you if you pay one day after that fifteenth you're not one day late
they don't they don't recognize any time difference do they
and anyway we need to watch our credit reports and all that kind of
that's something i never thought about getting you know checking with to see what what your credit report looked like
well you know you you can do that
and you didn't
you know you i mean you might think you're paying something on time
or and you by that day
and you're thir- thirty days is not real bad though anyway
or something you haven't paid in sixty days or ninety days you know and things like that
i think that discover card has a good idea with you know giving you a little cash back incentive for each amount you you purchase as long as you don't go crazy trying to get cash back
and since they don't have the yearly fee
i've never i haven't gotten one
just because it's uh uh
i would think it wouldn't be you know much more than the eighteen or nineteen percent everyone else charges
so that that wouldn't be too bad
or there's a couple of other places that are able to charge us like twenty-one and twenty-two percent interest
i know i had a charge with uh spiegel
and uh when i did i you know i realized that that it just looked seemed like i was never paying the balance off
and i looked at the credit card agreement one day
and it was like twenty-three percent interest
and and i've always watched it since then
i mean there's no point in giving them any more money than we have to
so anyway they can't bill you any higher than eighteen percent i think in in texas
oh that's great
but there there are a couple of states that can
and one to watch out for is anybody that bills you out of atlanta
well let's see
but they weren't supposed to process it until they delivered it
and i changed my mind
but then they went ahead and charged it on my account
and it took me about eighteen months to get that all of that mess off of my account
so that's that's probably the worst thing i've ever had happen with a credit card
have you taken anything back lately uh that you've bought
well the only thing we've taken back recently are plants
and we had no problem with it
we got our mo- got our money back
well wh- do you think that uh consumer goods goods are generally getting better or worse in quality
but i don't
i i believe that they're better now
you know wh-
electrical appliances i think are pretty good r- reliable
oh did you return it
and uh the people told me well that's the way it's supposed to be
and i fell for it
and uh when i got this one it did a lit- it heated a little bit warmer
and then after one year it started heating only on one side
so either you or your husband can be warm but not both
now i figure th- uh anybody that is dumb enough to iron needs to have an iron that will last a long time
and one year of ironing only once a week is not long enough for it to last
well without even any question
but i think it was the store
and uh well have you been buying any clothes lately any new clothes
well the last thing i bought was a dress last summer
and the buttons turned on it ove- over the winter
and i have not gone back about it
and it was an expensive dress
and they should have put buttons on it that would last forever
and one belt loop the wo- uh you know like the chain link chain belt loop half of it raveled out
and that was i believe a leslie faye dress
and it was i think over a hundred dollars
but i did that one
oh of course i do too
well i believe that we've been talking about five minutes
and norma it is just wonderful to talk to you
and uh what part of virginia uh
uh i live down in the south western part of blacksburg
i i hadn't been down in that part of the state really
well we vacation a lot
uh i wish we did
well we go to maine every fall then that's kind of a family visit and a vacation all up and down the coast and i have a daughter in texas and one in new mexico
so we go out there
and we go to florida and down oh
uh well it really depends
i mean uh
uh my uh fiancee's family's from wisconsin and so we've been out there a couple of times
and uh i uh went to purdue for a couple of years
so i've gone up to indianapolis on occasion to visit friends and uh uh i'm a real big baseball fan
so i usually try to combine it with uh catching a couple of games somewhere
i'm uh i'm a big red sox fan
but uh i uh
uh you're a red sox fan too
i you know go to cleveland to see them play
uh uh that's about it
we don't i mean we do a lot of little trips around here uh
we've gone out to um uh a place in western pennsylvania called falling water
uh have you ever heard of it
it's it's really neat
it's this house built on on a waterfall
and it's uh really cool
um of course we keep picking crummy weather to go out there
uh the first time we went out there was uh the day after hurricane hugo had come through
so i mean they they didn't have any power
and it was really cold and and rainy
and uh we went up about a year later
and it was better but not a whole
so uh where else did we go uh
oh did you
uh my girlfriend has with her sisters
but i haven't been
uh i hear that's nice
just to see why catch a football game actually
well when we came back from the outer banks we came up due norfork
uh spend a day and a lot of money
i've heard uh
i'm not real interested in williamsburg because of the of the price attached
but it's a pretty neat down to just go and walk around if you like to walk
so i can wander around without
i think uh they do the whole with you know paying
they really did throw away a lot of money to get getting one thing or another
but they had a good time
we really didn't do that really this time we just uh visited around
and that's enough for uh
i was uh
and uh my um
up up around san francisco
and uh there was one year when my father was uh my father's company was starting to do stuff down in los angeles
so my father was working down in los angeles for like uh six months or so
uh actually i think it was closer i think to a full year
and you know we'd he'd fly down there on mondays and fly back on fridays
well any time we had a school vacation or something like that we went down to los angeles
so i saw i went to disneyland about five times
and i really have no great urge to go back now
oh it was great because uh well the times that were really fun were when uh we had vacation
but the kids in los angeles didn't so we basically had one of the parks
uh disneyland i mean there's still a lot of people at disneyland
but there was another um another amusement park down there busch gradens uh
there was nobody there when we were there we got we won a log floating ride like five straight times
we just get get done with them and they go oh do you want to go again
we we really enjoy that
so i um keep wanting to get further
you know i thought i would go to florida a couple summers
but never did it
my uh my sister lives in charlotte
and they've gone to
we're uh we're getting married in about
oh are you
our honeymoon we're going up to this um uh place in wisconsin called door county
is it on uh one of the lakes
it's um uh
but there's kind of like a little a little thing sticking out uh
they call it the cape cod of the uh
so uh we're thinking that'll be a lot of fun
she uh she had this uh book of pictures from it that were really nice kind of like a travel guide so uh that should be a lot of fun
well i don't know what our next trip will be i guess our next
well i know what my next trip i'm going to be a grandmother in july
the first the first one
so my next trip is going to be to texas
oh that'll be fun
in the middle in the middle of the summer
well they'll be air-conditioning anyway
is that is that how you got into this uh this
you know uh data base
i was i was just
i mean most of the people i've talk to are from are from texas
so when i you know when i heard you were from virginia i was like oh okay there's somebody different
and you said oh i got somebody down in texas
uh i uh
there's been a couple of other the people uh most of whom are like me that work in in speech labs that are going to use data base
oh i see
so uh it was fun
i actually yesterday i ended up talking to somebody else from the same lab i'm in
and she's uh working on this project too
i mean she's talking on the project too and uh we got back monday
and i got a call yesterday
uh that's neat
i haven't uh i haven't had something like that happen just uh just getting the one guy
uh you're sure have a nice town
uh my uh sister lives on lake
uh we keep wanting to get down there and visit them over the summer
uh just so we don't haven't been able to take really
and i'm know real sure there are um
oh there's one in salem salem rebels
i maybe seeing them um in a town just west of here frederick has a uh has a minor league team that
and uh i think we may be seeing them this
uh that's a nice little town actually frederick uh
oh there's there's some nice things in baltimore you know
the inner harbor and the uh
uh they've just done a uh
you known i
you know the aquarium is one of those things that you know because everybody
so um how do think how do you think we've changed in the last ten to twenty years
uh i'm at a little bit of a loss
you know i don't know
see i'm what i'm about uh twenty-eight now
so when i was eighteen
people are being a little more oh i don't know a little le- a little less bigoted in some ways
well it seems to me that civic freedoms are more restricted
but that may just be because i've changed
you know i used to live up north
down here dallas seems to me the police are militant but uh
oh did you
how long how long you been in dallas
oh about eight years
in fact in the eight years i've been here it seems to me it gets more and more gets to be more and more restrictive place to live
yeah uh you know uh as you're talking like police and stuff like that it's definitely a tough job to do
crime has gone got a lot worse in the last last ten fifteen years
and maybe that has a lot to do with it
i i definitely think that has gotten a lot worse
and you know i i think there's
i'd say my own personal lifestyle has improved but that's more a matter of
you know i'm no longer a teenager in high school
i think there's more pressure like on both parents to work and things like that than there used to be
but uh i don't know
that's just that's one thing i see i see a lot more you know double income families and a lot more like baby sitters raising the kids and things like that i guess
you can't you can't make it
i guess when i was growing up it was it was still the ideal to get a get a home and buy house
and these days you see a lot of people living in apartments forever you know you just don't buy a house
that's that's a good point
so i'm trying to think of anything else that's changed over the last ten or twenty years
i don't know i think the middle class is shrinking and the uh lower class is expanding and sooner or later there's going to there's going to be a turn around
well i hope so you know at some point
but i don't know at what point
but i think it's going to be at the expense of the middle class uh so usually is i think
but on the other hand there's a lot of injustice that needs to be be changed
what uh department do you work in
so how long you been with them since you moved down here
um i'm over at the center one building
well it's a small world
so so let's see
second floor you work with uh linear
do you do you uh do you know alec morton
oh you do huh
well he comes up and pushes us around
so uh so i'm pretty familiar with
well seventh floor
well uh he uh boy he comes up there and gives us all kinds of grief
they they say it's what makes him happy is to give us d a d grief
so i can believe it
um been with t i like twelve
but i started out in lubbock
but the people all seem to be a lot more laid back too
i mean here in dallas everything is just real rush rush
and living in the city is a whole different uh social structure
well i got some friends that uh
seems like he went to school at like devry
oh i see
well he went to school somewhere in ohio
and he's from that area
and uh he works over in the park park central building i think
but uh i haven't talked to him in a while
but um yeah
he he misses it
he used to go back twice or three times a year you know because he missed it
i haven't been back in fi- ten fifteen years
well let's see
how how long are we supposed to talk here
i think we ran out of social social changes to talk about
well my kids are probably needing me to go
so all right
well it's nice talking to you
uh i think
and what do you think that problem is
and i think a lot of it has to do with the fact that we don't train our teachers very well
and then we put the schools in the hands of professional educators instead of the teachers and the parents
oh we don't uh we put too much uh responsibility on the teachers
huh that seems like you've thought this through quite a bit before
so i have some rather strong opinions
and and i'm
and i was not very happy with the results
so if you were to improve it what would you do to improve it
and then i would provide uh use the money that we've paying them to uh provide some special help in training and particularly uh mentor teachers to work with the beginning teachers and the teachers who may have been at it a long time
pay attention to what's happening talk to the teachers uh talk to their kids about school and support the institution
instead of becoming adversaries to the teachers so that the uh the teacher's in the middle
that's uh some pretty good ideas
well you should uh run for a school board position
oh well that i'm not so sure about
well my mother was on the school board
and uh that basically is the extent to which our our family has been directly you know
my parents through the the p t a organization
and my mother was on the school board for eight years
but uh that was that's the extent of which i guess that's more than than some people less than others
i would uh tend to agree with you that there is a problem
but i believe that there's definitely a basic perception and image problem with the fact of even being a teacher
and if there was a way to through the public mind set that image to be a little higher esteem a little uh uh a little more prestige to being a teacher
and with that of course you know you have to pay them a accordingly
if we paid them more it would attract more the the higher educated people to to either move into that field or to continue in that field
and then if you paid them more you'd also be able to demand a higher quality product out of them
uh rewarding people who've been doing a lousy job and instead of getting the uh improvement that we want
so we'd have to have some way to uh reward and recognize the teachers who are doing a good job and give them a a pat on the back and respect and some honor and more money
it's it's hard to tell
it unfortunately it's a and it's a business or an occupation that the results are not as tangible as other ones
so it's very it's very difficult to say that this teacher is doing a better job than this other one other than i guess how you kn- how a person scores in the beginning before the class and then after the class
you know if there's some gauge that they could make
uh also i've alw- i've thought around about the idea of making teaching and the
but some certain type of of position where you're overseen to begin with
now that's a very good suggestion
rather than throw someone in into that environment uh you know it i thought that maybe something
i don't think student i don't think student teaching is enough
i think that at least what i used to observe in student teaching was that some college kid who might not be all that bright to begin with was thrown into a class room with a teacher who was harried and overworked and uh had too many kids to handle and too many things to do and too many interruptions to pay much attention to the student teacher
and then the student teacher didn't stay but about six weeks
so there really was no time to try
much of anything and get significant feedback that would help the the student teacher improve very much
students could watch that and uh criticize the methods used and and analyze it figure out what worked and what didn't work
and then also to video tape the student teachers so they could correct their own performance
that's good as a a a teaching aid
but more you see these commercials that have jimmy walking into class late and it happens that the teacher is an instructor who is in new york while jimmy's in rome
and you know the whole electronic classroom idea
i don't know if i i'm in favor yeah in favor of yeah
i think especially in the younger years you need to have more of the the person contact rather than just the fact that your machine being fed information to to learn how to learn
well another thing i think would be helpful would be to have some sort of of say a national curriculum because one of the problems with getting good textbooks is that we have such a fragmented system for uh curriculums that the textbook makers produce a textbook that will sell in texas and california
and then everybody else is stuck with that regardless of what they want to teach
well that's the two states that adopt on a state wide basis
uh and so it uh
and it was absolutely clear that if you could get your book adopted by texas then you had a built-in market because there were only about three or four textbooks in each subject
and all you had to do is just get your share of those adopted in the individual school districts
and you know a third of the texas market with its millions of kids is a heck of a lot of textbooks
and then the states that either don't adopt on a state wide basis or don't have as many kids just have to follow along and take what texas gets
but texas uh adopts state wide all the way through the twelfth grade
well definitely is a national problem if that they need to address
and i hope maybe we're going to get somewhere with a little more attention being paid to it with uh reagan's uh new education secretary and uh you know trying to do some uh trying to produce some new programs anyway
well i've enjoyed speaking with you
oh it's uh it looks like a little shot gun house almost
it's uh an older home
oh i wouldn't know
because i was uh we had saw some termites
and we thought about getting it sprayed
so where do you live at
i mean wha- what part of town in here in denison
see that's north
or down here in denison
i live i live in plano
so it's north to me
but you don't have a texas accent
well i'm originally from uh ohio cincinnati
so i'm famili- uh familiar with uh
so the uh
and uh the way in which people speak
anyway my home is um i guess it's about twenty-five hundred square foot
and i have uh four bedrooms at the present
and so we're going to enlarge our master bedroom and take out a couple of walls and enlarge it and then shuffle the rooms around a little bit
and we've got a den
and uh we need the one extra room
like like you said our rooms are too s- the bedrooms are too small
but the bedrooms are too small
there's they uh
and they tend to put windows in the strangest places
you know we have windows in our bathrooms which really makes it difficult for
yo- you're kind of limited in what you can do there and everything
well we've got at least two windows on every wall in the house
and you can't really clean them on the inside you know
the house is about um i'd say almost thirty years old
so it's not a new home
it's it's seen some wear and tear
and he did it hisself
so most of that by now is falling apart
you know well i mean it's not just horrible
but like this tiles come loose off the wall
and i don't like that at all
um that is awful
with that uh the great big tiles square tiles like that you put on the floor
the the huge one
i wouldn't mind it if it was like short tiles
but this looks like floor covering on the wall
oh and also they're very heavy
and so they tend to come off a whole lot easier
and short of putting nails through it we can't get it back on
and he rewired the house
and it's shorting out here and there
that's one of the things we've been fortunate with is our uh wiring is okay
we don't have a we don't have enough power
um or our breakers aren't aren't powerful enough to take to to really help with the load in the house
i mean we need to redo some rewiring ourselves
but our plumbing is awful
there is n- there is a shut off valve that's outside that doesn't work
and there's no other real shut off valves inside the house
so if something breaks we have to shut it off from the main in the street
and oh it's it can be really bizarre
and we never know where it's going to flood
but it runs about ten minutes fast except for about a month for about a month the the clock ran normal
and then the power went off again
and we hooked it back up
and now it's running ten or fifteen minutes fast again
but on the east side of the house it runs fine
oh boy you do have a strange wiring problem there
but uh oh no
well that's something
and he won't even touch electrical stuff
i mean he'll do a little things
but he won't do any major rewiring
but that's about as far as he'll go
well that's the way mine is you know
i mean he he well he said he went up in the attic and looked around
and he was like oh my god
and we had squirrels in our attic when we first moved in because the roof was so sorry
i mean when we moved in
well he put
your husband probably knows
well he's got seven layers of shingles up there
and he told us it was a completely new roof
we stripped ours we stripped ours off
and we completely s- completely stripped all the old wood shingles off put decking up put the paper down and i mean just started from scratch
and we and we had we had almost i'd say about half of the roof off
and it did this
and uh uh a house full of snow
and a house full of snow and rain
and it came down
we have plastic you know just tied down on everything you know as best we could
real thick edge stuff i mean
and the wind came in from the north
and it just blew everything off in the middle of the night
and we were asleep
and and i woke up
and i got up
and it was about four o'clock in the morning
and i heard all these these drips drip drip drip drip drip drip
and i mean it filled up my light fixtures because they're the old kind
and i would go in
and i'd turn on a light in the room you know
and the light would come on
and the whole thing would be full of water
and i mean the light would still come on
the neighbor's la- uh washing machine had uh over done something
but it was leaking just pouring water in
and it all went through to her roof
and it was coming out of the lights fixtures
so she woke up with about six feet of water in her house
oh my lord
but it's quite a bit quite a bit
so did you have carpets and stuff
oh several of our rooms got ruined
we have um
we h- are on pier and beam
so it it got into the carpeting got into the floor
but it got into the floor and rotted the floor and made it stink
and they had it
i mean the insurance company was paying for the new roof
but they also ended up having to pay for the damage when the re- roof was being repaired
you know which really wasn't our fault
i mean we'd done everything we could to keep out the weather
you know and stuff
well you got to redo it the way you wanted it in the end
uh the roof
it's it's been done for quite some time
uh see it's three
it's just been a- at three years
i mean it's it had detached it had a dir- detached garage
and my husband's built a walkway across
and we're going to brick up the garage to match the house and things like that
what uh the walk
i mean this is what
and they're varied
they don't uh uh encompass uh many handcrafts like knitting and that kind of thing
but i do uh quite a bit of wreath making
and my dogs are my hobbies
now what do you mostly do
well mostly right now i'm a
we're uh we're about to take the kids to
uh i've got a little girl who's six and a little girl that's three
well i think that's better than having that party at home
well uh this is a friend's party
and they they rented
or you know they
they uh just rent skates and stuff for the kids
the the the skating rink does the rest practically
well not that long
uh just since october
but we did spend twenty years in norman
but we needed to get back uh to our older parents
but i am loving it
um what did you all do
well my husband was with uh
and then he went with uh
and uh he just quit a perfectly good job and came we
so is uh is he working there then
he's doing uh quite a bit of consulting work and
and he's contemplating
he he's liking this free time actually
well how did how did you get uh hooked up with the t i switchboard thing
oh i see
my wife has talked more than i have uh
i haven't i haven't
uh the the call was probably for her
they wouldn't accept my uh t i n number
so we put hers in
but uh uh like i said we're getting
but uh some of
and they've they've all been in dallas
but she hasn't talked to anybody
so that's interesting
well you haven't told me uh what sports that you are active in
well the sport i like best probably is basketball
but uh i guess i'm probably better at softball
and so i'd
like during the summer months it's occupies quite a bit of my
but i play in a couple of leagues and and occasionally in a tournament or something on a weekend
but my family usually goes with me
well i think that's uh easy entertainment for a
well they uh
a good friend of mine that plays on one of my teams we uh
and they have a couple of kids that are almost my kids age
so they play together
and uh tina enjoys uh
you know that's kind of nice
well it's getting
well it's been raining a lot here so far
so we haven't really had any kind of real heat
i think it's going to be warm enough this afternoon we were noticing a while ago it's already eighty in in the house
so it looks like an air conditioner
or maybe this evening anyway
but you know i'm sure you're familiar with that living
we go we go through enid you know quite a bit
and my my parents live in southern illinois
so we drive
and well l- lot of times we take seventy-five
and uh it seems like seems like that goes through enid
enid is uh
it's uh directly across the straight uh state from tulsa
um i know i've seen
well enid is
not uh an unknown little city
it uh an awful lot of people know where it is or have been there
was uh a very uh self-sufficient uh wealthy
until uh everything happened
but there's a lot of uh
you said you've just lived in north carolina just like
and you really like
it there huh
i've never been there but they sure
well it's it's
uh this winter
if it got to be forty degrees i decided it was too cold to to walk the dogs
my wife and i spent a couple years uh
and it rains
you know a lot there
but you get used to it
i mean it's like a fine mist all the time
and it doesn't really
that's the way it is was there too
uh i know it did it all february
and some people said to me well that's our wintertime
well i know you
and i've enjoyed talking to you
well i have enjoyed talking to you too
oh thank you
and i hope you enjoy
well i hope
uh how long have they been recycling there in virginia
um actually quite a a a while
um i've lived here for six years
oh i'm sorry
i live in an apartment and my ap-
uh anyhow they have facilities here in my apartment complex for recycling paper only
uh i've been recycling for maybe about two years now and at ano- ano- another public facility where they have you know recycling of glass uh aluminum and paper
have you have you cycled recycled plastic also
and that's what i i don't understand exactly why they don't have that option
we we have out here uh up until just this last year in on you are town there wasn't any really good way
but not all that many
it wasn't very well advertised but recently uh the refuse department has has uh is working on getting a system going where we will actually have uh a bend that we put things in for recycling these other things so it it should be good uh
i think it's a marvelous idea when you think of uh when i just think of the papers that i dump out i mean there just
now an additional thing is uh
where i work they also have recycling there of uh all white paper and of you know cans also so i mean a lot of people you know right at the vending machines
they have receptacles that you know
and near the
xerox machines they have places you know for your
you know i keep a little box at my desk you know
and i just throw as i'm using the white paper you know i just throw it right in there
and then you know they have someone that comes around and pick it up you know every afternoon which you know is an excellent idea
i guess one of the things i think that needs to happen is we need to be better informed about about it
there's needs to be more public uh
service of programs or something that would let us know had a happens to it and helps us to become enthused about it because of what is happening and there's
and i i think that's a shame
they need to uh do a little more
i'd like to know for instance when i when they say uh plastic all plastic what kind of plastic
uh now maybe they just sort it after they get it and throw out what they can't use
i don't know but i i'd be glad to organize it
i have to actually go to two different recycling areas because one of them is that uh
their aluminum cans is for uh children's hospital for a burn fund so all the monies are donated you know
there you know because the other
now that gives
and before even at work
saving them for you uh
and you know i would have them drop right drop their cans off in my office
and then i would haul them you know here to this place for the children's hospital fund which got people really going into it
i think i think helping us be more enthu- enthusiastic about it
helping us maybe maybe using the money for something special that would be like paying off the national debt
but i i think that's
right i think they there needs to be a little bit more in the area of of uh ad- advertisement
and letting public letting you understand
more of what it is you're doing why you're doing it how you're it's done and
what what happens to it because i think that's that would help a lot
and i'm sure you know in the near future i would think they would be coming out with more
you know i've seen a definite trend you know towards more recycling
everywhere you know even at mcdonald's
you know with their their use of no
i i'm glad
i think i think it is getting more you know advertisement
and all these things that
well i think
i'm that's about my uh
but i i enjoyed talking to you
well i did too
i have uh
i well i used to have the opinion that there wa- that there really was not any more crime in america in the cities anyway than there was in previous centuries uh before uh
the reason there seems to be so much was the fact that the police now had advanced uh reporting methods with computers and other devices
and those statistics
however i have been persuaded lately i guess simply by the uh overwhelming data that seems to be available that there is indeed a lot more violent crime
i am in i am in washington d c
you know i do a lot of business here
and i come here quite often
and and that again is a is a sort of media perception there's some absolutely lovely and marvelous and peaceful areas in washington
but it's it's real uh
there's pockets of violence that is so violent that they uh
now just to focus on that a minute i guess uh uh
became the drug czar uh for uh president bush he was going to focus on it on this area and do something about it
and i see that even he was met without with with little success even though the entire i guess a a quite a bit of money and other uh planning efforts went into that
what do you what do you think is causing all this
because it seems that there
well i i have three theories about it you know three things
and it's brought to us by two things
one i i believe that this is a function of uh the violence that young people see on television and the movies
and i am not just talking about you know uh role models of gu- of tough guys and gangsters and things like that
i am not even i am not even convinced that maybe things like football hockey and th- th- the you know the and even baseball games now where the everything is settled with a fight you know the the immediate need to
and and then i i am an advocate of hand gun control to some degree
so i think that particularly
i i was reading the other day about uh corpus christi texas which has the the highest
i think it's corpus christi that had the highest rates per hand gun death in america uh per capita
i was i have not seen that
i mean the saturday night special stuff
what are your views
i tend to agree with you with you know
it seems anymore uh a movie can not be considered good unless there's just some some sort of violence
and and along with that you know
and then you start making a movie and
but so they just throw something in there just to say they have it
well that's that's that's the impression i get you know
and i and i imagine that it's you know it just feeds upon itself when we have this sort of violence in society
and uh you have to amp-
it has to be even uh magnified to to attract people's attention i guess
and i am sure that it does form role models for young for young men and young women
uh i mean i i read now where we are you know
women are arr- young women are arrested fighting with knives over over whatever whatever reason which is kind of unheard of when i was young
now i do not want to sound like an old fart
seems that those things happened befor- did not happen in that manner before television
and i i i i have to think that that it has some influence on it
i listened to a radio talk show today at lunch time uh rush lynn bottom
but ther- there's a fellow that had called in and was lamenting about the
and they were just really coming down on him because of some of the things he was just some of the things that he believed in some of his morals
for instance uh they asked him if he spanked his kids
and he said you bet i believe in discipline
and people i i i i guess they confus- confused discipline with punishment
it seems anymore that uh if if you have you know this type of a moral stance that people come down on you
it's like you know hey everybody has to be free to do their own thing
and i disagree
and i think that's really contributing to this high rate of crime
well i mean i i guess what i wanted to say and i stopped uh i do not know i got diverted was that that uh there's so mu- there's so much of a return from pris- to prison that the rehabilitation programs seem to be a failure
i recognize there's there's over crowding problems
and and since we have decided to put everybody in jail that commits a crime now that that's complicated the entire process
i guess it's the reflection of the society where where we have so much more mobility and less attachment to uh
you know it does not seem to be any responsibility to the community where you where you live
or i do not mean respons- attachment and responsibility
well nobody feels responsibility to do something
it's like oh boy i wish they would stop doing that
i i do not know how that's
i do not think it's done by uh
you know i am sort of a a an advocate of of uh of letting people of having free speech
and i guess to curb uh
television uh the violence on television and in the movies would be contrary to my beliefs in that
and then how many
and the sacrifice is not that great
you know what you see and how yo-
i mean what you see affects how you think and therefore what you do
i think i think that's correct
but you know as soon as you start uh
well texas has uh texas has uh has always struck me
i mean i i i have lived in and out of texas both in the service and uh uh short business stints
and it seems to me they are a pretty pretty tough law and order state
but that's a
but yet that does not seem to have effected the amount of violent right in the state
just citing that you know
uh unfortunately you have got a lot of the
some well a lot of it can be contributed to th- the racial differences i mean just that we are so close
i talked with um i talked with people from richardson and plano
and uh the first three days
and then yesterday i talked with someone with from pennsylvania
i i tried to make calls two different days
and i couldn't get through
oh i know
i've been trying to you know do that
and and sometimes i just can't wait that long
so i just hang up
but i knew as soon as i heard your voice
i thought kathy's it's kathy kester
well let's see
and you're such a reader i know that
well i don't read all that much for enjoyment
i mean i read a lot for school
but gee i just don't have much time for enjoyment reading
the the last book i picked up was a book by judy bloom
and it was um it was called um smart women i think
um or something like that
and it was it was kind of
it was it was written back in the early eighties
and it was all this this um divorced woman syndrome of the um
it was almost like a a pre-aids scare kind of thing
because i i right away looked at when it was copyrighted
because i could tell by the theme of almost when it was written
and it was all about women searching for themselves
that kind of was um kind of a pop psychology time for wh- when a lot of books like that were coming out i think
and so that makes real sense that that's um when it was written
um i haven't wasn't really aware that she had written anything for um adults
just more aware of her jer- you know
and she's more famous for that
but she has been writing for adults also
and so i thought hey i'll just try this you know
it was very um
i wonder if she's written anything really recently if she's got anything printed in print
because i i remember seeing a new book by her that was out
and i think it was a it was an adult book
but that's the last thing i i've read
let's see i think i read oh
when i was on vacation um between semester break and summer you know on semester break between spring and summer and i went to my mother's
i read a book that i have should have read when i was probably in high school
i read um jane eyre
it was um uh pride and prejudice
and um you know i i didn't know what to expect except i had heard that that jane austen was such a wonderful novelist
i mean i was was very much impressed with the way her plot was put together so
and um and you know i just
but i as i say i was pretty much ashamed that i hadn't read something before then
because i i think i was i think i read it in college
or had to write it read it in high school or college
but i don't remember it
and then when jennie had to read it at gettysburg and i got her the i got her someone
i think it was um oh some actress reading it
oh how interesting
you know they had an abridged version of it on tape
and so i got that for her
and she loved doing that
oh i'll bet
but i remember that was the book
and now i i mean i think it's around here somewhere
well i read that
and then i'm trying to think um
usually i try to to find something long
if if i have long periods of time like christmas vacation or you know when i know i'm not going to be doing anything for a while um
oh that's what i do too
and that's about it because otherwise i'm reading so much for school
i'm um i have just started reading a book
actually it's for school
but it's for um
there's a a literary jour-
well not a literary journal
i'm doing some reviews of books just to what to sort of recommend to wh- whether or not a full-scale review should be done for the journal
oh how neat
just got a i got a th- this one
um most of the stuff is on uh literary criticism and philosophy
and it's a a a biography
oh that's fascinating
i mean it it's fascinating
um but it's so long
i i don't really have the time to read the whole thing
but i think
but it's it was written
i mean the the copyright is nineteen ninety-one
so it's a brand new book
oh it's a brand new book
oh that that would be wonderful to read something like that
and he really this man really shed some light on um
i mean you know that was it was families had just loads of musicians
and they just went from generation
just with these with these all passing it from one to the other
oh that's interesting
if that's you know that's kind of what
but i have to
wow that's rough
but at least i
well that's a neat thing to be involved in
because i think our i think my alma mater um gettysburg i think they were just starting a magazine
i think that's probably a sort of a thing to do in small colleges
you know you see you see a lot of small colleges doing things
because it attracts really a a lot people's interest
but uh another one of my projects this summer is actually it's part of my research assistantship is um
now translations what do you mean translations of of
um well where where for instance um a baudelaire poem that was written
oh i see
and the translations are all so different from one another
oh that's interesting
so it's multiple translations of single works
oh well let me tell you
you know i'm
there are days when i would be prefer
but um this is not on the subject
well i i feel in light of some of the accidents and so forth that have happened lately that i think there are some occupations that they should such as the health field the transportation field uh
they're already doing it in the armed forces where they handle weapons and so forth uh
they do it to prisoners so i i uh i i i feel like it should be mandatory in some professions
and i think if if uh an employer feels that he wants to to drug test employees and they don't like it then they should not be employed there
you know i would not mind it
i i especially agree that if it's an area where they could cause somebody else you know harm or injury absolutely
and i don't have a problem at all with employers uh testing in the hiring
but i i i don't
uh-huh unless an employer has a reason to believe that his uh the work competency of of the employ- employee is is hurting the business
i mean maybe it's uh
right and then it's not a problem
number one because generally if if they are involved in that type of thing they are into theft and as an employer
and the first
but but my concern is uh
um i'm not even
uh i'm concerned in the medical field
i i i think they should screen for alcohol in these areas too because i consider that a drug
and that i think is even probably more widely abused by you know the masses than than drugs so to speak
oh i know
but when you consider they could be driving an airplane or driving a bus or a train um and it doesn't take that long
they don't have to be totally roaring drunk just a little off on their timing could could mean life
now t i has the random testing policy and and you know our names or our employee numbers or whatever are in a in a pool so i've already been tested once when i was hired and and once since they initiated this random testing program
oh my word
but i work with one girl who was tested her name got got randomly selected three times in six months and i think that's the only reason i have a problem with it when there's no you know there's no reason to suspect someone you know
that that's getting a little bit
well as long as you accept that it is a random a random testing uh you know to to alleviate
you know so your name came out of pot when they spun the wheel
that's that's just the way it is
i would i would rather have it that way to know that i was chosen at random by a computer than to think that somebody turned me in because i i think there's when you let other employees turn in people
there are so many people with with their petty axes to grind it could really get out of hand
so i i i would really rather know however
if if somebody does observe you at say at a party uh using drugs i would think that it would be their obligation to report that
and i guess you'd report that to a supervisor maybe anonymously or something because i i would feel very uncomfortable working with someone i knew was using either illegal drugs or abusing alcohol
i'd just i'd feel really uncomfortable
but there there would be even be a situation where you were at a machine and working with somebody that was that way
we have we have a lot of people who work on the line
so it wouldn't
you know they couldn't hurt me with their ten key or something
but out on the line they've got people working some serious equipment
i i just think employers have to have especially given today the drug abuse that goes on i just think employers have to have some kind of way to see that they're not being put at risk
and and i'm not sure but what some of the insurance claims aren't due to uh illnesses brought on by drug abuse or alcohol abuse
and in the long run we're all paying for that so it i mean it protects us in the long run hopefully when they do that
i i was trying to remember there was a court case uh here where i live just a few months ago
the city workers they wanted to um
the city government wanted to institute the random drug testing and the city workers uh took them to court to protest saying that it invaded their i guess first a- the the search and seizure amendment and it's still tied up in the legal channels
so i'm curious especially since t i a local you know employer is also already doing it seeing what they'll say about it especially since
is it is it uh just a small group of the employees that are concerned
well it's the whole it's the whole city
they they just don't want to be drug tested
you know we've never my husband and i have never been in a situation where somebody said you have to be drug tested
uh my husband's retired from i r s agents
and so we we in our minds we're thinking what's the big deal
you know you know you don't
so it's not as big a deal
and you sometimes wonder when these people protest so much
and and then they say well if you give them the right to do this then they're going to take some other right away from you
but i i firm- i think that an employer has the right to ask you to do anything
and of course the big deal one of the big deals now too is to that when you come into a company as you sign a paper saying that i will go take a
and how do you hold to yours
i i never keep a budget
well that's that's good
and uh and it's it's sor- sort of always worked
uh but that depends you know on the individual if they can
well that's a lot of it
uh i know we tried several different ways
but we didn't keep it up
and she won't quit doing it
and that was the envelope system
and you put the cash in envelopes marked for that
so you have one for entertainment and one for groceries et cetera
and then for some reason taking it out of that envelope and seeing it in cash instead of in check form uh causes you to realize how much is left
and she even writes down on the envelope as she subtracts and kind of debits on each envelope
and then at the end of the of the period pay period if she has any left that much is for fun or entertainment
and they kind of work it that way
and a seems like the problem that they were having of all the of all the things that worked was not planning enough for the incidentals that we couldn't think about
and those are the ones that will kill you
you know the accid- the accidental fee or the car repair or the things that weren't supposed to be every month
i i couldn't probably be bothered doing that every month
and and ever since
uh well we've been married almost thirty years now
you learn to get through you know to the end of the month
i mean you wouldn't like on payday think boy i can go do this and that and this and that
because if you charge things uh you pay all your bills at the beginning of the month
or you get paid the last day or next to the last day
and there isn't anything left to spend anyway
well that's true
and we're going to go ahead and try to just live on what we earn instead of guessing ahead of what we probably will have next month
we we tried to to to
or we are paying them off now
uh there was a time when maybe we didn't take all of them off
but you just sort of had to watch what you put in
and for most of uh
i mean i'm a substitute teacher
and i've only substituted i guess for the last fifteen years
so there's only been really one working
and uh it it works for me
but i can't see that it would work for probably the majority of people
well i could say it's kind of
you know that's that's good
you ma- you probably have a little extra than you have to have to
and so that that's the difference there where sometimes like i know if we've had an especially bad month and we're just almost getting down to payday then i think if we could really budget
and that was a real eye opener
it it is when you do it that way
but to to have lived by that every week would have been tough for me because sometimes i'll spend less on groceries but we'll go out
so it's kind of hard to say this is how much you're going to spend going out for fun
well we we eat out a good deal at this point
i i started subbing just to go on a vacation and saved
all that money so because i knew that you couldn't you know spending
we were going to go for ten weeks uh
so i started
and and it was paid for
and it made a big
and you enjoyed it better probably
and so i think that that's difficult for most people
but then my father was
and you know you never could afford anything although we could afford everything if he wanted to um
so if you're out like in a department store and there's a sale you're just real careful not to let your urges get hold of you
that's that's excellent
and i'm working on it
and i never worried about saving money because we just we're in the savings plan at work
and they took it out
and i think though that we need to have some liquid around that you don't have to go through the company to get
well we never had too much of that but then we never had any really emergencies that uh
and we didn't buy really new or expensive cars
i think the most my we're looking at cars now uh we ever spent for a new car was like six thousand dollars
and they were mainly used cars
well that's the best thing to do
well that's that's going to payoff on retirement
you know we've been rather
well it uh
well each time they used to call in and tell me their space is limited and to please uh
well i almost forgot the topic
i was waiting so long for uh for it to find somebody um
well so what is your favorite t v show
uh major dad
oh you like that one
i i love it
and it's funny
uh i've never really watched that one
you know it's funny how you can just get in a mode where you only watch certain shows and uh you know there's so there's only a few that i that i like to watch routinely
probably my favorite is um oh
well i like shows like growing pains
and uh what's the other one now they moved from tuesday night to wednesday night
so i don't get to watch it very much
that's my favorite uh
i i think basically they pr- same thing they promote family values
i i guess that is supposed to be put out at a time when i was growing up or whatever
and uh it's just a real cute show
uh i i guess i like the shows that really have a real sense of uh i don't know honesty or sort of a purity value i guess
i i don't like it uh lot of the shows that that i've liked in the past like uh oh golden girls
and some of them tend to get so risque
and when you have children uh watching it that sometimes really starts to bother me and uh that's one of the reasons
i mean if you want to go all time favorite show probably one of them was little house on the prairie yeah
which i just i was i always felt was wonderful uh and so many of them nowadays like i said i think are just um uh they they go after well
well there was
but there's a sense of ho- i guess purity in the show
like one of my favorite shows used to be happy days but uh you know richie always used to be so you know just so honest and pure i guess
and when he left the show you know that it seemed to be missing that part of it and i never did like it after that so i don't know
i i say see the same thing in like wonder years and a lot of the shows that i like to watch
i i agree
uh do you like the sports programming
um i i enjoy those also almost as as much to a certain extent
our whole house is baseball fans and uh we enjoy that
so you're going to watch a game tonight
and uh oh yeah
so do you do you have a favorite for the series or anything
uh probably the pirates
but only because of steve bushel i guess otherwise i really don't care that much
but uh you know i'm i'm annoyed that the rangers got rid of him
and uh i'd like to see him do well like all the way to the bank i guess
live in live in plano
i i like steve bushel
but i don't really like the pirates
i'm a big saint louis cardinals fan so uh i'm kind of i'm kind of pulling for the braves over all
they you know they they've come from so far down
so i keep hoping the rangers are going to do
one one year they
maybe they'll make it i don't know so but uh yeah
but uh i guess my my favorite shows are the
and you know that getting back to the point that you made that's really true
and her daughter was talking about birth control you know and my daughter was kind of walking in during that time
and you know she's only seven years old
so many of them now um you know it just seems like they feel like they have to stick that stuff in
and and uh you know i'm you know i'm i'm an adult and i have adult tastes now
but i don't need that uh i i like things that uh are are wholesome i guess
well that that seems to be more our values too
like the wonder years i i mean it's kind of risque stuff for maybe for teenagers
you know or and you can kind of relate to it you know
i enjoy that a lot but uh you know i agree with you
and it's funny because the shows
like a lot of them that used to be considered risque like three's company and stuff i think they they maintained
there was that uh you know there was really the period that was going on there
i mean he really wasn't messing around with the girls
but everybody perceived him that way and stuff but as soon as you know he went to move in with another girl the show just died and it's it's interesting that a lot of the shows are that way
so we're going to talk about uh what kind of clothes we wear while we work
oh you do
well you're like me then
oh that's good
oh my you are busy and they're all girls
so all girls around here
uh really sweet
anyway as far as clothing goes um my wardrobe changes all the time depending on my size
and they all rotate all the time kind of the same stuff all the time though
i don't uh get a whole lot new right now
and when it's cold i'm wearing sweat pants and
i i like jeans a lot
well that's that's good
and now nothing seems to be comfortable because i bulge in all the wrong places
oh and it's it's frustrating
i just i find i have to get the right kinds though or it's not comfortable they
it it works best if they have pleats in the front and uh they have to
so it has to be not the straight up and down levis kind
but um but i
when i was i was pregnant through the summer this time and i wore dresses all the time because it was so much cooler and so much more comfortable not to have something binding on your waist but uh
and i remember i wore sundresses and you know just those real cool dresses almost the entire time
and i had one that was born in december
so um it was a little bit because it was a real warm winter so even even into like november and december i was still wearing the short sleeve dresses
so i i didn't really need warm clothes
oh i haven't tried those
oh they are so comfortable
it's it's just um you know a light weight kind of like a sweat suit but made out of that real light polyester stuff
and it's just great because you can put you know you can decorate them up or dress them up if you want
or you can just wear them with you know tennis shoes if you want
so they're really nice
but i sure never wear them
well i don't either
if we if we had professional jobs where we go into an office and have to wear a jacket or something that would make a
i worked part time when my oldest was a baby and um i had to wear a dress every day
and and it was a little bit hard to uh wind down
i would i would have to drive six thirty five home
and i would be burning up like in the summer time by
i i remember that from when i was
but offices they keep them so cold in the summer that you can't wear regular summer clothes and be comfortable you've got to have something to add to it or something i don't know if you can
and then when you drive home like especially if you're in a lot of traffic which you are in dallas
uh-huh because i always hated to run my air conditioner just sitting still all the time i was afraid i'd make the car overheat
so i would roll my windows down
and um i had a friend who used to take shorts to work
oh that's funny
and after work she'd go in the bathroom
because you can ruin your good clothes getting so hot in them if you especially if it's something that has to be dry cleaned which i don't have any of
um even when i go to church i have to have something i can just throw in the washer when i'm through
oh i generally go to the quickie places just because they're cheap
uh we have four
but most of them are gone now so there there might be
but we were taking you know uh four five and six people out
and we live- we lived in ohio prior to this
uh we were up near cleveland
uh but i look for service even at the quickie places type things
uh i don't like to go to the drive-thrus because sometimes they get your order wrong and then you're stuck
and it's a pain to have to stand there and see what it is before you leave so i really don't like the drive-thrus that much
i i like to go and eat there
but i would say service uh atmosphere and whether the food is good
and on going out i like steaks
so we try to hit those places when we can
and my husband and i like getting the salads or the lighter meals and then that way they can get their burgers and fries
and we can have a salad bar so sometimes we drive for a couple hundred miles until we find a wendy's
and in in in the countries unless it's a large city i guess dairy queen and wal-mart are their main
my husband likes uh dairy queens
so he's a fan of of dairy queen
and and we'll go even in town here at times just as a a change although i'm not that excited about it
but we've eat we eat out so much it's gotten so i don't like to really eat any place
but yet i hate to cook food at home so that might be why i look for inexpensive places just because we're eating out probably five nights a week maybe
or we eat junk food at home uh now my husba-
well what are some of your your favorite inexpensive places
oh we'll go to them all
and we uh
and if not we can't because it's cheaper so mine is monetarily i guess strongly monetarily based
uh we'll go get pizza and uh at little caesar's although the kids prefer domino's
oh we are little caesar fans here that's where we always go
but it's just a lot cheaper than than domino's
mcdonald's uh we've sort of been off of that for a while
and no particular reason
and she never wanted us to show up there so i don't we don't go there that much
a nice meal oh
it's usually when we're out of town and i'll order steak or steak and lobster combined so it's really not in town
and when we have something to celebrate we head to houston's
and you wind up waiting about an hour but the food is good
and they've got a nice patio area that you can wait and get something to drink unless you get there at five o'clock
but they have real good signature salads there and nice steaks
so that's our nice place to go
but well we don't go out that much
i gue- well i guess we do go out without kids
and uh with my husband traveling he can get all he needs
and i've been eating at home all week long with the kids and would like to go out somewhere
so we have a conflict of interests on the weekend
well i think i i never have liked to cook food
but i think it all began eating out when we had uh the boys in in different uh baseball on baseball tea-
it was mainly baseball teams and my husband would coach
so we were never home at the same time
i'm not one that's going to fix you know the meal at two o'clock in the afternoon so they can eat it all day whenever they're there
if there not there in between five and six well then i guess we don't eat today
or you go
so that you know that really snowballed when we got down here when i started to sub make money i went oh well i'll just sub to
well the types of vacations that i usually take
then i do you know before i take it
um i need to definitely take a vacation where all all i do is rest
and i guess to do that i'd probably have to take it at home
but um the vacation spots that i like to go to are places like the bahamas and florida
we went to uh cape hatteras
well we we were out visiting one of our kids in maryland
and we went down to cape hatteras for a few days
and uh uh the the waves were huge
i've never quite seen waves like this one and uh i was standing in water not more than in barely above my ankles and uh you know when the waves go in the waves go out they kind of all of a sudden you're in sand above your ankles
and i was standing there talking to my daughter
and this really big wave came and totally threw me
and one foot did not come out of the sand
and it tore the ligaments in my knee
so i'm never going to another beach again
i enjoy i enjoy going to the beach and to beach areas
but i really don't like to get in the water the ocean
well i i love to go and play around
at least i always did but although actually
and i basically
i my dream vacation is alaska
and someday i hope we can afford to just take a humdinger of a vacation
and i used to live in colorado oh sometime ago for a couple of years
and i really enjoyed that
i'd i'd like that
uh i haven't been to yellowstone for a long long time and i would uh we've been talking about going there next summer
uh i don't know we'll have to to
but you know it seems when your family is is different places a lot of trips involved
and my mother and his mother
and so we have to you know go to those
well you have you have a lot of vacation areas you can go to
well i know
but i'm tired of them
uh my my idea i guess of the ideal vacation would be to begin with uh
you know so just absolutely you know first class fly where i want to rent a car if i want to
uh you know just the really the nicest hotels
and uh that that's what i um you know that's what i would like to do
you know i would rather much rather get on a plane and get there and then enjoy myself
i just uh
that that does absolutely nothing for me
i can say that i think my my favorite spots are still to go to go where there's mountains and and a lot of trees and and wildlife to view
and and uh
i i agree
i can i can do that too
and uh you know i think if i had if i had the money i would probably go to europe every year
because you know i think that they have they have it all over there in just a few tiny
two two miles
you know there's mountains
and there's beaches
uh i i guess i've never really thought about it that way
but she's uh a very picky eater
and our our standard excuse for not going someplace like that is you know gee holly would starve to death if we
so football i love this
well we're from colorado
so we're bronco fans
and um we just moved here two years ago
and they went to the superbowl when we first moved here
and they lost again
but they seem to be doing pretty good this year
well i was from illinois originally
and i grew up a bear fan
and uh then we moved here
and we had some wonderful wonderful years there under roger staubach
and we kind of got spoiled
well they haven't they haven't have they just lost one game this year
i know they lost yeah to washington and philadelphia
but they're not doing bad
people are pretty surprised that they i mean they beat the giants
and wasn't that fun
and i must say i attracted a lot of attention
people running up saying oh what's the score what's the score
oh boy i bet all the men that got direct down there were just right on it
and that's exactly what they said
you know but i wasn't
or i probably wouldn't have been there
well i am i'm a big football fan
and he used to have the football pool at the office and all this stuff
and i just hated it
and i think i was just mad because he spent so much time watching football on sundays
and uh so when i met my husband he was watching football
and i figured out that i couldn't see him all weekend
i couldn't see him until like tuesday because monday night football if i didn't
it was uh you know
and if you want to see them you might just as well enjoy football
and i used to tease my husband sometimes and say my gosh yo- did you bet the house or something this week to get so excited
well i do
i just i love it
it's such i just think it's such a fun sport
and uh i'm just hoping that the broncos can get back on their feet
well it takes a little brainwashing first
are you uh transit usually
i mean do you stay not in one place too long
and uh we have two small children
and he had a uh just got transferred here to e-systems
well it will take you a little while
but you'll probably always have a soft spot in your heart though for for denver
well i tell you this
the weather here and there's no mountains or anything you know
and when you go to a football game in colorado that's you know there's snow
and it's an adventure
oh i know
and here yeah you've just got to drive down
well if they close it in see we'll have the best of both worlds then as they're talking about doing
but uh dan reeves is a pretty neat guy anyway
well he's from here
that's right you know he was one of ours one of our boys
so we are never we never cheer against denver unless they're playing the cowboys
but uh i
you know it's funny
in in colorado when the broncos went to the superbowl three times in the last i don't know five
they take moder- popular songs and and change them to fit uh the broncos and stuff
and they had
uh if i saw a picture of john elway in the in the cafeteria at school um
but they did the johnny angel
and and i was trying to get my son to sing that
but they they do a lot of fun things
i think football is football is kind of a a sport that i think you kind of it's hard not to like it
because you know there's just
well there is so much about it to like
you know it's so exciting
and when the cowboys won the superbowl here of course they put together some real cute songs
and we all ran out and bought the records
and now we feel like they're kind of a collector's item
i i wish i would have bought the tape when i was in uh te- in colorado
because uh i i think about that a lot
but you know when i first moved here was when they well no i guess it was about a year ago they did this
but they sure do
even when they were losing pitifully you know people still support them
are are we paying too much in taxes
and are we getting what we pay for
well it's kind of a broad subject uh
i i think there are some areas where we where we uh pretty well you know get our money's worth
but i i also think there are a lot of areas
and uh i was i was in the air force
and i was at there were there was equipment at every base i was ever on that was just going to waste
and you know and
i i tend to agree with you
when it comes to government spending there are so many studies done that don't mean anything but we'll spend hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars on
and it's nice to know something doesn't work or something doesn't exist
but it could be put to more practical use
and i i think that uh
uh i have a tendency to
i'm in from texas
and i read you know how our politicians voted each week in the paper
and it's you know it's interesting how the votes vary
and what they ran on in platform don't necessarily come true in their voting in the senate or congress whatever
and don't really respond to uh people who write them and call them
and uh you know unless they're in the limelight and under pressure
what what state do you live in
and uh it's it has hurt us a lot
uh there has to be some way i think to equalize education opportunities
but uh you know our we we tend to think i think e- especially big government tends to think that the solution to everything is to throw money at it
and i don't you know
i don't think the you know i don't think money is going to take the place of intelligence or uh problem solving skills
uh i think there are there are too many things that money can't
so we're comparable
i think we've uh yeah we have got it on the line
and it's not going to get any better
d- you know i mean it's going up and up and up
uh i used to live in the plano school district
and uh there was a an organization a taxpayers organization that uh finally communicated the message to the i think to the people in plano that you know we didn't want our taxes raised
i remember there was about four five years ago
but this you know this uh
i think living in richardson we're kind of spoiled because i think we get
well did you read in the dallas paper where they increased the teach- the administrators' pay by thirty three percent after they laid off all those teachers
that's that's the biggest mess i've ever heard of
you know how can you how can you justify raising anybody's salary if you you know if you have to lay people off
but you know i'm not going to complain because plano got we all got a pay raise this year
well yeah i think the teachers d- uh did
and i don't know about administrators
i i'm semiretired
and i was i was an administrator
so i you know i don't get a
i just i i work part-time and just get uh
oh are you enjoying it
uh course i i still work two part-time jobs
so it's not really total retirement
well it's interesting you know because when you look at what richardson has done with the early retirement you
that's a rather rather broad topic
uh we live in plano
so that's a
uh and where you are
so when i heard the topic i was thinking of the thing down at uh maceo high school in dallas
it is you know
uh do you have children in school
so i don't have to
well i have
so we have all this to to look forward to
and it is really frightening uh to think that you can't even
i mean certainly you know you can't just turn them loose in the middle of dallas
but you know
but i really don't know
i mean it's just in so much of society with the violence
and the kids having access to weapons and drugs
and i i really don't know what what can be done
well i just i just don't understand how of course in my little world how guns could be so available
but apparently they just really are
but you know my son comes home and tells me that you know he hears kids talk about having guns
oh my heavens
and i mean it just scared me to death
and you know they called the police
and and nothing happened
but my goodness
well maybe that's the answer to crime is getting
you know because i don't
now i somehow i feel we're living in an impartial society as far as people seeing something happen you know across the street or seeing someone get mugged or unfortunately raped
and people don't do anything
a woman was raped in richardson i read in the paper oh about a two weeks ago now
and all the neighbors said they heard her yelling for help
but nobody nobody did anything
you know i mean they heard someone calling for help
nobody even called the police to say you know i hear a strange screaming i'm afraid you know if you
well i can see you know especially if you heard screams from a house or something not going over there maybe because you know it could be dangerous
but certainly i can't understand not calling the police
i just you know
it's it's really
and probably one of the best things we could do for crime is to participate ourselves in its prevention
well i i think you're right there
but i think that's real dangerous
and uh i don't know
i try to tell my kids just just kind of be aware of what's around them you know
well you know the call for help is what scares me now because it it just
but it's that not getting involved that impersonal society i think we live in today
it's it really is is frightening
i mean i don't know the details
it was someone that uh show- you know just kind of showed up at the field
uh it was a a student age person
but i'm not even
but it's a little sideline part time thing
and uh i'm building a a log house at a farm that i have in east texas which is a hundred miles from here
and uh uh course i've been working on it for five years
but you know
oh but how wonderful
it's getting real close to you know of course there's still a lot of work to be done
and then when you get it completely you know the shell finished uh you still have a lot of stuff to do inside
actually uh i'm not even sure
but it's beautiful
it's you know it's eastern hardwood uh forest
but it's mostly oaks
oh how beautiful
and it's pretty flat there
well it's kind of hilly
but it's you know low hills
it's not uh
see i've only been to texas once
i have two sisters in texas now um one in austin one in dallas
and the one in dallas is the one that got me to doing this and uh i thought austin was beautiful i liked the hills and the trees
it's really different because that's kind of the you know that's the chalk hills down there
oh and you've always
lime- limestone hills
born and raised texan huh
well i had never been there
my brother-in-law works for the university um in dallas
wh- at at which one
uh university of texas in dallas
oh okay it's just north of me here
well that's he's got a job there
and this is his first year
so it's been a real interesting thing for them
but they seem to like it okay
but maybe some day they can get closer
so what do you what kind of hobbies are you in
well i'm mother of four
so basically i'm just
and we have a little halloween talent show tonight
oh that's great
well i am a travel agent at heart
and my hobby is just
i love traveling and and being involved of that and finding out more uh
but it's real hard to work in the summers and holidays and weekends when you have four children and a husband
so i reluctantly gave that career up and am just substituting at the school
so i've been librarian all this week which has been real interesting
and i'm enjoying it
and what else do i do
i do lots of cross stitching when i have time and i enter things in our little state fair
and that's pretty fun
well but actually my hobbies is mostly is my sports tennis
ooh i love tennis too and i ski ski
uh that's great
and we usually go to new mexico because it's a little cheaper you know
i've been to telluride which is on the west side and uh copper
you guys are you guys getting snow
well we're we are on the dry side of the mountains
so of course i'm a real seahawks fan and um going over that pass is just a real nightmare
and um so and we're on the colder side
and um we we ski
my my children all ski and we've we have been to whistler in canada which is just a marvelous place
and then we've gone to sun valley several times
that's a just a great place but no colora- not in colorado
since i was in college since i went to school
always want to go to canada canada to banff or somewhere like that
and your kids all ski
uh not all of them
my my kids are all grown
but my youngest son is a skier
well my boys are at the point where they scare their mommy to death
and they go off
i thought gee i haven't taken anything back for a long time
well i haven't either uh
i i hate returning things
i mean i i have a friend who if she likes something isn't sure what size somebody might need will buy it in every color and size and you know take everything back again
it's you know it's a game to her
but i i do not like to do that
i consider it kind of a a waste of my time
and so i'm usually uh pretty careful when i shop and i also you know usually have have checked over things you know if it's like an appliance or something to make sure uh it has the features in it that i want
and we've had it for a while
but all of a sudden it just wasn't working
and it looks like there's a part missing from it
and of course we don't have the receipt any more
so we can't take it back
uh but i think a lot of goods are made not to last real long uh
and then you'll throw it away rather than have it fixed we're we're a wasteful society for sure
well that's true
and lot of times though it is it costs so much to get something fixed that you almost
and you usually get what you pay for
and they were like ten dollars
and we expected them
and they didn't work worth anything
so we took those back
and that's about that
i think a lot of times if you get a brand name uh you know if it's a a good brand
i you i think there's there can be a lemon in anything but uh i think more often than not
you you pretty well know what you're getting ahead of time
and uh you know if you buy a good one you shouldn't have any you know too much of a problem with it
i mean we we had a car once that we tried to have declared a lemon under the lemon law which is extremely difficult to do
and the car would go
and without any warning whatsoever you could be going down the freeway at sixty
and it would stop and i
you know and oh we went round and round with the manufacturer and and everything
and they got it finally semifixed
and it just pertained to that
but it was such a hassle yeah
it it really is uh
and uh you know i still don't have any anything to do there
but but i i think too a lot of people don't buy their warranties either because they know that when it's that old they're going to buy a new one
well i think that's true
and i uh now we generally don't buy a warranty because you think you know at least for the first couple of years nothing should go wrong with it
so he usually be able to fix anything that's minor
and and that has saved us
i it's hard to say
some i think they more of their parts plastic which you know makes things break easier
but i think the technology is better
ye- i think technology is better
i'm i'm not sure
i don't think necessarily that things are being made better uh you know
everything is so automated uh
and things can be made without
and i think that certainly makes a difference from back from the time when somebody handcrafted something and you know had some pride in it
well people aren't willing to pay those prices very often so you know for a handcrafted something
that's that's true
so if we get what we
well i i do uh you know craft work and sell
and that and uh uh you know it's it's it's a real eye-opener as far as you know why people charge what they do to you know
well you keep up with current events
somewhat not as well as i would like to probably but that's the way it goes
where whereabouts in pennsylvania
um state college
oh do you
well i'm a current event junkie
so i i watch i try to watch the news
and i read the newspaper
and i like to read time magazine and people magazine to keep up with what's going on in the world
well what particularly are you interested in
well i just pretty uh little you know about everything
and not and then again not everything
but you know i like to know pretty well what's happening
political things don't interest me a great deal except i do like to stay informed enough to feel like i halfway vote intelligently you know but uh other than that uh i just you know
stay in touch with it and know feel like i know what's going on
but i always have been and i stay up with it
but uh how do you how do you uh stay aware of most of the current events uh newspaper
um uh well some of both
i read i read the newspapers sometimes and i watch c n n that sort of thing occasionally and i read magazines and such
well you stay up with it pretty well then
i mean not not that badly anyway
so i am i am interested in what's going on
and i'm particularly interested in certain things of course like all the news about haiti recently because i've been down there and yeah
oh you've been there well you would be interested in it then
i follow it you know
but i'm always aware of what's going on like that and uh because it is it's interesting and uh i don't know
they've just been so terribly mistreated for so many many years you know
i mean he was a terrible tyrant and i think it's been better since he died
but it's still been bad but uh even that priest that was in control there for a while that they overthrew uh
i've read some things about him that he was he wasn't too good himself
he was pretty pretty much a
he didn't mind having people bumped off for certain things you know
it's one of the reasons the u s wasn't so you know didn't do more than they did at the time because they weren't all that excited about him although he's probably better than a lot of them
but uh but then again who you know
so what do you think about the quality of news coverage in america
now i they sometimes they jump on it and and and go a little to the extreme
but uh but that's kind of understandable because you know of course if you watch it more more than once a day i mean it's the same thing over and over and over and over
and i listen to the radio so i you hear so much
but then again so many people you got to understand only catch it once a day maybe but i think the quality of our uh our news is just uh i don't believe it could be better i really don't
well you know i think it probably could be it always could be better
i i mean i mean what else could they do to make it better
well i think that um
well you always want to think everything can be improved upon i understand what you're saying
but by trial and error over the years i think they got it about as good as they're going to get it
well that may be so
uh nothing is perfect
i think that i'm not always satisfied with how dig they deep into the how deep they dig into things and such
well that's true
and then again i understand why they can't dig too much deeper
uh i don't know if there's so much wrong with the public schools uh as much as
uh that might be a lot to do with it
well a lot of it in mississippi here has got to do with funding
and they're trying to spend money where we don't have it
and there's a lot of things we need that we just can't afford
well it's it is getting very expensive to run schools
well it is
there's just so much uh more and less money to do it with
and a lot of it lot of it has to do with uh salaries too speaking of money
cause if you can't pay the right people you know they're not to be able to do they're not not going to get the people that can do a good job
i i i guess that in uh
talking on a lot of the things as far as the discipline in the schools i i think they're expecting schools to discipline the kids
and uh i think it should go right back to the parents
and then when the kids get to school they try to take away a lot of things that they can do to discipline the kids
i mean they've so severely limited
i i know when i uh
i mean they do that now
and they could probably lose their job
it seems that'd be a subject that i i don't have much to say on
we we've talked some about it in my state because we've had a lot of uh prob-
but he wasn't
and a lot of his problems had to do with money mostly
i know a lot a lot of
and unfortunately there's not many places to get that money
and they may not know a lot about
and they're trying to teach social studies
and they don't know a lot about that
he my professor was a physics professor
and he said a lot of teachers teaching physics today have no background of physics at the high school level
so therefore they're teaching from a teacher's point of view and not from a physicist point of view
and that causes a lot of trouble
e- e- maybe they should sit back and and kind of uh decide on where the money's best spent
i know in a lot of cases uh different districts like to have nice fancy schools
and maybe they should be a little more uh uh concerned with paying the right people to teach and and be uh satisfied with maybe a little older school
because i mean here in the town i went to high school
one of the there were four high schools in my county one of the high schools was blown away by a tornado
so when they rebuilt that school they had a a top of the line high tech school there
and the other schools were built back in maybe the fifties or early sixties
and then when uh the evaluation committees came through they praised the school that had been rebuilt while they were down grading all these other ones telling them what they needed to do to fix up this building
and this and this and this and so it kind of would make you think that we'd all be better off if all the schools were blown away by tornadoes and we had to rebuild them
well i i know uh where i came from we didn't have a very uh rich community
and uh high school that i went to was very old
and uh as far as i know it's still there
they've e- expanded on it
but they've never built a new one
and it's probably fifty sixty years old or or better
and i don't foresee them uh building a new one for a long time because they can't afford it
uh so what do you think about the school system
well i think they're they're having a lot of trouble right now
but uh i think they're big city public schools by definition are having a a tough time right now just from uh probably from budget cuts and and everything else going on
uh why did you choose a private school
well i had one that was needed to be able to be moved along at a at a pace a little faster than he was going to be able to be moved in public school
so he's he has been going to private since kindergarten
oh has he
oh he's loved it
so he's been there all the time
he's done it the whole twelve and uh so many years
and it's been uh it's been really good for him
uh overall on campus about twelve hundred but in the upper school upper four grades uh about four hundred and something
so it's maybe a hundred per grade
kind of gives them the you know
that was we were kind of looking for one that would be a mixture
so they don't
and he's done he's done really well
and just he was just ahead at an early age
and i didn't feel like uh in what was available particularly in the first three grades and even in the fourth grade where they started what they called reach was still a pull out one day program
and i just didn't think that was going get it
i thought he needed to be exposed to a situation where he could push ahead uh every day
uh one thing i think i've noticed is uh my oldest is in kindergarten
so i'm in a little different ballgame
but uh seems to me that uh kids these days uh
and the teachers don't have as much aren't respected as much
and uh they have to be so careful of the things they do and say
and uh makes me a little nervous that uh students don't seem to show that respect
and and they'll stand there now with them toe to toe
and uh the things they can say and do to a teacher and they do from what i
i think we need to get back to the
and course i guess the teacher used to warrant that
for other people and
but a lot of times it's not being taught in the home anymore like it used to be basic respect for for elders and adults and particularly in in responsible positions
and so then you wind up with little brats on your hands
well how do you think that that's happened
you think our society's just uh stopped talking out
or this uh generation's just kind of changed a little bit uh
well the world changes
so i mean obviously kids are not the same now as they used to be
i mean they're exposed to a whole lot more things
they have a whole lot more uh variety of things they they're that they see and do at an earlier age
so life is not maybe as simple as it was at one time
but but still i think it goes back to a commitment by the parents to to teach uh basic values and basic uh respectful of uh of authority
and i just don't think that this doesn't always get emphasized anymore uh
i mean i remember uh well it was a big thing when they let girls wear levi's
we used to have to wear dresses and then you had to a- go to dresses
and it was polyester
and it had to be matching
and when it was skirts it was like get down on the floor
and we hold the ruler up here and it's no more than so many inches above the knee
because it was mini skirt time back there at one time
so it's really changed
it's uh really kind of
so i think that maybe that's effected it to some degree
i think that probably does have have something to do with it
and it's also
do uh does this school your son goes to do they uh re- require to wear a uniform
they do not do uniforms although one where he was between like second and eighth grade did
well considering you moved here from california i guess
we have uh in california
i'm in c- i lived in central california
and other than that you know it would be maybe october and then in the spring
and then other than that there wouldn't be any rain
it's kind of it's kind of been a drought out there hasn't it uh
so here i know that uh last year there was some ice storms while i was out of the state
and i'm glad to see there haven't been any this year
generally if we're going to get them it's not going to happen uh prior to january one
but usually the bitterest weather if we're going to have any comes in january and february
so we really don't have as long a cold season i guess as people up north
well today it's not bad out there
i just came in from outside and it's it's really pretty
i'm a i'm a scoutmaster
and so i wind up going out camping with uh a bunch of boys at one time
and so it's better for us if it hasn't been this totally wet before we go
so you do that even in january huh
and then i guess you've been through a couple of summers here too right
and they're not too pleasant
oh it is
people that i know that come from uh like georgia or north carolina
yeah they say it's
but i find it
but it but more humid than arizona
and california for the most part
so that was
well it's pretty hot in the summer
it's in the usually you know
but it's a drier
but it's a dry heat yeah
i know well i lived in africa for a couple years in cameroon
and that's a tropical climate
and it really feels similar to this during the summer
what types of what type what type of business takes you to those climates
or was that just vacation or something
i was uh working with uh i still work with wycliff bible translators
so this is like the first thing that's written down
or you know first an alphabet is developed
and then uh
you don't think about that as a career a normal career uh when you're thinking of things that people might be doing
well it's based here
uh the international headquarters for wycliff bible translators is right here in in dallas
so you're you're with the home office now
well the uh i think uh all in all there are a lot worse climates than dallas uh
the weather you know does change fast
and things do happen severely a few times a year
but there's an awful lot of good weather too in between
i i thought the fall was really nice
and usually a lot of the spring months are really nice too
and and when it begins to be in the sixties and seventies most of the time uh i like that
particularly if i'm going to be outdoors and doing uh outdoor activity hiking and things
and that's nicer
you probably do a lot of that with scout scouting
think we're going in just a couple of weeks out to the east texas
and it is a little more humid out there than it is here
so i guess we'll
and then when you get one of those tornado type systems through or severe hail or thunderstorms
uh do you live in a home
we we it's a house we bought uh about two and a half years ago now
oh did you
and uh uh it's our first home too
so what do you think of of owning a home as opposed to to renting somebody else's
um well before we built our home we were managing some apartments that we were living in
and um that was quite an experience
i i much prefer having my own home and and uh just the space and and more privacy
do you have is it a fairly large house
um it's uh uh it's like twenty-four fifty square feet
oh that's pretty good size
actually we had an apartment two bedroom apartment that was about as big as this house is
it's uh it's only like eleven hundred square feet
do you do you have children
but it it uh all the rooms are small i mean
but it ends up giving us three bedrooms which we wanted and uh use an extra one for an office which is handy
i'd rather have have more rooms and less space in each one i guess rather have lots of rooms and lot- lots of space
but uh that ends up costing me
well like um how does it compare to the ones in your neighborhood
well they're it's pretty typical i mean it's a very very middle class neighborhood
uh lots of lots of young couples with you know usu- oh
i'm sure that virtually everybody in the neighborhood that's their first homes and uh lots of kids and stuff
and so it it fits well in the neighborhood
it's it's certainly not a real upscale neighborhood
but on the other hand it's clean and kind of suburban little bit more than i want
is is yours also pretty much in conformance with the neighborhood or is it
it it it it does it it seems about oh probably average um
but our neighborhood has a just a wide variety of of um people
and you know there's older people here and and um people that are our our age
and um there's a lot of kids a lot of kids
wow eight kids
oh my gosh
their home just burned down matter of fact and um last summer
and they're just rebuilding
and um their house is going to be really big
he's uh um uh oh not an obstetrician an an orthopedic surgeon
and um so since the house did burn they're they're going
and it's it's a lot bigger
and um but ours is about
it's you know it's a nice home
it's definitely not one of the the smaller ones
and um it's not the biggest either
new ones i mean they they tend to to be real tiny but that uh especially in newer neighborhoods
my my brother just built a new house
and the um the neighborhood actually fought him on it
because he he was um the house was going to cost less to build than any other house in the neighborhood
now that's because he was he's doing a lot of it himself and you know for example landscaping and and lots of the other stuff
and his house actually ended up being nicer than lots
but but they were they were pretty touchy on it
you know that's interesting
you say that because we do have we have those architectural codes here and when we um put out house in um they wanted us to have
we have part siding on on the two story part and then on the back
and they there was one side where our chimney was
and just the chimney was going to be brick
and they wanted us to have more brick
so we ended up having to go halfway up which it does look nicer
and you know we would have like to have had all brick
but of course at that point we couldn't afford it
and but it's funny that you'd say that because there were homes in here that didn't have any brick at all
so it's kind of like they were
kind of depends on when they get in you know
and i and so it was kind of like it's they
so the houses actually on our street are a little bit they're kind of gone a little bit nicer
oh they have
i mean just they you know
it's like the second phase and and so they've kind of changed the the codes a little bit
and so that's kind of why i guess they stuck us with more brick when there were other homes that didn't have any
well see my sister kind of got in the opposite end of that because they they moved into a neighborhood and bought a a real nice stone house down in south austin
and uh and the what the builder apparently plans to do is they they do phase one
and they kind of give it a very upscale and very tightly controlled uh codes and and and stuff
and then they come back in
and and then they sell
i uh spent four years as a university professor
i i spent three years
oh do you really
i did uh
well i was pretty young
i was uh
and i was uh
well you can you can tell me a little bit more about it because i don't think we did that in utah
well the cooperative learning is a technique that was tried initially to integrate the public schools
and uh what what it involves basically
and the uh teacher becomes a uh a sort of a consultant resource person to the cooperative learning uh to the learning cooperatives i guess they're called
and there are uh some fairly sophisticated approaches that are used in the high schools with point systems and things like that so that people uh gain a competence with respect to the material
uh i think that the combination of uh technology and techniques like that together with marketplace forces will bring about a revolution in the way we learn
uh i think there is a direct threat to vested interest in the public school system uh that will stand in the way of that progress being a little faster
uh school systems are in too many states dominated by administrators and uh both teachers and parents uh complain about the uh uh the cost and ineffectiveness that results
so my feeling is that uh
there are plenty of good people uh available to uh offer people educational experience
but that we just have to re- reallocate and reorganize the resources to do it
and uh i think certain techniques and technologies will influence all of that as well as research uh uh of the sort that people like me do looking at theories of behavior and how they can be used to improve performance particularly uh accelerate the the pace of learning
and my feeling is that uh those kinds of things will solve the problem eventually
uh uh but i think that the future is pretty bright because people recognize that we're paying an enormous price for uh inferior quality when the people involved really aren't inferior
so it must be the way we're managing the process that uh
i i don't i don't think it's it's a matter of of uh talented people to do it a- both as quote unquote students and as teachers
but clearly what's happened in this country is the school system's been asked to assume a great many responsibilities in the past thirty years that weren't existent uh
you must see kids with real significant problems uh in some cases
uh course i always see the
i don't know how hard how hard is it uh in the public school system in iowa city
is it is it uh deteriorated a lot
well i i haven't taught in iowa
but i've taught in utah
and uh people there were saying that the way that the schools were going a lot of people were going away and going to private schools or else going to home where they taught their kids at home
or you know anything but the public schools and the ones that did have you know the kids
well utah's a place where you wouldn't think that problem would be very severe
well uh maybe it was the area i was in
but a lot of schools had a lot of transient uh families and a lot of families who were on the poorer side
you so you saw a fair number of troubled kids
i mean like you said how they were the schools are doing more things for the kids they thought than they were thirty years ago
i mean they were the school i was teaching at the the year i left they were considering providing hot lunch for or hot breakfast for the kids
well as far as i'm concerned and it's probably apt that your call's at this time because we just got through watching uh reasonable doubts
which had a you know capital case in it
and uh m- i personally have uh
my own feelings about uh capital punishment is i think it should be mandatory upon a third conviction felony
mandatory i mean summary execution on the steps that day
well i think you know i'm i'm in that same
i think if it's uh if it's a con- if it's a convicted uh felon on parole uh and he goes out and and commits another crime or kills somebody i you know i i feel the same way
i don't think i think that person is is beyond uh rehabilitation
and and he should be taken out
well i i also firmly believe that no one is beyond reclamation
but i do know that some people almost all people usually die before that point
uh as far as capital punishment on on it's own merits i have the trouble with the way it's applied
i think it should be applied d- on a little bit more fair manner
uh and i've i've said this very often
and i believe it to be the a very true axiom
so i would be rather be white rich and guilty than black and innocent
because if you're
kill you they will kill you
and if you're black and you kill a black guy you know it's you know two hundred hours of community service
you don't hear you don't hear too much about of those cases
well it's a social disease that we have called one upsmanship you know
so we can do whatever the hell we want to do
and you're the minority
and you're stuck with it
but uh you know we had this in the vietnam war you know
you know but that's another issue altogether
as far as capital punishment i think that uh ten years on death row is cruel and unusual punishment
and if he can't produce evidence not argument but evidence
see the only thing i don't you know i don't understand i guess i i don't understand our judicial system uh as it is right now
because i you know if somebody has been convicted and has been sentenced to be put to death how is it that they can appeal and appeal and appeal and get stays of ex- execution
i mean how you know is there
th- that goes back to when uh america was a a colony of england
in england you went to court you were assumed guilty until proven innocent and once they found you guilty you know judge said he's guilty kill him
well th- there were some people that uh that had a problem with that
because they found out later on that jeez you know a guy will lie rather than get killed
and he'll say you know hey that guy did it you know not me
and uh or he'll have somebody lie for him
you know people lie
but they do that
and to prevent that kind of misuse of power they wrote into the constitution a protection against judicial mishap
look at that guy uh at e systems
they were g- they convicted him of a robbery that he could not physically have been able to commit
he had witnesses that were you know they weren't dope dealers they weren't drug fiends they were employees of a an establishment that had a very high level of security sense too and these were really responsible people
you know and they convicted this guy because somebody says well he looks like the right guy
they all look the same to me you know
big lips flat nose yep that was him
what do you think about uh uh convicted uh
well this is an unusual topic
i at first i
so i told my husband uh you know
and then he reminded me
but uh uh
and so they just notify everyone by mail
and then they just meet at like a park or something to have like a a short uh or a small uh dinner type thing
well that sounds great ellen
uh they come from well they all meet in portland
and they come as far as oh seattle
and and sometimes we've gone
and we were f- we were living in utah at the time
and uh the his his dad's family is all around the area
and his mom's side of the family they all uh have their family reunions in southern utah
and people would come from seattle to there and uh let's see nevada and in that area washington and nevada to southern utah
and they would uh assign a different person each time they had a reunion they'd assign a different person to be in charge of notifying everybody
and the people who are down there like they'll assign one person in the utah area one person in the washington area
and that person can call you know beforehand and just make sure everyone knows too
and then they just sort of do like a little program or you know something like that so that everyone's sort of involved
so we just have to either or
and we're all there
well i mean l a orange county area
i mean everyone's you know mostly not farther than an hour away
well my experience uh has been limited pretty much lately to my mother's side of the family
uh years ago there was a big dispute on my dad's side
and uh they haven't had a reunion since then
but anyway my mother's side we had our our first real reunion that i've ever gone to last summer
and they had people come in from out of town
and they took some rooms down at a holiday inn
and uh they had some activity
and people got up and talked about various parts of the family tree
and you know a lot of that sort of thing
since it was the first one that we'd had that you could do that once
well you know that's interesting because one thing that always brings to my uh husband's mother's side together is uh they talk about the genealogy of the family tree every time
and uh inevitably everyone is just very interested
and and they always have you know two or three new ones to add to the list you know someone's been born or someone passed away or you know something like that
and so everyone has to update their little books or whatever
well have have you do you have an interest in genealogy
not a passion huh
and i i suspect we will do more of it
uh i found out some about some of the relatives i didn't you know i i didn't even know their names some of the two or three generations back and some of the aunts and uncles
and uh there's a lot of things there you have to stop
and we don't even know where the twin
we have virtually no no background on on her on the twin
is it your your grandma's own sibling
my grandmother's uh sister who would be somewhere in in west virginia
i'm sure she's you know dead now because my grandmother died in about twenty years ago
oh i see
i'm i'm quite a bit i'm probably a lot older than you are uh
well maybe uh they just moved away and then sort of lost contact
um what type of magazines do you have
i i take um skiing magazine
and i take uh discover magazine and also uh c d and stereo review and national geographic i think and boys life
um so i take it that you like to ski
do you do you um receive a lot of information on skiing through the ski magazine
uh i suppose that puts me on some mailing lists and so forth because i do get things from ski associations and things uh at during the year
oh uh and do you receive discounts and things like that
so would this vacation you're taking
uh we already knew we wanted to take one
and we just started looking around
but we went to the ski show and looked at all of the resort information picked up a lot of brochures and just decided to go to crested butte
um that sounds nice
but i haven't skied utah yet
but i want to
oh well you need to come out
well how about you
what what magazines do you have at home
uh i am currently taking decorative woodworking and uh country living
and let's see we do have national geographic
and then we have some church magazines
but i really enjoy the decorative woodworking
so the decorative woodworking has just been a great great help
does it have uh articles on how to do things as well as equipment that you can buy and so forth
they do have uh mostly they have uh the ads on the equipment
but the whole magazine is just filled with uh pictures and projects that you can make yourself
and then it has all of the patterns and instructions that you would need to make a wood project and and then how to paint it with the tole paintings
and so it's really a fun one
well that's good
i mean i read it
but then they just sort of gather dust for a long period of time
but then eventually there'll be a school project or something where my son will need to refer back through forty-eight back issues to find you know france or something or whatever it is he's looking for
i've i've noticed that too
but they have been nice to have around
i liked that magazine but it was i was just found myself not ever getting around to reading it
and by the time the next round comes in i'm still not through reading
oh scientific american comes to our house too i forgot
and that's mostly my son's
but but i do read it too
oh well that sounds like
and he takes games magazine game magazine which has puzzles and things that he likes to solve you know crosswords and various logic puzzles and things like that he likes to try that
so he does uh
they do they can do that
and they like to go through
and so we've found good use for those
so he's we're kind of at the end of that trail
well i do have a boy in junior high too
so you got a little bit of a gap there between
so so we're kind of running the gamut
what do you do artistic painting
uh i do tole painting
oh you do
uh i haven't done any of the oil or watercolor
but right now my passion is tole painting
i i took one class about i guess three or four years ago
and i've done a little uh
but it takes a lot of time
d- do you sell your projects
uh i've done uh perpetual calendars and
but uh i would eventually like to make enough to sell and quit my job
i just work at stop and shop out there in in ogden
now do you ever send any of your stuff to the boutique
so i have five children of my own
so it's they they keep me busy
and tole painting is just a you know something i do in my spare time
well do you cut out your own projects
and so i really enjoy doing that
huh do you uh ever spray your projects with the i mean a base coat first
or do you brush it on
i haven't tried a a spray varnish
i just bought a spray gun one of those airless uh not airless high volume low pressure spray guns
and i do a lot of woodworking
and that's what i bought it for
but i haven't used it yet
oh well that's that 'ud probably give you a smoother finish wouldn't it
now what type of woodworking do you do
uh fine furniture
oh do you
that's why i brought bought the sprayer is to finish my projects
that's my worst
but spraying does put on a nicer finish
oh well that is interesting
so what kind of equipment do you have
uh let me see
and about it
boy it sounds like you're really into it
i i just have a scroll saw and a jig saw
and i am really anxious to get a band saw and a router
but it's nice to have the right equipment
that is that makes it easier doesn't it
well have you sold any of your furniture
oh that's interesting
do you uh did you take classes to learn how to do that
uh just in junior high and then i just kept on through high school and then
oh so yours is mostly just a hobby too then
well that is interesting
oh i would i really would love to go take a class in woodworking and learn how to
but mostly uh just do more
like the shelves and
so it's fun
well they come on
oh they do
so this is my first one
i've enjoyed this uh
so i think you'll enjoy doing it
uh you know there's a shop in roy that i really love
uh and it's there by the copper mill restaurant used to be the hayloft
well we live in roy
but we haven-
uh let's see
uh one of the things i'm very concerned about the air pollution is the uh this this the ozone layer uh uh issue
uh i used to own a heating and air conditioning business and handled lots of fre- different types of freons
and that uh rather bothers me that uh i was in in effect uh contributing to the delinquency of the the environment so to speak
and one of the reasons they fixed up the freons eleven twelve and thirteen in in in that area was because they were inexpensive
uh they could be made uh you know inexpensive and lots of it uh
and in that and its properties were great uh with uh the machinery didn't have to have lots of expensive machinery to uh get your heating and cooling cycles to work
well course there's a a
and of course the new cars i guess starting with ni- nineteen ninety-three will not have freon twelve in their systems
but uh there's you know the ton of after market machines and et cetera et cetera
and that's got me very you know highly concerned that uh
but you got to have people that can make you know earn a salary to pay for this conversion
so so i see us in a kind somewhat of a catch twenty-two unless we unless the banks or industry and or the government go together and and come up with a way to uh have us as a part of the unemployed society be able to be gainfully employed again converting all this freon twelve stuff into the new nonpolluting uh compound
because as i say there's a there's a tremen-
well how many uh uh families own a refrigerator
and then do you know that number and then how many a a freezer separate from and how many people especially here in texas own cars and trucks with air conditioning
i mean this is there there are people that that make it have a thriving business uh that do nothing but heating and air conditioning on on automobiles and trucks
and uh the only reason i didn't uh get into that more when i was had my little business was because uh most of your uh air conditioning in in on vehicles tend to be greasy and dirty to the n-th degree and
and that's a pollut- polluting type deal too is the excessive um you know uh petroleum products in your engine bay and so forth and the dirt and grit and those two mixed together with with water and uh
and i know there's a lot of pollutants we can't even see coming out of cars
but that that particular bothers me
well most most most of the time when you see bus uh you know the busses with the diesel that's uh those are carbon particles and carbon dioxide and water vapor uh
because when you when diesel is burned it's it
you know diesel fuel is burned in a in the diesel engine
it's burned so completely that you don't have any uh nitrous oxides uh or oxides of nitrogen uh to uh form because of by virtue of the very combustion process of the diesel engine because diesel oil is uh
you know where gasoline if you leave a little pail of gasoline out before long it's gone
and it's got
well you know it's latent heat is high
but it's slow burning at at uh normal pressures
oh i see
that's why your diesel engines have such high compression ratios as the as the air is heated you know by virtue of the compression process to like one to nineteen or nineteen to one ratio and so if the car sucks in uh fifty degrees
well how do you feel about trial by jury
i feel very uncomfortable with trials by juries recently uh
in that it seems to me that they are swayed more by emotion than uh by evidence that's presented
i have uh very little regard for the law
oh do do you feel they are swayed more toward are you talking about with criminal or civil suits
so do you think that i mean the the stereotypical bleeding heart juries where they feel sorry
uh i would feel more comfortable in many cases i think with judges uh you know doing the sentencing
i i like the idea of juries of your peers uh in that you you you get more personally more than one person making the making a decision
and second of all you get a wide variety of background
uh too often i think they are not and uh when you when you are selecting a jury and you are doing it partially if if not entirely on the basis of which color representation you have you know that is a matter of concern to me too
uh i think that uh in such cases uh they are not really looking for unbiased people but rather for biased
uh now i happen to know several judges
and there is one that i would feel uncomfortable but has me- doing sentencing without the jury
and i guess that's what i am concerned with
i guess i i definitely agree with you
but sin- the
well what i don't like about uh sentence the jury doing the sentencing in that i think it becomes a lot less
the the same crime gets unequal sentences
i uh i think there is more of an ability of you know you know for selecting a jury two different juries that would most of the time come up with the same idea uh the same idea versus you know whether he is guilty or innocent but i think i think there would be a large variation in in trying to gage the the severity of the crime and an appropriate punishment and have that that measure stick across the board
and you do see such uneven sentencing you know evidence of it in the newspapers and such i mean where uh it would appear the crimes were very similar
but one individual got twenty-five years
and the other one was sentenced to life
of course a lot of that's also the ability of of the defendant to uh get a good lawyer
there are times when is it uh
oh goodness my mind has gone blank it's uh othello
every now and then one is tempted to see what what
i i agree with it
they will admit to you that they can- don't have the benefit of being able to you know of of letting allowing themselves to believe their clients that are guilty it's more of the game plan of how do they convince the judge or jury through argument
and they are very effective too
i have been involved uh just sli- slightly in a case where i know the person is guilty but uh his attorneys gotten him off
uh the city has dropped their charges against him because their the attorney has presented enough evidence of doubt to convince the judge
so i don't know
uh this is a little bit of the subject
but one one thing that i really dislike uh also that's that's new is the uh is that i have heard that there are federal sentences
you know actually in this modern day and age it seems like uh uh we have more and more leisure time because uh we have so many convenience appliances and whatnot
uh but i uh
i've heard i don't know this for a fact but i've heard that a lot of families really don't spend a great deal of time together
that ki- the kids maybe on the average get uh something like thirty seconds of quality time with the parents
that's what i've heard too uh
i don't quite understand it although i think probably the the worst thing that's happening in the world at least the modern world today is television
and i thin- there's also some uh i think uh poorer lifestyles illustrated but simply because it dominates so much discussionary time
i've i tell myself sometimes just sit down after work
so i refuse to have one in the house
well good for you
a lot of people i talk to a lot of people about that
and i've thought about it myself
and i though about it a lot
but uh i still haven't done it yet
well that's good
well i'll tell you
i mean the kids can be a real pest uh
and turning the t v on is almost like magic you know
it's like sticking uh an electrode into their pleasure center
and you don't have to worry about them
but i don't think it's too good
uh so you know i don't know
but i take advantage of um dinner time
and you know whenever you're with your kids you want to interact with them rather than just ignore them
do you keep your kids uh active in sports or anything
uh i guess our big outlet is music uh our thirteen year old son plays violin
nine year old daughter plays cello and uh when our son started playing violin i took up violin
and when our daughter started playing cello i took up cello
so there's plenty of plenty of interactive time in uh practicing although neither kid likes to practice
but i mea- i imagine with infants you
well i i try and read to them
and i take them to the park and stuff
oh you know reading is so good
i uh i took great pleasure in reading to my kids when they were little
and i still try to read to them although our son is not liking that anymore
well they get to that stage
uh but i read you know
and uh you ought to get it
well i think i think his sleep book is my favorite
i like to i like to do it
and they enjoy reading
i've actually i never read a lot growing up
and i never read until a few years ago
and so i've found that you know it's really important to me to get to read
to i like to get away in a book you know
and so i've put a lot more emphasis on that on my kids to try and
so how much time do you think you spend with your kids on the average per each day
oh i probably spend an hour or two
oh that's great
so she does uh tupperware
so she's gone a lot at nights
oh i see
and so i spend a lot of time with them
ho- how old are your kids again
so you have your hands full with them
i uh try to stay away from cars as much as possible in terms of repair
actually uh that is really a sore spot with me
i i think perhaps the automotive industry is improving
but uh like ten years ago uh reliability of automobiles at least u s automobiles was pretty dismal
and not only that but the uh repair capability of uh service departments and dealerships was equally dismal and uh it seemed that the only way i could reliably take care of my car was to repair it myself which is not my cup of tea
but uh i
so do you have a car
well at that time actually i had a volkswagen rabbit and uh it was it was a real lemon
uh subsequently i got a uh buick century
and it wasn't as bad
but uh last year i bought a honda accord
and i take it in once every seventy-five hundred miles for its periodic maintenance
and that is it
and it's wonderful
and they're good
every time i get taken to an auto repair place you know every time i go i get taken
bad you know
and they go all right we got a sucker
let's ge- see how much money we can get out of her you know
so wha- what do you have
all the more reason to uh have a a honda
but our honda just got old and just wore out
and it just
d- so you bought a pontiac
my hu- uh ex-husband's
this is just happened a couple of weeks ago
but just a few months ago when he was my husband uh his father gave us this car
and everything is wrong with it
i mean the power steering fluid leaks the oil leaks the brake fluid leaks you know
wha- how old is the car
and he just doesn't take care of things
and but i was awarded the car
so there is a man in my church that is a mechanic
and i can trust him
so he is trying to get you know things fixed on it
but it's just you know leak leak leak everywhere
but uh you know i hate to go into a a repair place because they'll tell me something is wrong with it and it's not you know and charge me twice as much
so i said okay
and he charged me a hundred and thirty something dollars
and then uh about a month later a man was looking at my car
and he asked me
you know not a man not a repair man but just a friend
and i was telling him that i just a new master cylinder put on
and he looked at
and he said that's not a new master cylinder and i didn't even know what one was
and uh he showed it to me
and it was old rusty just awful
so apparently it was the same one that was on there
uh more than likely
apparently just uh re- re- uh probably filled the the brake fluid up
and that was it
and that's happened to me more than once or twice jus- just just about every time i've went in somewhere
so what's the solution to that i guess find a reputable service
and and you ju- can hardly find one you know
the guy that's doing most of my my car now uh goes to my church
and that's the only reason you know i go to him because i know him
and i know he will tell me the truth
because he doesn't even charge me for for doing it
so he's not going
and he does it so
well that's wonderful
so i don't know
and they ended up telling us we needed a brand new engine for our car
and so idiots as we were neither one of us knew much about cars
we you know they told us we just had to have one
and we bought one
so it was it was not good
and for me there's absolutely no question what's the most important benefit
oh and if you try to get it outside of your corporation you're going to pay an arm and a leg
belonging to a group is the belonging to a health group is probably the most important protection you can have after you
uh do you also get dental
and uh i don't know if i would rank that second
but uh since i have three boys uh it it can turn out to be important
oh i know
you know in a in a given year dental ca- dental expenses can really kill you
now my husband is with uh northwest airlines
and he gets uh you know the full health and dental
and uh we have four children
and what you pay just to have teeth cleaned is outrageous
and i don't know how people that don't have it can afford it
or maybe they don't
uh and then uh uh if the cleaning doesn't get you the orthodony will
uh i guess that would be up there
uh i'm not sure if i would rank uh how i would rank that next to say compared to retirement
or uh uh uh pretax savings was another thing that i think is a a great a great benefit
well it's a lot easier to to save it when you don't get your hands on it first
when you have the when you have the uh the economy to scale and everything that a large corporation has and you can uh offer some incentive
and if the government goes along by not taxing it when you put it aside you can really build up uh the savings and the that you wouldn't otherwise do
uh what about what about uh lesser uh benefits perhaps for you but for for the women in the in the corporation
for example uh
do they e- even do they have father leaves or anything like that
they may have uh just plain parental leave which either one can take
oh i do too
uh i their uh i know their maternity leave is on the order of six weeks which i think is too short uh
oh i think i think it's just a crying shame uh
and uh the infant needs her desperately
there ought to be uh uh some compromise that could where uh where the person would be guaranteed
it's uh it's so important to families then
and uh and yet anybody whose gotten far enough to get a good salary is really reluctant to give that up
i think you've put your finger on the one benefit that i that i would most like to see uh changed
well i think they're at they're com- they've come a long way
uh at least some companies some of them uh my girlfriend in particular that works for a a rental car agency
and uh as manager and uh they have a very very poor leave policy
and uh i just don't know how how women do it
particularly single parents who don't have the support at the other end uh
there's no other way i mean uh unless they're part of some extended family which is unlikely uh people moving as much
and uh they just it's just a terrible choice
but you can't afford to stay once you get there
just just getting there is has to be half the fun
i do as far as uh as far as uh as far as immigration as a whole goes
i think that uh we simply must start accepting everybody in the world
i i think uh i think when we come to a time of recession that it's particularly important that we shut our doors at that time
uh i hope you're one of the employed right now
and uh i applied for one set of jobs with a company here in dallas that they had two hundred openings
but they had two thousand applications
and i know that there are a lot of foreigners uh here you know doing my line of work
and of course i'm not perfectly happy about not having a job
so how do you feel
well i'm a little bit ambivalent
the problem with uh and i think one of the problems with immigration policy is like any other political problem is that people are not willing to discuss it uh in in terms of what uh really is driving it
they're not willing to tell the truth the same way with uh issues of uh race and things like that
i mean right now uh i believe there are two policies that uh that the government uses to modulate immigration three actually
one is at the high end uh
they always want to be able to uh do some brain draining
they always like to be able to attract the uh einsteins or the professor chou
or you know
and so they can almost always find room for someone like that
at the bottom end they uh
are always willing to uh let in cheap labor
those are two things that i think are going on although they i i don't think the politicians would tell you that
and i think you're right in both cases
and then the
third thing is uh the political aspect of uh uh letting steam come out from under the lid in mexico
they cannot close off the mexican border not because it's physically impossible but because the explosion that would take place in mexico would be uh uh
so they keep allowing uh the pressure cooker to let off steam
i think they're a very difficult group to integrate into uh society
they're very difficult uh group to find jobs and uh and uh places for
and so uh uh i don't deny that we may have been involved in causing the problem that uh in that they're pretty miserable where they are
but i'm not to sympathetic about uh letting large numbers of haitians in
actually actually i feel that if we accepted these people that we would eventually have almost the total population here
and it would have nothing to do with political situations
oh my gosh
but if you let them yeah if you let them in a million at a time it wouldn't make that you know it wouldn't make that big a bulge in the population but po- politically and economically
have you been have you been to southern florida
well i know about it
uh i mean it's it is now with haitians the way it was with cubans uh twenty years ago
well i mean and the two of them together
i mean we can
on the other hand you know
so there's uh there's a lot to be said for having a steady stream of people who know how it is someplace else coming in
but there's some differences in the immigrants
that that we're getting now
well i particularly have a problem with the illegal immigration
probably your a great deal of what you say is true about the legals
uh they they don't bother to learn our language
and uh first of all th- they
i'm sorry this i really feel strongly about this
oh i don't know
i uh i refinished a couple of old uh dressers that were gi- handed down
you know nice it's nice tongue and groove uh uh construction
i've done some other things too uh you know
uh uh my wife has picked up a couple of things saying uh boy if we could refinish that that would be a
and uh we've done it a couple of times
that's uh that's a kind of low risk sort of project isn't it i guess
uh i have a a uh really nice desk a nicer desk than i could afford which
and uh we stripped it all the way down and refinished it
and it turned out to be really nice uh a nice desk
maple top i think or
i i uh put together a a up rolltop desk from scratch
you know a kit
oh i'm jealous
but it was fun
i i do do things uh that might be too crude to be called woodworking
i've built my own deck and uh
i i've done the same you know like the trim around the house
my i uh i picked up a bunch of craftsman tools from the forties that my wife's father owned when he was alive
and so i do have a band saw and a router and uh things like that out in the garage
but i can't say i use them very often
they're handy uh they they come in handy at the most unusual times
uh i bought myself a uh template for making mortices and doors
and that's a whole lot easier than doing it with a chisel
but i've also i've also used them for building drawers where you uh for rabbeting and uh because uh rabbeting on my table on my uh radial arm saw is a little bit uncertain
so i got one for christmas a few years ago and used it quite a bit for the first eight months i had it
and now i use it twice a year maybe
my br- my brother's used it a lot for making drawers
what what's your opinion of wha- what a good router is like
you know i
because he was tell me like the ones that you dial in aren't all that great
uh i have never even s- i have never even looked at one closely
uh the the little use that i've gotten from my router i would say uh i would spend my money on the bits
uh i have a i'd guess you'd call a medium quality craftsman router
and the uh
but the problem is that the uh as with
any any time you buy a a tool with a a as a as a package the bits that they give you are low end
and uh uh if you're going to use for a lifetime i suppose it's worth it
because y- e- uh
i imagine if i go and sharpen them myself uh they won't last
and i've never had the bits sharpened
they they really get hot don't they
and they they dull after awhile
especially i did some cabinets in uh ash and oak and uh that that wears a bit down
we remodeled and saved a bunch of really nice ash cabinets uh which had been in the original
routing hardwood will uh take the edge off a cheap bit pretty fast
and then you take the blade to the to get sharpened right
like oh my gosh
well i've used mine on treated wood
and now all my blades need sharpening
because uh treated wood will also chew them up
we do keep uh well we started out keeping a budget about two years ago
and i made a lotus spreadsheet and went through the year using all of our our checkbook to figure out what we spent each time and whether we were over or under for each month
and then basically since then what i've done is is keep track of it through the checkbook
so that based on whatever we've got coming in the check coming in
that's our our biggest uh expense
so i take half of that amount out of my checkbook each with each paycheck
so that i can keep uh uh good balance
a running total yeah through the month
uh we've we've uh taken how much we have you know write down how much we have coming in each month
and then uh we've
we sat dow- made up different accounts like you know
we've set a budget for each you know household expenses or food and clothing and entertainment and then our our own fun money and just stuff like that
and then we write down each each time we spend something we write down in a book
and at the end of the month we tally it up to see how close we you know
we we try to stay within a certain budget
is it is it hard to keep track of it
or does it work out pretty well
um it takes some it takes some dedication to do it
but it it works out real well
and and you're staying within your budget and keep-
i stay wi- i have to stay within it
so i you know
and then we have that you know
if you can't stay if something comes up and you can't stay within it then we have uh you know a budget for you know like we call our slush fund or something
and some- an unexpected comes up then you're not you know you don't feel it so strapped
because we don't you know we don't charge anything that we can't pay off by the end of the month
we've been trying we're trying to uh do that this year
we've budgeted the money that we used to spend we were spending on a coda account with t i and then money we were also buying stock with for that year
we have uh another loan with the bank
and so we hope by the end of this year
the only thing we have it to pay off is our is a automobile loan and our house payment
and that's the only thing we ever
huh oh it's long term
he ha- you know his retirement plan and then to coda and stuff like that that's all we
and you know we just have our life insurance for right now
so we don't have any long term you know in stocks or anything like that right now
mostly what we're doing we've worked we've done the uh coda account with t i where they we put in so much a month
and then they or so much a pay check and then they match it
so that's that's worked out pretty good
and then i used to work for t i
and i have
when i retired from there or left i took the money i that i had in mine and put it in an i r a
and we had an out we had an existing i r a
so we have both of us have some money in an i r a that we're also trying to figure
to put it we're putting it in c d's right now
and then we're also looking at it in possibly getting a mutual fund
and then uh you know and then when if we need it we wait until it it's expired
and then so
the other thing that we've done that that was really nice to see we had one of the financial companies um
han- uh john hancock company came out
and their agent did a long term analysis based on salary and uh what we were pla- what what our uh goals were on a long term budget in terms of retirement kids college paying off the house buying a different house
um special thing buying land and building our own house
and they did an analysis for us based on what we were putting in and the time frame that we wanted to look at
and then gave us a good idea back you know some good information back on whether or not we were going to achieve those goals
and or not and what we needed to do so that we could achieve them and the money we could put in at what time
you know just our our life insurance guy has come out you know
and he's set up uh you know determined how much we need to you know we need if something were to happen
that that's the other financial thing i guess that we've done is with our life insurance is since i'm at home now is is figuring out uh what we would need if something happened to my husband or what he would need if something happened to me
that's a a big thing to think about
yeah you know
if i would sell the you know
if he something would happen to him i wouldn't stay in texas
i would uh sell the house and move back home you know to my home town
and and uh i wouldn't stay here in texas
so you know i don't know what he would do
i guess that's most of my um financial plans right now
is is there anything you'd like to add
well it's been nice talking to you
and then i supplement that with uh radio news from my car radio and from a news magazine once a week
so i try to listen to the radio in the morning and and try to catch one of the morning talk shows
and then i usually end up flipping through c n n and headline news during the evening
i always try to read the sunday paper just because it usually gives a summary of the the week's hot events
so i try to i try to catch that if nothing else
and and how do you rate the uh
h- are you pleased with the news coverage that you're receiving
for for local news i think we do real well where it's
but i think we get excellent local coverage um
and i like the national news that we see
we we watch n b c
and i think they do a real good job
so i'm i've been real pleased with the quality of the news we get
i would much prefer that they keep their analysis to themselves um since i don't necessarily agree with it or it tends to be extraordinarily trite
uh i think i'm fed up with trite
and i understand the void that uh comes naturally with both radio presentations and television presentations
and a- as expensive as they are to produce they certainly don't want any dead airspace
but i think there's enough news out there that they could pass on more factual information to us
and like you said save the commentaries because i'm going to listen to the the news and draw my own opinions
i wo- i we're certainly in agreement there
they're maybe they're a little more efficient
uh i think the my greatest complaint about news programs is programs like sixty minutes
but i don't anymore maybe once or twice a year
well i used to watch sixty minutes until they did two programs uh that i knew both the people and the inc- incidences
and i knew that they had presented an extremely slanted viewpoint
and it ever since that time i just don't watch uh
so i guess we have the the same reaction whether we came about it from the same place or not
well i had heard a couple of people you know that i had talked to about certain programs say that you know they had read other things besides what sixty minutes presented and that they didn't present it nearly the same way as the you know news articles or whatever they had they had already been familiar with
so i started questioning just how how bias they really were
i don't know di- i don't know how old you are
but it seems to me like the last uh newscaster that presented news in just the nice simple factual way that i wanted to hear was walter cronkite
so i don't i don't know if you're familiar with him or not
not really you know
but i never got to see his actual nightly news
i i did grow up with david brinkley uh
well brinkley was sort of trying to be in the mold
and he did a a pretty good job
we we used to watch um him and i guess john chancellor
and i always liked david brinkley
and i- and i used to enjoy john chancellor's style of reporting
but on the nightly news now he goes into his commentary
and that's where i get get into the problem with with him
well once they've reported the facts all they can offer is an opinion anymore
well i almost felt like it was too much
uh i- i spent a number of years in the service as an intelligence analyst
and i don't need their fill-ins you know
but i i think it helps me everyday in trying to review wh- the state that the world is in and try to guess where we're going
i wondered if it would help you sometimes fill-in the gaps or recognize discrepancies that other people people like myself might not pick up on
well i i think uh my background is probably what absolutely turned me off with sixty minutes
what weekly um magazine do you look at
uh but i keep coming back to that one
so i that's kind of my favorite
or like does it give um i guess little encapsulated reports and and then a few big stories
it's primarily um a few big stories and then lots of high-level reports
uh here's what went on in asia over the past week
and there's maybe a page of that little brief paragraphs unless that was one of their the focus of their main stories
uh it too is one those
and i do most of my reading in the bathroom
um and it's one of those that i can ei- read either an article or a couple of pages of those brief excerpts in the time frame that i'm going to spend in there
and it just seems to fit nicely so that i can get it read in about three days
well we're working on a newsweek uh
for the last couple of months we got you know an introductory subscription
so we decided to try it because prior to that all we got were things like glamour or sports illustrated
so we decided to try to bring one in that was a little bit better for us so to speak
well to broaden your horizons make you think about different things anyway
well anytime that we stop and think it can't hurt
i i even i enjoy reading t news
they just they just show you the words and the facts
and they they don't offer any commentary
and it gives me a quick chance to to be caught up during the day because you know we don't listen to the radio at work at all
so i don't like to go the whole day without hearing anything
oh i'm with you
i have to check t news every everyday
and the other thing we have that i like to check sometimes is um talking fingers
and then you dial in an access code
and it will depending on what topic you called in to hear about whether it was the news or the weather or a soap opera update it will give you um updated information
so that can give you you know current news updates current weather updates things like that
and it's it's offered through the local phone company free of charge
well it does sound very interesting
it it really is yeah it really is nice i mean because it gives you a wide variety of things you can call and talk and find out about
so that is something you might keep your eyes open for
i think it's it's catching on throughout the country
well how do you feel about it
well uh i don't have any strong convictions about it
um i know i haven't done any peace corps service
and i don't know anybody in my immediate family that has or you know has ever even thought about it
do you know uh do you know anybody that's been it
the the only people i know that have done anything remotely like that are people that have gone to be missionaries
and that's only because i went to baylor
and a lot of students from baylor go and and serve as missionaries during the summer
but i think i think that's a terrible idea
i mean and it's nice to to try to teach young people some some uh uh civil uh consciousness but forcing them to to donate basically their time and efforts
it's definitely up to the person uh
so i'd have to say that uh it you know the people who do it well some feel it's rewarding
i don't know you know
but uh i don't know how we got the subject
i was i almost hung up because i thought well gosh i don't i don't really have an opinion except for no
well how long you been in san antonio
i've been here for um just almost fiv- well no almost four years
and i lived with dana in school
well that's good
well back to the topic at hand
i mean the the recording mentioned the peace corps
well it sounded like i mean this is like major long term commitment like a year or six months
or so you're looking at the peace corps or sabbatical maybe
or you know i don't know
i mean but uh
i mean i'm all for donating my time to worthy causes
like i do some volunteer work here and there
and every once in a while i'll do uh a uh local big brother big sister thing
or i'll go you know do a
but that that time is minuscule compared to what what
i couldn't possibly commit a year or two of my life to to go do something
and seems to me like the peace corps
well i doubt that
w- i i mean it would it would have to be tough going somewhere you don't know the culture usually i guess
i think that maybe that's why some people do it is uh to see the other cultures or you know and some of that
but uh to do that i don't know
oh i don't know either
growing up all i knew was you go to high school you you know you work you go to college you get out of college and you get a good job and you work
and and none of this you go spend two years in the peace corps to ex- to broaden your horizons
uh-huh well you know uh i know american express
i'm n- i'm working at american express now
after a certain amount of years of service these employees can take off like six months or something for some type of sabbatical or some you know some something like that
and they're allowed to take that time off and then come back where they left off
so it is something that i think uh you know even the larger organizations will support
uh it's it's really for the community to give you know to to give back to the community type of thing
it's for i think at the same it's for some people to you know help them grow in other areas
well i mean in that respect a lot of people join the military to to grow up and to decide what they want to do
and the peace corps or something like that is probably useful as as that kind of a time
but uh and a lot of people have gone in the military i mean you know when they're in the college
sometimes it's to sup- help support college you know
uh others people don't know what they want to do
but as far as uh you know the peace corps i guess i suppose there's a few people that have done it at that point in their lives
but i think a lot of it's you know when the- people get older they'll do something like that
but i don't
i i i don't
and none of my
oh that's okay
n- and none of my really close friends in college went off to be missionaries or anything
so i don't really know anyone first hand that's that's com- committed a chunk of their life to do service work
well i'm going to go get a goo- good job and make some money and buy a nice car
yeah or or
i i have no i don't know anybody that's done that either
it's interesting we got this topic because i i i don't know what i marked off to get this
i i can't imagine
and the switchboard's been down for several days
and the last time i called it before it went down i had this topic
and i didn't feel like talking about it
so i hung up
and i guess they they keep you on the same topic until you actually talk to somebody about it
so you had the same one huh
oh well well you'll you'll get it over with here
oh probably five or six
oh i've done maybe four or five
well she just sent me the information out
i i got a hold of it you know
so they mailed me the information that i filled out
um i've talked about camping with someone
that one was interesting because i talked to a man in in washington d c
and it was hot here
and it was snowing there
so that was pretty interesting
and i talked to someone about the uh the uh education system
but that was fairly interesting
and i talked to somebody about credit card usage
and i talked to this person who i gathered from speaking to her that that she and her family just didn't have much
and they didn't have much credit available to them
and so she basically didn't use credit cards and didn't know very much about them and how they work
and and how you can use them to your advantage and and how you know you you can do certain things with them
i always i use everything with my visa
and i pay it all off
so that's a good deal for me
that's the way i use them uh i try i try to make sure i don't get in debt
well that's always a good plan
all that th- most of the ones on the list i checked off stuff like football and and stuff that i can i i would enjoy talking about
and i haven't gotten a one of them yet when i've called
i had uh
and uh i can't remember me and i think me and dana had football
oh how funny
so we talked about the cowboys a little bit
and i'm out here in phoenix
so we talked about phoe- cardinals
and so so that one was all right
and then what else did i have
i think i had some other uh like staying in shape or working out
this other guy i got this guy from new york
and the switchboard called me
so i was caught a little off guard
and i couldn't think of anything at all
so i started making stuff up
and you've probably never gardened in your life
and i can't even i can't even grow an ivy
that told and he told me when he gave it to me that it was impossible to kill
you could you could dry it out
well i killed it pretty quick
but i think it's one of the easiest plants
i can't i don't know the name of it
but i'm not too much into
uh in the houston area
well i used to
but i'm now in palo alto california which is i think the recycling capital of the world
oh that's great
so we have many recycling activities
and i'm and in full uh support of all of them
oh we are too
our community is uh just starting to get organized about it
they just opened up a recycling center where we go and donate our our things and dump them off ourselves
and uh it
well that's something
but it it seems to me that we've gotten a whole lot better um cooperation out here uh by setting it up so that we pay just a little bit extra uh
actually i don't think we pay very much extra at all too
but the uh garbage men
come by uh on your regular garbage day and pick up the recycling out at the curb
i don't know if it's the if they've done it citywide yet or not where they have the color coded uh bags and uh bins
and they give us one for aluminum and uh steel one for metals
and then you can either bundle your newspapers or put them in grocery bags
so we have we leave three little piles
and the garbage men come by and uh collect them and leave us new bags when ours get old and ratty or leave the ones if they're still in good shape
oh that's great
and the it really pays for itself because oh then the city
we're we're all for it
we've got several bins in our on in our garage where we uh you know sort things out and and take it to to the appropriate places
but they claim that because of the way they're bound they uh it's too expensive to recycle them
and they're uh
and one's for colored paper
so anything like manuscripts or computer paper or so-
but we get tons of catalogs and things like that and magazines
and there's no way to get rid of them
oh it does
but i'm sure that they can uh find some sort of uh use for them if you know you know there
i've seen talk about uh using garbage for uh energy
and so you know you could also apply the magazines toward that
well that would be a help
and it's really going to be a mess when they have to start hunting for places to put the things
oh i know it
we did have uh another novel uh experiment start this year
you can you buy these super giant heavy-duty paper bags
and you get them for i think it's about fifty cents apiece at the grocery store you um usually buy them by the dozen
and then you put all your lar- yard clippings and uh leaf rakings and anything that will be compostible
and those and they the garbage men also pick those up on thursdays
oh that's great
and then the uh they take them to a special part of our dump where composting is now in full swing
and at the end of every year uh they sell all the composts to nurserymen and to local people who want to put it on their flower beds
well that's a great idea
i wish we were that uh involved in uh or that our city was so involved in that involved in recycling
because you know i've talked to many people
and we wouldn't mind going its extra effort to do it uh
oh yeah you know
and i don't mind you know
at first it was the the little extra money that you got you know returning the cans in and stuff like that
but now you know i don't mind as long as things are getting recycled you know that we don't get reimbursed
i think it's it's to me more of a convenience to have them come pick it up
oh i oh i know it
but so few people uh have enough to make that worthwhile you'd spend more in gas getting down there then you get back
and then the plus the time that you waste standing in line is valuable also
now do the grocery stores in houston have recycling for their paper bags and plastic bags
i know of one that the one that we use uh has uh recycling for the bags
and uh and they're promoting the cloth bags you know the reus- reusable cloth bags
well we can get a nickel apiece for any paper bags that we bring back to be reused
oh that's great
and they have a giant bin by the front door for the plastic bags
and they say y- as long as it's clean they don't want a plastic bag that's full of goop
but they want any clean and dry plastic bag
so i keep
and the thing is i hardly have room now for all the things that we're saving it to recycle
so right outside the back door i've got the two burlap bags hung up for the cans and bottles
and wi- there right outside the that place where the garbage can is we have the bag for the newspapers
and now we've got the bag for the plastic bags
i understand uh
my husband about once a weekend he'll go uh to a couple of areas where he knows that the people just throw cans out
and he'll go pick them up because he just can't stand that
well how nice
and uh it's so you know
he we have all our piles of of recyclables also
i remember at christmas the the only thing that i'm
when you were talking about the composting the only thing that our city did that was they di- uh provided a place for us to take our christmas trees
uh to for them to mulch
for for city use
they just put all our christmas trees in the regular uh compost
so they did say that you had to put it out within i think it was uh three weeks after
and uh otherwise you would have to treat it like you would any other lawn refuse
so you know if we have branches or something
but otherwise uh they have to be in one of their paper bags
well that sounds like you all really have a a great system worked out there
and they even picked up our uh styrofoam pl- packing materials
they brought uh the week after christmas they left a plastic bag on everybody's front doorknob with a little note on it saying we're trying something new next week only
if you have any uh of those little uh styrofoam peanuts that
and we'll uh take all of those back and try to recycle them
well see that's one
but uh something nee- does need to be done about the styrofoam that uh
well those things must take up a huge amount of space in landfills
i mean they don't uh uh
and they stay forever
and i've seen where some places have taken a plastic and uh they're recycling them into other plastics
and i think that would be great if they could get something organized along those lines
it they really have to rely on businesses that generate a lot of that stuff
uh because otherwise uh you know they're not going to go house-to-house collecting it
and you're not going to bother if you have one bag full
oh i was thinking about you know like the uh the styrofoam used at uh the fast-food restaurants
that if everybody uh
i know like our cafeteria here uses a lot of styrofoam
now we quit that about two years ago no three years ago when we got china mugs for everybody
so and the only difficulty with that is that we're in the middle of a five-year drought
and so i- it's a real difficult choice whether we want styrofoam cups to fill up our landfills or uh china cups to use up our water
but at the moment we're using the china cups
and everybody gets one at the beginning of the year
and then uh your supposed to keep it recycled every day
well that's good
well let us hope that everybody's going to be paying more attention to this and that we will get uh better reuse of things
i h- i have to believe everybody is starting to pay attention and take heed of what is happening
and so it will it will be good
well i enjoyed it
well good to talk
um i i understand that it's being proposed as a requirement
for uh young people to be to go into public service
all all young americans they did not specify you know exactly what young means
i think that it probably would be a a good program
you're prob- probably right
and there will be a lot of rebellion in that
and when you get people who have no desire to be there in the first place
that that would be the problem sure would
so i think it would be a good thing though
or maybe offer them you know some sort of an incentive to do it
uh you know college credit you know something you know
i'm not sure they need to be you know paid you know
but that that kind of takes away from public service
but just you know to receive a letter in the mail
but i think giving giving some kind of college credit
that says you know you need to report somewhere by next monday you know you need to report somewhere by next monday you know
i don't think so either because a lot of people um depending on how the public service programs are set up
and i'm not that familiar with them to know
but you know if a a lot of people flat can't afford to
and most kids these days have gotten themselves into uh financial situations
so it's it's a really tough question
they need you- young families whatever
they just couldn't you know take off to do that
and if you put them in public service right out of high school then that that postpones their college
and that would upset a lot of people too
it would have to be a lot of you know thought given to something like that i would think
i you know i think it would be good for a lot of people to get involved in that kind of program
but i i think it can't be something that's mandatory
it has to be something that's voluntary you know which is pretty much the way it is now
i'm not even really sure at this point in time you know what what programs are out there
and that's the other thing is that you know instead of making it mandatory they maybe need to publicize it a little bit better
and uh you know go to the schools and do programs
you know uh volunteer for such and such a time
and you've a choice of where you want to go
and and that way handling it that way they could probably get some results out of it
like maybe if if there was something they could do in their own own in their own town or city
yeah and not have to pull up roots and you know go somewhere half way around the world or something
that's that's true too
but they would have to be supported in some way
and i'm not sure that tho- those programs are available to do that
and you wonder you know what kind of quality job would they do you know
or would they really you know make a contribution of some kind
and i don't know who's even proposing it
or or how they plan on implementing it
i i'm not sure either
but i think there would have to be a lot more you know information you know disseminated before you say
let's do this you know
you know it be
it wouldn't take up much much it would take up more time than anything
but it wouldn't take up a lot of money
and you have a kind of a captive audience
and you you give them your speech and maybe a little slide show or something
and i think that they could get some results from that
but they don't know where to go to to to do anything
i don't really see the emphasis on things like peace corps like we you know we saw back i guess in the carter administration
that was that was a big thing with him
and i guess even back to kennedy as a matter of fact i guess kennedy may be the one that actually started the thing or was you know really interested in things like that
like i say i don't even know what programs are are even ongoing now you know
well thanks for your time
ta- you too
well how about you
and if it goes down then we're stuck all day
and so i like the i b m p c personally
but that's pretty much everything i've worked with
and uh i've become so accustomed to it that uh it's second nature
well i have an i i b m p s two model thirty
it's kind of kind of getting too slow for me
but my job i'm an e d p auditor
so i audit uh computer applications both on the personal computer and the mainframe level
and i use my personal computer constantly
not only do i do p c type things like uh using lotus or word processors
so all i have on my desk is my p c
but i'm i'm getting not only our local area network
but i'm getting two separate mainframe machines also
so we um we use it's an i b m p s two also
and um you know every now and then the file gets so big that you know it moves slower than i'd like but i uh i do mainly graphic work on it
and uh a little bit of word processing and then lotus applications to it
and uh i don't know
i just i enjoy working with them
i mean the things you can do are endless
and there's three of us e d p auditors
and one of the three of us has an accounting background
and so she's not real proficient in p c's
and the other just has
so i ended up taking on the load of making sure everybody knows what they're doing
and i'm the administrator for our local area network
and i need to keep that going
so i i'm i couldn't live my life without a p c
but i just don't find the time that i can use it
um we've got a couple of portable lap top p c's at the office that i end up bringing one of them home a lot
they didn't know how they were going to do without me at work because i am pretty much the like you said the guru
and um so they didn't know how it was going to work
they knew they were going to have to get a modem so that we could in the decks machine so that we could in my home so that we could make it through this eight weeks or so
but uh you know it's uh it's almost like we could become too dependent on them
and oh i we use a lot of free lance
and uh that's uh pretty much takes up a lot of our day so for as producing transparencies and things
and um it
uh compared to the way the things have upgraded
have uh really
but uh the way things have changed over the years with the p c and the different programs is just great
it's remarkable the things we can do now and compared to you know a few years
i'm i'm trying to uh get an updated machine
mine uh is just putting along
and it's not fast enough for a new four eighty six chip
but i'm determined to brake mine
so he has to get me another one
well that's what i do
and we had about ten people sharing this printer
by it was attached to like a central p c
and you had to take your diskette to the p c to print something
um now that's awful
so the first thing
so i talked my boss into investing in a it's not a uh a uh real elaborate local area network
but we can share the printer
and we can uh send files to each other
and we can mail send mail messages to each other
and then i talked them into buying a h p laser jet
and that was a major ordeal to get him to buy it
but once he bought it he has been so pleased
it's it's fast
oh it has good copy
i've got a little little uh i b m pro printer on my desk
but and i can use either the pro printer
or i've got my p c configured to where i can use either printer the one that's on the network or my own
so if i just need something real quick and i don't feel like getting up and going and getting what i printed
um we're just trying to talk ours into getting a laser printer
and uh it's just so
the budget restraints and things like that it's makes it difficult
hewlett packard makes it's actually a dot matrix printer but the quality is almost laser quality
and i think it's called the desk jet
and they're you understand i think they're about five hundred dollars now
and we uh got a quote on some laser printers the other day at six hundred dollars
but uh we do a lot of transparencies
so they just want black and white which see we can just run them through the laser printer real quick
but uh it uh
so that's all you need for like charts and stuff
but uh it's uh
and if we want well in our area if we want to use it we have to you know like you said you had to change it put it on a disc
and uh wait for an opportunity to use it
we you'd have to just sit and wait while someone else was using the printer
i worked at the uh
well it used to be the largest bank in san antonio until n c n b came up and bought the rival
and now n c n b and now n c n b's got a little larger market share
but it's the only uh
well it's part of the bank holding company and that bank holding company of the ten largest banking holding companies in texas
any way i work in a big prestigious place
and i couldn't believe when i walked in the door on my first day and here's the audit department of this this huge holding company sharing a h p rugged writer
i was going oh wait a minute
so how are you supposed to expect to stay number one when you're behind the times in technology
we're we're trying
well see the entire bank is not like that
the the bank philosophy is one of innovation and
it's just the audit department happened to be just a little behind the times because the uh the senior vice president over audits is cheap
and it's real hard to pry money out of him to to do these things
but i was i was able to convince him that it would be cost effective and that our board presentations would be much better
we find it hard to believe sometimes or hard to understand when uh we work for a computer company and uh how are we supposed to present the imagine that we're supposed to present with equipment that's outdated that's obsolete
and the guys that some of the guys that run this place are very tight
and it's like well why do we need this
can't you do that with you know what we have
and when we try and then they complain about this doesn't look good
unfortunately the the uh computer equipment and and related peripherals are changing and improving so rapidly
like for instance we bought a
so sounds like you like to read
i'm i'm a single mom
but i have always loved reading
so most of my books are um i guess what you'd call self improvement type of books
um my interests switch around dramatically
i used to read just mainly fic- fiction
and now i lik- like a said i've read a lot of self self help books
oh i read all kinds of things for um helping people survive a divorce
uh the road less travelled was probably one of my favorites
uh i haven't gotten through
um as far as dealing with divorce
oh i'm kind of getting that one past me but a good self help book
um that sounds good
well um probably the best one that i i know of and i work with all the time is called search for significance by robert mcgee and it's one that we use in our work
it's probably one you'd find in like a christian book store
that does soun- that's sound really good
um what kind of counseling do you do
or should we stay on the topic of books
um probably should stay on the topic
but that has a little bit to do with some of the things that i read
it's a christian treatment organization and because of that i see uh work with adolescents specifically
so i see a lot of kids with with various problems
so a lot of the books i've been reading have to do with helping them get through those issues
oh i would imagine helping them feel good about themselves
and then to have to deal with sexual abuse would be terrible as a teen
that's uh that must be a wonderful feeling to be in that profession and be able to make a contribution like that
well sometimes it's rewarding
and and sometimes it's a struggle
oh i'm sure
uh what oth-
is is that just the only type of reading you've been doing
or do you have you read any good novels lately
it's it's hard for me to do a lot of uh
reading yeah reading just for enjoyment
that's for sure um
and i just realized i had never read it growing up
so i just finished reading that
um that's neat
and it wa- it was good
um she she's not didn't enjoy it much
so i didn't get much satisfaction trying to discuss it with her
but i thought it was real interesting
i've always wanted to go back and read some of my literature texts from college um because i enjoyed some of those stories so much
but i never seem to have the time to do that kind of reading
um i trying to think of some of my other favorite books
but i i keep lists
i must have a list of oh two hundred three hundred books that i want to read
and then i i get distracted and or have to start on another one
i i've got a copy of the road less travelled
but i was trying to think there's another scott book that i've got that i had read
uh he he also wrote people of the lie
i i bought that one
and i didn't get into involved in that one as well
and it's kind of the whole concept of global peace you know like and communities building communities
uh i got involved in uh beginning experience weekends
and uh it was of the people from there that said that
and his whole idea is we can build a better world if people get involved in good community building projects
and he did uh mention beginning experience weekends as one of the you know one of the places
so i've ha- um
it it really was
a real fun boo- bunch of books that i read uh the beginning of last year were um the author of jonathan jonathan livingston sea- seagull i can't think of his name
pardon me uh no uh
it'll it'll come to me
but he wrote he wrote the illusion and a bridge over ti- a bridge to forever
but uh they they were fun
um not very long
oh i see
and so uh i got myself involved in a sales job
and right now my list of books to be read have to do with uh the art of selling
it's just i was just thinking at at rossa
even if you took speed reading huh
um trying to think
he writes uh spy novels
i think the last novel i read i read i guess in conjunction with my wife over vacation last year
it was a um last name's
it's called piercing no it's called this present darkness
it's uh kind of unusual book
oh that sounds interesting
hey you should make yourself a promise that you'll you'll read one novel in the next six months just for you
you know it's it's so easy to get caught up on reading just for your work or you know self improvement
and you kind of forget the fun of reading
well i guess we've covered the topic pretty thoroughly
and i thank you for calling
and uh i'll have to check out that book you
okay deanna uh
and i believe also in shooting of uh rape i mean killing a rape victim
i mean someone in the process of rape
and i don't know what el- i don't really remember what else
how do yo- wh- what do you think about it
i agree i i agree you know
oh i do too
i mean i think they're doing their duty
but i think if they're going to come out and kill somebody else then they deserve it
uh i heard something on the news the other night they were talking about uh oh i know what it was
it was in our in our little local paper our little lewisville paper that comes out twice a week on the front page every week uh
tha- it's like a call in survey that says you know do you think so
and so and then you call this number
and you press like one for yes and two for no
and one of the things the questions the other day this last paper and i haven't seen the results of it i'm anxious to was do you think that um capital punishment ought to apply to drug dealers
oh i think
well they were showing a segment on a man in philadelphia that's going after the drug dealers
and he just got fed up with it
and he said he's had his house broken into and windows smashed and his car stolen three times and everything trying to ge- keep him quiet
but he's organizing people
and they're going out and marching on the corners and takin- taking back their territory
you know i think that's what it's going to take though
it's going to take uh you know
the police i think i don't think can do it can do it alone you know
it's going to take
i'm sorry i'm trying to
it's going to take all of us you know getting together and just saying
and it said they're going to other neighborhoods from there
and then quite often they'll get shot
that's right uh
oh my gosh
the only thing about the death penalty and and i know that that they try to be careful
and they try to be sure
but these people are on death row for like twenty years you know
an- you know
if if you know
i i think to be you know being convicted is one thing you know
and that's and that's great if they're con- if they're sentenced to death
i mean it ha-
well it goes all through the st- it goes all through the state supreme court system before they're
and they've been convicted
and then they've been sentenced to death
i mean there's no doubt
i mean i
so once they've gotten the penalty and there is no doubt do it you know
i don- i guess i mean that may sound that sounds cold
but gosh you know we're keeping you know we're we're keeping these men in prison for fifteen or twenty years on death row
and it's costing us a heck of a lot of money
and that's terrible to look at it that way
but that that's the way it is
ye- if the crime was bad enough that they were sentenced to death then do it you know uh
and the execution was to have taken place a few weeks ago
and there was a lot of protest
even robert redford you know was protesting this guy's execution
so the governor backed down
and i was so mad
the crime was horrible his crime was just horrible
and those kind of people i'm sorry you don't reform them you know
and being under the influence of drugs is no excuse to me
and i don't know
the same thing goes with some of these insanity pleas you know
well if you're insane enough that you can go cut twelve people up into little bitty pieces and bury them in your back yard
then are y- can can you be helped you know
i have i have my doubts you know
i you know i don't know
some of these plea bargains and all this kind of stuff that they do it's just it just gets out of hand
and i understand that you know that you know
wasn't it lewisburg that had a lot of uh bad things happening just in the last couple of weeks
or was it not
it was i think it was the south east area
my daughter my daughter lives down in rowlett
and she was telling me about it
uh i can't remember what the town was some little area
and then it started kind of happening a couple of places in south dallas
and that's maybe what you were talking about
men breaking in uh to houses and taking or a man
they they think it's the same person taking uh little girls right straight out of their beds at night
and ku- you know breaking in obviously watching them in the house
and that's the last they se-
you know the little girls bedroom
i think there's been i think there's been like six or seven of them
over the last like probably eight or nine months
and they're all like um like ni- anywhere from nine to twelve years old i think is what they've been
and he's taken them and and raped them and then brought them right back and just kind of thrown them out of the car in their front yard
oh can you imagine because it it happens in the middle of the night
so the parent you know these parents didn't know this the the kid was gone until the kid is knocking on the door screaming let me in
you know can you imagine
you wouldn't even dare put these signs in the win- little emblems in the window saying child in this room in case of fire you know
shoo- i you know i've got one of those in brian's room
well it's really bad that you have to be you know
we we were over at a neighbors tonight
and bri- my little boy is on- is just a little over two
and their little boy is like five you know
so there's a big difference
and they were playing in the back yard
and we were getting ready to leave
and i went out in the back yard to get brian
and the boys were gone
and the back fence was open
and she didn't act like it bothered her at all oh
and we walked through the fence out the alleys ar- come to the back of the house you know
and wal- and i looked down both directions of the alley
and i saw neither one of them
and she was like oh god he does this all the time you know where are you
you know screaming j d
and you know
and he's five
and uh he brian was two houses down
and he you know
and i just can't do that
there was a little girl picked up in rowlett from uh from her front yard
and her dad was working in the back yard and had just left her few minutes in the front yard
and somebody apparently drove up and took her
and they never saw her again
oh man this is too scary
you know i let brian play here in the back yard
and we've got there's two gates that go into the back yard
and we've got one of those big eight foot privacy fences
and one of the gates has a padlock on it
and then the other gate just has one of those slide bar things
but it's on the inside
you know you'd have to cli- like come over they'd have to come over the fence
they could not open a gate you know
and i still feel a little uneasy about him playing back there
you know i mean if i don't hear him playing i mean i i get up and come out and look out the window real often you know
i mean you do
and if they find who's doing that to those little girls as far as i'm concerned he could
because sometimes there are crimes worse than murder
i and i believe that
and this is one of them
so i don't know
and i don't know what to i don't know what needs to be done you know
and when they do put them in there you know
we- i'm taking a business law class at night
and the guy that teaches it is a practicing criminal attorney
and so he comes in and tell us all these bizarre cases you know
and he said you can pretty much you know if you ever get on a jury you know you're not told this but if you ever get on a jury you can pretty much guess whatever you sentence them to
they'll serve they'll serve a quarter of it
so if you want them to stay in prison for fifteen years don't sentence them to fifteen years sentence them to a hundred
you know because then they'll serve fifteen or twenty so
it's just not it just doesn't seem right
it doesn't it doesn't
they just get out you know
well what are we going to do about it
and they don't seem to
ag- we're just going to have to adopt a completely different attitude
and we're going to have to say if you commit this crime and if we're sure you commit this crime you are going to be sentenced to death period
and do it you know
and if you commit this crime you will be in prison for the rest of your life
we're really going to do it you know
an- and i understand they're doing it because the prisons are full
but somewhere we've got to come up with some money to build to build more
you know and keep these people in them you know
well i was watching a show about this the other night
and you know they were like in a i think it was on forty-eight hours
um there was a crime here in mckinney
uh a rather heinous murder
there was no um remorse shown by uh at least one of the perpetrators
and yet for whatever reason um his crime was not considered a capital crime
and if if and when he comes gets free again
he will have no compunction but to complete that that same kind of lifestyle i mean continue that same kind of lifestyle
so it really bothers me that there's not a way of getting him out of the way forever
i don- i don't think our prison system isn't set up
where we um rehabilitate or you know restore anybody
but i i believe that god can come in and change a person's heart and genuinely change it
but that doesn't negate that you do reap what you sow
and if you do kill a person and it is you know you're found to be guilty i believe god establishes the authority of our court system
and i believe that you know that i do believe that capital punishment is uh alternative
even you know god can still change your heart
but that doesn't mean
like the alcoholic that charges up all the bills on the credit card or the shopaholic you know you get your life right with god
but you still have to pay your visa bill
that's that's right
you still have to you know
so but god sent us his grace
and they give pardons
but i believe if it's a genuine conversion there's a genuine
and those prison people know they know a genuine turnaround in a person's character
and i i worked in a prison in fort worth
you see it you know the ones that have a genuine character change
and they know that
they're they're not going to pardon someone from the governor
so i feel like you know that's is there is occasions where there are they do spare lives
and you know i leave that with the governor who of course is going to go through every authority because they want to be be reelected
but my concern is
first of all that not all all persons who i think should be receiving capital uh
whatever capital uh tha-
thank you i'm sorry i just got home from work
and i'm just kind of spaced out a little bit
uh that not all of them are being convicted of it that that the the they're not even being charged with that appropr-
i agree with you that that
but the same god that can work that miracle also established the laws that said um for certain kinds of
right then it was it was uh almost immediate
as soon as as the trial was over then it was stoning
but in in the old testament
we don't have speedy um punishment
and so it kind of loses its meaning
but the ba- the base is still there the foundation is still there though bu- of the system
but i know what you're saying uh
but also they're under a law because we haven't been removed from the law
we've just been taken out from under under a law
because under the law if your child mo- back talks you
he under the law he would be stoned
so we've been removed from the law of un- from being under the law
but we're still you know we're still accountable to it
but you know it's like god changes your heart to not do that
because in the old testament they could look all they wanted just couldn't do it
but in the new he's looking at your heart
and so i guess that's what what i mean by their character changes and you know what i mean it's like looking beyond what they're doing and looking at a heart and seeing what is the heart what's the character showing me here
and those and then any of
if i don't think see if i don't believe that there's not a character change and the authorities agree that this person needs to be excused i believe for murder uh rape i even believe incest things
that will permanently damage uh the character of the child
i believe crimes against children should be punished bu- by by death i believe
and that's where we just have to to trust the authorities
and they're not going to excuse people if it was was run like that
and if it was done quickly and done swiftly
and but it's not because the judicial system has rejected they've rejected the answer to all these problems they have pretty much
plus the all the judicial system is overloaded with
all kinds of um problems and crimes and so forth and then all of the um civil things that clog the courts
and having sat on both uh uh criminal and a civil uh jury
because we're suit happy
but but back to the to the capital situation sounds like you and i have a lot of of of uh common ground at least as as far as as capital punishment is concerned
i would like to see some some kind of reform or some kind of streamlining so that if a person is um convicted
and sentenced to to death that that automatic appeal which goes in could be more quickly dealt with
and and go ahead and get the punishment phase out of the way because it doesn't do the criminal or the victim's family
r- r- any of us the taxpayer any good to have him sitting around for months and years
an an bu-
i know in jamaica uh it think it's jamaica i think it's jamaica i know that they have you know crimes punishable by death
and i'm sure they hit a few every now and then
and i wouldn't want to be one of them that are not guilty
but i know that they have like uh their crime rate
it's uh one of the caribbean islands
and and they
and they don't have a lot of the crime because there is a law
and the law is enforced
and that's what wh- when you have lawlessness
i mean the law's not being enforced
and all that does is lawlessness
we were we went on a mission trip to manhattan and to the bronx and stuff two years ago
and all these kids were up on there getting arrested for crack
and everyone was out
uh we were across from that big bus station
but anyway and everyone they had like fifteen people lined up on the fence
and within two hours there were fifteen boys sitting there doing the same thing
and you'd see the same kid who were back out there in two days
because there's no the answer is not being given to them in the court system
and i think initially when our country was set up it was set up with god
and it was really an integral part
you can't you can't force people
but i think people are hurting
and they're out doing crack sitting on the street
i guess i'm kind of frustrated that you know we've gotten away from the christian basis that our court system was founded upon
i mean it reeks of the bible just the whole thing the whole system
and so i feel like if that was presented more openly and not just relying upon and para-church ministry to come in and do it that that the system itself
you know you know what i mean
i feel like that might be better if it was run on a more scriptural basis which would include you know you know and expediting the penalties and just getting it over with
however certain uh very liberal minded groups who do not um subscribe to the same ethical system that you and i do
such as the uh civil liberties unions and so forth
because too too often they're can be extremism that that hurts from from any direction
regardless of wha- whatever you're arguing or concerned about
and and i see that
and that's why you know i'm like okay what's my role in this thing
because i don't think the system is going to get fixed
but it's is something that i've done in the past
uh we try to go once maybe twice a summer uh
that's that's pretty average to me
we don't go for the long you know week long thing
but we usually go to uh a lake area you know where the campsites
are and do that uh
or do you have a camper
that's what i ha- you know
as a matter of fact my my you know the majority of the amount of camping i've done has been really roughing it
um as a little girl i'd go with my dad and my uncle and my brother
and we went to the boundary waters area in minnesota
that's that's really wild
so we um we have a five year old
and we started taking her she was pretty young when we started uh camping with her
oh the kids love it
i mean they just love it
and then they and they you know
and they don't have all these modern toys
and they have to use sticks and rocks and stuff like
and i like that
well how it
it's really is a is a good good family thing
we we try to uh go with another couple that have children also
and uh that makes it a lot more enjoyable
plus you know we don't have to go out and buy all the
we kind of split it up uh
because it gets it really does get expensive if you if you don't want to rough it all the way
you know even the sleeping bags those are running you know a good thirty dollars a pop
and and so we've built that up
oh well actually i would you know what i would love
now that that that's what i would like
uh let's see
my husband and this uh other couple that we go with her husband um kind of likes um is it scuba dive
and so we'll go to a lake and uh
and the girls can play on the beach area
and i would play on the beach area too
i'm just sitting here list- listening to your accent and thinking what a good time the computer is going to have with that
but you know you know what's really funny
um i've had people tell me that i have a texas accent
and and i mean there is just no way i've not picked one up
you don't you don't sound like it to me
oh have you
so i- i- if i have one it must be very very slight
oh that's true
i see i don't think i do
but uh but a lot of people do say i sound like
i guess i have i guess more of a twang
are you a a native texan
well good for you
but any way uh
i know there are some good places to go camping along the uh the lakes
or is there
well we didn't go camping
we just uh we did like uh we drove down to houston to visit friends
we went to galveston and uh to san antonio and then up to austin and and kind of uh you know doing the sight seeing type stuff
so we didn't go camping
that's one thing my husband wanted to do was on this summer's vacation was to go and camp wherever we went
and i said well i'd love that
and and ever once you know on my summer vacation you know my week-long vacation i
want to be a little bit pampered you know by a
so we're hoping to do like a three day weekend
there's um a thing called pfeiffer rim
it's uh there's a town called glenrose
and uh it's it has like dinosaur tracks
and it's got one of those wildlife parks
oh that sounds that sounds great
so we're going to try to do that like on a three day weekend go there
you know where you should try
and well we've driven through
and you know
but but not you know camping or anything
but i would love to camp
see you need to go there
it is it's you know it's it's high canyon
and uh and there's this little mountain lakes
and it's very peaceful
and um in in the early fall time
um i can't remember what type of trees they are
but they all the leaves turn yellow
and it's just brilliant
i used to go camping all the time as a a girl scout
uh well we did you know
i mean i just don't understand these people that think taking an r v
i mean we had to make the fires and dig latrines
i mean that is it
well do you you you say you haven't been in years
i'm um i'm a struggling single mom
oh gosh bless your heart
um it's you know
um and i- i- it it
and you know what that was one of the things i really thought i'd like to do with my children
you know again
and th- i'm a little bit fearful of trying that just women
i i really now n- n-
i i have gone on one little vacation just the girls and i
and rented a little efficiency you know
and and had a marvelous like two nights
and that was great
and even at that it it was like the first time that i ventured
you know out of the city by myself
and and you know i i stayed in a nice place
but it's still it's real different not to have another adult with you
i haven't quite adjusted you know
well i i was with t i until january
i uh i left t i in january hoping to strike out and find a job where i could make some money
so well it's it was a good plan but i haven't yet
i'm selling uh telephone systems
oh that's neat
and it's it's fun
and it's interesting
but it's also um pretty challenging
and i haven't i haven't started making money yet
um it's hard isn't it
it's it's hard
now how old are your girls
so i'm old
well excuse me just second
well um i'm going to listen
so well i've enjoyed this
and good luck
i i haven't made any
oh have you
well you know when i had to sup-
this is my my gemini nature you know
and it's like virtually anything
and it's it's been real interesting the different personalities
cause because it is neat
well then i guess i'll let you go so you can go get the door
well thank you
and um i enjoyed talking with you
you me too
oh um uh i usually don't get to hea- hear any of the current events probably until about the ten o'clock news
uh you know being uh
i mean by the time you get off work go by and pick up the uh baby from the baby sitter it's you know after six
and by the time everything is settled in
i sometimes i hear some things on on the radio
oh i don't even have ge- time to read the newspaper except in passing
you know i'll look over my husband's shoulder and see what's going on
i i guess occasionally i'll hear someone at work say something though
we have uh a news thing on the computer that uh that i'll i'll try to look at every day
and uh it it's pretty much headline news
which isn't you know pretty much what we loo- look for anyway
but uh i do you think that the quality of the uh the you know the news events that you get are
well i i guess it's pretty good
and and like the dallas area
and i i guess when you're in a big metropolitan area like this
well you know there's a lot of competition in the media
and sometimes i think it too much trying to figure out who's going to get the best headlines and that they'll run a topic into the ground
and uh you know they try to play public's opinion which i think is awful because it usually works
i'll bet that was the case of the the war in the middle east
uh l- lots of new uh newsmen were created during that
so it will be interesting to see what happens
trying to think what else is
well um i don't know what to say
uh that's a bad one
but it's uh i- that you know if what it's going to take
well you know we can deduct that from our income tax our federal income tax
but uh you know but we need good schools
uh we're more involved in that now
and i i i i think it's better for everybody if we had better schools
but they haven't for
you know i wish they could have gotten a lottery
well they're struggling with it
i think you know the lottery could have helped with that
i mean it wouldn't have been as painful as what we would've paid in state income tax
but you know it's not the idea of your paying uh income tax
i i'm not sure there's a positive solution for that
i you know i haven't seen the news
so it uh
that's that's sad
well the other thing i can think of is uh what is still going on in iraq and the kurd refugees
they uh yeah they had to choose between the better of the two two bad situations
uh i don't know what i've would have done in the situation
but i understand why bush you know doesn't want to go in and and uh take sides
i mean because that would definitely look like another korea
and he'd have all these people jumping down his back even though i'd agree with it
i think he ought to should've gone in there and blew them away
yeah it it it did a lot
i have uh in-laws that live in saudi arabia that stayed there during all of it too
it uh it uh you know
we so we kept very much abreast of what was going on
were were they in any of the areas where they
they were on the the ne- near uh dahran
on the on the wes- east coast
probably about a hundred fifty miles hundred miles from uh the kuwaiti border
uh and they stayed active was the uh the military there taking supplies out to them in the desert
it was it was a new situation
and that's that's awful in texas
have have you all been getting rain storms down there
we got some awful rain uh the other morning
and today's just been real drizzly
we did we did last night uh some real massive thunderstorms
apparently i i don't know if it was just the strong winds or some small tornadoes up this way too
oh well we we've just got slight chances of rain
but uh we had the we had the hard thunderstorms the other morning
well the the ground here is so flat
and it's all saturated now
uh when was it last week we had all the rain
we i think we had about eight inches
and uh it you walk out on the ground
i mean you
i mean it's awful
well today it was i mean the air was just so sticky so damp
well i guess that's it
well it was nice talking to you
the public school systems well everybody's kno- has known they've needed renovation for years but never really had a clear direction on which way to go with it
the first direction that i can see or i wish i would love to see them go with
and for too long they've kind of lumped everybody together
and that's the only way it's going to happen
and the re- the other fifty-seven minutes you've been talking about a subject you've bored them
that's that's very true
and the other one doesn't
and you're right they do get bored uh really fast if they already know what you're talking about
what what is your suggestions
the educators need to be a little bit more open minded as well as innovative in dealing with uh the various students to get the maximum potential out of the person
instead of pushing the scales too far either direction i mean it's great to be well rounded and hav- be exposed to all this stuff
but why not hit the points the kid's really interested in
because if he's interested he's going to study it
and he's going to learn it
and he's going to remember it
the only i think the only thing that they would argue about that is that you know every child needs to learn every subject
i mean that's that might be the only thing
but i mean i i definitely agree with you uh
that's true uh
everything i learned about ancient rome ha- has not helped me anywhere in
and i feel like i mean i'm taking this history class
and i mean it's so boring
and i just hate it
i mean what does this have to do with getting you know a computer science degree or whatever you know
what what type of history class is it that you're having to take
uh american history
we have to take um like this is like early seventeen hundreds through i don't know i think like mid eighteen hundreds
and then we have to take another one that's mid eighteen hundreds on up to basically present
well the early ones they could actually combine two two
and make that your second step because
that's well that's
to a point to a point the bottom you know the early parts of it you're giving the foundations of the nation
and but even then they're skimming over
they're very tri- almost trivial with it
you know i mean if they really wanted to get to the meat of the matter i mean there's they make all these people out to be oh
and they're the father of the country and all this
any way this this um school system thing
i i tell you i saw something on the news oh i don't know maybe
and they were talking about
but i'm from the dallas area
and they were talking about the plano school system that they had one school that uh if the students did something wrong i mean whether it was behavioral or uh you know they weren't learning properly or something they took these students and put them basically in a closet with no windows
they had a a table or not a table but a desk in this closet
and they had to sit in there by themselves
well parents were getting really angry about this because they said why is my child being put in this closet
well how is that helping my child you know
and uh the the thing you know
they said well we're giving them isolation time
and this helps them to think
i mean if a child has uh claustrophobia i mean that's just going to terrify him you know
if if the isolation concept really works that good why are our prisons overcrowded
i mean they were uh i mean
i think that is a very wrong way to handle uh disciplining a child
putting them in i mean they were they were call- they called them their quiet rooms or their isolation rooms
but they showed these rooms on uh you know on the news
and i mean they looked like a closet to me you know with a desk in it a real small
but they said that one of the solutions they came up with was to take the doors off of these isolation rooms
i said now what good does thi- i mean how is this helping
i mean either way
i think that is that's not the way to handle a child you know discipline a child by putting him in a closet
th- the as a part of the revamping of the entire education system on that lev- the public school system i want to see changed too
when i was br- brought up if you crossed the line and you broke a rule bad enough you were going to get spanked
well then the extreme came in
and now we can no longer
so we now isolate them
instead of there has to be some sort of discipline
and there has to be some sort of punishment
let's put him into a situation where okay you crossed the line you broke the rule you're going to have to pay for it
but it's going to tax you physically
i i don't
have th- i mean in- instead ha- have them pick up around the school yard have them weed a flower bed somewhere on the school yar- do something to beautify the school property
but you cut you know
the the kid's having to give up his quote play time to pay his debt for what he did wrong
but he's seeing something constructive come out of it
um i have to
i think one of the positive things i mean one of the things that can come out of uh is not just di- discipline okay
for instance one of the things they do at uh my kids school uh they have what they call uh caught being good slips
and when the kids are in halls and stuff and if they're being really good i mean just being excellent they're not you know cutting up and so on
and then when they collect them at the end of each week they get to go to this little what they call their caught being good store
and then they get to spend these like money
well see to me that's positive reinforcement is much better much better than trying to find ways to discipline kids because they're going to be good and try and earn those things you know to get the positive part of it
i mean they'd ra- much rather go in the store and buy something than be spanked
so they're definitely going to work towards being good you know rather than trying to act up and be bad you know
we've been too long there's been too much negative reinforcement
how much da- like the caught being good slips
well that's true
i mean that's one thing that i mean my kids definitely get spanked when they need they need to be spanked
but i really do try to use positive uh reinforcement with them at home also
and it really helps
and i mean they they don't get spanked very often
but they they do when they deserve it you know
but uh i don't think any kid should be exempt from being spanked
but you know that's just my personal opinion
and that's not going to
i mean i don't think that law will ever change
they are never going to let a a teacher spank a child again
but i don't think
i mean some kids don't get don't get spanked at home
and some kids need to be spanked at home
i m- m- most wholeheartedly agree
i mean there's a point of over kill
but somewhere in you've got to find an even line
well there's so many parents that say you can deal with a child without spanking them which is true you can
but there are times when a child needs to be spanked
i mean they do things that they need that
um i guess what i guess my
i have uh a stationary bike and uh a regular bike
and when i can i like to ride my regular bike outside because it's so much nicer
and i plus i have it uh in the living room
so i either watch t v
so i watch the fish you know
and i don't realize really
but and then usually after i'm done riding the bike just to cool myself down i usually take a walk you know
and that just kind of gets myself uh gets me you know to where i'm not quite as tired i guess
but i do it because i have to not because i want to
but i find that if i sit
and i haven't figured how to get that soft
and i tried even tying a pillow to it
but two years ago i joined well it's not quite two years it's almost two years i joined the cosmopolitan lady here in plano
and i love it
so is it just women that go there
see i think that's what's my biggest problem with going to a place uh a a health club
because i don't feel like having a bunch of other people watch me exercise
and uh i just feel conscious about it
i mean i'm not big you know or anything
but i still don't like other people watching
and i my bathing suit's just one piece
so there's no big deal all the way around
but i don't have to be conscious of what i'm doing or how i'm doing it
and it's uh oh it's just i don't know it's it's a total free relaxation
because hey you can do what you want
and no one is staring at anybody else or worrying about what anything else is doing
and they've got such fantastic equipment in there
that's that's great
and i love the water aerobics
or what is
so it is like double strenuous
but you're not being double strenuous on your own body
because you're pushing it yourself
so you're doing it yourself
so you don't really feel like you're really working that hard do you
but i get blisters on my toes on the bottom because
well that's funny
well a lot of people wear those little uh terry cloth with rubber soles on the bottom especially around the pool
so they just wear them right into the pool
like wat- are they water shoes
they're just little terry cloth things you wear for house slippers with rubber you know soles
so that you know
huh that's really funny
but i never think about it until after you go there for about a week your toes you start getting blisters anyway
so no big deal
but it's fun
so how often do find yourself going
um on a if you're doing it on a regular basis how often do you go
going uh five days a week
but i do force myself to do it at least three times a week which i don't feel like is enough
but i- it's it's at least something
i just force i have to force myself to do it like i said because to me i really don't enjoy it
but i know that i have to do it
i mean it's just it's it's not a question of whether i want
when i was working up at uh the summit
and i'd be at the swimming pool by four o'clock
oh actually about four thirty because they start at five to six
so i was there by four thirty every night
and the only thing that ever bothered me was my hair getting wet
because no matter what i did or how i did it i invariably got myself wet
but the water only comes up basically to your anywhere from your waist to your oh chest i'd say
so i mean it's your choice where you want to go
well i'm sorry
uh did you ever go to texins at all when you were working for t i
i have a i have a bad back
so i'm very limited what i do
but if i walk for more than fifteen minutes it's going to bother me
well that what pushed me that way though was basically was the fact that when i went in there is wasn't for the water aerobics
and uh she said hey go for the swimming pool
but i couldn't
but i'm no swimmer per se
but i found that this worked really well
and i came out of there
and i saw my stomach going down well
i dropped oh i'd say almost twenty pounds
and they fix you up with a diet which worked real good
i mean when you go in there they wouldn't make you do theirs would they
see i joined uh when this one down here opened up i joined as a v i p
and the v i p gives you uh oh
and they go over all your health and all your history
and they show you how everything to do and how to do it and the whole nine yards
so it became part of the package
so i went through it
but they have packages where they just offer the exercise program
so it was it's less than what you pay now for going in there
so it's like when i got laid off
so i get all the same treatment again
so it's kind of nice
and i go into the hot tub
and i love it
because i have n- i have never
but that's because of my physical condition and nothing to do what they did
but usually when i go into the hot tub before i go swimming or when i come out i'm totally relaxed when i go home
so you really do enjoy your exercise then since your
uh i've gotten on the bike
and they've got uh the stepping bike where you step
and i've enjoyed that watching how well i can walk up and down stairs
that's you know
but most of the others to me are very dull
but i got talked into the bike instead
and i don't know
but i'm not sure if i'll get benefit out of both of them
i mean i don't know if it would really do any good having both of them
uh the one nice thing about the bicycle is you just sit
so you have a little you know little
but if i were you i would go apply to either a health club or one of the others and use it for a while
because you can buy a month's membership
because it all depends you know for everyone their own what they want to do
because i jump on the bike here at home
mine has its see the handle bars go up and down
so i can sit there and read and listen to music like what you said
and it has no effect on me
so i mean it's boring
or i will
well you go ahead
well i'm going to tell you what i'd have
and i have uh shrimp that is steamed in beer that i cook
and then i have a cauliflower that i would cook garlic bread green salad tea
and we'd have a lemon pie for dessert
oh it sounds fantastic
and what's really neat about it is the shrimp is cooked in your uh like your rice steamer your rice cooker
and um you place the shrimp in the in the rice steamer
and you put a bay leaf and put some uh red pepper over it
now you can either use you know the kind that comes in the little can
or you can just get some you know regular red peppers
and you put a little bit of that over it
and you put that in there
and then you pour two bottles of beer over it
and how much shrimp would you use
and you pour the beer over the top of it
and you cover it
and you only cook it until the mixture begins to boil
and you put it on a platter
and then you serve it with melted butter
and uh i usually put garlic powder in mine
and they can just dip it
and they shell it as they eat it
but uh then the mi- uh the cauliflower you
and what you do is you just uh wash it
and you core it
and in a like a oh what do you call it like pyrex or something like that kind of bowl that would go in the microwave
but it's got to have one that has a cover on it
and you uh put about two tablespoons of uh water into this bowl and about an eighth a teaspoon of salt
and then you just set your cauliflower in there
and then you cook it for seven minutes on high
and you rotate it one time
and it's are you cooking the whole head at one time
y- uh when you core it you be real careful so you won't knock your flowers off
and uh you just set it in there
and you microwave it on high for seven minutes
and you turn it one time
and while that's cooking i take mayonnaise about a cup of mayonnaise and a teaspoon of mustard and some garlic powder
and i mix it all together
and i shred up some just regular white cheese
and after that's cooked you take it out and pour this on top of it
and then you sprinkle the cheese on top of that
and you cook it for another three minutes on high you know
oh that sounds fantastic
but it it looks
i mean what you can do then see is like what i usually do is i'll like sit the cauliflower in the middle
and then i put the uh shrimp around the outside of it
you know on my platter
and then i have a green salad that i put around the outside of that
and you know you have all the different seasonings and stuff
and then i just fix little individual cups for them
and they have the
and it makes it a real nice looking
and it's not much work
but it looks like it you know
and uh usually i cut those little cherry tomatoes up
and put some color into it you know
and i'll lay those on top of my salad you know to make it look nice and things like that
now how many could you serve
uh it usually serves six
oh that's good
see out here we have so many uh ethnic people
and we have portuguese
and we have russians and polish
and it depends out here like the type of people you're going to entertain you know
so it's hard uh
you you just have to pick something for the the group that you're going to entertain for that particular time
and uh they're big on finger food here too you know chicken wings and uh ribs and that kind of stuff
uh barbecue and uh cooking out in the yard it ya- you know when it's nice barbecue outside chicken and that kind of stuff
but i have had shrimp
oh you ought to try some crawfish
but see that's one good thing about living down here is usually anybody that comes over you know even if it's like out of town guests and stuff they want our cooking
oh of course
because just like now especially crawfish it is starting to move out you know
and more and more people are beginning to find out how good it is
uh it's similar
i mean it's got a taste of its own you know
oh it does
but it is it is similar to because you only eat the
um it looks more like a crab
oh it looks more like a crab
um let me think of
i guess if it uh it looks like more like a cross between uh a crab and uh and a lobster
because it's small like that
and it's got the pinchers like a crab
you know it's it's similar to a lobster too because the tail has got the little pleats in it like a
and we call them mud bugs
but i mean they're fantastic tasting
it's it's the season for them right now
and and where did you say you were from
oh well do you do cajun cooking
oh i love uh blackened you know uh the the fish and the chicken and that kind of stuff
oh we have a few places up here that do that
and if ever i see it on the menu i always get it
now how do they do the blackened
you buy it you buy it as a seasoning
but uh do you have to have a certain skillet
i cook mine well do you have a uh like a black iron skillet
but i have mostly teflon
i guess you could cook it in in that too
but i don't know
you know i never have
i use uh uh the black iron skillet to cook mine
do- does it have to get extremely hot
but it really it's not it it it doesn't burn or anything like that
i mean there is it's it's
you know i mean that is a seasoning
that's really it's not like you would have to cook it for an extreme amount of time or something like that to get it
oh i see
because it's called uh what it's called is blackening magic
and it it comes in a bottle
well i'm trying to see
it's got a a picture of dom de luise on it
now would you would cook it for the same amount of time as you would prepare it any other time
i could have the uh chicken on the skewers with uh uh blackened seasoning
and oh that is so good delicious
but you do have to have it you know you do have to have it hot when you cook it i mean
it does have to be really hot you know when you put it in
but it's not like it's burned
and it what it what blackens it is the seasoning
and it is so good
i i love it
i i in fact i was in texas for a little while
and i liked uh the barbecues and the mexican food
because i have been brought up mostly italian american food
because my uh parents are italian and portuguese
so we cook a lot of pasta and uh gravies and pizzas and you know roasts and that kind of thing
that's why i enjoy going to restaurants and have you know trying different things
well have you ever thought about coming to louisiana you know to visit
um you don't even have to go all the way to new orleans you know if you want to really get some good food
i mean you don't have to go that far south
but uh of course the further south you go the better the food is as far as i'm concerned
and fact is we're going to take a vacation this year
and uh we're only going down there for the food though
now wher- where do you go when you go there uh right on basin street and those places
we go to the the french quarters and stuff like that
and uh i have some friends that live down there
and so usually we go to we don't go to the tourist ones
we go to the ones that they tell us to go to you know
oh i see
and we went to this one
and uh they were cooking the stuff you know while we were we went on this boat ride
and then we came back and ate out on this it was like a back porch
oh that's nice
i mean it's so good
the seasoning they it's just unreal
and don't they make a lot of um
is is is that with seafood
oh you can
i've seen them d- the chefs on t v do that
and oh it looks delicious
and i'll tell you what
see we do um uh a thing we call it a sea bake
um we got two cats
and uh um
we had cat you know my family had cats when we were growing up the whole time until my mom developed an allergies
so i mean i'm used i'm used to having cats around
i like having ca- cats around or pets around in general
i i favor dogs over cats actually
oh see i'm not uh i'm not a dog person at all
oh i'm i'm a dog person
but not cats
um but we um we house sat for a um my um my wife's boss a couple weeks ago
and um uh he has a dog and everything
we were you know we were sitting the dog and everything
and uh i felt like just miserable all weekend
and it really didn't dawn on me until sunday
it was like oh that could be it
well dogs are real high maintenances
and you've got to pay a lot you know
but it's not quite the same thing
um and um um you know it's it's just nice that cats you know cats yeah you don't have to let them outside you know
so you know they're not yo- w- you're not worried about them running all-around the neighborhood
and you know they you know they they make their mess in the cat pan which is
it's you know it's a pain to clean
but you know we used to
i mean they got great stuff out now for cleaning cats' pans
well when i was you know when i was growing up i had a clean the cat pan all the time
and i hated it because i had to carry everything upstairs and you know and use this thing to you know scoop the take the stuff out and put it in the toilet and everything
but now they have like this you get these liners
that is garbage bags you know
and you and you you know the
oh that sounds so easy what i did
and that's it
and what we used to do was just put um newspaper on the bottom and then put cat litter
and then i would just take the whole thing to the garbage can and dump the whole thing
then i would do it you know everyday or two days so i would clean that pan very very rarely
and so it wasn't so bad
she's even got she's got one dog now and the two cats
and her dog there is is basically a reject
it was her ex boyfriend and you know just was not mature enough to keep the dog didn't realize how much work it was
and she's just so kindhearted that she just takes all the animals
but i think that for me well my husband just has completely nixed the idea of having a dog or a cat
because that's all there is to it
so you know
so you don't have anything right now
oh except the kid
but he was no completely against having a dog or cat
he said they're much they're as much work as a kid
and they're harder to get rid of for the weekend
uh i don't i don't know because the cats pretty much um
and um uh it's not a big deal really
i mean they're they're happier when we're around
but you know they they're pretty much okay by themselves
um and i don't you know we couldn't do that with a dog
that's uh yeah really true
but like the friends other friends of mine have cats
and if they go away they have they hire a pet sitter to come in twice a day and pet them and things like that
and their cats you know their so used to the attention that if they don't get it they get really upset
and you know they sort of cause trouble around the house and things like that
well that's that's um pampering the the petals
i i tried to have um
so i tried to have a goldfish
and um i killed that one within a very short amount of time
but they're not that much fun you know
you can't you know
they they don't they can't fetch you know
they ca- they can't do anything
so i've never
i think we had fish sh- when i was a kid
but i don't
and one of his fish jumped out of the um gosh what do you call it fish tank and fried itself
because i remember my brother
and one of the fish was missing
and they couldn't find it anyplace
and then they found it fried on
and i don't know if we got rid of the dog
because my brother was allergic to it
but because of that we didn't have very many pets afterwards
and then he had fish
they're like you say they're not the most exciting pet to have
i just i don't know
i i just never understood why what the attraction
i mean they're you know they're pretty and everything
but i've just never s- seen the attraction of having fish
well a friend of mine had um an eel
and then he had a um
it was one of these fish that i- it would eat it ate a big other fish and things like that
oh now we really get sick
i i couldn't see having fish like that
i could see some having maybe some of the tropical fish that are really really pretty
like i remember a friend of mine at work telling me that at his frat in college that they had a tank of piranha
and uh you know used to drop mice in
this is not these aren't cats
i mean i guess that's fine if you have a mouse problem at your frat house
well a cat will do the same trick
and it was a live rat
and um this woman just offered it to me while i was in in graduate school
i had a friend in col- i had a friend in college who had a um had a pet rat for a while
um i forget how she got it
but it was um it was the same kind of a deal
and she got it from the psych department
mine had been a a a
and the people in the lab one day called in my friend and said you know this rat is acting really strange i think he's sick
and she said i don't think he's sick i think she's pregnant
and they had misclassed the sex of back there
and so um she asked me if i want to one of those babies
and i took the baby
and i got her when she was you know just this tiniest little thing like
and then she grew to be you know
and then she grew to be pretty big
you know like a pound or something
and i had her for over two years
and she was very affectionate
she would you know crawl on me
and she would sit like on my neck or my shoulder while i was working
and things like that yeah much more than you would think
i mean you know if you get them young and everything before they go kind of nuts
but i could see getting one from birth and everything
i sort of weird for me to have had one too
and you know it was easy easy to take care of
i i i have friends with hamsters and gerbils
and they they tell me the same thing
actually it was more fun than you would think yeah starting from the beginning
we live also live in the city now actually in manhattan
and so it's almost impossible to
or certainly certainly not a dog
i mean people do
but it's not
i don't oh
plus i mean the pooper scooper one new york
so you know
you see all these people yeah these stately people and well dressed people out walking their dogs with their plastic bag or their piece of paper for them
we were wondering if they uh they had any special law for the horses in central park
they have um the bags behind them
but i think they're actually supposed to
keep them yeah keep them clean
but oh gosh i can't even walk by central park yeah when summertime
oh god i can't haven't been up there
oh well it's not that long ago
but i mean fall
oh twelve times of the year
i mean it w- it was in the yeah it was almost like october of eighty-five
i think was the last time i was up up there and at center park
um i had a friend who went to colombia
and i used to go up and visit her
do you have you said you had two cats
are they um just what you call it are they breed cats or anything
or are they just
my wife got them from uh um friend of hers at work and everything you know you know as kittens
and it was before i mean this was before we even met
um she's had them for a couple years
and um you know they're really cute
they're they're sisters
apparently w- i don't know all the details
but they were born around christmas because one of them is named tinsel
and the other one is named holly
you know the scr-
both yeah both females
um or whatever it is neutered you know
and they're they're both declawed at least on the the front claws
the topic was should the united states adopt the metric system and if so should uh
and why didn't it work last time
well i'm all for it
well i i am too
i wish uh it had started a long time ago is the problem because we're so wound up in the in the system that we've got that you know trying to convert over
and i guess what'd they try they tried what'd the call it soft conversion and hard conversion one of them is where you just take whatever's already standard
and you give it some sort of a weird metric number like six point two eight seven instead of six millimeter
i i don't know uh
i think they just ought to you know start uh just go all the way on new products introduced or whatever you know start your packaging go to liters instead of quarts
and you know people if they have to are going to learn to think that way
well don't most of them doesn't just about everything now have both metric and english
but things are generally packaged in the english sized packages you know
and sure it has has the metric equivalent written on there
but it still a quart
but if they started putting it in liters liter of oil and you know liters of gasoline people are going to learn to think in metric
i kind of remember back when gas prices started up you know pretty dramatically when they started getting toward a dollar a gallon range
somebody had uh
and it was only like twenty-nine and thirty cents a liter
so they could put this sign out front that said you know thirty-nine cents a liter
and nobody had any idea what a liter was
that that's the problem
so you can figure out what you're actually paying for it
i mean not not at first
but by the time i was in fifth or sixth grade anyway
i would expect people with any kind of buying power over the age you know under the age of thirty or so to have some idea what it is anyway
the uh i think maybe there's where the problem came in you know
it's kind of like learning a language you know
it's almost like uh
but you know it's like somebody said okay as of such and such a date you know anybody caught talking in the english you know
will be shot or something like that you know
well thing is it's a global global market place these days
and you know we're like what one of two backwards countries in the world as far as
it's just time i think for for us to go over
because all you end up doing is if you're in business or you're in any kind of international
i don't you know
yeah uh i yeah i do too
and one of the things that we've run into a problem
course you're familiar with the t i drawing well with any drawing system you end up with you end up with things in inches in parts of inches you know half fourth you know this sort of thing
and then you end up with a decimal where you start getting into mils and that sort of thing
and then some of them are done in you know purely metric
and ours were in mils
and it got to you know
but uh you just you know you end up with all kinds of problems with converting your designs
oh i can imagine
the uh the one that uh uh
and i had to get used to you know purely metric system down there because they didn't understand anything else
you know if you start talking about miles they'd look at you like what
so i had a little bit of experience with it
and also i noticed in canada they uh you drop a quarter fifty cents whatever in a coke machine up there
and you get this funny looking coke you know
it's in a can that's that's taller but not as big around
you know i guess that's some it's not a liter
but my daughter in law's from panama
and she has they have had americans down there for so long you know that they're kind of into both systems
but uh she gets real confused on distances
and temperature is the big thing the centigrade for which she says celsius
i would have more problem more problem with the temperature except that you know working in engineering we do everything in centigrade or celsius
well i had kind of gotten used to centigrade temperature you know
and if it's ten and twenty it's not too bad
so but uh the big problem is not having the uh the resolution between temperature you know between a hundred if you're talking about a hundred degrees or what thirty zero you know thirty four degrees whatever that is
you know you don't get all the little differences you know the differences between seventy and seventy-two or seventy-five degrees isn't much
but the difference thirty and thirty-five degrees is quite a bit
so i i think as long as people have a choice they're going to stick with the american way
and until we have to have to learn to think that way we won't
but i'm not sure what they do in england now
they're they're on metric aren't they
now okay we run into some problems once
and this thing was was even different than you know s a e standards and stuff
this this ca-
my dad bought one of these little nash metropolitans here a few years ba- quite a few years back
and the thing had a austin heeley type engine you know
and the body was built by nash
or who you know
ameri- that was even before american motors
but nash essentially in the u s somewhere
and that thing had the darndest combination of metric and wentworth and uh s a e
because i think the wentworth and the s a e bolt sizes were the same
but the threads were different
oh that would be a mess
and uh it was a total mess
and on my chevy van that's a couple of years old
the only thing that was in it was built in the u s was the uh differential
and it was built in buffalo new york
but it's got the hardest combination of uh metric
and most of the body parts seem to be metric
and most of the engine parts seem to be s a e
so it's just crazy
now you got to you got to have one and not mix them up
because you're never going to get to one one system if you still got a got a mix
and of course here that that would involve changing road signs all across the country you know miles per hour to kilometers per hour and the whole nine yards
i thought maybe they would convert to uh metric back when they went to the fifty-five mile an hour speed limit because what is it fifty-six or fifty-seven's a hundred uh qua- a hundred kilometers
hell you'd have people doing a hundred miles an hour
and you know yeah
you'd have people going you're right a hundred miles an hour
and so i don't know
and the other thing too is you know between here and el paso's what five hundred miles
but it's almost eight hundred kilometers you know
but they'd need they'd seem to be ticking off faster too
every road sign you come to is like well i don't know it that far
well they converted all the road signs to fifty-five miles an hour you know
at that time anyway that was still when things were
you know now cars they have both
i know the only other place that i was ever at where they really had it mixed was was in panama where's a lot of the road signs and everything are in in miles per hour
and some are in kilometers
and you got to know where you are because anything that was the old canal zone is going to be miles per hour
uh so jack what type of music do you like
well i like uh classical
and uh sort of uh popular rock type music uh
i never really had listened to it till i i got married
and and my wife uh enjoys it
so i had never listened to it bef- till then
but now i listen to it well whenever she does
and even every once in a while i put it on myself you know
i i used to play the piano
and i like uh bach and
um sort of the baroque music handel and
uh vivaldi and those kinds of
see those those are really nice
though i i couldn't tell you anything about them other than when my wife says this is bach you know
well i you know i don't i don't know all that much myself
i just i just know
uh whatsever's on the radio is is usually okay with me
um sometimes i have a hard time unders- you know hearing the words clearly if i'm in the car and there's noise and stuff
you know people always say wow th- the meanings of those words
and i'm always meaning
there's wor- well you know
i just thought they just all sort of rhymed you know
it's funny uh depending on where you live
i i i commute back and forth between baltimore and a rural town called salisbury
and the difference in the radio with popular music
is totally different you know
because baltimore will play more uh what might be considered m- a little bit more progressive
and as soon as you go down to salisbury this town that's you know uh two and a half hours away in the suburbs or whatever uh in a real rural balt- uh maryland
they it turns into ber- basically classic rock
and they don't you know
but classic rock you know with
if you know like when the doors movie came out you know doors was really on the radio there
you know where you know you'd hear was- one or two of their more famous songs maybe top forty in baltimore
but in salisbury you woul- that's all you would hear was this is the doors you know
so it was sort of a funny thing
i mean if you
but there is
i never i never i didn't
i i lived in pittsburgh before baltimore
and i didn't i never really noticed the difference when i moved to this area
but when i went more rural you know that it really changed
chicago has a lot of good stations uh
oh does it
uh in fact they have they have a continuous news station which is nice if you're driving and you want to h-
now you don't have to wait till the hour mark
it's it's it's sort of constant
and uh you get the latest news and everything
it's uh it's sort of like c n n you know
and it's on
because you never hear the you never hear the news basically on the radio
you know and if you don't if you don't read the paper you sort of fall behind if you're in
i like to listen to tapes uh of music or or um stuff on a long trip
and um now you can even get books on tape um
on fact my uh my grandmother does that a lot
or what- she's losing her sight or whatever
that of in
i can imagine you know if you're driving cross country
you know uh listening to a story
so that's a lot of fun
that's that would be good
well we strayed a lot from music
but i but i guess music comes into that whole aspect of listening
so as long you're listening
but if you do if you do have to go something i guess we can just cut off
well jack it was nice to talk to you
a- and good luck
and i hope you get some more calls and make some more calls
well i i've been uh i have probably had more time than you have to think about this subject
so i'll tell you is it a serious problem
and foremost uh where we compare w- that we are now doing fifty percent of our uh people are voting
uh we're probably making a comparison against uh some european and uh and uh uh s-s-say newer republics that uh
uh so uh one of the reasons uh that uh o- one of the reasons that we could get uh one of the reasons that it is lower in the united states is that mostly we hold it on tuesdays
and then we further complicate it by saying you know we will keep the polls open until eight o'clock
most people uh a great number of people now work at various at different jobs that if a third of the people are shift workers they won't be able to get to the to the polls in any case if they uh have to work late into the evening and not get up
they hold it on the week- no they hold it on a either a saturday or a sunday
or at least a day when when uh a great number of people are not working
in america that is not true because a a great number of people work on sundays
bu- but that is one of my solutions uh
i i know here in dallas that they have just instituted in the last couple of years a uh a real long period of time that you can absentee vote before the elections
and they i do not think they have seen a really high improvement
have you absentee voted in in in texas
well i have absentee voted in uh new hampshire
and it is a fairly fairly complicated process where you have to go pick up the ballot
but part of the process also is that you must register preregister at some particular point
but other states you have to register every couple of years and uh
well to vote to vote to just vote
so registrations are perhaps a a problem also
and we're the mobile mobile society uh
people are always mo- you know
if you compound that that uh eh- eh th-
i- if it is difficult to register to vote that would remove your eligibility to vote
who or who are not just motivated who really believe that their they their voice is heard
i mean and the people that i have talked to
well maybe that is another factor the motivational factor
well that's diminished by
i i'm just read two books
the uh trivial pursuit of the presidency in nineteen eighty-eight
it's uh it's preceded by uh several other books by these guys
uh wake me up when it's over was about the eighty-four elections
and i forget what
but any case uh i-i-it is uh uh the mar-
uh uh th- th- there was uh
uh they these guys uh have taken the place of theodore white on reporting elections
in any case they say that uh there's a definite trend uh well you know toward candidates using negative voting
why do uh is that just because they have such a low opinion of the public and the public's uh
the public would rather hear something negative about the other guy th- uh than than a positive factor
and y- and you know
to if you if you go on the attack i- and put some sensational thing before the public as mike dukakis learned in the last campaign
and it is not refuted
people will you know uh believe it
well he did refute it
to the matter see
he he refuted it
and indeed his trend started upward
well that see i i didn't believe anybody would believe that either
i i i guess i
well they do
have a hard time coming to terms with the the fact that the american public really was you know so
well don't give too much credit to the american public for their motivational ability
and and and it
well then how can a democracy work then
well it uh
well i don't know
how how can it work
i mean that's that's the question
i guess the question also is that we discovered is that they don't throw rascals out
but they don't throw the rascal out their own rascal
uh my my solution to to part of this is is to to make it a-a-an an economic incentive for people to vote
that sounds rather crass i think because then then you are saying well uh y-y-you
know y- in- y-y it could be c- convoluted in many ways where people would actually uh by paying them
i mean you know you would take a certain amount off their income tax or property tax or whatever
but th- it would be very difficult to administer because i am sure that any time money and votes are involved
it just the whole thing
how about how about the reverse of that
when i have heard about england's elections they are allowed to run for what a total of six or eight weeks even for the higher offices in the in the land
what if we totally took money out of the camp- eh ma- just severely limited the campaigns so money wasn't so much of an issue
i feel like if
but the idea is to get the individual to the polls a-a-and we have to make it as easy as possible for him to get to the polls
i don't i don't care how easy it is for them
i do not think they are going to because they do no think that their that anybody listens to their vote
they really think that the packs you know no matter what you're promised during a campaign
and these days we are promised hardly anything of substance
oh you mean the special interest groups
and eh and eh y- no matter what a a candidate promises during the campaign i- which isn't very much specif-
any th- they do not promise anything specific these days
but whatever you are promised they just they just reverse themselves depending on who pays them what once they get into office
i mean i think that's the
well read my lips and and and no new taxes
and yet bush did that
but i mean but but he's excused from that
generally people i've read polls now where they've excused him because there was a a definite necessity to balance the budget
well then why did he say that during his campaign
oh he he he gave it
he did he did he promised the best he could
and he is the president
and he should he should address those problems
and if there needs to be a change in a period of time
wh- what was so funny about it is that i guess that it happened so rapidly you know
but i think it is er-r-r
i think you you still have a view that the american voter is different from other voters
and he is motivated because we happen to be the cradle of liberty and all that
i think voters are motivated uh
what about what about voters in the other countries that you were talking about
like in the european countries where they have higher turnouts and well the newer democracies
because it's going to be totally different
but you do not think so
well i don't know if they have higher turnouts overall
i think that we just discovered in this in in the indian elections is th- one of the greatest greatest and massive things in in the world
uh just it was got vi- more violent every year
concerned about their inability that to that their vote does not count any way
and the corruption of politics in in in that s-s-situation there
but th- but you know everything is relative to when uh eh w-w- you know we had higher turnouts because at that time we cur- talk about the turnout relative to the eligible voter right
i mean is
but but before these enormous before this voting rights act what we had was a a great deal of our population uh mainly the blacks in the south and the
hispanics were precluded by by uh voting laws uh from reg- from their eligibility to register
so if you really computed it they probably
oh i see
dis- were disqualified
because all the eligible voters you know the- it was skewed by the eligible voters being less than the total population of
but isn't that isn't that kind of a blanket racist kind of thing to say the blacks and hispanics and other minorities just don't vote
or is that just the the truth
i think the high- there's a higher percentage in in certain black areas of voters
i don't know about hispanics you know
i just i i mean i haven't studied the statistics well enough to
i mean i think in this sort of conversation we can only do our own reaction
but you know that just made me think of something that happened down here in dallas last year
and at one point they di- they took another vote on it
and they uh the minorities could not get enough of a vote out to to pass their plan
and this is something that had been going on for months
they and they have had lawsuits over it
i mean it was r- it was a major issue
and there still wasn't enough minority vote to get to pass the plan that they were backing
so that's y-
you know i think that you have really hit on something there
wa- to say that uh those
well with the minorities and we are saying we have lower voter turnout
maybe it is is uh now that we have minorities included in the
you know karen i wonder if we are recording
but usually by this time they tell me that the time is up
my last uh auto repair was my my uh alternator went out
i have a nineteen eighty-six toyota uh
and uh i have a fri- a friend whose real good with uh repairing cars
so i got him to take the alternator off and take it and uh you know get a replacement part
so we went to a uh a a place called quality auto parts
an and their parts are supposed to be guaranteed and and everything
and they're they're uh very reasonable
so uh i bought the alternator
we p- put it on the car
and it it didn't work
and it blew out all the fuses
uh i bel- something like sixty-nine dollars som- something on that order
did he did he hook up the wir- wiring wrong
it it was just that the the part just just didn't fit the car
so i took it back
and uh he he took the alter- the guy in in the parts shop took the alternator
and he put it on the little thing he has in there to test them
and uh he said there was nothing wrong with the alternator
so we we went back and tried it again put it on again
and it still didn't work
and we took the car up to um a little place called pep boys
i don't know if you have them in your area but uh they're they're pretty reasonable uh car repair place also
so uh took it up there towed it up there because it you know wouldn't start or anything
and this thing just kept blowing out the fuses and uh took them about an an hour to um figure out what was what was blowing the fuse
and it was it was the alternator that was blowing the fuse
and the only problem was that uh it had to be a genuine toyota uh alternator because most of the other ones that they say will fit it that that you know they sit in there and everything
but there's just some little difference that um causes it not to work an i-
and that was my that was my last experience
well i had a weird
there's a little sensing device uh in front of my uh
it's a it's an air conditioner sensing device
there's a metal piece that fits through the belts uh
and somehow that broke off
and uh i i still can't figure out how it broke
and uh anyway so a- this piece obviously um
and uh i think you can only get it through subaru dealer etcetera
uh this little sensing device costed like sixty bucks
and and i haven't had too many problems with my car
uh and then you know just basic maintenance and oil changes
an i and i do not do my oil changes
and i will not do my oil changes
i've i think the first time i tried to do one and ended up um trying to ge- uh
and i did this
and i went and bought everything
so after buying the filter and all the oil you're looking at ten bucks at least
or somewhere in there an and uh and then to go to the trouble that i figured it's easier spending eighteen bucks at jiffy lube
so that that's um you know
as far as any maintenance on my car i i shy away from the oil changes
well my car is uh it's an eighty-six
and i really hadn't had any any trouble with it un- until that
and the car now has a hundred and thirty something thousand miles on it
and uh and this was just recent
so i really can't complain about this one
um well i used i used to work uh
it was a seventy mile trip everyday you know two ways was seventy miles
oh a hundred and forty mile trip
it was it was just seventy miles
oh thirty-five miles each way
and uh i did that for about three years
and it really it really added up
i've only taken uh maybe two trips that were about four hours long dow- uh down to shreveport
and uh the rest of it was you know it's just basically driving a long ways to work
and now i drive like twenty twenty-three miles each way
so i'm getting a little a little uh little relief
but still i drive a long ways
but i guess because they're highway miles you know it's not so bad on your car as as if it you know were just regular street you know
i was going to ask you you know as far as how we're getting compensated for what we're doing right now um
and i'm just i get these green
and uh i just wondering how i go about getting the cash
uh there's a number that you call
it's the same number that you that you call to make a call
you you call that number
and and uh somehow or another they'll give you an option to leave a message
and you can leave a message
and they'll they'll call you back
well that's good to know
th- this is the first time i've been called in a long time
and i haven't been doing it
and uh i've done it maybe twelve times
well i don't know if i've done it quite that much
but uh mine is mixed up too
uh let's see before i had this car i had a um i bought an audi five thousand but i bought it i bought it used
i i just bought it from a friend who was going to who just charged me what the dealer was going to give give him for it for a trade-in
and uh it had a whole lot of miles on it
i i figured maybe i'd get one or two years out of it
an i an i did get a couple of good years out of it
and the uh the engine messed up on me
and then i gave it to a guy to repair who works for the aut- for the audi dealer
and uh he took the engine apart
and you know he just said he couldn't fix it
so the engine never got put back together again
huh oh well
i think those old cars might might be a pretty good bet because you
oh tha- that's when they made cars though
this things was the body was in good condition
and you know it ran fine
and um but i had to
you know i after about thr- couple of months after i was out of college i finally splurged and bought my car
well you know these these cars made in the sixties and stuff
i mean the steel i mean the thickness
i mean i- those thin- they're just th-
and they last a long time
and they were simple too
and some people will still buy them you know
it's easy to it's easy i guess it's still easy to find engines for those cars engines and transmissions
and if you i guess if you keep trad- changing them out you can keep a car for a long time
course i guess i could do the same thing with the the toyota that i have
but i just think they cost too much in the in the first place now a days
uh actually my last vacation was in connecticut
uh we went home to visit family
oh i i'd well actually i did visit hawaii once
but i never made it off of oahu
w- when we were in oah- oahu uh i couldn't wait to get off
we we took a cruise
and we went to four different islands
and it was a really nice
we had we had a great time
so where have you been
oh i've be-
we that one would count
uh that was about a year and a half ago
an- what what did you just decide to go there
uh well my husband is french
and we were living in france at the time and we decided that i i've never been to africa
and i needed to get that continent since i
and it it's actually it's a fairly common vacation place for french people to go
and they speak french
and so uh you know in that sense is just a little bit easier
and it just seemed like it would be a fun place to go
oh i'm sure it was wonderful
and so we we didn't really have enough time
and as always it don- it seems a bit uh rushed
well we were there in the winter
in jan- uh january or february i don't remember which
when my father worked there we they used to travel quite a bit all around you know
in in europe and whatnot
but i was very young
so i don't remember that
at wha- at
oh that's too bad
so i don't remember
but we have all these wonderful pictures of all these great places that they have been
and that i was when i was a baby
because that's you know that's that area of the world i think would be great
the only thing i didn't like was in some of the more touristy areas uh um the it would just be besieged by people wanting to be your guide
and you there were some places
and we had nothing taken because we knew
and we had things in inside pockets and in you know in jacket underneath a coat type of thing
we we found that in jamaica
that people would come up and try and sell you well try and sell drugs and things like that
but they they were so destitute
and i guess they they make all their money on tourism
and and they would come up and ask you you know if if you want to buy different things
and really after awhile it really gets annoying
you know it it's a little scary too when they're coming up and they're all over you
the the worst place was in marrakech and the other cities it wasn't nearly as bad
and a couple of them it was what we did in some of the other cities
and they tell you to do that is to hire a local guide it doesn't matter who it is
and they keep everyone else away from you
and it's worth it
and it's like ten dollars a day or something
and its worth it just to keep everyone else away from badgering you and you feel stupid doing that
but we did it
and we were much happier
and you also get in to see things that you might not get into if you were alone uh
well that's great
well you lived in france
so you've been all through europe
actually i haven't been all through europe
uh we're going to go for a conference in september
and so hopefully we'll get to travel a little bit too
uh my more exciting spots have been
lots of wildlife huh
but it that was really really fabulous
and just the photos i have of it and gosh incredible and be so close
um august eighty-eight
and then actually after there i went to um hawaii
a lot of my travel has been sort of based around conferences or business meetings and so i went to hawaii and then to australia and japan and china
did you see the great barrier reef and and go snorkeling
i i actually i didn't go diving
i i'm a diver
that's that's actually been another of my favorite vacations has been taking little diving trips but uh
i drove from sidney down to melbourne and over to au- adelaide
i've seen in you know
they they show all this wonderful seafood and and great big prawns you know the big shrimp
didn't have shrimp there huh
but uh in fact i didn't eat out that much there because i was traveling by myself in a car
it would have been i think much more fun to do it like in the van
oh you're adventurous
and i was by myself in china too
china was a little bit more uh of a challenge
but it it wasn't more of a challenge in a sense because i hired a guide all the time
and so i never you know got out by myself or not much
actually i paid about either a thousand dollars or a little bit
and but this is from hong kong
because i was already in hong kong
and um but it only cost you about a thousand dollars to go there
and i went to beijing shanghai chengdu
and actually then i took a train up from shanghai to a little quingdao i think is the name of it
it's a little uh sort of getaway retreat village not far from shanghai
i had two internal one yeah two internal plane flights and a couple of other things
i guess i relate it to to japan where things are very expensive aren't they
oh japa- japan's ridiculous
and i stayed i didn't stay in the top of the line hotels
but i stayed in
and you know they were newly built
and they were sort of the lower end of the top of the line hotels
and you don't want to stay in the very very very exclusive
tha- i highly recommend that way to go
uh and a friend of mine who had gone for a business trip to china
and she just gave me this woman's name to contact
and it would really be fun i think ideally with like two couples because you have a car and a driver and a guide
well i grew up out in the country and uh was used to having uh guns around the place
i'm uh not for gun control
in the strictest sense of the uh word
i i think i'm kind of bent towards middle liberal of the bridge myself
you know i have quite a collection myself
and you know i'm a good hunter
and i started hunting when i was twelve years old
you know i don't want to see them ban guns completely
but i don't want them to completely turn loose of their controls either
well i i feel that its uh
i think the what was national rifle association uh had this bumper sticker a few years back if uh about if you outlaw guns
and i believe that too because the person that is wanting to
commit a crime is going to find a way to get a gum a gu- a gun a knife a a rock
and it's the honest citizens like ourselves that are responsible about use of guns uh
but there's an element that can't
and it's you know it's got to the point now where even our our police departments and our d e a agents and everything have to carry automatic weapons
because everybody that's in drug trafet- trafficking has got them
you know yeah
there was a an article in the paper just this week where i think it's uh one of the gun companies i can't remember which was developing a ten metal ten millimeter automatic pistol for the f b i which would give them additional firepower
it had held like a fifteen shot clip
which uh would be able th- they would be able to put down anything that came at them
but you figure you got some drug guy out there that's got an uzi machine gun uh
a thirty-eight uh
i have lived in uh illinois at one time
and they they passed a uh it wasn't really gun control
but it was you had to register as a gun owner
but you had to have this card
it was like a driver's license card that you had to have it in order to buy ammunition and that was the first uh
but they had that so that they were trying to control it a little bit in that respect
see in california they in california they make you register when you buy ammunition
you have to sign a you know
they take your name and driver's license number hunter hunting license number and all that good stuff
now rifles aren't too bad
but you know any kind of handgun at all
and i bought a pistol there
and there was a fifteen day waiting period
gee that's not a bad idea
i think that uh you know a a waiting period uh
but again it's going to be the law abiding citizen that's going to comply with that
so there's i don't
th- the only way they could do it i think would be to stiffen the penalties on anybody using a gun
you know i think if we kind of stiffen them up a little bit course i-
i i feel kind of weird about that anyway
but i i agree with you there that uh
the uh the again the purpose of gun control is to control how it is being used is what the purpose should be
and i'm in favor of keeping the the illegal guy from getting one in his hands
well and the- they're actually a necessity in life you know
they're not you know
but sooner or later i need one
you know whether i'm out hunting or you know
well i did in the service but not you know not on the street
so i don't really need one in the in the aspects
so mine are you know i use mine for recreation
and i enjoyed my guns
well i know what uh
my wife the same thing uh she knows how to shoot any weapon that we have no- not that i have an arsenal or anything
but we have several guns around the house
but i think it's uh
you got to have have the pl-
uh still i think they ought to know how to use one and that it's not just a toy and that when it's not like on t v when someone gets shot uh they get back up
and he you know
i have a fifteen year old and a seventeen year old well
you know i've taken time to teach them
and now the young boy wants to know
and you know like i told him you're a little bit young for a gun let me go out here and you know we would start with the b b gun deal you know
so he started with the b b gun and shot a couple of holes in a couple of windows
and i took it away from him
you know so he's learning the hard way
but at least it was a b b gun not a twenty-two or a four ten or something
i remember i had an old uncle up by tulsa oklahoma that took me out and uh showed me
this was it was not my it was my mother's uncle
and he took me out with him and uh single shot twenty-two
and and uh he taught me how to shoot uh a old single shot twenty-two
and i was probably about twelve at the time
and i thought that was the neatest thing
of course uncle sam took me out took me hunting with him
and he let me shoot and showed me how
you know i don't want to get out there deer hunting and have some guy blow me away
well that's about all i
well it's been real nice talking with you
she's only about uh uh a little less than two years old
so we uh we started saving
but that's all
so do you is there are you planning to like encourage your children to go to a particular school
uh i think that's really a decision th- that
well help them make in terms of you know what they are they are wanting to do
you know that that's a big influence i think and
you know what not only what you can afford but what what's going to be best for them in terms of what their career goals are
so uh you know you need to go to a school that handles whatever it is you want to do
uh university of mississippi
was that local or uh
uh well it was
but it it was not necessarily local it was
but i i mean so what's
uh well at the time i was uh thinking of going pre med and in the state uh they had the best pre med uh curriculum for the uh state institutions
it was choice between there and uh a private college that uh was a bit more expensive
so i ended up going there although it was quite a drive away for me
uh i enjoyed it
so you did you commute everyday then
when you said it was quite a quite a way away i did not know it that meant you had to drive like an hour
i was uh it was like another world
basically it was a no it was a
did not get home that often you know
and at that age it's uh it's kind of kind of difficult sometimes
so did you go there like straight out of high school
uh see i did not get my degree until later on
so i just finished mine a couple of years ago
and uh you know i guess you know when you have to do it that way it makes makes your choices a lot easier
uh that's true
that that's like you know when i went on to get my my masters i uh basically was you know it was where i was at the time
you know i was not going to try to pick and go somewhere else because i was pretty much settled
and i was trying to work
but uh so when you are first going to school that you kind of have the luxury of being able to have some latitude in choosing the place to go
wh- which group do you work in in t i
um uh the computer science center
oh uh where is that at
uh north building
uh about three years
like sounds like you got your masters before here
i have uh uh
actually i mean i came straight from school to here
so cause this was the first first real job after getting my degree
my undergraduate degree was not in not in what my masters was
so i made a career change basically
well let's see
i have not you know
there's a lot of pluses and minuses for different schools you know just like you said
uh depending on what they want to specialize in and what you can afford different things like that
so i i have not really made up my mind you know whether to encourage them to go different places
one day i would like to uh you know the uh
i i like the school where i went
i mean and i would not hesitate at all to to encourage her to go there there if she wanted to
or the school where i got my masters at which which was a different school
and uh i liked it almost as well
uh but uh you know that i'm not going to hold them to that just because i went there
i you know think that's
um because you went there
because they uh allow for uh uh tuition uh break for out of state students who children of alumnae
well certain schools do it
i i was involved in some uh oh alumnae recruiting uh here in town uh recently uh well last year
uh and it was kind of fun because you are trying to
and they were
this was a college night at a at a high school in richardson
and it was
and there were a bunch of kids you know and a bunch of schools
it's kind of interesting to to to talk up you know your
and i was surprised by the number of kids that came came by and had heard of you know our school
and and were interested in it
uh you know we uh
situations like that you don't realize you know until you start thinking about it the kinds of advantages you school may have over others
and so i i was real real pleased with that
so did you drum up any interest then
well that's good
but uh it seemed like there were quite a few kids that were definitely interested in going there
and she was wanting some more information
but she was her her daughter was uh a a ma- ma- dru- a majorette or something you know a baton twirler or something and she was
she had cards printed up actually describing you know business cards describing her daughter's uh you know she had won several different twirling awards and all this
and she was had these business cards she was passing out
and it was
well you know i think richardson is probably you know one of the places that would definitely
um i i really have been pleased with plano
i have a child who uh
and uh i thank god every day that i have the resources that we have tapped into
now is he the elementary school
and he's not severely learning disabled
but he is being helped
i mean you know he just he's being helped
he he was in resource from second grade till fourth grade in math
and they recently released him from
resource which i'm i was thrilled
i i just thought that was so neat that they got him over that hump
and um he's in the herman method of reading
and basically what they do is they start right from the beginning relearning the sounds of letters
doctor haggard is is heading that up
and it's wonderful
you know in in watching the way he has struggled
so you worked you learned how to solve your problems on your own
and and so it's you know it's not an intelligence problem
has has he had this since kindergarten
or is this something that maybe learning phonetics
and then he just didn't learn the right way
well you know it's funny
when um when he was in first grade he had trouble with with spelling
and i would say to the teacher
and you know he'll say c a t
and then he would go to write it
and he would write c o t
and i kept saying to the teacher something is wrong here
you're right right
and the teacher kept saying oh he has a may birthday
and i i requested a conference and
well i was
and i and i went up there the second week of school
and i said you know something is wrong
and thank god the li- the head teacher the team leader was a special education major
oh how great
it was it was
so she she was able to zero in
and she said you know we we were going to call you if you hadn't called us
and we think he needs to be tested immediately because you know once the first report card comes in they
and she said i think we can get him real fast
and sure enough they tested him
and you know he qualified for for the help
and it's been great
and i and i thank god i'm here because i i know i have a sister who has the other extreme
she has a a child in connecticut who is extremely gifted
and because of the cutbacks in the economy they have nothing for her
and and to me that's the same thing
it's it's like having a child who has a learning disability that's being ignored
but that's something that parents i think are able to help the gifted child in the home more than they could help the learning disabled child
that's something you can do by just enrichment types of things in the home but learning disability unless you are schooled in the types of things and ways to help a child like that then it makes it real difficult and this is this to me is the benefit i see in public schools is that that uh you do have government money to fund
and i'm not sure that the private schools or parochial schools address that problem
and if they're a behavior problem they're out
uh this is kind of a rejection type of thing
and and we get it even at our level in in
and we get students that come in that have been kicked out of the uh parochial and pub- and uh private schools and uh they come in
and their attitude is i'm a bad boy and proceed to
so i i really hate that for them
well when comparing test scores
and they were comparing test scores between private schools and public schools
and that was one of the points that i made is that you're not comparing apples to apples
you know you can't say um you know i know steven probably would not be accepted because he has a learning disability and
into a private school and um which is which is too bad
but on the other hand i i can't necessarily blame them
you know they they are a private school
and they ca- they
but you can't say then well public schools are are not as good
perhaps they are because they're they're
if you choose the select top group out of the public schools and tested them and then compared them to the pri- to the private school group then i think you would have a more equitable way
and i have a problem when they compare the kids in japan or germany to the kids here
in in in uh ho- honesty the kids in japan are they have to try out to even get into to which kindergarten they're going to get into
and then after uh
and if if you only
the in fact they've had cases in the past where parents have committed suicide because their child has not gotten into the top kindergarten which means they probably won't get into the top elementary and and high school
and if they don't then af- when they reach a certain age they just that's the end of their schooling
and and uh they don't ever really go on
and and uh so that that creates a problem
and and you can't compare because they go so many more hours
well you see that with the foreigners that come here
um i i was talking to somebody recently or read somewhere where they where they said that you know these children they they had to be the best
and they put off all social life all everything
well is that good
but on the other hand i feel like my children who are kind of middle of the road have are more rounded you know
and so that's why i said their childhood is extremely different from mine
we didn't do all that you know
well and you don't you don't see the parents uh encouraging those students to get on athletic teams or
and it's interesting to see them as they get older uh then that is the type of adult they are
well this is a very timely topic inasmuch as we're going to a family reunion this weekend
oh are you really
this is one that's uh the baker family reunion and this has been going on at least uh i would say at least twenty-five years or thirty
first time i i married into the family
and the first time i went was about fifty-seven i think
but uh this one has been well organized
and in fact it used to be at lake brownwood
and now it's lake texoma because that's more central location for people from oklahoma and texas to come to
very important because uh you'll start losing people if it's too far to go
we i have one reunion on my mother's side
and we found that if it's in a certain part of texas some people come
and if it's elsewhere other people come we never get them at both of them it seems like
so i think we need to find a new place
well listen they've uh they've had this one
well it just
of course over the years it has uh built up as far as the organization is concerned but now they uh have a golf tournament on the saturday
and then they have generally a show or an auction or something on saturday night to help raise funds to cover the costs of such
oh that's a neat idea
and uh everyone uh they get the community building there at lake texoma lodge
and everyone brings in food and then for the saturday night dinner they bring in like kentucky fried chicken from durant
and uh it really uh has worked out
uh generally uh i think it's been as high as about a hundred and twenty people
well i guess um ours probably isn't that big
and i often feel funny because i'm in a branch that's all but died i just have one aunt and my family
so sometimes when these other families get together they're really pulling in aunts and uncles and grandkids
and we're kind of off on the sidelines
but it does remind us that we have family and roots
so we keep going even though we're not a real big part of it
well our family start- reunion started out my wife
and i were the kids the newlyweds so to speak and now we go our children go
and our grandchildren are going now
oh that's great
so it's uh wound up that uh we're the old folks now
but um they have various organized
they have generally a volleyball net set up and horseshoes uh to pitch
and they organize a baseball game for the kids and several people bring boats
and there's a place they they take the kids up to the lodge and go swimming up there in the afternoon
so there's lots to do
so it it's a full day
and some just come in for saturday so it uh has worked out quite well
and it's a chance to see some of the relatives you don't see all year long except that once a year
well that's neat
i think think they're really fun
and then we go to my husband's occasionally down in temple
and he has a large family
so it's it's fun when we go to that one
and i think we've been to one in thirty-five years
that that is a problem with the distance
the people that we have that don't come are out el paso way and it's just too much for all of them
but then we have the same attitude when it's out
they're going to have it at fort davis and we thought that would be fun to kind of tie it in as a vacation time as well as reunion
each year of course they elect officers of the family reunion and a number of years ago back in the early eighties my wife was president
and it takes a lot of planning
but it's a lot of fun
well i think
and the grandkids really enjoy it because it's the only time of the year they see all their cousins from oklahoma
and it's it's good for kids to know that they have other family
and this year they're all excited
oh what fun
this weekend's going to be a rock and roll show my two grandsons and one of their cousins are are going to dress up and lip sing to a rock song you know in jeans and t-shirts and such
so it's uh it's going to be exciting for them and for us too
they uh really get uh into it
well it sounds like you really have a good structure and have it going along
ours ours is still kind of loosely organized
and the same people usually get stuck with doing it
oh that generally happens
so the officer idea is a good idea
well we've uh had various things over the years uh to raise funds for it and again it's not it's not cheap to rent the lodge up there or the meeting room down in the cabins and such
but uh they've come up with
and they've had auctions and various things to raise funds
and uh some people do
and some people don't
and it's not fair that everybody not contribute
well thanks a lot i enjoyed talking to you
well i am uh the product of uh i think as much the changing roles of women as anyone
my mother uh
my mother and i were uh really prac- first generation divorce in our family
my uh mother was divorced in nineteen uh fifty-seven
and was i was the first one of anyone that that anyone had ever known
of course now fifty percent divorces in the united states uh
my mother uh was treated very badly uh in a by a lot of people family members um especially from my father's side of the family
and also uh uh uh we were uh
ostracized by his family uh basically just you know uh we just kind of dropped off the face of the earth
and they all felt that th- there was never an issue that my father was the was the cause of the reason for the split up even though he had impregnated another woman and forced the divorce
uh it was always my mother's fault she was not uh sufficient you know she just was not good enough
that that's too bad
um um that's sad
uh so you know that's so changing
um i think that there are people that i think that uh
i was a- i was first generation going to college in my family
uh first my mother had always had a quote career but always a career as a uh uh in a secretarial position
she did rise to the highest position that a woman could rise to in a secretarial pro- profession in des moines iowa
that's that's wonderful
she was a secretary to uh uh the jud- to uh a circuit court judge federal judge
and it was a lifetime appointment for her as well as for him
so that was a really high high status position
well that's wonderful
hard driving lady with a steel rod up her back you know
oh bless her heart
but uh so i went to college and now since have completed two masters degrees
and i am the director of music in a church
um and but it's interestingly enough i am still everyday confronted with
uh for instance uh well you know i am just not taken as seriously you know
at professions as many of the wom- as many of the men who are doing the same job i do
and uh the choir members treat me differently because i am a woman they expect me to be more motherly
and i have experience with this because i work at both both as a director of music and also as an associate under a man
so i am pretty i am pretty ob- pretty cons- i mean i am pretty aware of what goes on uh in the church
so basically that's that's
well i am done talking
well i think that you carried forth your subject matter very well uh nickie
and i can uh relate to that uh
uh i think it's it's the image that the woman has and uh in the world
as uh the lesser of the two
and uh i think things are changing
but the changing is taking a long time longer than we would like it to like it to take
uh i think we are progressing at a snail's pace
but we are progressing
so that's the main point is that we are going ahead
and uh i think that uh in the long term that women are going to be able to have the recognition
and uh men uh have a lot of them have uh come around and have seen
but there are a lot of die-hards out there that will never change
so we have to uh face that reality also
i have never been able to figure out why they can not ever change why they can not bend i mean why they can not just accept you know competent women
i i have never been able to understand that
i mean what
it could be if they are af- they are not sure of themselves
the one's that uh go along with that they are sure of themselves
and they know that they can uh you know uh be on the same level
and they do not have any uh ego uh problems that they are fighting
and uh i think that we are going to be uh on par with them in salary and in recognition
uh and i what i would like to see happen futuristically
is that yes uh we each have our uh jobs in life
and uh i think our problems would be fewer
they in their in their own peer relationships they do not treat themselves equal
and so it's really difficult for them to treat women as equals
they are they are really much more comfortable with somebody being the boss and somebody being the follower
uh it just seems that it seems it seems that they are more comfortable that way
and i do not know if that's i mean that's it's a militaristic point of view i guess you know
and everybody else is infantry
but it's just really interesting to me
you know who treats me very you know with a with as
but when he gets angry it's always over control issues it's always over power issues it's never over you know it's always you said you were going to do something
and you did not do it as if he is the boss
and i am the you know and i am the slave
those are the only only issues we ever fight about
i think it's just i think it's just difficult for men to uh to accept women equally
uh dictator dictatorships are real efficient
well i guess we would have to go back to the way that the lord made us
and uh the women when they are married they are to be subjective to their husbands
and i believe that strongly
and uh but i think that they should be in harmony with what they are with what the subject matter is
and i think the issue should be settled
uh and i think that can happen in a very won- wonderful way
and if we men and women would do as the bible said that we would esteem each other higher than ourselves
i mean if your husband did that to you
and you did that to your husband
and uh that's really the the divine answer
and and the right answer
so uh uh that would be a beautiful relationship
and i think there are some people that have done that
and i have seen it
and it's it's just marvelous
and i am just in awe to see this
and then i'll respond
well i'm uh i'm very guilty of of not doing my part with recycling i'm afraid
we um recently moved here from north carolina
and it was very easy to you know to put everything out there
but we don't have it in at least in our neighborhood right now and uh so i've been very guilty about not making the effort to to take things where take things where they belong
well how long have you been here
well we've been here since january
so we we still feel very new
but uh it's working up to a year now
so i guess we're old timers compared to some people
you need to get into the
and and we didn't recycle at all before we came so i think we're doing well
we we save most of our aluminum cans and glass and newspaper right now
well where do you take those things
well the um glass and the newspaper we usually take to walmart
they have um in behind walmart they have bins and then we usually save up our cans and and change them in for money
well where do you do that
because we've been saving cans for my daughter's choir um
but i didn't know where to take them
um there's a place on parker road um
it's just over the overpass before you get like to k-mart
i think there's a a service station there
there's usually a semi truck that has a a person there that will weigh them
so and what i hear a lot of neighborhoods do have the the pickup now
and we hopefully we'll be getting them in the month of october
it seems like ever since we've moved here we've been hearing that you know it's coming in a couple of months
but the trucks that were supposed to do it there's been some problems with from what i've read in you know the mail that we get and i can't wait for that
i feel guilty we don't recycle our our milk containers because they seem like a big waste
well they yeah they they're a lot of bulk anyway yeah
and i think that's when i'll i'll start doing the plastic too
it was just no effort at all um no more trouble than taking out the garbage
i've gotten used to washing the you know the um salad dressing bottles and
and it's nicer to just throw them out
but we can do our part
well how much do you earn on the cans
i i didn't know ho- what kind of an idea to give her for
oh when we first were were here it was like we'd take maybe a oh a grocery sack full or maybe two grocery sacks full
and it would be like two dollars but since last time we've gotten more like a dollar
so it's gone down
i think more people are are recycling
that's something we we don't really make any effort to
and whatever pop we drink we used to take the boys out for a bike ride and pick up the litter you know the the cans and that was kind of fun
but we haven't done that for a long time so
well that sounds like a pretty good project
well i'll have to keep myself and and ge- get on it
my neighbor across the street um is so careful about recycling
and so i keep telling myself i'll i'll get it organized
but may maybe they'll beat me and and do the city wide first
well hopefully the bins will be here in this month
and that will spur you on
that's all you can do so
well um have you
or do we
they you know
if it's been long enough five minutes is is when they cut in and say say we don't have any more room for recording
you can't chat all day huh
so we can say good-bye now
and maybe we'll get on line again
well do you have any pets
i have a dog named grisly who's a ten year old uh mixed breed between golden retriever afghan hound and chow
and i have a pair of box turtles
i used to have box turtles um well years ago when i was growing up i i really like them
lucky and spot that's their names and they live in an aquarium without water in my family room
and my dog thinks he's a mother turtle
so do you have any pets now
um we have one dog a bichon frise
um our friends in houston bred the dogs
i had never heard of them they're um they're all white
and they're small and um and fluffy
but they're not very well known in this country
and they're not um high strung or over bred um
and how big do they get
ours is uh on the small end
and she's about ten pounds
oh that's interesting
and they range from probably ten to sixteen pounds and they love people um and kids
and that was something we were looking for um
our our love is golden retrievers
and that's what we had intended to get in houston
but we had a small yard and a pool
and knowing how they love to dig and love the water um and we thought that was kind of a tough climate so uh we ended up getting this
and uh my son would rather have a golden retriever though i think
well we've got a good size dog
and we were considering getting a puppy a small house lap top dog for him because he likes other animals and for me because we used to have a miniature dachshund
and i miss having a little one you know around
well they really are um they're really sweet dogs
we've uh we thought probably our neighborhood in houston had more of this breed than any other place just because of um the family that had them and and bred them
and and a lot of them stayed in the neighborhood because um
and how do you spell that breed
and how do you pronounce that
and they don't shed
so they're they're good dogs for people with with allergies
and they love people
ours um ours barks more than um than some because she spent a lot of time at our friends house
they had a cockapoo and and two bichons um
and she didn't bark at all until she spent time there and uh now it's funny
she's she's a good watch dog and if there's she'll bark that way
but she also talks a lot
she um has a definite personality
and so if we're leaving her she barks at us because she doesn't want to be left um
and they're um they're very smart dogs
the circuses in europe used to use them um for the acts
they uh oh they'll dance on their hind legs each um but they're very easy to train and
and about how much are they
well they range
and how about the and how about the person in uh houston
well she's no longer breeding them but um because her dogs um the the second one that she has was one of the puppies from the litter
and uh the one male that she used had a tooth problem and so she only bred that dog once because it had the tooth problem and did them strictly as um pets you know they weren't weren't show quality
oh but yeah takes a lot of time
and it's very expensive
um but she might have some contacts here
i know origina- i know that the dog's grandmother um was from plano
oh that's where i live
oh that's where i live too
so what do you think about it
well i found it interesting that they started off with a problems of immigration in america and then went back and said well if there is a problem
um uh i think there's some problems
but they're not really big ones
i think that um in general the whole immigration policy isn't quite as open as it should be
i was i was wondering what your response would be
uh where did you come from
so where did your parents come from
and that was you know prior to world war two
but it's interesting that you know with the topic i think i agree with you
and you know we have to remember the chinese came here and were our labor you know for the railroad transatlantic railroad
our irish came and you know built the towns and
but what do you think
well that will be interesting
because we have just
had a naturalization act where the mexicans that were residents in texas i'm from texas and have become citizens now
um i think that's all right
well i agree with it wholeheartedly
so when you were giving your answer i was thinking is this a texan i'm talking to
because texan philosophy is a little different
well a lot of the experience that i have with this problem has to do with my brother-in-law who's chinese and immigrated from china
and um you know he um got a green card is and is in good standing in america and china but only because he was always nice to the chinese government
and he was always on pretty good terms with them
but um their
and they're trying to get permission for his mother to come to america to like help care for the kid and that sort of thing
and it's turned out to be sort of a horrible problem
oh well then you have first in the experience on immigration
well that is interesting
well i wonder you know even with those that were involved with tienamen's square
you know did we really protect them
that's and i think that's pretty crazy
because i mean those students who were in america when that was happening are almost certainly going to be in trouble if they go back
and aside for that they're the best and brightest of china
so it's certainly in our best selfish interest to keep them here if we can
well what do you think about
and these are not the brightest
see these are refujees you mean
i mean we we're talking boat people
well um i don't have any problem with that um
um interesting my when my daughter was in high school one of the custodians was vietnamese and with his limited english they found out thr- you know that she was in student council
and they found out that he was a medical doctor
so we started recording already
uh i guess
oh so you pressed one
so i guess we're supposed to start talking
i read uh a lot of steven king dean r koontz uh uh-huh
so it's mostly all novels
i'll read some uh classic too
oh like what
a a rose family by faulkner that's one of my favorites
oh and this this is more of a play or something that that it was from that that i saw
and i read the book from that
and by the way my name's bill
uh well a bunch of stuff i guess uh fair number of novels but mostly shorter ones
and like i don't really like the you know six hundred page long stephen king novels and all that
i i read one like maybe once a year
like i like say uh richard broudigan a lot uh
he's uh he's dead now
but he was really a pretty amazing writer
he wrote books that were like pretty short and pretty easy to read you know like written at a third grade level or whatever
but they were still very heavy and philosophical also very funny
like he wrote trout fishing in america
so that's anyway
and uh i read a lot of non fiction books too
uh let's see
i like to read a lot of non fiction history when civil war era and and that kind of thing
and that was on t v
it was uh
and uh about a american woman that got kidnapped in uh
uh this is when they were having their revolution or whatever
and teddy roosevelt sent troops over and really portrays him as a
what how crazy
well just like s- some one quote that he had was that he thought the america's emblem was stupid because it was an eagle
and it should be a grizzly bear because you you know like the t- t- grizzly and stuff like that
and that's what made me want to read the book
see i also read a lot of books about music because i'm interested in that and fair number of stuff about science and also philosophy things
i like i like to read some of the philosophy stuff
like let's see
and even like reading some new age things things that i don't quite believe in
like here on my shelf i have a book called journeys out of the body
and and uh even stuff about not like ghost stories but real encounters with ghosts and supposedly haunted houses
and i like to read stuff like that
and i like to read uh
i read dianetics once once i got past all the gibberish on it
uh did you like it
it it it it took me a while to really get into it
it it didn't help me that much
but uh i think once you're set in your ways you're set in your ways
uh then i
one in- real interesting book i read recently was when i was looking for a job
and it it had real good tips
and i got the
uh well where i'm from the atlantic coast conference is a very big conference
and course we have duke university that was the national champions last year
so i'm kind of hoping that they'll repeat again this year
this is college college okay
so hopefully we'll have a good year
and see that's probably all all i saw
i we have moved in the last couple years from utah to texas
and there's so many
and none of them are our our alma mater
uh i i follow it especially around the playoffs
so course i was real familiar with the utah jazz
and the mailman or karl malone was you know pretty big thing
and the lakers have always been amazing to watch
i i did keep track a little bit of the mavericks
and have a lot of problems with with tarpley
and maybe now that that's over they'll they'll come out of it
well that's an up and coming team though
or they're not going to have
but i think chicago will probably with the n b a again
course the celtics are always really
be interesting to see how the olympics does this year with all the the n b a players playing on the olympic team
and the season hasn't started yet
and we need to talk about baseball
oh my atlanta braves
well i really do uh you know
it is it is
and that's why i've
and i haven't really even started thinking about basketball yet
but this wasn't a good subject
uh i guess my personal opinion i i don't mind paying taxes necessarily
i i just sometimes wonder if our money is being used in the best way
uh sometimes when i hear what what they're even what even what the politicians are making you know when they're getting a hundred and fifty thousand plus benefits and that uh i think that's just a bit too much to be paying them uh
and that's all tax money
and then when you read about that they're spending all the money on you know these studies that have no relevance whatsoever that kind of ticks you off too
but uh somebody somebody was telling me the other day that they heard some senator say that what we're paying it's not that we mind paying taxes it's that we're paying too much for a lousy government
and i i i tend to agree with that
and i think there's just too many too many levels of bureaucracy
i think it can be can be managed by less uh less levels
well i know any time there's there's a big uh budget cut you know
and any time there's there is a budget cut or crunches it's always the small guy that that gets hurt
it's never the uh the person that's making a hundred thousand there
and uh and sometimes we're running around there
i see these these uh supervisors running around uh having meetings
i i really don't know what they do
i sometimes wonder are are they really doing anything
well i think we're going to see a streamlining in the government
i just you know
i i don't know what kind of uh i don't know what what level or what how long it will take for you know our country to start the public in general to start saying hey this is too much we're not going to pay any more you know we're not going to pay for this
and you're out you know
but i think uh i don't know what what kind of input we're going to get from the public and how they're going to go about doing it
because i think i think we're just getting taxed way too much
i mean right now we're getting taxed probably probably around thirty-five percent or more
and that's that's you know that's me not making a whole lot of money
well they got so many hidden taxes that it's really hard to figure out how much you are paying because go to a grocery store something like that and you're paying a little tax here
and you so
but there's probably at least about twenty-five to to thirty cents of different taxes on on our gas
and you don't realize
and i don't know what our gas tax is
so i mean they're hitting us up
and they may not raise it you know federally as much one year
but then they'll raise it somewhere in the state or the sales tax or property tax or whatever
it's just i mean you can see that you're money is just not
well i know they say like with reagan they say no new taxes
but they changed the uh deductions on you
and that just raises your taxes you know they just get it a different way so i mean to me it did uh raise my taxes
well i mean you
and all of a sudden i don't know
i heard someone say that uh if they would just something about with the uh the defense budget all that extra money they're throwing back if they cut back by so much percentage it could throw back about six hundred dollars on an average six hundred dollars
well uh even though it's totally out of my uh my degree training i've been working as as in the horticultural aspect so oh
oh for goodness sakes
the last i don't know fifteen twenty years so uh i'm
well i work for the state as as a grounds keeper
well that's interesting
um so at this time of the year are you doing much garden work
but uh i don't know
i i guess uh growing up on the farm and and that i i've always had a big interest uh
i have a uh when i have an area to do i i always had a big garden and enjoy working on lawns and and everything
and i enjoy flowers and stuff
i don't do a whole lot of it um at this exact point in my life um because i have two teenage boys
and so they do all the lawn all the lawn care
but i still take care of the you know flower beds and things like that
i was even planning to go out and to uh dig up some hibiscus plants that will not make it through the winter here but you know were planted in the ground since last spring and i was going to dig them up for a friend and for some starters for me
oh that's terrible
and lo and behold about five days ago we had a freeze down to about oh twenty-three degrees or something so the hibi- hibiscus plants no longer exist
and i really feel bad about it
it's a plant that we've had for probably twenty-five years that these were cuttings off of you know
so they're all gone at this point
i grew up in illinois and um
why you know everyone that lives in town and has yards practically has land- uh
and so with that why our lawns do stay um you know pretty nice all summer if you water
but in the winter we have bermuda grass and in the winter it turns as brown as a grocery sack and
when i go back home to my parents in illinois in the winter you know and their grass is fairly green
that's one one aspect of a lot of those grasses they go dormant
i think the saint augustine and uh centipede grass is another one you have quite a bit of down there yeah
but they really have a heck of a time keeping it going in the middle of the summer
but um those law- those lawns look nice during the winter
but you know they almost stick out like a i guess not a sore thumb a pretty thumb
but you know when you look at the neighborhoods and they're all brown except the one you know
it's sort of like well
well i know my folks live uh in arizona there
and uh you know they just grow rocks
that's their gardening there so uh i guess as long as you can have uh some grass there
so i know i was in uh houston when i was working for a company once
and we were taking care of lawns out there
and uh that particular year they had just tons of rain you know
and then i know with all that moisture a lot of the lawns get a lot of disease problems
houston is a lot um a lot wetter than than dallas dallas area
are are you uh able to get uh sometimes a double crops of of certain things in your garden
haven't for i guess i never have here actually
but um but yes
so what do you guys having up there
i haven't been up there since oh lord forty-eight i guess
that's a long time uh
it was it was uh let's see yeah it was forty-eight
we did an air show out at uh out at uh boone greene no out at uh andrews
so what's it been like up there
well for the past week or two it's been cold and wet but before that for most of the year it's been hot and dry
uh like september was hot and dry
um september really was
i think for about twelve months through september the the average temperature has been higher than normal each month
um lots of ninety degree days during the summer
i mean this whole ye- course this whole year
but uh we had uh you know all these we have all these uh
somebody said you know you're either a stranger or a fool to try to predict texas weather
well always they were saying it was going to be the hottest summer ever
and we had all this rain
and it really is not a bad summer at all really cool
but all of a sudden in in uh in october uh september october it got real hot and dry and just stayed that way for a long time
and uh then the end of october it started
and then uh into of november the first like the second week uh you know the first week actually we had we had a freeze
oh if you had it early
and the average you know the average uh first frost is like the fifteenth of november here but usually it's not until later
uh but you know we really need the rain that we've been getting
and it has not today
but the last few days it's been been pouring most of the day
is it is it is it flooding anywhere
i have not heard of it any problems of it flooding anywhere
i mean that's occurred certainly at times in the past
but uh no
it's just kind of uh clou-
we're supposed to have a chance to get some rain the next couple of days here uh which will be you know a little bit more typical uh autumn weather but really it's strange
it's like we went into winter you know the poor trees said what
and then it then it then it became winter like uh today it's today it's sort of change to warmer to sort of more typical autumn day
there you you know
usually there's uh
and you know all these huge trees just like the eastern hard wood belt all the way up to maine you know
it's that same trees pines and and hard woods you know hickories and oaks and stuff
and uh i was up there last weekend
and there are trees that that still have their leaves on
and they're green
but they're dead
you know the the freeze just got them
they they weren't ready for it at all apparently
and and we haven't had a typical fall at all
not much color you know changes have occurred at all
i'm not sure what that what that means
our leaves are are all on on the ground now
so you you all actually had some color huh
we we did for a time
that's you know
i think you could drive along in maryland and look at the sweet gum trees on each side and the and the pines and what not
and you could you know you could be driving along in east texas and looks just the same
it's almost you know identical kind of country
i was up i was up there cutting some firewood this weekend
little little oak tree that was dead and cut it up and split it
that's because it it can't tolerate a freeze this early
uh it there's some trees
like the oaks like the white oaks seem to be pretty hardy
and some of the other oaks there are a few oaks that have lost their leaves
um what i notice mostly is the red maples that the leaves are just dead the dogwoods still look still look you know they got uh bit on the ends of the leaves a little bit
but they still look pretty good
it just depends on the on the uh on the tree
well it's not often you get uh many women interested in football
i haven't recently um
do you have any uh
well i guess kids are out
i i'm married
so do you like football
oh i follow the uh the cowboys
but that's about it uh
the the same here
i i i am a pretty big dallas fan been for a long time but i haven't been to any games recently
but uh i try to catch the game every weekend that i can
um it's pretty nice
we dec- we decided just to watch them at home
at least you uh follow the game a little bit
and and hopefully they win
right now i'm in um college
so i'm more into college football than professional i think
oh i see
what uh school are you going to
um i'm at b y u
so what are you planning to go into
um i haven't really picked a field
i haven't i i don't know i've thought a lot about labor and delivery
but i don't know
she she really uh enjoys
she's a nurse in san antonio but uh she's been she's been working a uh on a late shift
she works the uh i guess the graveyard's what you'd call it
and she's worked that for oh years when i was small
uh i guess probably going on twenty years now
and she really enjoys it
and uh and uh she's uh she just started a new job at a different hospital closer to where she lives and she's really enjoying herself
well that's great
well good luck to you in pursuing your nursing degree
do you plan on staying in in the dallas area
um i'd like to come back to dallas
but my family's there
uh i think texas san antonio in particular has got a large uh base of hospitals
uh i don't know about dallas
i'm i'm in dallas but i'm originally from san antonio and they've got large medical uh center down there
so if ever wanted you know pursue anything more than your nursing degree that that'd be the place to do it
my brother-in-law um is in the medical profession i mean he's at medical scho- school in san antonio right now
well like i said good luck to you
well um take care
and maybe we'll meet up again some time
my name is uh donna donahue
and i live in plano texas
and i live in raleigh north carolina
um do you want to start
or should i start
we have um three children
and um they attend the public school here and are very active in a lot of the sports soccer and baseball
and well my little girl goes to tap dance
and my little one goes to preschool
and um i'm home with the children just do a lot of running around
um what about you
i'm i'm single
and i i live in a town home here in raleigh
and it's pretty typical of the other town homes in the area ther- we we have a lot of town homes here as well as single family homes
and at the time that i bought this one it was just a a much better arrangement for me personally
well um that that sounds that sounds pretty good for
i know my husband takes an awful lot of time on the weekends not so much now but to um maintain the lawn and the edging and the flower beds
and it's a lot of work owning a home with a little bit of property attached to it
it's sometimes i think um it would be nice to have a town home with
well if you ever get one be sure the walls are good and thick because if they're not you can hear
i that's the main thing when i was shopping for one
i wanted to make sure i could i couldn't hear my neighbors
and that was so i bought one that's more like living in a
oh that sounds lovely
they're kind of built on a catty-cornered instead of like side by side so you don't actually hear anybody next door to you
so in in your area then there's probably a lot of um career type people that have those type homes
and um the area that we're settled in is um definitely young young families with with kids
they're still doing um a lot of building in the neighborhood
so the people that move here seem to move from all over the country which we're from um the northeast
so it um also gives you a common bond when you don't have a lot of relatives visiting your neighbors
and you know um
well we also in this area seem to have a lot of retirees people who don't want the heat of florida but don't want the heat of the the cold of the northeast
so they settle sort of in-between
now it's um is it very wooded around where you are
yes as a matter of fact this is a uh this particular community that i live in is very wooded
oh how pretty
and it's pretty flat and and kind of barren
and that's the only thing that we don't like about living in texas is we miss all the beautiful trees and the fall
and and um uh the landscape is much different here in texas than it is you know in the north um or even where you are
uh we definitely have a lot of trees here
but fortunately the home owner's association does all that
well see that's another plus
and this is the time of year we're starting to lose
we just have a few trees in the front and a few in the back but not not much just just a little
and if you didn't do anything about it then they'd probably the leaves just blow away
and have a happy thanksgiving
the way i work uh the way i dress for work is uh this year nineteen ninety-one has been really suit and tie
or i shouldn't say suit but coat and tie every day
a a year ago i changed jobs from being a researcher to doing marketing for the research group
which means kind of a i guess it's a different set of standards i guess
so uh i i dress almost the same every day
i mean pretty much it's a white shirt and slacks and shoes and a coat
but it was very different before
well i'm a drafter
so i just wear blue jeans and tennis shoes
and i have sweatshirt on today
and that's pretty much the norm for me
if i come in in a dress everybody's shocked
they ask me you know what are you doing in a dress
and it's usually i haven't done my laundry lately
so does it change
so or i guess do you have things like presentations to do or anything like that
so back in my old job up until through nineteen eighty i would usually wear blue jeans and pullover shirts and the like
but probably once a month or so there was some reason that i would have to put on a suit
but that's for my husband's job and not mine
oh i see
oh well that's interesting
let's see uh what else about this uh
it it seems like t i is pretty cut and dried with two like two or three levels
that there's the t- upper management that always wears gray suits
and the people that don't uh
i would if you if i want to say don't have power or don't have authority or whatever like i used to be in that research and i guess you are
and then there's kind of the the branch manager level or marketing people that kind of do that middle thing
but there's not much
mi- middle of the road
and some of these mini skirts you know are worse than shorts ever thought about being
you know that's i guess that's one of the things you got to put up with when you don't have a dress code
i guess they're the isn't there a dress code something about spaghetti straps
supposedly and backless things but i've seen those too
so this wasn't necessarily a big conversation
but i think we we did it
and and your name was lisa
and i work in the north building
uh well thank you
uh advice on son or daughter going to college
uh that's advice that i will need in time future for my children rather than one that i have uh personal experience with
uh i suppose i would ask what the child wants to do in life and what the child hopes to to get out of college and what sort of college would best meet meet those needs
uh let's see
when i when i went away to school i'm trying to think my criteria
i guess when you're when you're eighteen or so uh it would be important to know if it was a coed college
that was a a strict requirement for me
uh again what uh how serious a person is according to uh uh you know what what they want to get out of school and uh
uh let's see uh
now what was the question
what what's the criteria for picking a college
oh okay uh
uh stay in a dormitory if you can
and also uh depending on how uh uh adjustable your child would be or or flexible i guess it would be uh
if if they chose a college in a different part of the country that maybe the they were unused to their that the way they run things
i mean the the northern colleges are very different than the southern colleges i think
and uh you have to be more flexible and more willing to uh uh adjust to other people's mannerisms and customs or ways of doing things
you know you have to be a flexible person to be able to go all the way across country to something totally different than what you're used to uh
i'm thinking what what problems my children might have in that uh
but i agree with you
uh let's see
uh well climate would be
you know you'd have to you know is somewhat
if uh if it's something different than the one they're used to i guess uh
i i'd also advise them that uh if mom and dad paid for their college that uh if they decided to drop a course or decided that they need another year then they'd have to get a loan to continue
and two uh to to take out loans to assume uh debt after college
the the responsibility of that
and uh uh uh they could they could work and earn money towards college
or it's a lot cheaper if you stay within your state than if you go out of state to a private school uh
and like i said if they was willing to work uh in the summers and also maybe then the parents could pay a third
and then maybe they could take out a loan for a third depending on how expensive it is
so it's not too far away
but it's getting there
i mean we still have definitely can put away the money for college now
uh i would advise that that they did not have a car at college
oh yeah uh
i think it's more an in- a burden to to provide for
i think i think because most kids don't have a car at college the ones that do get taken advantage of
and you know there is just i think it's just trouble waiting to happen
so i would advise they didn't they didn't take a car
and uh they didn't take a television
and they didn't take a refrigerator
uh i didn't do any of those though
well let me see
well uh city slickers and star trek five
only only five
oh i can't wait
i mean it was classic trek
now does the old star trek guys meet the new guys
however the rumor is is that it will happen next happen next time
you know that i read in people or somewhere no it was u s a today that they said they weren't going to do anymore
uh except that the rumor is is that they still might
but it may not include the entire crew
and it will be a next generation meets this generation
i'm not sure what the difference in light years between the new generation and the the old guys was
oh that's right
considering that spock was on an uh you know couple weeks ago and that the the very first episode of next generation they had mccoy
well you know he was rear admiral whatever you know
and he just kind of hobbled down the halls real slow
matter of fact he looks just as about as old and the uh next generation as he does in the latest star trek
but did they have some pretty good special effects
but i think the script was you know just incredible compared to the last one
five was the script was bad bad bad
well you know why
uh william shatner wrote it
oh is that right
and even worse he directed it
l- leonard s- nimoy he does a lot better
he in fact uh he didn't direct this one
but he directed the one before uh i think star trek four something like that
in search of spock or no journey home i think that was
are you're a real life trekkie
i i wouldn't go so far as being a trekkie
well i've gone to you know one for real live trek convention
i saw james doohan you know the guy that plays uh scotty
huh did you get to talk to him
it was like uh want an autograph want to stand in line for about four hours
huh they have some good management principals in this new generation
it's it's kind of funny
i uh was reading in uh a book uh trying to think
but it was it was saying don't do star trek management style
and they were referring to you know captain kirk
so he kind of was a cowboy type too
but uh jean luke does more of a a
uh it's definitely a lot better
uh saw the addams family last week
oh how was that
uh there were a few things different than the old series
but on the on the whole it was pretty similar and
lots of little funny spots huh
in fact thing has a big much bigger role than he does in the series
i mean you know there is lots of areas where thing saves the day
and he runs around a lot
uh you know just finger hopping
but he's in a box right
he never did does come in out of a box i don't think
oh that's yeah that's okay
well do you do any recycling
uh we do here
uh see what do we recycle
we they recycle
and they also have centers where you can take aluminum cans and uh plastic bottles
and i think that's all they have
well we uh
there is a lot of things that you can recycle down here although the only thing i guess i wind up recycling religiously is uh aluminum cans
but uh we've got a we've got a couple of different things uh places uh
and you can go up there and and uh redeem
we've got one that gives you like a penny a can
so if you
well actually you have to give put them in there unsmashed
and uh when you do that it it basically crushes them and then drops a penny down a little shoot
oh can you can you hold on for just a minute
i'm going to try pressing one again to make sure that i pressed it hard enough because okay just succeed
well i guess i guess
well i heard it that i heard it that time
well anyways you guys only get a penny a can
well when you buy like uh canned drinks and stuff like that do they charge you for the deposit
and so it's like they charge you for the deposit
so when you turn in the cans unsmashed you're just like reimbursed
it it really is
really what happens is we just get a penny a can back off the off the price if you want to think of it that way
so when we get like uh uh a twelve pack then that's like twelve cents back
so you guys can actually get ahead
but uh they have sort of like uh things that you c- you're not like reimbursed for or paid for
like we can recycle uh clear glass brown glass green glass
uh and milk jugs and uh newspapers you know
but that that kind of stuff
but they they said they can't be smashed or else uh
and they're not reimbursed by the the people who are over them or something
well shoot maybe what we ought to do is start sending unsmashed uh pepsi cans and whatever up there
they said that how ways can encourage recycling uh
i i i tell you what what really works uh at least down here is if there is if there is some e- even some money basically to take care of the gas to recycle it you know what i mean then people tend to do it uh
in other words taking care of the environment is is all well and good but if it's going to cost you to take care of the environment they're not quite as uh likely to do it as if uh if you get something back for it you know
and uh so you know if there are some energy savings or if there is some significant savings anything that they can pass on to the consumer you know it kind of reminds me of using an a t m card you know to get money or doing your banking
you know if it's free people will use it
but uh i know we had a problem down here with uh oil people taking oil out of their cars and just putting it down the d- you know the s- the drain sewer
and uh all that because there was
apparently a lot of people you know every time they change the oil
they just dump all the res- their old oil down there
oh that's good
uh another thing i thought of i guess to recycle would be like clothes because i mean everybody gets rid of their clothes sometime or other
and that way you know you don't get near enough as as much as you bought it for
but you you got the use out of it
and what you're going to basically donate to a goodwill or whatever anyways you can get a little bit of money for
and so that's something that i've never
i we're we're new to iowa
but that's one way to sort of get money and still recycle i guess
i know a lot of places they uh uh
well i guess what part of t- what part of the country do you live in
well i'm also in dallas
but uh have you always lived here in dallas
and i'm a uh
and i'm originally from boston
oh well you are seeing quite a different climate and quite a different neighborhood
but i like it
well i missed it at first
but now i go back there
and i'm a real wimp about the cold
so i like it here
well that's good
i i have lived in texas essentially all my life
and uh i have traveled up in the northeast and around and have enjoyed it
but uh i don't know
i'm getting older and uh not sure that's something i want to do
i live uh over in the lake highlands area if you're familiar with that
uh tell me where that is uh
i i probably do know
but i don't know it by that name
we're just north of uh white rock lake
well we have some very nice hou- homes here in this area
uh my particular
so uh my particular area the homes run anywhere from about sixty-five eighty thousand dollars on up to probably half a million
uh the homes that were here earlier were smaller
now they've gotten larger and larger as as they have developed the land
and of course it's pretty static right now
and all the values over here have dropped off because of the economy
well i am uh i'm gosh i'm barely in dallas
and i guess we have a similar situation
i mean we've got houses two streets away that are probably around seventy eighty thousand and then we've got bent tree right across the street
so i don't i don't even know how high those go
but some of those are pretty big
so it's that's the strange thing about i guess dallas because back where i'm from you wouldn't have that sort of a variation at all
they'd all be pretty similar to one another within a a couple miles
well we have suffered from real lack of land use planning in dallas
but exactly what you're describing is what happens all over
uh we've got a house
and it was it had previously been unoccupied
but it had existed for three years
this is a whole block of homes that uh a builder built all of them
and i guess he he did some crazy thing to get some extra money from the bank and then ran away
so the whole block was all foreclosed
and so some were vacant for quite a while before they you know they finally sold them because there were so many
well your was your house in good shape
oh it was
so we just you know we bargained to get an extra warrantee on that
and uh we're really we haven't had any problems
and you know we had originally thought we'd have to get a fix up special or something because being from the northeast we figured we couldn't afford anything
but the prices are much lower here
and this was definitely not a fix up special
but i'll tell you
and i just finished repainting the exterior and you know making drapes and buying furniture
i where i live is a house that's seventeen years old when i bought it
and we bought it from someone who was in it
but before they had it i found out after i had been in the house it it had sat empty for the better part of a year
and i'm not sure what happened
but i do know the folks that we bought it from had done virtually no maintenance for for about four years
i i i found a lot of things
well and plano texas rather than plano illinois
oh do they have one
oh i didn't know that
well i learned something already
well let's see
the three questions are what uh
well mine is uh down at u t austin at college
and the other one is in high school
so you do spend less time then
yeah because they don't want to know they almost don't want to know us
i have uh two married two almo- and then two almost married
and the other two i'm not sure
two s- two two uh uh for sure are single
we have between the spouse and myself we have six
oh well that's kind of nice though
because i came with a split family
and she had
you you shouldn't be lonesome on a holiday huh
and they're doing their own things
well that's true
and and a lot of times they they've got you know uh
yeah and sometimes they want to do their own thing
so sometimes it's just spouse and me
and and you know what
you know right
because who says that they just must got to come over to see us all the time for the holidays
and if they force them to you know that's not good either
well do they all live in the area
well let's see
n- got of the six we've got four around here
uh you know well we're talking like north texas
and then one is in vermont uh montpe- mont- montpelier montpelier vermont
and the other one is in everett washington
and my second marriage
uh and uh
well the s-
the the the the fourth and fifth child of the of the of the uh six are the two that are scattered like that
boy that's those are a long way
well they wanted to go uh
j r my my my last son or my middle son excuse me fell in love with washington state and the the the third daughter fell in love with uh uh vermont
so they wanted to make their homes there
are they are those two married
they uh just working up there or going to school or what
well uh let's see
i guess you'd say j r is working going to s- trying to go to school
especially if they if they're meant to i think
well i certainly hope so
i mean i've got a daughter that's a sophomore at u t
and i'm i'm going to u t a right now myself
well it's oh i agree it's never too late
and when you're saying older we're talking fifty up
and i say that's great why not you know
why not because that's a a lot of times well it's
i believe that uh we in that category
and i'm not in that category quite yet but we are seasoned minds
i mean i don't know why i even went to college when i was seventeen
we know what we're wanting to to uh study
and uh we know our limitations
and we don't try to burn the candle at both ends and in the middle altogether
we're past yeah we're past that age
we're we're smarter now
uh so let's see
so mine i don't spend a whole lot of time because they're not here
what was it uh
h- what do the trends in families
and do we approve what other
well uh the trends in the families were to spread apart do your own thing
but i have seen lately yes i am seeing i'm seeing a change that whoops government can't do it
schools are not able to and between a person's religion uh their their faith in their maker w- whether you know uh whether you're christian or jewish or whatever uh
are going to have to solve some of the problem huh
and the family those are the two that can that that have the wherewithal
and of course judeo-christianity uh and of the jewish folks too believe that the family unit is the one that was given the uh uh mission by the lord to do this very thing
so when another group of of uh people step in try to do it they're they're tromping on our territory so to speak
so i firmly believe that uh
uh the only thing i'm i'm thankful of is that we don't have to pay any income tax in in texas
well that's probably the next year's agenda
and i i think one way or the other we're going to pay for the bureaucracy i guess
uh it's one area that is really i i think hurting the economy more than anything
i think the taxes have just every time you turn around they they have taking more bite out of the dollars that are available for spending for any kind of products
and i i i think that is probably as big a item fueling the recession as anything right now
well i i tell you um
and actually that one the the the taxes on gasoline don't don't bug me as much as uh uh what are we eight and a quarter percent sales tax
and every time you go to buy anything now uh
even you know they they tax food
well i think that uh that the problem with the sales tax of course is it's an unfair tax across the board uh as far as ability to pay which a- allegedly allegedly taxes are supposed to be directed towards
but uh now people with the lowest income pay a hundred percent almost of you know taxes on everything they buy and where people that make you know two hundred three hundred thousand dollars a year certainly a portion of that they aren't going to be paying taxes on you know
and uh that's the unfair equity inequities of sales tax as a main source of revenue
but i don't think it is anymore not in texas anyway
oh i got you because people that uh don't make very much money wind up spending it all
and that's the unfairness of the thing
but uh i think taxes
wha- what do you think of that new luxury car tax anything over ten thou- or thirty thousand dollars
well you know like other things if they don't affect you you don't worry about them too much
so it doesn't
i i think uh you know generally the prices of cars have gotten out of line which is uh you know
and uh i guess if people got thirty forty thousand bucks to spend on a car uh that's their prerogative you know
i i i don't have a whole of sympathy on that
you maybe you buy that you know
and i don't mean to be knocking uh
but it it to me it seems really interesting that they come along and add another ten percent tax uh on top of it
and there's an awful lot of cars that cost more than thirty thousand
and the idea of that kind of taxation is to have people think twice on putting their money into that i guess you know unless they really want it buy something that you know
more well it it's just like having taxes on or exemptions for kids you know
it's a way of increasing the population that that was one of the initial ideas of you know giving exemptions on kids on on federal taxes
and where you exempt things like uh uh one of the best things i heard on taxes to stimulate the economy someone brilliant deductor probably lloyd bentsen said that all you know if they gave back the deductions on credit cards on your federal taxes people would probably be you know spending more money using their credit cards
now i don't know if that's true or not
but if you look on all interest things not just credit cards but on your cars and you know a- any kind of interest that you're paying from a personal point of view that might make certain sense in stimulating consumer purchasers
so that's a lot of the games that politicians play on where they want to go you know tax things that they don't you know to a degree well like booze you know
it gets to the point you know it makes drunks sober you know
well tell me about your home
uh right now we're living in
well it's me my wife and uh two young boys
and uh right now we're in a uh i guess it's either a zero lot line or a garden home
so we don't have a a big yard uh
but uh when my wife and i first moved in it was just the two of us
so it was enough
uh and it's uh i guess what they call a story and a half
because it's not a full two story
where you know everything on top is on bottom
so it's got real high ceilings on half the house
and the other half is just standard sized ceilings
and uh it's about a five year old house now
it's uh pretty nice
well you know these guys that gambled high lost big you know
and uh i'm insulating myself from that problem
oh that's nice
and as i look out the window of my trailer i can envision all the insulation that's going up
oh that's nice
oh i see
and i retired about five years ago and started college
and now i'm a college educated builder
there's still no work you know
so uh you know i decided this summer that uh you know we had enough credit on the credit cards to buy the materials
so i did
and uh see the the the state has a law that says you cannot borrow the money to build your own home
but you can't borrow the money to build your own
well that sounds kind of dumb
and then the bank's holding the bag
as as you know anything that involves the government is works half as well as it's supposed to costs three times as much right
but uh you know my home is uh fairly simple
well i figure it's just me and my wife
but you know i like to do stuff with my hands and whatnot
so i want to have a shop
and my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon
well in the winter time i can see see another guy
but you know he's i can just make out his place you know
oh that's pretty good
well i took a lot of time in choosing this site
oh you you you don't plan on putting any any of that in
well it's got a a very small furnace
and a uh we'll use a wood burning stove as well
but in the house itself i've been working inside you know these lo- these many months and i have not had to use the heat
because it's all geothermal
and with all the
well as much as i could get in it you know
and uh the east side is glass
so it's almost all glass
i mean you know
well not really
it's uh it's on the side of a hill
oh i see
so the first you know
the the the
um i see
and the side that's on the uh the other side is about six feet high
so i've got a pretty good grade there
and then when i put the verandas whi- which will be twelve feet out all the way around on the north south and east sides that will define the shop
that's kind of like like a victorian style
i i've always liked that
you know i we don't have much yard
but i built a small deck in the back
but you know i i see these magazines where you know dig your your own deck
i i kind of wish i had them those size property and and uh one with a grade on it so i can build a real nice deck
uh what sort of camping do you like to do the most
uh well i i do uh real rough type camping
huh rough type huh
i've i've enjoyed it
i've never actually done any uh like tent camping
but uh one of these days i'm going to try that too
uh that can be a lot of fun too
yeah like to go visit uh the national parks and state parks and and uh just get out and see nature
well so far my wife and i have pretty much had to stick with tent camping
this summer we went to uh the smokey mountain
oh how great
and uh stayed about three or four days in there
and the days were nice and warm
and it was beautiful beautiful few days
it worked out particularly well especially considering she was what six months pregnant
it was one of those uh those dome type pop up tents
and about had to be something like that getting around in a pinto
well that's true
i guess the last real uh camping trip i took was has been a couple years ago
uh i went to california up to the sequoias
just just the drive up through uh up the coast line and then cut over in into the into the parks it's gorgeous though
but that's my first trip back in oh goodness um um thirty years maybe
but that is god's country
do they still have the uh the scenic uh roadways that cut through the center of some of those trees
the last one well
the first time i was there the the tree was still standing
but it has since come down
but they are huge
if you've never seen them it's it's very awe inspiring
well new orleans and uh minneapolis
well there is lots of pretty country further west
and you just need to take the little one
show them all the all the pretties before they go away
because there is lots to see
there is course the
and uh the painted desert is is real pretty
and course the the sequoias and the redwoods and
and uh the grand tetons are gorgeous too
course i i guess i'm partial to big tree country
uh not a whole lot of forestry down there is there
place is forested with c- with those concrete trees
lot lot of concrete and glass you know
well i guess that's god's place too
uh what do you figure has been the longest trip you've taken camping
uh probably the the last one that i went to california
i took uh three weeks
and i was actually on the road a little more than three weeks
it really was it was great
well you went out from texas up in into that area
we went uh we took the southern route and went went through uh uh the grand canyon again
and we stopped at uh uh las vegas for a couple of nights and then uh went into malibu in california over on the coast
and then we went up the the big sur highway all the way up to san francisco
and uh and then cut across through the wine country
and then went down to to uh sequoia national park
big sur highway that's uh where you're pretty much in view of the ocean almost all the time aren't you
well we don't right now
with uh with pets
but uh right now we don't have anything
well we've just uh
and uh it was
uh someplace where there you know
some children who would just really uh enjoy having an animal you know a dog i think
well right now
and campus housing does not even allow thinking about that
but you like uh you like pets and things
oh i love animals
it was al- almost always at least one cat sometimes you know like fifteen or twenty but uh always cats in the house
we like we like pets
but uh you know you've got to deal with uh taking care of them and and feeding them and everything like that
and our kids are
and they're not not used to it you know on a daily basis
they they uh
oh from fourteen down to seven
he's about te- eleven weeks now
um i don't know how familiar you are with that area of the country
well that's yeah that's interesting
so it's really up north in the country really
well um my parents' house is like three miles south of where the mason-dixon line would have hit the ohio river had it continued that far
oh it's beautiful
uh well from my neck of the woods it's hilly
um you know uh maybe three hundred four hundred feet elevation uh
type variations from the valleys up to the hills the hilltops
um not a lot of farmland there
mostly it's uh
i mean you know there's you know individuals with their own own f- uh growing their own food
uh most of the agriculture it's more in the way of uh sheep and cattle
and even that's you know small time mostly
uh the biggest chunk of what's going on there is is uh industry
uh aluminum plants
what are you
uh just finished up my fourth semester
oh did you
well you've got some experience behind you in the work force
are you uh shooting for a bachelor's now or a master's or what
uh it seems to me from what i've been able to find out
it's nice and small which means you know if you don't get the class this semester then you've got to wait or three or four s- you know anywhere from two to four semesters to get
but uh i- it's worth it once you get it
and probably a good uh student teacher ratio and things
well i i was wondering what if you all were to get a pet like if you were to move into an apartment
or a house somewhere what would you get
uh well um first off we'd probably wind up with a a cat or maybe a puppy
i i i'm partial towards the larger dogs
um our last we've we've had a couple of cats before we moved on campus
uh had a hamster or two
and they they got
uh it's amazing how much character
uh you have got a pretty big family
and that is the hardest part about getting the fam- the stuff together
and everyone is spread out all over timbuktu
but most of us
well uh uh i am originally from west virginia
most of the family is right in the west virginia uh uh what they call tri-state area uh northern west virginia eastern ohio southwestern pennsylvania
but she is she is gone now
see that is kind of what happened with ours
so so to make one successful i mean i mean what do you all do
uh do you all start planning real far ahead of time
there is uh
so uh the day it happens is ninety-eight percent of the planning usually
uh we uh get together at the uh the park uh the uh the park and playground area of the church i was raised in and uh everybody brings lots of food
and some put up the volleyball net and sit around and tell stories and catch up and play volleyball all day and get really fat
it is a lot harder for us because we are like i said we are spread out and so we have to plan anywhere from six well really probably a year ahead of time so that everyone can uh start their uh vacation time
uh sat uh sunday afternoon or uh sometimes it has been like on a saturday afternoon
and most people do not have more than you know a couple of hours drive at tops to get there and back
is that one of your uh
i mean uh
well where i am calling from is southern mississippi
so we have got uh uh my wife and i have uh a bit longer ways to go than most
but you also manage to make them
uh actually we we have only made one of them since we got married about four years ago
but we are both in school
so that makes it kind of tough
they usually uh they have been happening uh just after the summer semester starts
and she took that summer off
well now that we have been talking about it i uh i am kind of getting home sick now
well my my grandfather is the only one that is still around
and see my grandmother is the one that use to plan this stuff basically
so unless the aunts and uncles really get on the ball and put stuff together it is kind of like
originally uh i uh was born in missouri
but uh you know we have relatives scattered out all over louisiana mississippi uh here in texas but it is harder for everyone to get in get home
well maybe this year you can find a more central location
well but the majority of them are in like just like how you said in close close quarters
so it is easier for us few stragglers to go home
you know our family right now uh the most of it there is only a few stragglers uh with any distance
there is one cousin out in colorado uh uh some cousins over in phoenix uh
i got a sister over in in uh washington state
uh the rest of them are within you know a couple hours drive
well uh how do you all communicate like to plan it and every thing
or do you all like mail out stuff
it is going to be such and such uh weekend
and uh you all come
and you know this is the standard pattern
and somebody brings the volleyball net
well uh uh i guess probably the last one i went to i met so many people that i had not seen in probably ten over ten years
and i am like no
i mean is that since
i mean do you have them every year
and uh still you wind up meeting people you uh you never knew you were related to let alone and
well i think that is probably why our is probably so interesting is cause we don't have them that often and then when we do and everyone finally does get together
it is like after the you know
so you have eight children
um what type of things do you do as a family to spend time together
oh we spend a lot of time outdoors jogging bicycling uh going to the park um some time watching v c r movies um generally cheap things
uh with lots of kids you don't have lots of money for recreation
well that's fun
so um let's see uh
and you may think this is funny
but one of our funnest games we like to play together is hide and seek
and that is so fun
um we like we do like to go to the park too you uh like your family
um we don't do a lot of vacationing
we get an occasional one or two day thing but most of them are going and seeing grandma and grandpa
oh now where do they live
oh so that's a bit of a drive for you there
oh so you like to go there for the holidays
oh we don't go very often for holidays
uh what are the ages of your kids then
so you have some in the nest and some out huh
and then they go down to four
i think the hardest thing for us has been is to find ac- you know leisure time activities that all of our kids can enjoy together with the age span that we have you know
like the older kids love playing board games and that kind of thing but the young kids don't understand it and so they get real frustrated when we try to do that
and then if you want to play something on the little kids' level then the older kids get real bored
and they want to do something else
i can i can relate to that
um do you feel that the current trend in families spending time together is a positive one or a negative one
we we have pretty much a a routine that we spend
we don't have our kids play with other kids on sunday and we just kind of keep them at home and our next door neighbor uh
and our next door neighbor was there
and somebody came up and asked if their daughter could spend saturday night at their house and she said no sunday's our family day
and i think those kinds of things are happening a lot where we are right now
i think it's gone to one extreme where the families were just running all different direction and i think more people are interested in spending time with their kids now
and i feel like you know like president bush bush has mentioned quite often that we are trying to become a kinder and gentler nation
and it does begin with the families at home and so i i'm a firm believer in that too
that's that's true
well we see that a lot out here in utah
and um hopefully hopefully it's going to spread huh
um do you have a lot of large families out there in texas
well out here in utah five is about the the average
so we get up occasionally
oh i have some relatives out there in texas
where where in dallas
well uh no
is is that close to dallas
it's i guess it's out there clear out
uh i like to uh play basketball and weight lifting
um so those are more or less indoor sports
um in in in the winter you typically it's it's probably too cold to go out and do things like tennis
um i like to play tennis in the summer time or in the spring fall
but in the winter it gets pretty cold
so it's mostly indoor sports i think in the winter
um how about yourself
i'm riding my aerodyne bike um half an hour every morning
and i'm just about ready to up it to up to forty-five minutes a morning
and i feel like that's been a real nice exercise in the winter time
it's it's kind of kept me from getting cabin fever and um has seemed to be a real nice aerobic exercise
do you do uh any anaerobic type weight lifting or weight training type exercise
i first of all i'd like to get my weight off
and so i'd like to get the weight off
and then i'd really like to get into that
and uh we have a my husband and i have a a aerobic video that's called the firm
but it's a an aerobic video with not necessarily bouncing around and jumping up and down
but you're using weights
and that is the most incredible aerobic workout i have ever done
it's it's really fun
it's it's it's aero- it's similar to aerobics with weights but it's like low impact aerobics just with weights
are you familiar with um step or bench aerobics
i mean yes
but i have never done it myself
in in atlanta that's um
that's the that's the in thing
that's the big thing huh
but now bench or step aerobics have kind of taken over
so how is that
um it they call it a low impact aerobics
and it's supposed to burn off more calories at the same time
and from when i've done it it does give you a good a real good
but only thing i'm concerned about is potential for injury to your knees you know that and movement of going up on the step you know that could create a problem
they they seem to think that it it won't
but you never know
now if um playing basketball are you knees
i i think my ankles probably are my main weak point
but i've i've kind of taken care of that
i wear high tops and then also an an- a support ankle brace which is very stiff and um we- wearing that i haven't had any problems in the past year or so
oh that's good
well that sounds you sound just like my husband
he he injured his ankle about seven months ago playing volleyball
and oh he's just had a heck of a time getting that ankle healthy
so that's what he does
he wears his his brace and his high tops
i did i injured mine so many times that rehabilitating became quite easy
i mean it would only take three or four days
and i could play again on it because after a while you just learn how to rehabilitate yourself to play that way
but um so how how successful is your exercise video
it is amazing how fast you take off the inches and i would once i start my forty- i'd like to do the forty-five minutes a day on the bike for a week
and then every other day i'd like to incorporate the video and then the bike on the other day
but it is really amazing how fast the inches come off
and the muscle builds real fast
um you can start
and then after that you can just start with your five pound dumbbells and then build up to your uh twenty-five pound dumbbells and then you're just doing repetitious exercises throughout the whole video
and it's a hour long video
so it's a good workout
so i'm looking forward to losing this weight and being firm and healthy
so in the winter i guess there's a lot of
um we could have been out walking throughout the whole winter because really we only had about three weeks of snow on the ground
so we're recording right now
and i'm melanie from harrisville utah
oh another one from a different state besides texas
it wasn't really a fa- a planning one
but it was kind of uh it was a birthday and i brought a lot of family together then
and how did you feel it went
i'm i've worked in hotels
so i i kind of know how to do these things
i used to you know
all this planning and and getting together and such
um oh let's see what else
and and it's all of like she she comes from a big family
and then all she has uh
i have like uh
and they show up and all their kids
so it's a pretty big reunion
oh my word
um the probably the biggest challenge was getting a place where everyone you know could eat comfortably and and everything uh
i guess probably the most helpful thing was that um for the rent we rented like a a rescue squad building or something like that
and uh each one of the everybody that showed up donated some money for the rent and for for like soft drinks
and and so nobody like really got stuck with the bill
oh that's good
and each person in the family you know brought a dish or something
and then did you have a main meal
or did everyone just bring
you know everybody brought their specialties i guess you would say
and of course my grandmother's food was as always gone first because she's such a great cook
uh she's eighty-six
is she pretty spry is she you know pretty
she looks probably like she's in her early sixties and if she didn't have arthritis she'd get around better than me as a matter of fact
and there were
we sent out five hundred uh announcements because our family is quite large like your your family there
and so that was a real challenge
and i was president of our family reunion for two years
and i wasn't very at that duty for two years in a row
but i found that advance planning was the key to success
uh also one thing that's helpful
and i don't know if your family's spread out or whatever but most of all my family lives like in the same county
oh that's wonderful though
but it's just kind of like get on the telephone
it's so and such days from such and such date and everybody just shows up
oh well that is that is helpful
our family ranges from oh goodness well australia
i have a brother lives in australia to uh boise idaho and and uh all kinds of places
uh my immediate family you know my my parents and my brothers and sisters i guess we're the ones that have the gypsy blood or whatever
because my dad was in the army
and we're we're pretty strung out all over
but since they've moved back to carolina's we still are the only ones do not live in in yantsen county
and then my my parents live in greenville
and i have one brother and his wife live in greenville and uh another brother that lives in outside of fayetteville
so i mean we're we're spread out
but everybody else is centralized in in my home town waynesboro
oh my gosh
well uh i mean i don't think that guns should be outlawed but it's going to
i mean all you do is to get guns and then like with the stuff of that massacre in killeen texas not too long ago
but i don't really know i mean unless they do uh just outlaw them how you can uh prevent that
well don't you think that you know just having you know some you know almost like a driver's license be required you know with stiff penalties if you are found with with you know a gun that is not registered or you know that you are not licensed to carry
well do you even know what the procedures are now
but it's kind of like if you want a gun you can get a gun especially if you have the money to pay for it
uh in most states as long as you aren't a convicted felon
you know or on probation or uh you know other obvious things like that
uh and i know i know that like in a lot of states you could you could be just like released from a mental hospital the day before you know be be obviously insane
and then you you know but have your legal right to get a gun
huh i didn't know that
well that's pretty scary
so does now do they want us to say where we feel about it like in rating it one to ten
i'd probably i'd probably say about a five
well i mean i mean i don't really know what they can how they can really enforce the laws any better because i mean i do think that some people need them and like for protection and stuff and i can understand them wanting to have them
but then again it's just like all those nuts out there
if you are looking at like you know country that uh where they do have a lot more gun control like england and places like that you know
well i mean yeah
the uh the
you know so it's it's really kind of a complex problem
well is the crime that bad there in atlanta
i've i've not really had that many problems with it
but i mean apparently we we were ranked pretty high up
uh i mean i think you know in the te-
i mean i think we have been like ranked in one of the top three for murders in the last few years
i don't know if dallas is in the top three but do you own a gun
if i get one i think i will probably you know get something
i would probably get like a shotgun
just for protecting myself you know from burglar type thing
you know and shotguns are really good because they're
i mean somebody is not going to break in steal it and you know use it to mug someone you know
uh and you know you
i just don't understand these people you know like when they they decide they're going to buy a gun to protect themselves
they go out and buy a three fifty seven magnum which is going to shoot through you know
and and they're going to shoot through five wall
and hit someone you know
i mean a shotgun just really struck me as being you know a real good defensive weapon
you can sort of point it somewhere in the direction of you know whoever
and you don't
then the actual shot doesn't go that far you know a wall will stop it pretty much
well now when i first moved to dallas i moved up here by myself
and uh my dad gave me a gun but i never did go out and practice with it enough to feel comfortable with it so i finally ended up giving it back to him
i don't want to be responsible for it because you know if you're not going to teach me how to do it and if i am not going to you know
that that really does scare me people you know that have guns
because you know if you ever get in the situation where you know you are not prepared to shoot
but you pick up the gun and point it at the person that that person rushes you
and they get it from you
and you know you're pretty much dead you know
because you you've just told the person that you you're about to kill them then
and and well i mean you you basically made it clear to the person that you know unless he unless you know that you are a real danger to them
and then you know if you if they manage to get the gun from you you know their first reaction is going to be you know stop you
well that's why i ended up giving it back to him
i thought well you know i don't want it if i don't know how to oper- you know if i don't really know how to use it and i just didn't want the responsibility
so well uh did you hear about that killeen massacre or whatever
the did it happen at a cafeteria or something
that kind of i mean it just makes you wonder how people get guns
so julie how do you feel about aids research
i think we need we definitely need more of it definitely
but i mean it seems like it just makes economic sense in that you know uh you know
it would have made even better economic sense to to to have had a lot more research than a l- l- longer ago
you know because you know because uh the country's going to wind up paying for the treatment of patients
does does like d- do health insurance policies like for companies and things do they cover diseases like that
but what they do is uh if you know you apply for for to get a a insurance policy they'll uh check to see if you're h i v positive
and if you are not only will they not give you uh a policy
but they'll uh they have like
there's like you know a database of people that have tested positive
so you'll never be able to get insurance ever again
um well that's but that's why they should have s- started doing stuff before
i mean still you know since it's dormant for such a long time there's still probably a lot of people you know before the tests ever really came out who are who are draining a lot of money right now you know
i think a lot of it was was just that you know becau- because of of the audi- you know because because the majority of the high risk groups were people no one really cared about
and all these god-fearing people were like well you know god is trying to kill off all the et cetera et cetera
one one one h- one humorous retort i heard heard someone you know who claimed that you know aids was you know god's punishment was that then lesbians must be god's chosen people
uh do you think d- you mean do you actually think we're doing enough right now to
i did i did like a research kind of thing on aids research and stuff
and uh really we're not doing much at all
i mean most of what gets raised i mean it's not really federal movement most of what gets raised gets raised by uh uh you know conscious yeah communities and things like that you know
like uh san francisco has a a real uh strong aids support group and all that kind of stuff
and and uh get they get donations from the community you know they're real
and from corporations around the around the city you know for aids research and that kind of thing
and uh i think there needs to be more of that sort of on a federal level you know rather than just in the places where it's you know where it's predominated so far because it's you know it's bound to spread
i mean it seems that you know it's just you know of it's just going to reach a steady a steady state a let a lot lot higher point than it will if we you know we'd nip it in the bud to q- quote barney fife
i i i don't know what the likelihood of that is
but i mean you know people really waking up
especially with the ultra conservatives move our our political system s- sort of seems to be taking
uh so do do you think it's more important to spend money on research or for support of uh people
uh i think i think one of the main things that's really important to spend money on is education not support or or research per se but but education because a lot of people sort of get drummed out of the work place and out of society you know kind of like lepers would you know and it's really it's really not necessary uh until until the disease reaches its final stage you know becomes really infectious and uh i think that would be the most effective support they could get is for other people to understand you know try to understand what they're going through and everything and try to understand that they're not you know they don't they don't have to be just completely
i guess i think that that uh
i think it's i think it stands a really interesting question of uh
well what do you feel about the um present situation in the mideast
well it looks like it's just about as volatile as it usually is
i think i think there's definitely been some changes um
and i think you know the the um end of the soviet union will definitely have it's effect on on the situation
um you know in that there's there's not you kno- there you know i- you know
basically since the end of world war two there was always you know that little proxy war going on
you know with um the u s funding israel and and the um soviet union funding the arab countries
and then we'll see what happens when uh they're not funded quite as much
but on the same token you know israel has lost a lot of their you know value to the u s in being you know the foothold of capitalism
you know in in the mideast
well i we tend to be pretty strong supporters of israel ourselves
you know we s- kind of cringe when they make mistakes but yet overall tend to support them
but i think one of the most interesting things to me recently was you know during the war
uh in uh kuwait was uh the fact that they did not retaliate
for the uh scud missiles that were uh launched there
that just seemed to me to be a uh a phenomenal uh demonstration of restraint
and it must have reflected uh uh some awful good uh diplomacy on the part of the u s
but on the other hand you know if they would have had a hard time retaliating because the you know they they wouldn't have been given access to the friend or foe codes
they basically would have you know had a had a f- they had they would have had had to fly through you know two enemies
oh you don't think they got the codes from the u s already
i mean of course you know public statements can be taken for
well what do y-
what about this situation with the you know the uh continual uh harassment by iraq right now and uh apparently failing to let the uh arms inspectors have free access
i pretty much question or what what the u s motives were in uh in in actually the original involvement
the cynical side of me says that you know it was more for uh the the domestic political situation than for anything else
you know and that you know and for portraying bush is a strong president
uh i mean i really i really think that that my gut feeling is that that you know he pretty much picked picked the fight with uh with um hussein
i mean i'm not not saying at all that hussein wasn't quite willing to ge- enter that fight
but you know i think i think that that um we chose to have our official feelings hurt
well do you think that uh we should ignore it and just allowed him to go ahead and uh
you know move on into kuwait and see what happens
i think i mean i thought i think that um in the past we've allowed lots of things like that to happen
and i i really don't i really don't think that
i think i think it was it was there were there were a lot more demographic related interests involved than true foreign policy interests
well may have been
you know i'm not saying that that's not the case uh
and i mean in in in along this line since since you know it it really it really didn't accomplish very much except we're getting getting uh the iraqis out of kuwait
i just don't i just don't i i i d- i i i don't foresee bush making the decision to invest a lot of manpower and money and you know in in fighting a second battle
um you know over over the uh over over what what probably won't accomplish him accomplish much for him politically
it doesn't look like we're getting ready to do to do much more in there
well what about uh
do you have any any views on uh israel's relation to the u s
think we ought to you know
or what do yo-
well i have i have very fixed feelings about israel
um i think that that for a long while we've we've had almost a you know ha- t-
uh anyway we're supposed to talk about recycling basically what what your personal opinion is on it
uh this is this is really for a speech research project they're doing
so uh i don't know
well they just kicked it off down here in in sarasota county
oh they did
uh you know which makes up a pretty small portion of the county actually
and uh they've got these i don't know what if you're familiar with sarasota county at all
they've got these wh-
it's it's county wide program now
and what they've done is they've broken everything down into garbage uh yard trash
plastic cr- cans and glass
and then uh paper
which in the paper it's just uh newspaper and corrugated cardboard
no slicks uh
oh that's that's good
in terms of you got to put everything in its own little bag and really presort it really you know tightly
but when i lived in orlando it's like you could put almost anything in there and they'd just sort it out for you
well you know uh i talked to this girl
who uh she's a an s- an acquaintance of mine
and and she's involved with uh
but it's the other big vitamin company shaklee
and uh and and she's just shaklee crazy you know because it's her business and everything
and and she asked me a couple of questions you know
and she and and what she said that that generally the problems that people have with being environmentally conscious is number one they don't want it to change their lifestyle and and like you know especially make it anymore complicated or any extra work or anything
which that's that's what recycling at home sorting does you know
i mean it's a little extra work
and uh it can actually turn out to be a lot of extra work because
and you set it out by the curb
uh or you can have bundles up to a certain weight and cer- certain dimensions tie them up and put them by the curb
well the plastic cans and glass they give you this little tub
and it's about a foot and a half deep
and it's about one by one and a half foot wide and long
and then they have another one the same size
and so like you know you would have to rinse out your pop cans
and you know and and if you've got uh food containers or anything like that it's a big problem
it is you know a big hassle
so not only do you yeah
i mean up here they give you one one of those containers
and you put everything in it
so it's like if if you use a lot of stuff you
it's like well you know if you're a partying kind of guy and you drink you know like a couple of twelve packs maybe over the weekend it's going to be hard pressed to p- to put all your recyclables in that one place you know
so it's kind of a pain in the butt
but uh i don't know
that's definitely one thing they could do to make it easier is to just you know
you have have those garbage people that make how every many make tw- twenty thirty bucks an hour
you know and and maybe come up with a better system
uh if you want to have a nice garbage can you know
and it's on wheels
and it's big
oh you can actually rent those
yeah up here the the city provides them
i think in i think in the city they do
but out here in the county you have to rent them
and they just add it on to your water bill or something
so where exactly are you in terms of of like sarasota
and sarasota is on the west coast
like south of tampa right
about an hour about an hour south of tampa
well i listen to this talk radio station down here
and it's really
but those guys they just kind of get into to s- s- stewing up trouble you know
but they get into some really good conversations sometimes you know
and some of it sometimes it's serious
and they have some good feedback and all that stuff
and from listening to that i kind of got an idea that i thought would be good with
and this kind of fits into the uh the aid program
and it's like uh
so uh what things do you consider an invasion of privacy
ooh well i don't know
oh i don't know
i was thinking of like uh
i was ju- started to think about all the big you know data bases they have with all the information about you on them like the credit reports and all those you know demographics studies that they do that
i don't know how much the stuff actually what they actually have in there
but i know they use that i mean they sell those
well what about uh required drug testing uh as a uh condition of employment
that was that that was the other one i was thinking of
i think that's uh
i mean i know drugs
uh i uh have worked at texas instruments
and uh they instituted a drug policy there drug testing policy where they randomly would test uh employees and actually to tell you the truth i really did not think much about it
i i hadn't you know
but there were some things that people brought up like well what happens if they they get a false positive you know what recourse do you have
and yet uh a lot of these large corporations such as texas instruments although they don't admit to it it's actually oh a drug testing policy comes about as a result of government pressure
although they don't actually e- execute it themselves it's really the government that
so in that sense it at least philosophically it's really borderline legal
and if they're you know if they're on some kind of you know contol- controlled substance then you know it kinds of takes away from the job of you know the supervisor or manager type person you know who is able to evaluate them
well what about this uh aids epidemic now
where you find that uh uh you know certain people are actually are are criminal in their disregard for it- others
and and uh of course the ultimate solution is to operate on their brain so that it doesn't
it uh it destroys their libido
now uh you know if they ever
i mean i've heard of things like you know making them you know marking them somehow or you know or something like that or you know putting them all someplace like in a kind of
so what about that as an invasion of privacy
wel- i guess it kind of borders on where i mean what do you value more the invasion of uh the person's privacy or the possible danger to you know other people
it i- gets to balancing uh personal freedom against uh the general welfare of society
i guess that's alwa- that's been the big role of government i guess
well it it's supposed to have been
well that's kind of a difficult one to go into
i mean that that particular case
because i mean there's a lot of people that uh i mean they could require you know
not a huge part but a you know the aids population i guess that have it that don't know they do are spreading it
but again to require you know such a test and jus- and then to make make it is to subject them to to discrimi- discriminatory practices and other things
uh i don't know how exactly i feel about that
i guess uh uh it's an easy one for me
i think that's uh there's something seriously wrong
what is it that you are you know particularly upset about
uh i guess uh i think they've lost their compass
and uh i'm not sure they know exactly what uh uh public education supposed to be for anymore
but uh i voted with my feet
and uh my kids go to parochial school
what do you feel that your kids are getting in the parochial schools that they wouldn't get in a the public school system
well one hundred percent of the uh customers care
and uh they uh take an active relatively active part
which uh i mean if you're uh sending two thousand dollars that way every year you uh watch what goes on and you uh uh pay attention and participate
and and you can influence the way things are
so you're saying that the taxpayer who also is really paying through the pocketbook for the education of the child may not be quite so conscious of the fact that they are paying the tuition for that child in the form of uh real estate or other taxes
and and consequently they're not so motivated to get involved and make sure things happen the way they'd like to see them happen
and uh uh i also think that one of the problems
and actually i don't think this i think this is a cultural problem
the uh problem with public education is really uh really a problem with the culture
and i guess my evidence for that is the school districts in places like california for example where only a minority of the taxpayers have children in school
and you can't get a tax levy passed
uh people are uh reluctant to pass uh school tax levies even uh when the money is needed or would be well spent because it's uh they don't have kids in the schools
i think that's a a loss of civic virtue and a loss of uh uh the cultural attitude that we used to have that education was first even if it wasn't our kids
i think that's uh that's the principal problem is that uh people no longer see it as uh as their problem
and there's an immediate problem
it troubles me too tha- that the priority seems to be with my particular purse strings rather than the public good
and by definition
uh it means that you've got to be informed
and you've got to have a certain level of education to do the reading and the critical thinking involved to come up with a decision
you know i i believe that the original idea of public education in the united states which i guess was controversial at the time of the constitution
uh you know it barely made it
i think the real the principal was uh education for civic participation
and you couldn't pull the wool over their eyes
and you'd think we'd notice it economic uh thrust
well that's exactly what i was going to say
and one is education for civilization
i mean and i think that one
and then i quit and got disabused of that notion
but uh the uh uh now the only thing people seem to agree on is that education is uh an economic enterprise to train people for jobs
and uh i'm not sure that people in the education establishment really know what their purpose is
and i'm really sad to say this
but i really think that uh the educational establishment has become part of the problem
and uh that's why i guess i'm sort of reluctantly uh in favor of these uh choice programs
well i i g- agree with everything that you've said so far
and the only that i'd want to add is that i'm a little more in contact i think with public school teachers than perhaps you are uh except as a parent of your child
and the sense that i get from public school teachers that i know is that they are very conscious of what they feel they should be doing
and they are the three things that you mentioned
but they find that they are also being asked to do a bunch of other stuff which they think is only tangentially related like consumer
oh you laugh
well twenty-seven up
and we had five
and how about yourself
i i'm sure there's a lot of differences in the way in the way it's done now and then
well when mine were growing up i did some traveling and but not that extensively
but i always just made it a point you know to spend about ten minutes with each one of them
so it was an hour you know
but whether it was going back and laying in bed with them and just shooting the breeze or whatever telling them stories or reading to them
so they were all real close
uh well qualify that
but that's uh
well both my husband and i work
and sometimes i feel like you know by the time i pick them up and get them home and get them fed i have very little time each evening
well that's plenty though
and well he spends a lot of time with them while i'm cooking
and then i spend time with them while you know he's doing other stuff
and and of course we try to spend a lot of time on the weekend
you know there's a lot of times my house may not be as clean as i particularly like it
but it's neat
and i can live with it because i do stuff with my kids you know
well you know with kids you're not going to have a neat house
well i've accepted that too
e- espec- especially with both of them working
and you just have to set the time and say okay this is going to be it
well that's true
and and we do a lot of that on the weekends you know
if my husband golfs you know he'll do it during nap time things like that where they're not really missing the presence you know
and and we do a lot of family things together
we're we're kind of going the other direction this weekend
well that's good too
well i decided that you know you need that once in awhile that you you need to plan the quality time
and and i do think that if you plan it and spend that and make it quality time you don't have to be there twenty-four hours a day
well that they say it it all it takes is about five ten minutes a day
and you know and as the kids got older i made them you know help me cut the grass and kind of made that a project too
and they think that's a family activity you know
and uh well yeah
but uh another thing we used to do is have ham- family councils
and what would you do
and we'd take turns being president
and everyone would get one vote
and i always thought we'd get outvoted five to two but it never worked that way
so they would just pick whatever issue kind of was at a head that week
well and we could bring up and we could bring up stuff too
and that was always good time
boy we really got to know the kids well
and i imagine you still have a very close relationship with them
in fact they were all in uh over the weekend for easter
oh that's wonderful
see i was raised in that type of family where you know you don't disobey me you mind me
but if you have a problem with what we did or how we did it you can always come back and talk to me about it
well we did too
and i remember the one daughter saying we had a a friend of hers that used to drive us up a tree and she said hey i don't make fun
so why make fun of mine
kind of r- kind of hit us between the eyes
but that that was always good quality time for us
and then never attend
but if if they missed it they had to abide by the rules
whatever was voted on huh
and boy they they'd show up
well i think that's great
and we'd usually take notes and you know the younger kids uh or maybe all of them needed help at one time or another
and uh but they were usually tougher on themselves than they were on us
and they loved it
i i think that's true
i can remember times my parents would say well what do you think would be a fair punishment
and we would always come up with something that was harder than what they would have done you know
so i do think it's right that they're harder on themselves you know
but uh boy i i feel for you and your husband
oh why is that
well my my uh two of my uh
uh i i don't see any problem with with testing for random drugs
i i myself almost uh am in favor of it
uh i work at honeywell
and i went through a a pretty i don't know i went through a standard drug testing thing before i i was brought on
uh i think it's important to insure the quality and and uh i don't know almost the goodness of character you know that kind of thing
uh well i'm a graduate student right now at carnegie mellon
and i i just came from saint paul
uh interviewing with three m
and uh they have a policy for uh testing
if you if they make you an offer then they'll test you right before you start
and i guess the only
and that that definitely happens you know
i mean those the drug tests sure they're accurate
but there's always that margin of error
and that's that's something to be aware of
another thing is a lot of times you know they aren't that accurate
like if you're on a prescription drug of some kind you know what are they going to do about that
you know i was on a couple of different prescription drugs when i was tested for honeywell
and uh uh you know i know they didn't catch that or else they would have said something
uh i'm sure they screen for just a particular few types
although the literature they give with you says yeah we do this
and then they list about five thousand drugs they try to test for
uh i don't know
what what program are you in over at carnegie mellon
uh electrical engineering
and this is actually a
but uh they uh even for interns they they do the whole random drug or the whole drug testing thing
they test you uh before they before you start or before you even interview
uh they essentially
they essentially uh they essentially uh made me the offer and then and then uh did the drug testing thing after that
so uh it was one of those things where you go through the the general battery of all their tests
and and then they essentially give you the offer and then at that point they'll they'll ask you to go to a drug testing and things like that
so uh there's some noise on this end
you probably wondered huh
wh- what happens if you were to fail
then do they give you like one ch- one more chance or two more chances
i believe from what i remember of the literature they gave uh if you fail i believe they give you one more chance
but uh you know once again those things are not that accurate
so there's undoubtedly a proportion of people who do fail you know
but uh wha-
i'm just about to finish my master's in may and uh just interviewing with companies right now
that was the first time i'd ever gotten any kind of drug screening you know was was going to honeywell
and he's doing an internship with i b m
and uh they basically uh did the same exact thing
uh we both got our internships at the same time
and we both had to go through drug testing
so one of those things where we went through a kind of an identical process
did do they test you at right now at work too
that's one thing they don't do is is drug testing while you're on the job
uh i think i think the unwritten rule is yeah expect it
but they don't do it
you know so that's good i guess
i mean i uh i have gone to a couple of parties since since that time
and while i don't do any drugs myself i've seen some people who work there uh you know smoking a joint or whatever
and uh you know that's the kind of thing that would definitely come up you know
they don't they don't really do that
uh first um i need to know uh how do you feel about uh about sending uh an elderly uh family member to a nursing home
well of course it's you know it's one of the last few things in the world you'd ever want to do you know unless it's just you know really you know and uh for their uh you know for their own good
i'd be very very careful and uh you know checking them out
she had a rather massive stroke about uh about uh eight months ago i guess
and uh we were i was fortunate in that
i was personally acquainted with the uh people who uh ran the nursing home in our little hometown
so i was very comfortable you know in doing it when it got to the point that we had to do it
well i had an occasion for my mother-in-law who had fell and needed to be you know could not take care of herself anymore was confined to a nursing home for a while
uh it had to be done in a hurry
i mean we didn't have you know like six months to check all of these places out
and it was really not not very good uh deal
and she was able to to return to her apartment again
but it's really a big uh big uh
decision as to you know when to do it
you know is there something else we could have done you know in checking out all the places that uh might be available
of course you know there's not one on every corner
especially you know smaller areas
probably the hardest thing in in my family uh my grandmother she had to be put in a nursing home
and um she had used the walker for for quite some time probably about six to nine months
and um she had a fall
and uh finally uh she had parkinson's disease
and it got so much that she could not take care of her house
and uh that was even harder actually
because it was you know it was just a change of change of location
and it was very disturbing for her because she had been so used to traveling
i mean she tr- she had she had children all across the united states and you know she spent nine months out of the year just visiting her children
and um that was pretty heart-rending for her
i think when she finally came to the realization that you know no i cannot i cannot take care of myself
i mean for somebody who is you know for most of their life has has uh not just merely had a farm but had ten children had a farm ran everything because her husband was away in the coal mines
and you know facing that situation it's it's quite a dilemma
my mother excuse me
well my uh my uh
i think that they they had a great deal of um
and they actually had a conference
and i mean it was just it was probably one of the most strengthening things for our family getting down together and doing that
and and just the children were involved in the decision because it involved just them
and you know making that decision and then finding a place
and everybody had duties to perform
you know whether it was just you know giving money or whether it was actually taking part in a lot
of the decision making you know
they and well they had well they had they had seen it coming
i mean it
i mean i i i i har- i i truly wish that if something like that were to happen that my children would do something like
unfortunately a lot of times it responsibilities like that seem to fall to you know maybe one child in the whole family you know
well we we
and uh it's usually not a very smooth smooth thing
we were i was lucky too that i only have one brother
and uh fortunately we agreed you know on exactly you know what we thought should be done
my mother also was very very independent
she had her own still had her own little house and still driving her own car
we were lucky in that in one respect in that after she had her stroke she wasn't really you know really much aware of what was going on
that nursing home life would not have been you know anything of her choosing
of course she would she would not have been happy there at all
but as it turned out the stroke took care of that concern for us
well with my with my grandmother i think it was it was such that uh that she did not have the problem with
and her daughter came and visited her at least her daughter
and i think that when she passed away it was probably one of the greatest
i mean but she was truly she was truly aware
i mean i i i di- i don't know how i would how i would deal if one of my parents came with with alzheimer's
that which is which is far more devastating
and um i i i think that what one thing that they were concerned probably was the fact it wasn't necessarily you know like the quantity of care but the quality of
that the people that worked there were very were very interested that to make it as close a home environment
i think i think i think you know for myself i i see that as probably the the what everything would hinge upon
that's the that's probably the major question
i think that great strides are being made nowadays in in caring for the elderly you know in several in a in a whole lot of areas
you know it's it's interesting that that a lot the population of the united states is changing because you know uh now that so many more minorities where they have had extended families for such a long time
um matter of fact in the united states we used to have extended families
but i guess as we become more industrialized and more you know less in a rural situation we we don't we we we choose not to deal with the
people things are scattered so much nowadays
i i i think that perhaps perhaps the extended family you know that it maybe one of the solutions to a lot of things even child care
you know i mean of course there there comes other issues you know whether or not any of the grandparents
i mean they raised us after all
but uh i i i think that you know we always uh i mean i've i've had a lot of good experiences with uh with many many people especially where they've had uh extended family
and i and i i kind of see that that you know perhaps you know we may need to like get close to the family environment and and get down to the values of you know
i mean uh it's
with with with with what's going on today
and i i think i think that we may not that may be you know perhaps if we put money on the back burner that may that may choose to alleviate a lot of the problem
i mean we may not we may not have as high a standard of living but the qua- but actually have a truer standard of living
well i guess that was it
well the first thing for me is i wonder i see a couple of different ways of talking about what privacy is um if privacy is something that disturbs your private state i mean an invasion of privacy is something that disturbs your private state
and if privacy is something that comes into your private state and extracts information from it in other words finds something out about you that's another
and the first kind of invasion of the first type of privacy seemed invaded to me and very much everyday in this country
but in the second time at least overtly uh where someone comes in and uh finds out information about you that should be private uh does not seem uh um obviously everyday
i i think i agree with that
i think in a good example on the typical thing that happens uh when the phone rang
and it's t i calling
and then i realize oh no this is something i solicited
so my immediate reaction was one of that sense of invasion
but after that i realized no i i really wanted this
and it was sort of exciting
that was almost an example of s- an invasion that turns out to be not invasive
it turned out to be uh uh an invitation
uh and at the same time i think that i receive on on the order of uh probably seven or eight a week calls of the nature where one wishes that there were a convenient way to just hang up on it
from from personal parties or from these um phone answer phone uh
sol- solicitations primarily
oh that that's a remarkable number
and i'm still astounded that that one they let anyone do them and two that they have any effect in this whatsoever
um because i'm usually so insulted by them i just hang up as soon as i recognize what
i think they prey on people's um inherent politeness on the phone even with the machine
and then they feel an obligation to respond even though there's not even a person there
and i think that's what makes one feel invaded is the fact that there seems to be little control
and you one's feeling obligated
because of some sense of of the way the ritual is played out
and and uh that that then ends up being the the most common example for me
um i guess i'm not typically feeling invaded in my privacy relative to this second this one that you raised
and i don't think i would have thought about that
i don't typically feel intruded on on the things uh the sense of finding out information
well presumably those who find out such information if they are doing it i would prefer to not to be known
and i mean you know the classic oh i don't know c i a conspiracy theories or whatever would have such parties trying to do it without your knowledge
and i can't talk about the second one other than to to to generate paranoia
to to surmise it is there
i don't think i'd like the k g b is monitoring my phone or anything like that
well i guess although i well that's a good point where you said that how does one define what invasion of privacy is
because uh if that's the case of a tree falling in the forest
and i'm not feeling invaded then maybe my privacy hasn't been because i have no sense of my privacy state having been invaded
if your defining it in terms of information gone even if it's something you don't know about it well then i guess one could assume one was invaded
but i don't feel invaded by it
uh i guess it comes from a sense of fact or facts
and if someone finds out something about me that is true i i don't have a sense of loss from that
well you must have a relatively clean conscience then
ev- more harmed or something
that would be an example where my sense of threat would be high because i would find that there be cou- a good possibly that their facts were were fantasy
and then i would feel not only invaded in the sense that someone had obtained information from a that i would rather they didn't
and that might be the sense of the spending pattern for instance
that that i would have thought to be private
but then if it turns out to generate incorrect things that's even worse
so or if my call rate of of eight t- or so a week went up even higher because
uh someone had had
and the person who had takes unsolicited phones calls and pays money
and then all of
and um one of the problems with the lotus data base was um that it was uncontrolled access to who would have that information
i mean they said they would give it out to only select companies
but um you know just like software is only given out to customers
i mean you can't believe that
and they wouldn't bother to check that carefully anyway to someone who's offering you know full cash price
i mean you know you can't tell it what a company really has to do with it
and there's something rather ominous about having virtually anyone any hacker being able to know what your income is what your spending habits are
and you know and and that hacker just has to get in to in touch with the sneak thief
and suddenly and then what started as an invasion of privacy can be an invasion of your actual home
and i guess that turns out to be the basic problem with any invasion of privacy is whether or not you're feeling
threatened as a result of of it
maybe that is a a little bit of what privacy is
i also thought about it was of uh waiting to talk to you that another thing that occurred to me is there is not so much invasion of my privacy because i know how to behave such that there isn't
but i realized i have to behave in a certain way in order to not have people invade my privacy
and i realize that that i mean i can take that for granted
but i used to i used to live in india
and things are quite different there in terms of that
oh that's interesting
but but no concept for wanting to be private
it's it's generally being alone is not a very desirable state at least officially
um so there's not
i mean doors don't have latches on them
you people walk in out
and as a as a westerner in india and i was often surprised
that that would be that would be culturally shocking
you know it very much is
but on the other hand i realized i could go out on the street and act like a complete lunatic
and people would leave
whereas in this country where everyone respects the closed doors very much if you go out and then act like the lunatic you you violate the uh the norms of social of um public behavior
um people start paying attention to you very much
and they start asking questions and in the sense are invite- invade invading your privacy although if you know what the social norms are you know quote unquote you asked for it
but it does mean that you have yet another reason to follow a set of social norms
and which isn't of always the case in all cultures
and it wasn't until i was thinking about it just now that i realized that's actually something that's culturally relative
tha- that is true
and and that it's fascinating to to think a lot of someone who doesn't know how to say private
and that's really um
well i mean i i wonder how people have sex
i mean they a-
and it's obvious you know the results of sex are quite obvious
um but i i just don't quite um
because anyone can be alone for some period of time
but for me a lot of what i do requires a sense that there's this invisible barrier around me which people wil- will respect
and if that's gone um i i really don't know how to live very well
and i wonder i really do wonder how people do that
are th- are there any other specific things that that you feel like where where you feel your privacy to be invaded on a day-to-day basis or either on a growing frequency
all the class- the other classic examples the jehovah's witness or or mormons or someone knocking at the front door um which is more intrusive because i have to really tell someone to go away
and there's that sense of i have now opened my door they now see what i look like what i live like
and nor- and they're doing something that normally i really only invite
because i any anyone any friend anyone i give my number to is welcome to call me
but no one is just welcome to come by my house
so that is more of a sense of invasion
so that's another example of the invasion because of the not so
have you all been able to do much as uh as a full family these days all of you
we've uh been um we've gone other you know all kinds of places
and uh you know
or we you know we do everything we can possibly as a family
an an then uh you know my husband enjoys spending time with the kids you know
he'll he'll take them out just to be with them
so he they can have time with him an
so you have a break too
so and we uh we try to teach our kids as much as we can at home you know we have we try to spend like monday nights we call it family home evening
and have our kids uh you know have little lessons with them and you know just see count see how things are going in our family and you know teach them about their grandparents or something like that bring out pictures of them so they get to know them
and we just do all kinds of fun things like that
so they you know the only way they know their grandparents is by pictures
and phone calls that's about
and uh you know they we you know we go to the park
or we go in the backyard and sit down
that's wha- yeah that's what we mostly do pretty simple things
she she's really getting to the age where she's playing
and with you know me being at home and just having the one income you know you don't have this lot of extra money to to do a lot of you know extra things
so you you make more fun than you know
you know the kids just think it's wonderful just maybe to go get an ice cream cone or
oh that's a big thrill for them
yeah or uh you know go get a bag of m and m's or something like that
they they think that's a lot of fun
so we just we try to spend as much time as we can
we you know
our our whole weekends are divi- are devoted to our children except for we might go out you know one evening or something
but during the day you know it's all devoted to our kids
and they come go to church with us
have um have you ever been to the science it's called the science place
we ju- we haven't lived here too long
and we went there a couple of weeks ago
i is i'm not sure which one we went into
the one we went in had uh
the thing that sticks out most in my mind is that like a kids place area
that really seem they really seemed to go wild in there
and uh there's uh there's some petting you know like uh uh
i think it's owens country farms has a free petting you know like a farm that you can go to
and the kids can pet animals and stuff
uh it's like in richardson you go up plano road
it's like a little bit past campbell and plano road
and that's a lot of fun
and uh the kids think that was a lot of fun too
oh that does sound like fun
we take you know whenever we take them to showbiz
or they think it's wonderful just to go to mcdonalds you know
they go for the to play around
and it's a indoor fun park
and it has a bunch of different rides for kids
and parents get in free
and it's like during the week
it's like five dollars admission per child all day
and and you said about plano and campbell is the petting
and the one in mesquite is uh scyene exit
and it's it's uh
they you know you just pay that admission
and then all the the the rides are free
you know of course they have all the little video games and you know those little quarter rides you know to and stuff like that
an i think that was better than like showbiz pizza cause there's more for them to do
because they can just do
so they had a lot of fun
well i've gotten some good ideas from you
i we try to do a lot of things as a family and you know inexpensively as possible
well i think i don't know if we've done five minutes
but i'm sure that will be good
well it was good talking to you
oh no problem
well take care
well um with credit cards is me i uh i try to get maybe just one or two
i don't i don't like having credit cards for every store
i i uh i just don't like them
um i don't know if i'm really afraid of spending too much
i just uh don't think that i need them you know
uh they are tempting at times
but i i just you know sometimes i just don't like everybody knowing everything about me you know
well that's very can be very very true
so and th- you know everybody just gives you a credit card just so you'll spend money
well that's the idea
see they make money off of it whether you use it or not
well the other thing of course is the fact that they hope
i use mine a great deal um for groceries for everything that i can and
oh you have
um four and two and half
oh boy those are two very active ages
um i'm i'm like you
i i use my only use my credit card for um you know when i you know
and then but i don't charge anything that i can't payoff at the end of the month
well uh do you uh do you ever use the a t m machines
but uh i take the checkbook
so i you know i just if i need cash i just tell him
and he gets it out
and i don't even think i know my number
see we he couldn't do without it h- but you know since he can just do it right there at work
oh that helps
well the the other thing some people are not aware of is they will use their a their credit card like their visa or their mastercard for cash and when they do that they begin paying interest right from that very day on
and that's kind of silly
because they they figure that that's correct
and uh during that whole month and
i mean i get i get at least one or two a week
people t- you know sending me a credit card or calling me on the phone and i just say i don't want it
well i think that's the only thing you can do is just say no and mean no and
i'd like to know where they determine that i'm such a good credit risk that they can go and say you get this much credit line you know
well it's interesting uh that uh
people have the generally the same view
and then some people they get so wrapped up in them that they find you know one day they find wow i didn't realize i had this much you know i'd spent this much money
and then they can't meet the minimum monthly payments on it
well and some people use one credit card to pay for another credit card they own
and i mean that does nothing but exacerbate the entire problem
it does because you're you know you you're you know you're just co- costing yourself more money because you if you can't make the monthly the minimum payment you're paying interest
well it's been enjoyable talking with you
it's enjoyable talking with seeing that somebody feels the same way
well take good care
you you too
oh you found that out tonight
but there are some others out there that i don't believe deserve the money they're getting
well isn't it funny how baseball's getting less than like football players would
and they play a lot they play a lot longer season too
and a lot more games right
but i think let's see
i mean i know yankees have won a lot games
and we had made a list of all these uh baseball teams and the cities that they were from
and i don't even know where i even put that paper
the oakland a's and i think it was i don't think it was an all california baseball
well that's what i did when i was growing up
but i think i think the rangers need to go
and i think the pirates will go
and uh let's see
every once in a while i i like to go on the nights when there's not anybody out there not very many people out there
sometimes when i if you go out there during the day you just fry under the sun
and do you know anything about that new stadium
that that huge
and it's going to have little shopping centers in it and little like a lake or something running through it
and uh they're going to try to make it a real community center out there
and your going to be able to buy your
what was no wait about the liquor
that's that's in uh texas stadium where the football players
and they're never going to let liquor in there
well they're trying
but they try every year
and every year they get thrown out
but they don't they don't allow you to sell it don't allow them to sell it there
but uh that new stadium's going to be real nice
and i heard that there's uh that you can bid on that stadium
last night on the news i heard that they said you could you could bid on the stadium to have it named after you
and it's going to go to the highest bidder
so that could be your you know fifteen minutes of fame
well where are you
oh you are
my h- my husband teaches in plano
oh what's he teach
so what do you do
but i teach for dallas
oh you do
i mean it's good because they they try new things you know
but it's like they'll try something
and then they throw it out and get something else you know
and you get tired of that
that's that's i think it's going to be any where you go
well but they can't be though
but the politics the politics gets worse in the small towns sometimes
oh man in dallas you don't even know who's in in administration
you don't even know who to payoff huh
and you don't know what they're there for you know when they're coming how long they're going to be
oh how funny
you know it's just there they are
and they're writing the whole time
and i finally just got to where i go okay i'm debbie moore you know may i ask who you are and what you are in my classroom for you know
because you know you never know where they are going what they'll report
and you hope they're telling you
and you never see it
oh it is
how long you taught taught in dallas schools
uh this is my eleventh year
ugh that's about uh ten too many
and all i do is teach reading all day long
and it's just ten children at a time
oh well that's not bad
and you've got a lot of federal money too
but hasn't it changed a lot over the years
or working in the system
and i said okay i want to see a curriculum guide you know
so i'll know what i'm suppose to teach
and they go we don't have one
and so i go okay i mean you just you did
you don't know which is you don't know which is worse
so how long are we suppose to talk for
well you can talk for ten minutes
but you don't have to
oh you can
if you talk to ten then they come ov- on and say oh you've extended your limit
and please say good-bye within the next five seconds
oh i haven't ever talked that long
well you know i hadn't either till last night i was talking to this retired administrator from cleveland ohio
and we started talking about gangs you know
but she was real interesting
and then tonight this woman called
th- yours is my second one
so hers was the first one i got gotten
and uh and she was telling me all her problems you know
and it went over ten minutes
did she did she did you all not talk about the topic at all
but the topic was boring i thought
what would you serve uh if you were having a dinner party
oh gosh all the other
it was um about movies you know what have you seen at the movies lately and stuff like that
so that was real good to talk about that
have you seen like uh silence of the lambs
the last one i saw was dances of the with the wolves wolves
and he he said he didn't think it should have gotten all those awards he thought it was too long
oh i enjoyed it
i mean it was just more for my money
uh he said after about the first hour he started looking at his watch
and how old are your kids
and one is eleven
it's it's not it's not too cool for kids
you know they've got it all figured out
well and ninja turtles
but most of the time really we watch them on the video
well heck that's a lot cheaper then uh
especially if you get them for a couple of nights you don't have to watch them all in one ni- one time
and they're cheap
and nobody has got them yet
we saw um heroes have always been cowboys tonight
and i felt like it kind of got chopped off at the end you know
it just it
it one of those movies it's not going to be around long
see i do that to make myself go to sleep at night
oh my mom and dad read all the time
well i was reading the book
and it's called shoeless joe
and then i was um i decided well i like this author
so i got a uh book of his short stories
and that's been real good
who is the is the author
don't don't ask me
quite a quite a bit
but you know in the movie the guy was black
see i never even heard that there was a book tied in with that movie
well do you think we covered baseball
well have a good night
so who's your uh favorite team
the dallas cowgirls huh
i mean you know
well i mean you know i think uh once jimmy johnson gets his system established uh they'll do all right
as long as troy ot- aikman doesn't get hurt again
so i don't i don't even know who your favorite team is actually
and they haven't been doing too hot
in fact in fact the cowboys got the best end of that deal
well he was a good player i guess
well i don't know
well he could always get past you know he'd get past like six or seven tackles and just keep spinning around and get on into the end zone
but um i guess you never could really see him play because with the cowboys while he was with the team the rest of the team was pretty poor
so you couldn't really tell if it was just him or the team
and i always just assumed that he was too good for the rest of the team
but i don't know
well who's the running
or is it emmett smith
did he did he actually play in the pro bowl
i remember he was like a backup
and then somebody got injured
and he was supposed to go
i kind of i haven't been keeping up with football i mean in the fall
i i can go on and on about football
but since it's kind of off season it's kind of hard to think back about all that
who else is uh oh
there's you know mike
so and th- and he was trying to keep uh uh
um i have no idea
but uh i don't know
did they did they make it to the play-offs at all
well they started out really bad
they went like one and six
and then they won five or six in a row
so they were in a shot to make the play-offs
and they screwed up the last couple of games
kind of like the cowboys huh
and the cardinals were kind of like the cowb-
and the cowboy cowboys came on strong at the end of the season
and the cardinals got killed by the cowboys
well the cardinals i don't know
i think the cowboys probably have a a better team
at the end of the season the kind of got messed up with aikman getting hurt because uh laufenberg just couldn't ever really get it together at all
oh don't made any excuses for him
well i'm just saying i shouldn't i shouldn't blast him like that say oh well laufenberg got out there and blew it for them
i mean he didn't get to see much action but too bad
because now now you know he had a shot and and didn't look too good
and so no one's going to have much faith in him any more
i haven't uh i haven't kept up with it lately
but i remember reading something a few months ago about them signing somebody else on or or trying to go after somebody or trade for somebody
but it wasn't anybody i'd really heard of
but i heard on the radio this morning or yesterday morning that uh aikman's back in practicing doing real real well
um who is it michael irvin he said that uh aikman was hitting him right on the numbers every time
so sounds like he's going to be all right for next season
they're just trying not to overwork him right now until he gets his shoulder uh back in shap-
i think it i think it was his shoulder he had surgery on
but anyway they're trying to keep him you know keep him uh from reinjuring anything but anyway
but uh well i got my thirty day notice yesterday
um i'm done where i work
so anyway i guess we can't talk much more about that
but i just thought i'd throw that in there
maybe i'll call you back after after the recording is finished
actually i think we have talked about football for five minutes
so i guess we should talk about football a little bit longer just to be sure we got five minutes in
so other than the vikings who do you like
um actually when i was younger i was a cardinal fan too
oh of course
other than that i mean you know when i've you know when you grow up in a city that has the you know one of the greatest football teams until the last few years you kind of tend to get caught up in it
well the cowboys were th- america's football team
i mean it it was really exciting
growing up when when the cowboys were really big
because my parents would always have season tickets
and they'd go to all the games
and you know the hype were just unbelievable
it's just you know the last oh
but you know i'm just used to always growing up and hearing cowboys cowboys cowboys and you know super bowl and all this other stuff
so i can't you know
i mean i think they'll pull out of it
and you know they'll they'll wind up being good again
they've got some lot of really good young players that are going to that are going to uh do pretty good i think
so they're banking on doing good next season
see they they sectioned it out even more
they used to just have like uh
and then they sectioned it out to end zone and then everything else
and now they're sectioning it off to like from the from one twenty yard line to the other one
and then the next highest price is that same area but above it on the upper level
and then like from the twenty to the ten yard line
and then they're some sections kind of in the corner areas
and then the cheapest of course is going to be the end the direct end zones
but um they have about four or five different prices now
but obviously yeah they're all going up more or less is what it's going to do
so now the tickets even got lower than the lowest one last year
um you know i'm not sure
i didn't i didn't really think about that
but not that i'll ever go
las- time last time i went to the cowboys game was during that um n f l strike or the when they had the scab team teams in there
and it was the uh dallas and washington redskins game
and i went because my dad can usually get a hold of some free tickets because a lot of those doctors have season tickets
and they um if they're not going to use them they'll give them to somebody else
so my dad i went with my dad to a game that one time
but that wasn't a real you know
it was it was the scab teams
it was kind of you know it was kind of different i guess
and before that it's been quite a few years
i just never never have gotten around to it
so maybe this year
um what do you do this weekend
well uh pretty much spent most of my time either in the yard or at nurseries buying stuff for the yard
huh which is
wh- d- what do you plan have planned for your yard
well uh we just bought our house uh last july
and it's it it the house is forty years old
so there's there's an established lawn and whatnot flower beds things like that
but they've uh they've gone a few years of neglect
so we're in the process of uh revitalizing the whole situation
we've got um different flower beds in front and uh a window box a built in window box um trying to get some color back in those get the trees trimmed up uh get rid of a few weed problems and things like that
uh i live in dallas
and we're going to be getting some wheel h-
uh the place we've been living at it's uh we're we're just leasing it
the in plano and the soil has so much has such a high clay content
that uh uh i went to use my dad-in-law's tiller and it about for my arms off
i mean just just scratching two or three inches was just a chore
it was it was
and then when it gets wet you know you don't even want to get out in the yard
but um i don't know what what i-
um where you live is there a real high uh alkaline or ash content
ac- actually it's done uh
it's in the north end of oak cliff in uh kessler park area
and uh we've got about
we've we've got mayb- maybe eight to eight inches to a foot of soil
and then it's solid rock from then on down
it's uh a little aggravating
we can't we can't put in anything too big um as far as uh shrubs and things like that because they've got to get a chance to find the find the cracks in the rock
is it is it limestone under underneath
it's it's solid limestone
uh you just we're just happy that there's trees already there so far
um anything like that is is a uh major undertaking i guess uh
sprinkler systems or anything uh start to get real expensive because there's an awful lot of work that has to be done chopping through the rock
and it you know no-
and it makes it makes for a a different challenge
well i i moved to dallas about five years ago
and uh i never really messed with anything uh gardening or anything like that until now
but uh i i keep hearing all the stories of of different parts of town
in fact uh we even we were at the farmers market yesterday and bought a few tomato plants and things like that
and the first thing the the old guy there at the stand asked is what part of town we lived in because he said uh i've got i've got a dozen different varieties
and each one works in one part of town
and that's it
we we tried planting tomatoes last year
and it they they turned out pretty poor
i just i wi- i just wish i'd known the
but it it's amazing we also have roses
and i mean they just grow so beautifully
in fact we put in some uh some more roses yesterday
like what um what type roses
uh different uh a few different uh hybrid tea type varieties
oh hybrid teas
we we have a few uh of the real short stem
they're kin- they're kind of like the bush roses
but uh i don't know i think it's i think it only has about five or six more years to go because it's a it's a really old bush
and but i i i'm amazed because the sun is so intense
and the roses just seem to survive just fine there
that's we that's what we're searching uh
we've got we've got all the different lake editions around the house
and we're we're kind of experimenting right now
we do we've got the direct sun in front
and the backyard has two great big uh spruce and and an oak tree all about forty to fifty foot tall
so the backyard is just complete dark all day long
and uh we're
have you have you uh done um done a lot of tree surgeon work on your trees or not
they're they're in pretty good condition
uh we've been we've been pretty lucky on that
just if you want a lot of you know light for underneath
that may be the all right because we had because we have some we have some old fruit trees
so we may just be getting rid of that
but but our peaches they they seem to be doing just fine
but they they really need pruning
it just seems like they that that even you know pruning once a year is really not enough
but the the way they behave
but uh but uh what kind of uh what kind of what kind of grass are you growing
it's uh bermuda
oh i've i've been trying uh uh a mixture of uh the bermuda and the rye
but i may be working like a fescue in because of you know the type of weather
it seems that uh bermuda's bermuda's fine
but um it looks like it would hold the soil
but it really doesn't
a lot of a lot silt that comes in it just doesn't seem to hold it very well
but uh but the rye does really well especially during the wintertime
but uh but boy once it gets over seventy seventy-five degrees that it just dries up
there's such a there's such a difference
through the year uh
my my parents-in-law they're they're building a house into the side of a hill um
well it's already been built and everything
but uh this is out in west texas
but the the wind there has been so bad that i mean they've tried to plant grass
and they just
they just so they just washing uh watching their lawn just blow away
but it's it's quite an undertaking
on a on the side of a hill
you can see the house from you know miles away
but it's you know it's a pretty neat little job
they save a lot of they save a lot of energy
but just uh you know for them i mean they they're going to have to start gardening
and they said well we just plan on spending the rest of our lives just
they have have the all they have are me- uh mesquite and cottonwoods
and uh it's it's all on lake greenbelt
and uh i don't know that what they have
they can they can actually they can pump water
i mean they have to get permission
but they can pump water up from the shore
but uh that's for like an additional
they have to pay like some kind of fee per year
but uh they're uh right now though i think they're just they're trying to get the trees planted and everything
but man i i just think of all of the money that they that they're going to have to spend just getting that
but the taxes alone there lake greenbelt
and some places they they they really nail them for tax
and i mean your talking what just several hundred dollars a year in property taxes
it's it's ridiculous
it it would
because even though it's far out there it's just that lake greenbelt you know they have to they they try to do it just from the selling the water
but um the water usage you know they try to limit even though there's three or four streams that flow into it people still use it enough in like in towns like clarendon and other areas that where they irrigate
the ir- irrigation because it's gotten so bad the past few years
but i don't know
and just the air is so dry
my father-in-law says the mesquite trees are they're they're pretty smart
they don't they don't even start growing until may may or april like after it's been raining for a few months
so that's all they work on
that's something i've been uh been looking around and noticed all the flowering trees and stuff are
and you know we're trying to decide what what to what to put on one side of the house and things like that
but there's so many things that they they last for just a couple of weeks
and then it then it's just a a bush there from then on
it's kind of it's kind of disappointing
i i don't know
my my wife and i we planted on the on the south side of our of our house we planted some gardenias
and they did real fine during the summertime
but during the fall when it stopped when uh the rain let off just a little bit it i mean it just dried up
and uh so i guess it these plants they just they don't
well how how do you feel about the immigration laws
currently i think they are a little restrictive uh particularly for uh certain ethnic groups or from certain countries
um i think we should permit uh more immigration from eastern europe for example uh particularly the uh
i think we could permit more of them in than we have permitted in the last uh several years
and i think we have uh uh too much restriction on the uh on the orientals also
but of course that's just my opinion
well we seem to uh to favor certain uh uh countries particularly south american countries
i have nothing of course against uh the uh the south americans or uh or hispanics in that sense
but i think we uh are more restrictive of the uh so called eastern uh european countries than we uh we should be
well i'm not real sure why i got this topic because i don't think i checked it off on the list oh
and uh so i think uh you know the uh embargo we placed on the uh on the russian jews although we of uh spent years and years uh lobbying for their release and their ability to um immigrate from russia as soon as that occurred we
and i still think
you know again kind of having uh uh within this century come from a uh an immigrant family or immigrant families on both sides
so i'm a little touchy
well uh my uh my family is from uh europe from well from england and ireland and uh have been in this country for oh more than a hundred and fifty years almost two hundred years
so i don't have any any uh relatives that i am or or uh several generations back that i am familiar with their names and how they fit into the family
they were all they were all born here so i don't have any real strong ties with any with with the immigration laws
i don't because i don't i don't have any personal feelings about them
and i haven't taken the time or effort to learn what they are
well i think in a way though uh uh i also have uh an
again again that was you know
my grandparents came over during the time when uh there were quotas
so they had to wait uh you know in uh certain parts of europe for years before they were permitted to come over
so you know
i i well i agree with that
i i think if immigration was entirely unrestricted uh not only would would the united states become over populated well more over populated awfully quickly i think it it would bring in a lot of uh people that are run out of other countries or in trouble in in other countries
i think they'd come here trying to find a new market for their their brand of crime
well you know there's another aspect of this too
they're also uh uh diminishing the uh health restrictions which
i was not aware aware of that
there are were some uh regulations over
i don't know whether they're laws passed or or whatever they're called uh just recently where uh people with certain diseases cannot be excluded uh from uh immigration
and uh recently uh tuberculosis which at one time if you had tuberculosis you could not get into this country uh they dropped that also
so i think in in some as- some ways we are uh becoming a little too egalitarian in that in that sense
but uh i think we should be a little more circumspect about it
well i've enjoyed talking to you
i i i have talked long enough
well as a matter of fact i'm before we started this conversation i was working on my p c at home
i work with one on at work continually you know
but i do not have one of my own at home
we have an um
actually it's a t i computer
but it is the i b m um clone
but everything in is in i b m mode
that's what we have um
well i really do
i um am an accountant
and but i work at home
so you're on it a lot
so i use it for that quite often
we have you know used some of it for some personal things
so i do a lot of um a lot of that work on it as well
and she works out of her home also
and the uh software that does the taxes is just incredible
oh it is
you know i mean she just you know
i expected to go and you know drop the stuff off and go back two weeks later
and you know she had it done and out in twenty minutes on her little p c
i have often thought that that having one at home would be neat
i just don't know if we would really use it that much you know
we deci- we didn't decide to get one until i started working at home
then you know then we thought well we can use it for you know some personal things
for us it really took you know a business application to justify the expense of it
i know my stepfather bought my mother a little personal computer oh i guess probably three years ago for christmas
and you know it's got some stuff on it
it's got a nice little word processing software on it you know and some budgeting type things and stuff
and i don't think she's ever touched it you know
it just it just seems like a lot of trouble for something at home
you know she always seems to have better things to do than to try to sit down and figure out how to use her computer
now i know my boss has bought the software um that he can that his checkbook is on on on a disk
and he goes in and prin- and types his checks on the screen and then hits print
and they print out on the checks
oh my gosh
and he's ordered envelopes with the windows in the right places you know
and he just whips out you know
and and he paid his monthly bills
and he just you know wrote all the checks on the screen and hit print
and it printed out like ten checks
and he just you know
and he just ripped them off
they go through just a continuous thing on the printer and he ripped them off and stuck them in the envelopes
and there they went
you know and he said you know i can balance my checkbook in seconds you know because it's all in the computer you know
and you know there's not going to be those adding mistakes that we all make
he said you know he said used to be i always sat looking for those you know
you know it does it for you
so this you know
there are some definitely some some advantages to it
it's just a matter of like you say are the advantages does it justify the cost if you're using it strictly for personal business
i i think in most cases i'd have to say no
and we have some education programs that he likes
a little sesame street one and we have another one that plays music
and he really likes that one
i guess for for kids like as they get older
especially now when they get to junior high school high school and even college
i mean my sister went to college started about three years ago
and she had to have a a computer
i mean it was like a necessity
well i'm going through right now
i'm you know going part time in the evenings
and you know i do
i mean they require it
you have to type it you know
and and so i'm up here you know nights and weekends you know working on the little p- on the p c up here you know typing stuff
so i can see where it would be a great advantage to have one at home you know if you were going to school
any more i don't even know if they have if a college kid would have a typewriter
and they probably used to have it
i just finished a a major research paper a couple of weeks ago
and i couldn't imagine not having that thing on a disk where i could go back in and move stuff around and change it
i i don't know what they used to do
well unfortunately in our family my husband and i went through college together
and then he went on and got his master's degree while i was working
and i'm the better typist
and we just had a regular old typewriter not even a correcting one back then
oh and you had to type all of his papers
but i typed his master's papers and things on a typewriter
oh boy to have a computer back then
oh cut your time in half at least
and then of course you have some changes to make and do the whole thing over
on a computer you take it out bleep print it out fine
you know i remember when i was working in high school you know i was working in an office right after i got out of high school
and we did everything on a typewriter everything
but it's amazing you know
then when where you know someone would have you type a letter they did it right they did it right
i mean they were
and they go is this really what i want to say
and you typed it
and that was it
and now you know people just send it back over and over and over and over
that's probably one of the problems and frustrations that it's brought about because people do feel like oh well we can just change it
well we'll try this out and see what it looks like
use it as a just a
instead of knowing what they want to say before they eve- they just you know play with it and which in a way is nice to be able to do
but you know it it gets a little out of hand sometimes
i've seen it get out of hand up here you know where we've got a secretary that sits over here that's keeping metrics right now and keeping up you know of all the letters i type how many cha- how many of them do i make changes on and on each letter what types of changes
or people just change a like one word because they think it sounds better or whatever
and you know she's also keeping a percentage you know what percentage of letters am i retyping for whatever reason
and there's like one week she did retypes on ninety percent of what she typed you know
and it's like you know it's ridiculous
and that was that was the high week
but it's running about seventy which is still ridiculous to have to make changes to seventy percent of everything that she types
well it's good that she does that i mean bring it to people's attention
well that's exactly right
you know she keeps you know keeps several weeks' worth of data and then in addition is keeping copies of all the changes to show you know look this didn't really need to be changed
you know this is ridiculous and you know changing add this time to now
you know i mean that's the kind of things you know that she's keeping and showing that this was a big waste of time it was a waste of paper it was a waste you know to change something like that
so anyway maybe you know maybe it'll it'll help in some way
but i don't know
there there definitely even with the few disadvantages like that are far better than the alternative
oh i have to
well i would like to get one at home some day
and so you know some day i would like to get even just like the video tell or something like that you know just to to be able to pull in sources from outside would be wonderful
you know so
oh i do too
you know that sounds like such a great idea
you know it'd be kind of fun to be able to play with it
so i know my father had a p c
and when we were in high school it was always fun
we could um link in
and i don't even remember now what it was called
but you could link in and talk to other peo- talk to people all over the country you know
and like you have your own little code name you know
and you'd type in du du du hi how are you du du du
and they'd type back and everybody
and you'd have five or six or seven people talking to each other at the same time
and everything everybody said prints out on your screen as they're typing it
and it was just great fun you know
it was very expensive because the whole time you were on there you were on long distance you know
so we were each limited to like twenty minutes a day you know
oh it added up big
well you know we my parents were divorced
and so the time we were like visiting our father in the summer time you know
so he felt like he could splurge and let us do it
i'm sure we would not have been allowed to do that under normal situations you know
but when you're doing the guilty father complex you know because he's not there to watch us grow
well it was nice to talk to you
but they're not in public school yet
i i get i get that experience starting next fall with kindergarten
so you haven't really uh dealt with that in a sense
but uh being one of these late in life mothers i've listened to everybody else's you know
complaints as to wha- what's the matter with either their kids or the school system
so i've been surprised
do are do you have school age kids
uh mine are both out of school
you know i i've in hindsight seen some things that i wished that you know i had done something about that was you know within my power or uh you know wish that in some ways we as parents had more control over what's happening up there you know type thing
or the teachers didn't seem to be teaching anything
of course it's a little hard to tell from the information that you get from your child you know
they they bring things home
and i was never one to believe everything my kids said
you know about something
but uh still i i questioned the ability of some of the teachers to uh really do a bang-up job
and yet others i know are just wonderful
well i heard a a frightening thing
actually i didn't hear it
it was told to me or suggested to me uh that to work as a teacher in the public school systems in the state of texas
and i think it's similar in in many other states if you have a degree in a technical field you do not need a teaching certificate because there is such a shortage of uh people to teach math and sciences
and somebody said well you know you could go in and and substitute teach at seventy-five dollars a day
and there's always going to be you know somebody having a need for a math or science teacher
i thought christ they're letting me in to you know
this would be this would be frightening
that's pretty interesting because just just because you know a subject matter doesn't mean you can teach it
and even if i knew how to teach the subject matter i don't know if i'd know how to handle that kind of a a group of kids
in fact i think that's that's one of the big problems today is the the way the kids behave or act and and the way they are sometimes disinterested in what's going on in the class and disruptive
and this comes from you know the the aging hippie near forty mother
so i went through this period of supposedly you know cosmic social enlightenment
i'm on i'm in
and there is a real dichotomy in terms of educational and economic background of the kids that are going to be attending this school
and i used to think well that's wonderful
you know they can get a real life experience
what i'm seeing now uh in terms of kindergarten preparedness just from in in in different preschools it's like day and night
and i wonder how do they handle a child who is obviously very ready and another child who doesn't even speak english let alone know her colors
and they're in the same classrooms
and i guess also you're going to see the first of the uh crack kids starting kindergarten
i thought well how do you how do you weed those out
some of those certainly have a lot of dis- difficulties you know with uh all sorts of things
and i would imagine their learning disabilities are quite large in some cases
and they've quoted statistics that i just about my throat just about fell into my toes
and i and i i got to thinking back when i was teaching college chemistry the people that took you know the lower level courses i sometimes wondered you know are they really even educatable or trainable
my god you know i-
are the rest of us who went for the big bucks you know staying out of you know where maybe we should be kind of socially obligated to spend some time teaching or something with
well that's you know that's an idea
and you think about that
at the same time you think god i hope i don't sound like a stage mother because
right now if you ask my friends t- put twenty mothers in a room and ask them how many have gifted children you're going to have twenty hands you know up there
oh you're kidding
nobody has nobody has a nongifted child
and i keep thinking you know
it's it's not a kid who's you know precocious
you know what has you know has has the educational system been watered down to that anybody who's above average is now gifted
mine didn't did not fall into the gifted category
oh don't say that
and i would never had said so either
uh but uh they managed to get through although not always with flying colors
uh in fact one of the incidents i was thinking of that my son had uh he was struggling with senior english
and i had a meeting with the uh vice principal and the english instructor
and she told me what she had requested
and i read it
and while it had you know a few little grammatical problems it wasn't very long and so forth
i thought it had some nice well thought out uh parts to it
and i thought well now here you have a student who is trying to pass who is struggling with your subject
and you give them an f on something that doesn't seem that bad to me
you're telling them that hey you might as well forget it you know
well you see i think that that harks right back to the elementary and junior high years
because i have a stepson now who's twenty-five
and uh i was just absolutely shocked uh the first time that i saw his schoolwork
uh i remember being you know taught
and i think you know you have to teach how to write an answer and you know how to construct a thought process
and you know they can get a they can grasp the points
and that's what's you know really scary to me
uh i would really you know
there's such a a push among young mothers these days to make sure their child is computer literate
and if they can't i mean if they have missed that training then somebody you know before you're you're start penalizing them with bad grades for not being able to communicate what they're thinking teach them these basic skills
it's pretty sad to think uh about those who even today are graduating from school
and they are telling that they don't know how to read you know
well my stepson you know i he went into the navy or air force
and i don't know
i re- address them all as generals
so i don't offend anybody
but uh you know fortunately for him he wasn't dumb
but boy he sure had trouble you know putting things on on paper
and one of the things that that they did for him they tested him
and they said that he's you know great in electronics
but he you know he's really does need the basic skills
and they put him through six months of composition writing in addition to all his electronic training
and at that point he has now graduated from warfare electronics school with honors
this is the kid who who really you know barely made it through high school
and i keep thinking you know it's not it's really not too late at any point to do you know some-
and i kind of have always pooh-poohed military educations
but i think that for this kid it's going to be you know his lifesaver
otherwise he might have been driving trucks or framing houses you know from here to eternity
so i don't know
you know it does make me nervous
well i can see why if you've got little ones just coming along
there's a a whole lot of stuff going on out there
and and part of me says i just would like to you know shut my eyes and pretend it doesn't you know go on
and then the you know the old social conscience says you know i'm not working i don't need to work
maybe i should volunteer to you know teach what i know
maybe adult literacy maybe you know composition writing maybe you know uh volunteering you know on a tutor line or though the even through the elementary schools for help with homework
or the other part of me says is god i've had enough kids
well i do it all
i i try to grow uh uh a vegetable garden
it's i just have a small plot it's like ten feet by five feet
and one's like fifteen by four
all the rest of my yard backyard is uh you know pool and decking
oh i see
well i enj- i enjoy fiddling around
and especially when the weather's not too hot or
excuse me go ahead
sometimes i i said i sometimes i wish i had more space you know
and sometimes i i want to plant something there's not enough room to plant
some of those things like uh you know the things that vine like uh cucumbers
or uh squash or something
and it takes up your whole space
they they just run all over
well it was very good
it just takes up you know like you say a lot of your garden area
we just do oh
radishes and turnips i mean not turnips carrots beets and things like that
well she just plants a few for herself
peas i i got a few peas out my garden a couple of days ago
oh i see
and so i
just wait until you know the weather warm enough to stick it in the ground
i uh i guess you can get an earlier harvest by doing that
but uh sure is a heck of a lot of work
i guess it it
because you got to
and i i don't think i'll do it again
and and i usually say hello to wife and kids
and then go out and fiddle you know just walk around the yard and inspect it
and the kids want to swing
and i push them on swing
and i wal- i mow my own lawn
and i do i don't have a sprinkler system
i i don't enjoy watering
and boy it is really nice
and and off by the you know by the time you're up and about
i i usually get it started for my wife and i and she moves it around
i'll have to admit i don't i do my own yard
i i really don't enjoy doing that
i had a lawn service to do my yard for me during the real hot summer months you know until i retired
and now i i've lost my excuse for that so i have to
sometimes i wish i could get one of these uh chemical services to come
but uh they want too much money
but it's still be quite a bit cheaper to do it yourself
if i have a problem discipline you know i think
now boy i really need to get out you know and apply something you know
and i screw around and don't do it or wait too long or something
and the weed come up
and all of a sudden you've got to do something else
i'm i'm kind of bad about that
but now i have the time
and i really can't i really don- you know don't
well if you
you know you you can get out in the morning when before it gets hot and and do it and stuff
just mowing it on saturday morning you know
you know you can i can start doing it in the evening after work
when they when they switch to switch
and uh i i think it's coming up here soon
are you having any trouble with bugs in in your garden
uh not a whole lot uh
i i don't use i i seldom use anything harsher than seven dust you know
and i didn't have any problems
next year i was planting some broccoli and and some of those they're called cabbage cabbage loppers
i mean i went up
i didn't go out there for about three days you know
because i and i went out there one day and the plant was noth- nothing left but a stem
and they they
have a you a good appetite
and they would you know
i i picked off like twenty of them
you know cutworms will do the same thing to your tomato vines too
they got that uh what is that safer soap uh
and i've been watching them every day
and i've and i haven't seen any signs yet
so if i see any signs i'm going to spray them
it's kind like this uh box shape
so i got four pieces of two by twelve and joined them together and just made a box
and put in a whole bunch like eight hundred pounds of topsoil and manure
and you know various other things
well the good stuff
and i'm hoping especially with those big tall sides on there it that maybe i won't have oh i'll have less of a bug problem
any- at least they they'll have a hard time crawling up the thing
my backyard is uh is sloping
so i built a box up you know had to build the one the low side up
and uh i had sandy loam hauled in
but uh you know you can improve your own soil there but the texas soil isn't the greatest
you you have to work on
and you know if i i didn't wait five years for it to be good enough grow
when we had our pool done i had them to leave some extra loam you know for my garden
so i had i had a lot of loam out there to start with
do you have do you have a rotor tiller
and it weighs twenty pounds or
and i guess it has a thatcher attachment to it
and and he lets me you know no problem borrowing if it's
just a hassle when you know
and it's a fairly large one to
check it back and just grab it you know if i just go to my garage and grab it
we've had a garden gosh for years and years and years
of some size you know
you know tomatoes that are starting to bloom and uh i've got carrots i mea- yes i've got a few carrots up
and i've got some radishes up
and as a matter of fact i've already done a second row of radishes
and uh the green onions are coming along
do you grow those those ten fifteen y
oh they they are the best
and i couldn't find a nursery that had any of them left
but we've got some this year
and uh my wife does uh a small herb garden on the side
those onions i think we we planted like twice as much this year because you know we got on- onions
and they lasted from you know about when you harvest them about a month from now or so
until until like october
and uh we really missed them when they were gone
oh i bet
and and and uh you don't realize how many dishes you put onions in
and and it was just like everything you put it into tasted so much better
one nice thing with onions and and bell peppers at least you can chop them and freeze them if you have
you know too many
and some we do green
and then my wife puts them on pizzas
and and chops them up in recipes and things like that
you're you're making me hungry here
yellow peppers huh
and i've got some broccoli uh onions some some radishes and uh uh beets
uh and i planted potatoes too
oh the potato
they were they're delicious
you don't get seem to get that much for the space
they they do
it takes a yeah it does take some space
some beet uh potatoes
and i've got some tomatoes still growing
in in containers
i got to wait for a place to to to free up
uh our our kids love pickles
and we all love pickles
so we're going to try to grow our own pickles this year
we've got some good um um hybrid burpee uh uh pickler cucumbers
and we're going to try to see if we can pickle our own
so because have you seen how much pickles cost in the store
i said why are they so expensive they're just a bunch of little cucumbers you know
but we're going to try that
i'd like to try you know just try something new
well i'll let you go it's
um i run occasionally
and i work out on a on a hanging bag
so i keep up with that a little bit
um the only exercise program i'm doing right now is walking
and i'm four months pregnant with my second
and so at the time walking seems to be the best
it's something i can do with her plus um doesn't tax me too physically
and i enjoy that because i like the group association you know like exercising with other people
and um and that's my favorite way to exercise
well that's neat
my wife's about five months along so she's been walking quite a bit
so that is a good exercise for that
but our schedules don't coincide as well as they used to
and so we very seldom get together to walk
but when you when you work out do you pretty much do it on your own schedule
or do you go to groups
i i do it on my own schedule
but it was so difficult to go on a regular basis to drive the distance you have to go
we've uh just save the fees and buy some of our own equipment
and then you can do it whenever you want i guess
and we got my wife an exercise bike
and i use that sometimes too
but you're i guess you're not as dedicated if you don't drive
because my husband used to work out three days a week with uh at the texas instruments gym
and then i would just go on saturdays
but since the first of the year neither one of us have been going
so i guess like i say we've been paying these fees and not going
so it's kind of a waste of money if you don't take advantage of it
i uh i try to work out at least a couple of times a week
and i think you really have to at least twice a week just to maintain the shape that you're in
and we i have two friends that we walk
they have babies that are about the same ages as as mine
and we've been walking every morning at going
so we when we go we have about do about fifteen miles a week
but the last little while for one reason or another we haven't been
but but i enjoy doing it more when i've got other people with me
you know i usually do it because i want to because i know it's good for me not because i don't feel obligated to do it
and i won't be as consistent with it
i exercised pretty well up until i found uh until i was pregnant
and i started having pains
so i've calmed down everything except i was working out doing aerobic exercises as well as the um walking
and i had to stop the aerobics because it was just kind of
but the t i rec center has an aerobics program for for um prenatal and postnatal aerobic type thing
and i was going to wait until um about my sixth month and then start that
and um i went to my exercise class one day
and then she was delivered the next day
so it would seem to be real beneficial
maybe it maybe it speeded up the process and all that
well i think it made parts of it a lot easier
and and is this your first that you're having
well then i don't know how much you've been through it
but i think parts of it made a lot easier
and i've talked to a lot of ladies that exercise with one pregnancy and didn't with the other
and they said that they had ex- that the one they had exercised with was three or four times easier
and we've i had
and and it's it's rough
and i think the exercise helped
well that's good
so do you work with t i
my my wife has been working with them
well then she could go if she were interested
so she could find out if she wanted to go
and they would talk about exercise and just general things relating to the birthing process
and so for us it was educational
i know a lot of people that talk about exercise and say well i don't want to exercise it's too much work
but there's a lot of different things you can do that are enjoyable that you don't have to strain yourself or sweat or be real sore afterwards
but i guess that you don't want to overdo
well it's been good talking to you
i hope your baby goes well comes out well
well what do you think
well i'm kind of leaning towards
but i guess i believe i think the n r a has gone overboard the wrong way you know
and and i think that's a dumb
because there has got to be some kind of background check to see
that the people who are buying a gun are buying it for a useful purpose you know if if you're going to hunt with it
or if you're going to do sport shooting you can wait a week
if they're can check your drivers license every time you get a ticket you know i mean they should be able to go back and find out if you've had any kind of psychiatric record armed you know felony record
and it seems to me right now that there's not there's not that much of a check
i i'm not really sure what texas law i think there's a check for felonies on your record
you know but
but he has to go out and do it
if and if it's a private sale of course then there's nothing
and see that's my only problem with uh
you know get the check and everything is is i guess bad guys if you want to call them bad guys
but but maybe we'll prevent a few john hinckley's
you know i i
that that's the kind of people
or you know whatever
but you know
i i just think it makes honest people more honest
and and the people who want it it's not that big a deal like i say to wait
and if you have to have it in a hurry something's wrong
what they need it for all of a sudden here um
well i'm married to a policeman
so we we talk about this a lot
i i imagine his his opinion is a little bit towards the one there
too many people have too many too much access
and i guess i think the other thing that we ought to control to some extent is there should be some law against the types of gu-
that are pie- i mean they're are
or even even the um the little um
they that's really gotten bad
and that's kind of scary to think that you may be shot for holding one
i mean there are a lot of kids who when they're ten look like they're twelve
or fourteen or and and especially some of the minority children whether
you know a racist or not
and a cop comes up
i mean you can't blame them
jeez and you can't take the chances
because there's been kids that age who have killed people
and you know you know there was a law in
and i think that's a good idea
you know like yeah
and the kids don't care
so you like to do
you know so that they're not very distinguishable from a real gun
i was uh watching t v yesterday
and there is a town in georgia
and it's the law that you have a gun
every adult you know uh is able to carry a gun
and and they encourage it
and the police love it
which really surprised me and and i think and that's what they were going after uh they went to interview this town
i mean it's a little dinky town
and uh the police said all the people said that's fine we could care less
you know we're all honest and everything like
we we all carry them
but we we don't mind being checked
and uh and i think it kind of took that uh neatness away from it you know
like well heck everybody's got one you know
and so it was it was quite unusual to see the people in that town
and uh my folks have always had
what not to what to do and what not to do
because i started shooting my dad started letting me shoot like a little air b b gun
but you know it was
it this is the only place that you do it which was
you know out far and away
and you don't ever touch it unless i'm here
and you don't you don't point it at people
and then they had
but anyway the s- hunter safety program
if you want if you want to go deer hunting
and your birthday's after nineteen something
well that's neat
fifty-five or something then you have to attend one of these hunter safety courses or you can't get a deer license
well that's real neat
and it and it it's basic stuff
it's like it's don't you know when you're climbing over a barbed wire fence don't point lean your gun against it you know
well that's real good
it it is always incredible to me the number of times those kind of stupid accidents happen to people
and they usually are real basic
don't assume always assume it's loaded
that's that's got to be the most common thing that people
and people don't want to believe that
it's oh it's empty
well see i
and i forgot about the one in the chamber
well we we're trying to teach our daughter
she knows real well about uh about her daddy's guns
and and she and she's real
um she'll know
so she's real she's real good about it
and she's never been curious
i mean cause he's always you know
if he has them out cleaning them you know she can be there
and he'll tell how he's doing it or you know show her the insides or stuff like that
to be feared and
if it if it's just one more piece of something
but they but they've got to understand like you said never touch it
and it's up in the closet
and then the shells are in another part
and it's something to think about
and i got it because my husband used to travel and be out
and i was like i live in a nice neighborhood
and then i've got it so far
and it's in a case
and it's you know it's put up
and it's away and all that
but i don't want to take the chance
and i think if somebody ever does break in
well i know how to use one
we we go hunting every once in a while
and he showed me how to use his guns
and i really enjoy it
but boy if someone did break in i don't i don't know that i could or would even grab it
i i used to think about that
it was a lot easier when i was when i was single
and when i was just married with no kids
it was like you you come after me you're going to get it
and now there's so many other things where are the kids what are they doing
you know where is this person coming in from
uh you've got
and and if if you manage to get it out
and then you know what how can you even afford to to think about what what you're going to do because you don't know where your kids are
well we we have dogs that are pretty you know very protective you know
and and most people that uh break in or whatever go to houses without the dogs
well any any advantage that they can take
and that's one of them
well do you think we've
i i think that's about all i can
we we're in pretty good agreement actually on it
it would be an interesting it would be even more interesting you you to be some of these people who are at the other end of the spectrum
well it's been nice talking to you
well right now the place where i'm living the yard was basically neglected for about the last twenty-five years
and after three years of working at it i've i've been amazed at just what a little bit of doing
instead of mowing in the same direction every time changing one day you'll or one time you'll cut it cut the lawn the long way then you'll go the opposite way instead of going lengthways you go width
and it helps the grass come back
did um you've been working on it for three years
thr- f- for three years
because it was like you could you couldn't even stand still out there
a little bit yeah
and the ants would start crawling up your legs
uh dursban two
but um so you haven't had a problem with that since
um not bad
but that's gon- to be expected
what else did it did it kill anything else it wasn't supposed to
well that's pretty wild
and we did that um
i just i'm not
but i sometimes have problems starting the mower
so a lot of times i won't get out and do it
but my husband
and he does the you know edging and all that kind of thing
and we're renting
and so we don't really put a lot of money into the uh you know like
we just we have winter rye out back
and we have
and we're just not real into the lawn probably because we're renting i guess huh
so it anyway
uh i found one thing that it's kind of a weird thing to say to put out on the lawn
every time i've done it it's got- it it drives the fleas completely out of the area
hm i wonder why it does
you you don't have to put a whole lot out
and it's real fine like flour and you just go out and do the entire yard
and you i mean you don't have to put clumps of it
well i'll have to remember that because hopefully we won't have them this year
but we have a cat that comes in and out
and the cat was getting um fleas and stuff and bringing them in the house
so we had a real problem last year with fleas
and we prayed that we could get rid of these fleas
and we got rid of them
but we did
and so we don't want them back this year you know
and we've had to get out and treat our lawn for that
i think we used
but that's about the extent of our lawn care
so i don't know
oh i love it
but it's too hot to be working in the yard
and i'm stopping to drink water
so what's the problem
well that's well that's funny
and my husband doesn't
and he you know he doesn't really enjoy doing it
but he'll do it
and he doesn't gripe about it or anything
and he's kind of like your wife
i mean you know in that he doesn't really enjoy it
but i would like to have a garden you know
but right now where we're living we have the trees where their uh roots are at the top of the ground everywhere over the ground
or it'll it'll tear up a nice tiller
so we're going to wait until we move
so we're going to wait
and when we move that's one of our priorities
and so i'd like to do that
but that's our next thing
and half of it's
uh in missouri city
southwest southwest side of houston
oh because we're in dallas
well that's neat
and um yeah
but we just haven't been able to do that yet
so one day we'll be able to do it
and i'm excited about it
and then i don't know anything about it
and then you'll have to give me a call on gardening
and i'll go nothing
so i guess we'll let you go
i've had an en- very enjoyable conversation with you
and we'll talk to you later
well uh do you believe only fifty percent of the people actually vote
and they really don't listen to any of the issues anymore
because they feel like so many of the politicians are like crooked you know
and so they figure why go out and vote you know
and i think one of the good ways of solving that is to like everybody likes to come to a party so have a voting party and uh you know like in communities
i mean that's the only
thing that i can figure out because i've heard so many people say well i'm not going on voting on that one you know i i'm going to go fishing today or it won't make any difference if if i don't vote
and i think it does
well it uh there's no question it does make a difference
uh so far
as having a party and then all voting uh when you have different precincts you would have to have a party in every precinct
because people have to vote in different areas
and uh not everyone votes at the same place
uh i personally think that we need to do more along the education lines in the schools and the children from the little ones on up with the idea of the the value of voting and the purpose of voting and that one vote does make a difference
and ma- maybe let them have some mock i mean uh you know
and and they are are doing that in a number of schools
however probably not enough of them uh country wide
but it's going to take at least a whole generation of people uh to get across the idea of voting
uh just like it's taking a whole generation of people to finally uh realize the harmfulness of drugs and uh hopefully to uh now with the many programs throughout the country on
uh perhaps we'll finally get the youth weaned off of it
but uh i know i i spent thirty-four years in education here in the dayton area
and in nineteen fifty-one the police were telling us about the drug dealers outside the school and how they were just giving away their marijuana giving away their heroin
and you know that was in fifty-one
so it's now uh to the forefront
and people are finally taking some action against it
and the thing we've we've neglected the value of voting and uh and what it really means
well i don't know how it is up there
but down here louisiana has a bad reputation for their politicians and all
i mean i'm sure you heard about some of ours
and uh people are just
i mean it's like they're turned off on voting
and that's the reason i said maybe if you had something like a block party
and then we're going to go and vote you know
like maybe they could give something like uh the top neighborhood if you had a hundred percent in your neighborhood or something like that you know
i mean it doesn't have to be it could be like a a sign that they would put down at the end of your block
you know or anything like that
but it it's really bad here
i mean to me it is
they say huh well it don't make any difference you know
and they don't bother to listen to what any of them have to say
and uh i know my husband
i don't care how small the ballot is i mean if there's one thing if there's one issue
because the way i feel is if i don't vote then i don't have any reason
and i hear so many people saying well i wish this would change i wish that
and you know but they didn't go vote
and uh maybe if they like you said if they would start when little kids and start letting them vote and learn how to vote and all then uh and the importance of it because okay if you don't vote for your friend over here well your friend's not going to have a chance
he needs your vote just like he needs everybody elses you know
because i know here uh until you get into high school now then they had the voting machines
and you voted for like cheerleaders and different things like that
but they should start that a lot earlier
it should begin and right down in the first grade
uh and your very best teachers in my estimation should be first second or third grade so that the children develop good learning patterns
and you have some success and want to go on learning and continue learning uh and not wait until they're in high school
and then it's too late to try to change them around at that point
but uh everything should be started on the lower levels
and uh certainly if the youngsters had that opportunity that you know they they understood that the principles of the country were established so that everyone would have a say and everyone would have a vote and what that vote meant
and uh but it but you're right from the standpoint that people do have a negative attitude towards politicians
and perhaps it's because our campaigns have become so terribly expensive to run uh that only the most wealthy can do so
and they're not always the best person for the job
but they have the money to be able to do it
so uh so that there are a lot of problems along that line also
and perhaps the government
you know a good i- idea for the young kids like that too is to have like a
and okay this this candidate tells you some things that are going to happen
and this candidate tells you some things
okay then this percentage of the voters i mean the kids in that class they are not going to let them vote this time
but they have to do whatever
if they did something like that and started kids out real young and showed them okay now you're not going to get to vote
but you're going to have to do what that person says
and i think you know that's an excellent idea
they would put them to realize that that their going to have to do what someone else says even though they didn't vote for it
and you do that in the primary
uh and i don't know that uh a lot of people vote in primaries for that very reason
uh they can declare anything they want
and they can actually rig it
but uh it's uh it's just a sad situation
and uh i do think more needs to be done along that line to help to uh teach the people uh uh everyone uh more about what is going on with voting and with nonvoting
so that uh we can make they're making some more intelligent decisions
and it's going to take these young you know it's going to take the uh a whole generation of my feeling uh before that's going to be accomplished
well you know they'd have to start when they're real young
i mean you know it would have to be a child that is just coming into school
because well i'll tell you another thing too now
whenever the first time i voted i never voted in high school because there was never anyone that showed us how to use the voting machines
but i did not know how to use those voting machines
and nobody ever showed us or anything
so i didn't vote because anybody that went in there and they asked a question all the other kids laughed at them
ah she don't even know how wah wah
so there wasn't any way i was going to go in there and vote
and it took me i mean it took such courage you wouldn't
and i mean i was out of school
and uh i didn't know how to work the machine you know
and it really scared me really bad
because i thought all these people are going to laugh at me because i don't know how to work this machine
where if they'd if they'd had a class or something or just to a short time you know to said okay this is the way
well just the just the opportunity to try the voting machines
it's this is the way it's going to be
and my son was exactly the same way that i was
and i didn't realize it until uh his senior year
i s- asked him something about well did you who did you vote for for uh cheerleader
and he said oh i didn't go vote
he said uh there's no way i'm getting in that machine
well then i realized it
so when we went and voted the next time i asked the uh lady i said i want my son to come in with me
and she said well uh why you know
and i said i won't turn any of the buttons down
but i want to show him how to use it so that he'll be able to vote
and uh so he went in
and now he's a registered voter
but he would not vote before then
and i mean i think that's bad
you know here i was
and and even of course there's a lot of years between the two of us
but even with that many years between
well what a wh- what do we currently have
i have a subaru uh g o x t
well i have a ninety honda civic
and i'm ready to get rid of it
oh it's not pretty old
uh well i ha- i had an eighty-eight that i really liked
and it got wrecked
and so i bought a ninety um because i i really liked my eighty-eight
and i've had a lot of problems with this one
so you think their quality control's going down over there kind of
it's it's kind of funny um
well i i i think we're going to see that i think uh that the quality that the japan carmakers had is slipping a little bit
it's it's true
but but that's one reason
i uh i've had no problems with my subaru
that's one reason i went with it because i subaru had a good reputation uh for you know low maintenance
well honda does too
there's there's no question
but you have a nineteen
i mean i've got to see if
i mean i've seen and i've had friends that have uh like uh eighty-one or eighty uh celicas
and those things just keep ticking
i mean they just they can rack up a a hundred fifty k on them
and they're still beating on them
and it's just amazing
and then they got
and you know they're not making them like that now d- d- you know
but they're still they're still a lot i think definitely better than the american carmaker system
oh i i definitely agree with you there
and it was the worst car i've ever owned
and um that's why i mean i was so tickled with my honda
and then it got wrecked
and you know i wouldn't even look at another car
i just went and bought a honda i mean i didn't even i didn't look around or anything i just said that this is what i want
and i really have had a lot of problems with it
but i don't know
well maybe you need to unload it on somebody el-
but in the first twelve months that i owned it it was in the shop an average of about once a month
i was really disappointed because i was you know so hyped up on honda
so what's your next purchase supposed to be
well i know this
well it's this is going to sound really strange
but i really like to have a mazda m p v van
and i have kids
and the the new chevy lumina van
i don't like those styles um the m p v is more of uh uh just uh i don't know what you normal
i i'm not sure how to explain it
i mean it looks i guess kind of like uh the chevy aerostar or arrow
astro astro i guess
but i used to really like the looks of the m p v because it looks more like a mini van rather than i think
do you have uh do you have a family
well that's probably influenced maybe a little bit
but i know that it's got to have a radio it's got to have air conditioning
i'm sure you can uh relate to air conditioning
um living in arizona
but and cruise control and tinted windows that's about it
i mean it's got to have those things otherwise i don't care
well when i bought my car it was right out of college
and uh you know i always been looking for something sporty
and i ended up getting you know basically something that i could you know afford
i probably uh
a few girls that i've gone out with i've had uh like mazda r x seven's and stuff
and they're they're pretty fun to drive
so so i think that's what uh i i'm going to have to get next time around
i keep i keep hold- holding off
and then i could i could upgrade now if i wanted to
but i just i
and and uh i i'm just going to keep holding off
but i'm definitely going to look for something uh in the you know nice perpor-
but it's not practical for me
um but i'll probably um
but i don't know if i'll get myself to spend that kind of money
you're looking at you know for a new r x seven or a supra or something
oh at least
well new cars aren't cheap anyway
anyway my ultimate car though the the one that i really want is uh five sixty or so mercedes
we have we all have those kind of dreams too don't we
that's the only one that i you know
i se- you know i see uh you know early on that that that says
it may be my phone um
anyway it's the only car that says you know sporty and class uh
uh kind of what i'm
and those are fun
oh those are nice
and uh i-
they're they're cute cars
well he did he had a a red
and uh he actually
they came out with a european racing green uh miata that's a limited edition
they're only going to make like three or four thousand
so he went out
and he traded the other one in and got this one
wow i haven't seen those
and i'm like um but uh i haven't seen one yet either
but supposedly they have some real wood built in to like the clutch and all this and the steering wheel
so it's it's very authentic
and there only is supposed to be limited edition so it may be may be a good investment
if it's a limited edition usually no matter what it is if it's a limited edition it's usually worth something later on
but uh i think
anyway uh hope it's not going bad
um but he i think he he only spent you know the low twenty's
now see i would have never figured that i would have figured that to be a lot more than that
well i don't know
the prices aren't as high you know
and the the mu- miata was first introduced uh
and well they weren't really that bad though when they were introduced were they
the demand is so high that uh you know they were going to retail them around like thir- you know thirteen standard you know
and you get your options
your looking at fifteen or si- fifteen
but there were you know people were buying them for nineteen and twenty
they they may have gone down a little bit
and i can't remember what i read about that
but so that's
i mean i would think somebody would try to compete with that because it is very popular
have you seen the new uh dodge stealth
and the mitsubishi
is the same same
now those are nice
well that's that's that's the same manufacturer
so they just market them
but uh yeah
those are and those are supposed to be very performance power i mean they're there is yeah big time
but those are pretty stripped
and there's nothing
that one's just more for looks you know
it doesn't have any really the performance that the expensive one does
you know but i've seen one of those
and it's not that great i mean because they really
i think the- they're only around uh twenty-nine k
like i mean they have um better
but i don't know
like i said it's it's still not practical for me
and no other responsibilities for yourself i guess you know it's i can
i've i've haven't tried to upgrade myself right now
that's uh you know i could i could have you know get something nice and upgrade
but i just uh i'm consulting right now
what do you think about the uh peace corps or public service commitment
uh that's the first i've ever heard of it
i haven't heard of it anything too much about it
well i think it was uh thought up when there was so much controversy about reviving a draft
and people said well they uh young people who were drafted have to provide military service to the country
but there are an awful lot of young people who would benefit from um some sort of public service
like the conservation corps back in the thirties or uh various other things of that sort
and it seems to me
but i don't quite see how they'd make it work
how would they decide who goes into uh building fire breaks in yosemite national park and who goes to saudi arabia
my first impression was um it would be v- very good
but i don't know if it should be an option
and i think there are some available now where they are able to work
but making it a mandatory thing kind of
the the difficulty would be in whether it's voluntary or involuntary
and the people who were proposing it said that it should be involuntary that it should be like a draft
and some people would get military service
and some people would get civilian uh
they were allowed to do hospital service or uh things like that
and if they re-
or farm work in world war one i remember uh reading about
and and i suppose that there is uh justification for taking everybody if you take anybody
but i just really think that the difficulties involved in paying them uh sorting them out assigning them
it seems like you'd have a lot more conscie- conscientious objectors if they had that choice
you know i'd i'd much rather work in a hospital than than to go war
and i'm sure most young men and women would
and so uh
well i think that in the in the cases that like that uh they had to be uh pretty thoroughly examined to prove that they had pacifist and religious beliefs and so forth
and that this wasn't something new just to keep out of going to war
it was uh something that was a fundamental part of their philosophy of life
well that makes sense
and then you run into again to um the bureaucracy in running it
you know how you going to cover that many people because we've got a lot more people now than we did then so
and then you have to pay them some kind of a stipend
uh even if it's like the peace corps where they don't get most of it until they come home
you have t- have to pay them something
now i had a lot of friends who went to the peace corps uh back in the mid sixties and it really did seem to be a worthwhile organization
but on the other hand i'm not sure what the permanent value of it was
we had an awful lot of idealistic people who went off to uh what was then east pakistan is now bangladesh
and to uh algeria and to uh southeast asia and lots of uh out-of-the-way places
but i don't know if they really had significant effects in the places where they went
well i know in
and i was living such a stringent lifestyle that it was very beneficial to me
it taught me not to be so self-centered and it you know to think of others
but i don't know if i was doing it in different situation you know not a really religious background if if i would get a lot out of it
you know i think i did because it you know it emphasized that sort of thing
you know a lot of self evaluation
and it was definitely voluntary too
and that i'm sure that would make a big difference too
you know you've got
well what about a voluntary program
um well like i say i know that there are some type of programs that they have available for a youth like teenagers to go and do um work in the national parks and work in uh neighborhoods to do um clean up and that sort of thing
but i don't know what organization it's under
but i know that that helps a lot with training and um a lot of
there's a program like that for uh juvenile delinquents the the ones that are not dangerous
and they don't have to be locked up go to these uh camps
and they uh put up signs
and they do fire prevention work and certainly things of that sort
and that i know is run by the state
but there may be other things
i'm not so sure what kind of uh training that is for the future for those kids
it's probably a a very good way to keep them off the streets and out of trouble
but whether it's something that they can put to to economic use later on is a different subject
especially in you know if you take a a child that's from the inner city and then put them in the a middle of a park
so that's yeah so that may not may not benefit them in the long run
but my other line is blinking
well thank you
but it was good to talk to you
what's what's your most recent one that you've seen
well actually what i do
so i haven't really seen any movies in the movie theater
but i rent probably four or five movies a week
but i haven't been doing it lately
and uh uh oh gosh uh i'm just
oh air america
see i haven't seen that one uh
well it depends
do you like uh steamy movies
but usually i don't
i i guess one of my favorite well two of my favorite movies is probably like lethal weapon and lethal weapon two
and those are those are like two of my most favorite
i mean they're just really good movies
and i liked bird on a wire
or do you like uh just action
like like are you talking about movies like die hard two
oh jagged edge
or uh fatal attraction
um that was okay
i i don't i guess i thought it was too far fetched
but so many people said oh no it wasn't you know
but i guess
i i just thought it was too far fetched
i i have to say that probably the one movie that really threw me back the most uh that i was really the most in shock with was probably uh star wars
i mean i guess uh out of all the movies i've i've never been as excited to go back
i was ready to go back and see it again you know
but that that's really like an all time classic
i mean i don't think anybody anything could ever beat that
now i i also liked uh oh gone with the wind or some of the classic like the lawrence of arabia
see i've never seen that
oh you haven't
that's uh that's a that's a real interesting movie
and it's got a good historical perspective to it
so it'd probably be a good thing for me to see
and it's about al capone's brothers
and i won't give the the whole plot away
but it's it's really a good movie uh
and one of them was lost for many many years
and uh he actually he turns out to be a law man
oh you just gave it away
or go rent it
and a lot of times what i wind up doing is picking say an actor or an actress
and seeing like all
uh all of mae west's movies
and just kind of kind of go out and uh rent all the movies and uh uh you know just kind of go
i guess you could do that you know get all of david carradine's movies
or uh uh segal
um it's not david is it
he was on uh on uh uh arsenio just recently
oh i don't i don't watch that
arsenio was asking him about uh what he thought of uh one of the other action guys
he said well he wouldn't really talk about it
didn't want to talk about him because he didn't think he was such a uh a good action guy
it was uh
but i like all the the rambo movies
oh see i didn't really care
but see i don't really like sylvester stallone
but i just have never been a stallone fan
i just have i don't know i just have never seen any interest in him
we we actually rent uh probably a go- good combination of movies with the exception of horror films
you know i don't know
there's something about people coming up through the sofa to get you or something you know
coming out of the t v that just doesn't make my day you know
well it's so
i guess i'm a real i'm a realist and so when i watch movies like that it's like this can not happen
so i just don't enjoy it you know because it's just like come on give me a break
you know i mean i just
and so many of them are done so poorly
you know that it just doesn't even give you the effect
i mean some of them are done good
and they do scare you
but um so many of them are just done real
i just saw uh uh a really interesting movie called uh flatliners
oh that was one of my favorites
i mean it was what i liked about it was that it was a new subject
you know and it was just it was done so well you know
you know students might try to do it
you know i mean and it's not like there's a lot of scientific data on it
well that's probably true
but it was a very good movie
i mean there wasn't any part of it that you really felt like no this can't happen
it seemed re- it seemed real
you know it was really good
that that was one i mean
but it was good
and um i don't know if you like this kind
but i thought pretty woman was a really good movie too
i've we've seen that two or three times
and we rented it
you know but but it was really good
uh have you seen shrimp on the barby
ye- ye- yeah
it must have uh what's his name in it
it's got uh uh cheech marin
it's kind of uh kind of a poor man's pretty woman in reverse
but it was kind of cute
actually did you see dirty rotten scoundrels
because when i thought of that i thought of
um oh there was another one
oh dances with wolves have you seen that yet
oh you've got to see that one
it's it's very very good very good
well my wife uh has got a uh a picture from kevin costner
and he signed it
and he signed it
he he happens to be uh a friend of one of her her business associates
oh wow that's impressive
and or not not a friend a cousin a cousin
so uh uh but anyhow we got uh we got a nice uh picture
and it came in an envelope that says dances with wolves
so we've got to uh try to get out there and see that one
i mean it's a very good movie
and they pushed it back to playing it in the theaters until like august
i think because they were they were scheduling a video release of it in july
and then when it won all those awards uh they pushed it back to august
now did you see uh driving miss daisy
and you know i didn't think that one was near as good
you know i guess it was okay
i mean it was all right
but um when i compare like the winners of this year and last year it just
maybe it's it's not
well um i'm uh pretty pro gun control over all
i uh i've had a lot of arguments with people about the issue of gun control
and uh i must say that there are a couple of arguments against uh strong gun control which i find very compelling although most the people who argue gun control with me i find uh use sort of canned arguments you know sort of the n r a slogan arguments
and um uh see i've been very frustrated when i do debate with people about it um
i guess on a one a scale of one of ten i'm probably around a two in terms of fair restricting guns
and i have to admit most of that is uh strong personal distaste
i don't like the idea of people being able to kill me with very little effort um
and uh guns are very symbolic of them having that power over me
well me being from texas
um uh i'll give it a try
well i'm not your stereotypical texan
i resp- i respect them and what their capabilities are
and on top of that spending a good portion of my earlier years in the military as a green beret i definitely respect the power of weaponry
and here in houston as well as just about any big city anywhere across this country
and here here here you go
when you i mean you've heard the the slogan um if you outlaw guns then only out laws will have guns
well you you've got
well any of the big cities you've got the different rival gangs
and they're having their little turf wars over their little drug kingdoms and such
and they get out their little mac tens
and they're going to fight with them
and it doesn't matter what restrictions you put on that type of weapon or a class three firearm
i don't care if if they've got to go down into new mexico to get it
and they'll get across the border
now my position although i have absolutely no use for a fully automatic weapon
if they want want me to present a letter from my county sheriff saying that i've got his permission to have an automatic weapon in his county that's fine too
what i don't gets dangerous in terms of civil liberties because pretty soon it's
you don't want to have someone making a personal trust in that way i would hope i mean because i mean someone
the personal sheriff doesn't like doesn't get to have a gun
and someone the personal sheriff
the only well the criteria the sheriff would have to follow has is this guy a convicted felon uh
and if he had an automatic weapon could he really be raising some problems
you know just proving that you're a basically a good citizen
but if you're not a if you're not a basically good citizen
if if they want the firepower they can get it
so why hav-
so why have any restrictions at all
well we can could be
i said the restrictions i would like to see on for anybody whether it being for handgun a rifle a shotgun
but whether it be the your state police or your county police for you to be able purchase a handgun
well that makes a lot of since to me
i mean i certainly feel that if if we may disagree on when someone should own a fire arm
but uh i certainly agree that if someone owns a fire arm that have as much responsibility to know how do use it safely as someone learns how to drive if not more so
well the han-
as a as a pistol
well i have a bicycle
and that scares me too to tell you the truth
well i'm still i'm still puzzled though what is the argument
how does the argument work if uh if the bad guys are going to have guns anyway
is it uh is it a way of raising the prices of illegal guns
does that uh mean advantage
uh not necessarily a price thing
and i expect to see it in other states very soon
legislation been introduced as that if a citizen of the state being
you you're you're from california right
and all these people come around
now if this legislation comes through
when you're and when you're looking down the barrel of a hand cannon things change real quick
having having spent time in combat i feel i feel it before they'll get the gun on me
i'm i'm sure
i'm sure given all given all your training i'm sure that you know you'd
um i'm quite concerned that if you let everyone
hasn't yet used a gun in a haven't hasn't yet committed a felony
it's it's hard for me to imagine that a a situation of you know
i actually it's no-
the fact that everybody is packing a piece is a deterrence for someone saying well i'm going to mug this guy right here
but hey he's carrying just as much firepower as i can
and if they're sca- if you got to go through a certification course to get where to where you can carry it in public
now whether this person is made the moral decision whether he can take another human life or not
even even more so when it comes to my my wife and son
anybody anybody tries to hurt them i won't even blink
i i understand that
what if uh what if you think someone's trying to hurt them and you make a mistake
this this is where the question of gun control comes in
well uh that that was the topic
say a person uh uh get
and say i've got the vibes this guys fixing to do something
and i make sure this persons sees it so that he's got now doubt that i will use it on him
and i will use it right then
and the only reason i feel confid- com- com- comfortable doing that is because of the training i've had
well as as someone who would would possibly be in the role of an independent bystander i feel more comfortable with people having blades because uh you're not going to get
well if i'm the one doing the shooting i don't miss
this is really ironic that this would i would get this subject today because just yesterday our dog ran away
and it's just been tearing me up all day
oh i bet
because we have just been looking all over for him
so this is just really strange
oh i guess so
um he's gotten out before
but he's always stayed right here you know
and so this is just really strange you know because
um he's part golden lab and part uh
uh australian shepherd
that's why it really surprises me you know that he hasn't come back because
you know but
oh well i hope he comes back
oh about two years
oh that's tough
that isn't that funny how we do
i mean we just really
well you know they're always there for you
and they don't talk back to you
well they're companions
well do you have any
and her name is angel
and we have a cat who a white cat he's he's just a tabby just a
and his name is dominique
uh we've we had the the dog first
and uh she's kind of a wimp
and and the cat kind of rules
but uh she likes him all right
he we had another cat about two years ago
it got leukemia
and uh then we got this new cat
so uh i have two children
and they really enjoy the animals
and then my mother who's very elderly lives with us
and she's really good friends with the dog
i mean they are you know like i said they're they're really companions you know
and they're friends
i mean they you can love them all you want
and they love you right back
and they don't
it's just so neat you know
oh i know it has to be
it's just it's like i said we've had him for two years
and he's never
i mean he's he's gotten out
but he's always been right there
he's never been gone for at all you know he's just always been right there when he gets out
you know it's the first time he's ever been gone like this
oh that's really too bad
that's awful well
and i knew we were going to find him you know
and when we didn't it was like oh no
well i i'll i hope you'll find him
we keep you know
they told us like at the humane society and the adoption center you know don't give up hope you know
well have you put any posters up or anything like that
well not yet
we were talking about that tonight since you know he we just he just got out yesterday
we we were trying to find some pictures of him recently
you know but we just don't have a whole lot
we have him on film you know on the video camera
you know but you can't put that on the
you know so
so i don't know
i we will probably will put some things up some posters and stuff up
well that's good
and hopefully that will help you know maybe around the neighborhood
so that helps too you know if they can keep
i think that uh if he gets out he'll come back
you know i really do because he knows exactly where he lives
it's just like it's it's just so ironic that this would happen
and i would get this this kind of a call
you know i know sometimes our cat will will stay out all night
and when he's not right at the door in the morning i really worry that something's happened to him that somebody he's got in a fight or you know somebody's hit him
and and uh if he doesn't come by mid morning then i really get scared
but he's always come back eventually
well that's good
you know they can get hurt a lot easier
so that would make you really
well but he's a real feisty guy
cats are really almost more territorial than than dogs are
they're very very
any cat that comes near and even a dog he won't he won't jump at them or anything
but he'll sit
and he'll watch
and i think maybe he would if it came real close
but he's very protective of our property
i i guess i really don't know cats that well because my mother never liked them
so i never had them growing up
so you know i never really had them around me
so i've never owned one
well they're really a lot different than dogs because they're not they're very independent
and they're very he's very affectionate when he wants to be
but if you want him to be and he doesn't want to be he'll just he'll you know either scratch you or run away
but when he wants to be uh he's really affectionate
he likes to lay next to you and have you scratch his head and and and snuggle up to you
and but if he's not in the mood you'd better stay away from him
but dogs seem to be always in the mood
they're always you know right there and like like you to pet them and loving
i i like the way they come up
and they'll they'll put their head underneath your hand you know
and uh most dogs do that
i mean you know they know exactly how to get that attention you know
they just you know come up
and they put your you know or they'll rub their their head against you you know
now do you keep him indoors most of the time other than to go outs-
well well he's outside during the day
and then we get home at night we do bring him in
you know because he's had all this room to run in
well how did he get out
well see he did he did it a couple weeks ago dug a hole
and you know we we filled it back up put him back in there
so uh we got we we put dirt in the hole and then put some chicken wire around it you know so that he couldn't get out
well he kind of ripped through the chicken wire
so i can't
i i i just have not
i don't understand you know because it's like he's got a good home you know
i mean we have two kids you know that just love him a lot
you know it's like we can't understand why he kept wanting to get out you know
well you know that animals are like that
i'm sure that yeah
i i know
i mean he's always you know
you know it's like
and they they just been real uh
at first you know they seemed to be upset
but now it's like uh well if he doesn't come home can we get another dog
and you already want to replace him
we that's was our cat's name that that that died
we named him uh we named him buddy after uh buddy bell uh the ranger baseball player that used to be here
and we used to
and we named him buddy beaner for some reason
but buddy after buddy bell
but he was he was a good cat too
and i i feel real guilty because
and one year i forgot to get him his leukemia booster
and he got it
and i just felt so bad
i it's real contagious
and the vet
and if they don't have their booster
i had i had no idea
the question was about uh physical fitness and staying in shape and exercise
well uh i i don't do it as much as i should
and uh last year i would i did it every day
but i've kind of in ninety-one i've kind of gone down hill
and so i'm not doing it as much as i need to
but i i can tell you when i do do it on a regular basis i feel so much better and so much healthier
but it's just to get motivated to do it
and once i get started and and i i i ca- i do it every night
it's just to get uh motiv- motivated again
and what happened about couple of weeks ago i started again
and i was walking
and it got kind of dark
and i was by myself
and there was this fellow in this truck that kept circling the block
and so i i kind of got frightened
and i kind of use that as an excuse
um well i try to
um i started at the beginning of this year
and i went through the t i fitness center and registered for the uh aerobics classes there
and they run for two months at a time
and you have to you do have to pay to take them
and i took i signed up for one that was three nights a week an hour and a half
so that was four and a half hours a week
and it cost sixty dollars
and i thought okay that's not cheap
and i had a friend of mine going
so i was real good
and then oh march came around
and i signed up again
and i got uh caught up with a class i was taking at t i
and then i was having to work some real late hours to get caught with my work after i got out of class
and then i went to colorado springs the next week to do some training at the t i up there
and so that was two weeks i had missed
and boy i tell you what i've been terrible ever since then
it's once you get out of that habit you just don't you don't get back into it
because i teach school
and last year a bunch of teachers had an aerobics class
and she came to our school twice a week
and i i was
and then i missed once
and this session is about to run out
now i signed up for a different one now that's only two nights a week because i am getting kind of into a real busy schedule as far as teaching a lot of training classes
and some of them require me to go out of town
and and uh that just kind of throws my whole schedule off on doing that
so and i've
lately uh there's been nights that i could have gone
and i've found excuses uh
but i'm fine this week
and i didn't
so i'm kind of finding excuses
and now it's kind of like well
but i better
and i think another thing is that my friend that was taking with me the first two months wasn't the second two months
and so i haven't had that extra motivation of of us forcing each other or not forcing each other but encouraging each other to go
like it's misery loves company
i mean some i
the neighbor across the street she goes belongs to president's
and uh it's not president's any more
but she loves it
i mean it's just it's an automatic high for her
and i don't
but i hate it when i'm doing it
you know i just
and she just loves it
so even when she doesn't go to the health club she runs you know
so it you know
and it's so hard for me
but i don't i don't
and i have an older sister that loves running too
and she runs all the time
but at to me it's every minute's agony
like when i walk i'll take along a radio or something
and that helps you know pass the time
and we try to we used to try to get together
and i think now that the weather's getting nicer we're going to start doing it again and occasionally go walking
and it's not as boring if you get several people and you can kind of talk
and and it it makes it pass pretty quickly
and the aerobics isn't too boring
i kind of enjoy it when i'm doing it um
but uh i do i do have to make myself go
and of course while i'm doing it i feel pretty good
and after i get finished i feel great
oh it's great afterwards
i mean i can go in there
like a friday afternoon when i'm tired it's the end of the week and i just want to go home and i'll make myself go
and i'll have headache and everything
and i get out
and i'm just
and then just in general i sleep a lot better and i just feel much better
i mean i've been kind of dragging the last few weeks
and i know if i would just get around to exercising i'd feel better
but my dragginess is my excuse for not exercising
well i'm too tired
or i have a headache
well i just got over the flu
and i'm still kind of draggy
so i better not go
and you know it's silly not to
but i don't know
and i and i know that it's good for my health
i know you know from everything that you read and you see on television now exercise is so important to good health
so you know you not only you know you're not only doing something to keep yourself fit but you're probably prolonging your life
but i don't know
and i i think one thing i don't like about aerobics is that after i'm finished it's kind of late at night
and i've been sweaty
and and it you know
so it kind of kills the evening for doing errands
so i think a tuesday thursday might be a little bit better
but um so i'm kind of glad they have a longer class on tuesday thursday now that i can just kill two nights and and uh get a reasonable amount of workout in
well that's good too
but i'm glad it's not too totally cheap because if it was too cheap i would talk myself out of going more probably
well do you have a facility right at the where you work
and it's they have a really nice facility at the t i
but i guess sometimes it kind of motivates you to really get going
and then they hire private instructors
oh that's great
and they have ceiling fans in the rooms
and it's it's a pretty nice setup um
and of course it's real convenient because it is right there at work
and just the fact that i can go straight from my desk over to the the recreation center and do it helps a lot
i can see that would be uh easy
well um do a lot of people take advantage of it
they have probably ooh i'd say fifteen different fifteen to twenty different aerobics classes each session that are running
and they have them anywhere from six in the morning uh
they have some during during lunch hour that are shorter
and i guess guys can take advantage of that
for me i wouldn't have time to do an hour hour of aerobics and then take a shower and get get dressed again
but there's a lot more guys that do that one
so they have big variety
they even have some uh aerobic uh water aerobics when the weather gets nice out in the pool
oh you have a pool there too
oh how nice
they've got an olympic pool and and basketball courts and sand volleyball
they've got the full weight room and uh the locker rooms with uh a jacuzzi and sauna and the shower facilities and hair dryers and all the you know everything you'd need just about
it's a real it is a real nice facility
it's also got a full insid- inside basketball court
and i think they're working on building a jogging track and some other things
but it's it is very nice
i mean i'm just now finally starting to do the aerobics thing
well does it cost money like to use the to exercise in the weight room or to uh to tak- to go swimming
and it's about eight dollars a month
oh that's not bad
and then the aerobics cost extra even if you have the fitness membership
but i think the aerobics classes are even pretty reasonably priced from what i've heard
well and people of all ages take advantage of the aerobics
in fact uh the t i-er's families can come in on these things
oh well what's there to say
in maryland they they do have capital punishment
and uh i've seen uh a lot of people get convicted sentenced
and then just nothing happens
well from what i underst-
i saw a statistic just a few days ago um so far this ye- year or was it during the last year somewh- during a years time i think it was they executed twenty-five people in the nation
so i i
and it's building up you know
they're they're convicting them faster than they're executing them
so it's really building up
and uh here in maryland i know we have a real problem with overcrowding in prisons uh
but i mean in
here it's uh to the point where they were letting prisoners go
uh commuting the sentences of those that were in in jail for lesser crimes
in order to put more people in into the jails
and it was just uh amazing to me
and of course they made a big deal out of the the few that got out and turned around and committed a crime within five days of getting out
isn't isn't maryland where the famous willy horton case was
uh i can't remember
it was uh that was the one that was used so much in the campaign in the politica- in the presidential race
uh may it may not have been maryland
um i don't remember myself
anyway well the question is you know do you think i- it does make a difference in whether or not a criminal commits a crime
or do you think it can if it's done right
well i think in large measure the reason they don't care
but so many of the people that commit crimes don't get punished
or the courts don't convict them
or or they don't serve very much of the time
and so uh you know their their success rate is very high
ca- you can make a good living at it
and there's uh there's a lot of people here in baltimore that uh have
and we just had uh a real big cocaine bust
and of course you know they're they're playing it up real big that it was looked like it was a very very small ring
and they just happened to get lucky and catch the guy
but i mean uh baltimore has uh an all time record for the number of deaths so far this year
well it's kind of it's kind of moved up
and you have to remember that it it it uh there's i think x number of people out there that are going to commit murders
and uh once you kill off a few of them
i mean if you murder a guy because he murdered your partner or something like that i mean pretty soon you run out of people to murder
the only consolation is so many of the murders are you know
and so they you know
well at least maybe the guy they cross next time is going to uh
i think i think capital punishment is an appropriate punishment for the kind of people where we say you know this sort of person is just not acceptable to our society
and we are there by going to remove them from society not temporarily but permanently
i mean i i personally think life imprisonment
i don't think much of li- of life imprisonment first of all it's never turns out to be life
but second you know why should we
well that means you're going to put them in a cage you think it's never ever going to be safe for them to walk the streets again
well then why bother
just execute them because that's that way you're sure they'll never ever going to walk the streets again
so any any anybody that says life in prison with no chance of parole i'd say uh give them the death penalty
you know it makes sense um you know
you have the occasional person who may have been falsely accused but i mean uh so few and far between uh you know
and that's about it
and and also um the the thing i don't like about a lot of these court trials and a lot of these appeals is that it's not based on what is true and what is false
but rather it's on
and i think our courts should be geared much more strongly
and and that way we can be sure you know
we can find out what really happened and and base the ver- sentence on what the person did not on what we're allowed to let the jury hear
my uh my father-in-law participated in a uh a jury trial
he was he was actually on the jury
and uh this man was accused of killing uh i think it was two people uh and shooting a uh policeman um point blank in the face
and uh this was during a holdup of a uh uh a restaurant
and it came out during the trial that um they had tried to rob another place
and uh when the guy came out with the bag they thought was money it turned out to be a couple cookies and uh you know jumbo cookies
and and so they were so upset from robbing this guy you know trying to do this holdup that didn't work that they quite literally were mad and went into a restaurant to hold the place up and just started you know shooting people
and get even with who
you know stupid guys
and uh it turned out that the you know policeman survived to the point that he was able to you know identify the guy
and of course you know they tried to make the cop look ou- like he was uh a uh no good rotten drunk
i mean it was amazing
so what was the verdict
oh he was found guilty
he uh um
last i heard he uh he beat a push for the death penalty
now whether they finally got it or not i don't know
i kind of uh stopped listening after a while
um you know he would come home
and and you know after the trial was over he came home and told us what was going on
and of course then they had to go back to dec- you know
the the penalty phase
and uh yeah everybody everybody was pretty much you know let's burn him
and that's you know that's the way they wanted to do it
and he was surprised because he thought there was going to be a problem because he uh
you know some people on the case were were a little hesitant on convicting him on some of the charges
but i mean when it all came down they just within an hour decided the man's fate
well you know you just have to decide you know wha- yo-
well there's really two separate decisions there i guess
one is did it really happen the way the the prosecutor said it happened you know
and you have to decide that
but then you have to decide you know as a member of society what do i want to do with this guy who did this thing
and that w-
i i've never been on a jury
well it it it went pretty pretty quick from what he said
but i mean there's there's there's a lot of other crimes out there i mean besides murder
i think uh now if you're dealing drugs now
caught more than twice or something uh
it there's uh a death penalty associated with it
well the thing i'd be most likely to attach the death penalty to is the violence
i mean ye-
i can handle people people selling drugs you know
it's it's wrong
but it it's not worth somebody getting executed for
but we hear so much about the violence and how it's not safe to walk the streets because somebody you know these random drive by shootings and that sort of thing
and the people i'd most likely want to sentence to death are the people that just show a really low regard for human life
that you know
and so i go le-
these are the kind of people i would like to ye- get out of here and get out of circulation and say i don't we don't accept your kind in our society
i i've i have uh a low tolerance for that kind of uh that kind of person
and uh as far as uh you know
there are some some other crimes that i think uh you know uh
kidnapping um you know when they
i mean kidnapping per se has a certain uh uh fine and penalty associated with it
but um some of these people are just out and out brutal
i pay a good deal of taxes i guess because i i make a fair amount of money
and uh the taxes that i pay um i guess as a as a general statement i feel i i guess i get my money's worth for
i guess i am sure that i feel that in general though uh the allocation uh of the taxes in certain areas i- isn't correct
well i'm sure that uh probably every person in this country would agree with you on that
well i i
lately i guess um uh or at least for the last twenty years or so i've felt that the expenditures of our taxes into high cost uh defense items at least in the last ten years have been uh
and i'm not really sure that that we've gotten our money's worth there uh regardless of the outcome of the desert storm uh
desert shield uh situations
uh i guess my particular beef is that having participated in the mi- military off and on over the over the years of being called back and things of that nature is uh i've found that you know there's an extraordinary amount of waste
i take that as a as a given in any military operation
and i gue-
i i should imagine that that that what the what the problem
why i i'm i'm a little concerned about today is that this uh rather uh quick and and easy i don't know i shouldn't say easy rather quick victory in the in in the uh mideast uh uh over the uh iraqis uh might lead us into uh a false sense of security that we can do that against any other foe
i'm i i don't know what other foe that would be
but uh i i'm just getting nervous again now hearing the voices come up that there has to be increased expenditures in that area
well of course uh a lot of uh a lot of w- missiles and things were expended in the course of fighting the war
and the and the inventory's going to have to be restocked uh
now i work for t i
and one of the things we were told is like they had eleven thousand harm missiles which t i is the sole supplier for
and they used up two thousand of them in in the war
so they're going to have to do another contract to restock that to get ready in case something else is needed
but it it it
would that be uh
well let's see
two thousand out of eleven thousand that's about a little over twenty per cent uh
i i should imagine that that would be to keep it at a level those levels i guess that that were originally appropriated w- was when the soviet threat i guess was perceived as being a greater one
i do worry about what nuclear weapons are left in the territories uh in their territory over there and who's controlling them
tha- that's true
i i don't know what amount of what amount of our hardware would stop some fanatic i guess from doing anything uh that would be irrational
well of course now we used up twenty per cents per cent of that inventory
and uh uh uh t i also makes the missile which was the the t v laser guided bombs and and a big percentage of that was expended as well
that n- that w- that was just a matter of
oh what is the name of that
uh it's called paveway
and uh a big percentage of that was used up during that conflict also
so tho- those are two areas in which t i stands to to gain some some short term business to restock that
well uh i'm
uh i guess uh it
talking about the taxes in general and that that was an area that i i perceive as not being the best expenditure for the amount of dollar that we're taxed for uh in the area of defense
or perhaps we have paid too much there
and and it's it's a cliche
but i see it myself
oh no doubt
i i i don't know uh
i kn- i'm familiar with some some upbeat school areas
so i don't totally agree with the the great uh uh with the with the great ex- expenditure of effort and time there
but i guess overall because i guess i'm not associated with what ghetto schools and and uh and uh rural school systems are like i i should imagine that would take an enormous expenditure
as a matter of fact in texas um we've had our school funding system declared unconstitutional by the a state judge
and uh the legislature just passed what they called a robin hood bill which
basically what it does is it takes extra money from the more affluent school districts that are that are you know come from local taxes and send them to other parts of the state that are not so affluent
they they don't have a broad based income tax that funds the educational system
or is it all funded out of local taxes
to g- to give you some perspective this this town that i had lived in for sometime in nineteen eighty-three was funded sixty-five per cent by state funds
but they forgot to put in the state budget the money to pay for it
and they dumped it all on the local school districts
so so what ended up happening was was a was a shift
we went to sixty-five per cent state funding to sixty-five per cent local funding in a matter of four years and uh i mean
uh do you mean a a complete reversal
oh complete complete
and now even the money that's been raised for the local districts is being is going to be siphoned off and sent to other parts of the state
because i guess they can't raise that money in those those poorer districts huh
and and i have i have no problem with uh a certain uh floor level minimum level that's a standard uh that everybody uh ought to be able to have uh
but i am opposed to w- any attempts to restrict um local communities from taxing themselves above that to provide above the minimum
uh i uh i i do i i guess i am a s- uh a strong and staunch supporter of some subsidy for any forms of education
i mean by that i mean i'm a product myself
i have uh a a a a background of uh being uh getting my college education through the g i bill
but uh when i look at it to me uh it doesn't really make any difference
i don't think i would have gone on unless i had that financial uh easement made possible
and i i don't really care what it takes to qualify whether you're uh an an ex- whether you're a veteran or whether you
or unless uh or or you promise to even do something in the future i think that uh the that that the subsidy itself
or i guess the enactment of that form of legislation
would give many people who i i think i think i perceive the fact
at least what i read is that some younger people feel that education is priced out of their uh out of their uh budget
i know in the state of florida just today uh the the legislature uh adjourned
and uh they had completed a fifteen per cent increase in the in the uh state land grant colleges which which isn't i mean
to me it doesn't sound like a mo- lot of money
but i guess it would be for fifteen hundred dollars a year
and uh for an out of state student the tuition went up twenty-five per cent
they had to they had to raise uh community college taxes here a few years ago
but that uh i guess that goes along with the general idea that the federal government had to uh was expending so much money on defense uh that that the program now is a uh program now is uh
fees that that fund these things i guess that's trickled down to the states
the states now establish uh don't have enough money
so they they must charge fees uh
i i'm not too sure of that reasoning
but i guess to get back to the main topic i don't know whether i pay too much taxes
i i i travel extensively in europe and see enormous uh
people p- pay uh a great deal in taxes
there they tell me they they
some states they pay uh
in germany or in in england in some cases people in my income level at least allege that they pay up to six- fifty-five percent of their gross income in taxes
oh oh i can believe that
but but i'm not too sure when i put my property tax in my car tax my income tax and these myriad of uh
some sort of an airport departure tax uh uh a tax a sales tax which is getting to uh quite high levels
well i guarantee you you'd be paying a lot more in taxes i- if uh the democrats had more say
but i mean w- what's what's happened here is is is
i feel that that in the last ten years uh my taxes have gone up
i pay ex- uh
and and and
everybody everybody is
but that's been a republican government for the last ten years
well what what what they've been able to do is slow down the rate of increase
to keep it to keep it b- from becoming even more obnoxious
well this has been really interesting
and i've enjoyed our talk
you just uh we just say say good-bye
and that's it
um i think life uh
now i grew up on a farm
i grew up in um
well at that time i was in a uh trenton new jersey
so and it was a suburb of trenton
so i really had mixture of suburb
i see i see well lit- little bit different
i think though it was much slower and uh much more self-contained
i'm um i work in a high school
so uh i'm comparing my life when i was in high school thirty years ago to what i see these children doing
and the pressures on the children uh you know
but it's true they are so much greater
unreal unreal by comparison
oh i cannot believe uh what they're doing uh academically the demands on them
and uh and i can see why children do drop out
i can see i can see the uh you know
i i can remember as a child you know nobody ever worried about me wondering out at night and going where i wanted to go
it wasn't it didn't occur to nobody to worry that anything would happen to me
and you you didn't you didn't have to lock your door
and uh a lo-
but uh it's uh it's a lot different all though i guess twenty years a go now in this area things were um similar because twenty years ago
twenty twenty-five years ago is when we had the washington riots
and it reminded me of that
uh in twenty years ago
and uh i use to have to go over to patterson when those riots were going on
um i don't know though
it's it's kind of hard to really know because of
though the news media had those riots uh kind of blown up out of proportion
because i went there many times
i never i never saw a riot
because i lived right downtown
but you know it's it is interesting uh
they're different kind of dangers that face young people now and social pressures uh
the the kinds of diseases that you've got out the uh um
i mean the consequences is
i think the other thing is that uh we have taken some rather drastic turns in our in our education and the way we approach things as of maybe starting back when when i'm number one you know and uh uh uh worrying about self and not uh seeing the consequences of the disintegration of the family
and uh and there have been many things that have happened that have not encouraged closeness of families and uh support for young people that the kind of support that they need
if you don't have some kind of of basic believe or something down inside of you
then it's very difficult to uh have anything to turn to
when you got when you've got something facing you like that
i also being involved in the school system see so many of the problem children coming from their parents um children who will lie and cheat
and you approach their parents
and their parents are constantly justify them rather then to
uh you know they're constantly
and you can see exactly
you can as a teacher can't hold a child accountable
and you can't make up in a classroom of one hour a day
and you're you get mixed signals
so it's it's not always the school's systems
i see some flickers of of uh of good directions turning
but whether they're soon enough and fast enough i don't know
of course life is a lot more complicated too in ways um
uh you know with farming being so mechanized
uh people working on the family farm which was a traditional american way that becomes less and less likely
factory jobs are so much more um uh sophisticated
and the kinds of knowledge that uh you know
it it's requiring an increasingly sophisticated labor force
and you worry when
and there's so much so so many people on the lower end of those who who are going to be the the drop outs and the and the poor and the homeless and whatnot
you know these the sex and drugs on the young children and the unborn children
uh in terms of what it's going to mean to a society
it's just it just is almost overwhelming sometimes when you think
of of the jobs that is out there to be done
well it sure is
uh not that i really think that they were perfect ten twenty or thirty years ago
i think as uh as uh mother you know i use to think sometimes it's not so much uh it's not so much the kids
to try to keep all wash done and all the things done and you know and everything
and all the things demanded of the mother too i mean
uh i look at my mother's life
i mean she she didn't work um um
for a long time whe- when i was very young she didn't drive
uh she learned to drive i think when i was um a teenager
and her life was a lot simpler
and i sit here
right and and children's lives were simpler because mother was there
and and when there's nobody there
i always thought too that you know people worrying about going to work when their child when their children are little
and i and i think that's sad if they have to because they miss so much
but i i believed after having a few teenagers that the worst time you could go
but it's that you are there when they need you
uh uh i find working in a high school is very helpful because it let's me be a little more tolerant and understanding of what people do
and it keeps me from being the old fogy
so but at the same time
but that's the same
or where home
but that helps a lot
it's uh it uh it does
and he opted to go into a day care center where she could have her children with her
and uh and looked a long time before she found one that was laid back enough so they she would be able to interact with them
and uh and so i
you know good kind of experience as well
that's that is that is so true
and it's not that always that the children always say something
but every once in awhile they'll come up and make a comment
and you realize it's important that uh
and yet you know we have to make that choice
what was what was your name again
and your name was
well i think probably that we've just about
well i enjoyed talking with you
oh well uh when they were little we did lots of reading and playing and going to parks
b- i had two boys
so we would go to the football field and set off model rockets
uh my children are um are swimmers
and so as they were growing up much of uh our um normal life outside of school and everything arou- uh revolved around their swimming
so in order to have a reason for being there especially as they got older i became involved in it too
so we were always together at their meets
oh well that's good
um mine were not terribly sporting
uh they both did t-ball and soccer in grade school
but neither one of them carried on uh the sports after that
the the boys tried those
but they w- they did go in
they started swimming when they were oh seven and eight
and they really loved it
and they're swimming both c-
and the other will continue to swim in college
and they're fortunate
they ma- even made nationals
oh that's great
and so we would drive up to see that when w- whenever it was reasonably close
but we did a lot of things um
and we tried to do things both together and individually with the children um
so we we would always go in for the museums
that's always a big uh thing
and one of my children is uh also a musician
so um one of the things that we did with him a lot was to go
and my other child um uh is in big into tropical fish
so our whole family we take family trips to different places to visit fish stores or go to fish shows
my goodness uh
well we didn't have any uh avid uh activities like that
they they were interested in a lot of things
but nothing to quite that depth i guess
but we would
oh my goodness
well we did go to things like aquariums and uh
our vacations have always been um uh uh as as they've gotten older
but as they got older we tried to pattern our vacations where we would travel and do things
and that there would be a a feature each day
one summer we uh we went up to new england
and we went to the marble quarries up there and uh
so we did you know we did try
and of course we learned too
but uh and uh i don't know
well i started working half-time when uh they were at the nursery school
and i i started working part-time when they were in um junior high school and high school
and now and i worked in the school system
and now i work a full school day
but that leaves me off on holidays and summers
so it was a it was a you know
well uh i think it uh they need you in different ways
and but it's not quite so much the hand-holding and peanut butter and jelly making
that's that's for sure
what do you do you have any feelings as to the trends that you see
well it lo-
and i don't think it needs to be the mothers
but i think it would be nice if some of the parents would be around for a few more hours
when they you know
and my mother and i have talked about it to how important it was when i came home from school
but there were always things that just tumbled out
and uh uh granted the child doesn't always think that they're sharing it
when they when it's not there they miss it
but i d- i also think that's at least in my experience truer of girls than boys
i i i realize that
but it's funny
but occasionally they do
and you want
and when they do there's a reason for it that they're sharing it
and you want to be avail- at least i've wanted to be available when they for some reason they had they were bouncing something off of me
and it was uh
or or if my husband
or what would they do
uh but it has been um it's been interesting and particularly i i think because the society in which we live families are separated
um i mean i grew up in a situation where on weekends we were always visiting relatives
well i did too
we were close to my uh maternal grandparents i mean just a few miles
and uh close enough to visit my paternal grandparents you know quite often
see and we're
we i i grew up with you know
um and it was sort of an italian family
um but my children
we although we have some relatives in the area that we we see we
well when my kids were quite small
uh we lived close to both sets of grandparents
and they saw them a lot
but they don't have any cousins uh
or they didn't
their uh their cousins are about ten years younger
so uh they never played together or anything
and there are only two of them
and they didn't live in the same town
and i i just sort of think yeah
the trend of of families and time
where where parents are spending less time you don't have the families too to take up the gap
and so the kids in some ways are are are suffering a little bit in that uh the model the role models that get the the the family issues that get discussed
so we we try to to do it as well as we can
and cousins and aunts and uncles
and we do
but it's although it's not the same we are
and that's part of i think teaching too is what a family is like
because then h- how do they pattern their own
well everyone makes it's own model
but uh i- it seems that there should be some continuity
and it's helpful to have uh things that become family traditions and that sort of thing
well we've always we have had this tradition um that we always go out before christmas and cut our own tree
and that's always been a little bit of a tradition that we've had
so this was one thing that we um weren't able to do this year
but we did that for e- from the time the children were young enough to realize what it was until uh our older son went away to college
oh well that's the kind of thing that they will remember though
and we have advent calendars still
from the time that they came you know to
it was a christmas tree that had uh a little trinket for each day
and then you took it off and put it on the tree
so at the end you had a decorated tree
well o- ours is uh
and it finally got moth-eaten
a friend uh a friend of mine from denmark hand appliqu3ed one for each child
and i mean they look today as new as they did when they gave them to she gave them to us
and there's a ring
and you buy a present
oh i see
and you wrap the present up
and i mean the presents have gone from the days when they were very young to a little box of band-aids and an eraser and things
to today where um sometimes i put a little gift if i see something that's uh occasionally a christmas tree decoration which they will save for their their future
uh pieces of candy
so i think as they're getting in college i just
oh i'm sure he appreciated that
for my older boy that was in college i put a dollar bill for each day which was the equivalent well it was the equivalent of a christmas present
but it was uh and it was and you know it was fun
but that's a tradition
and they will those will be passed on to them when they when they get married and leave
well you were saying what other trends are there
and one just occurred to me because i was editing a book about it recently
and that is the trend in a lot of uh lower class areas for the grandmothers to be raising the children
we um as i said living in an area of washington d c
we definitely see this uh
and uh it's that grandmother figure not only raising her own children but raising um children from the streets too frequently
well we had a sociologist at the center where i work who was writing a book on uh multigeneration
um matriarchies in a way
uh where the tradition in the family has been for a teenaged daughter to have a baby while she's still living at home with the mother
well this is a this is a si-
uh this is in fact uh
we've been studying this in our school that um this is one of the symptoms or not the symptoms
well myrna how do you get your news news
uh most of it is from the radio uh
we usually watch the local news and the the uh national news both
i uh i find that uh
and i i read a lot for school
and i find i have no patience to really read a newspaper because i just i'm reading so much all the time
and i really enjoy just sitting down and watching a news broadcast
well you can always get up and leave that
tha- tha- yeah that's true
uh i d- i just don't seem to have time to sit down and read the paper
it's already you know time for the news to come on
so it's so much easier to sit there
and besides i can be doing other things and still listen to the news
i i agree
a lot of times i eat while i'm uh watching the news
is there any uh
what did you think about the coverage like over in the uh persian gulf
it was it you know
for a while when we were really interested uh we saw it all the time
and then you know the special reports and the extended news coverage i thought was really good
and you could always find some channel that had something on
but you didn't necessarily have to watch the same thing all the time
i noticed that one thing that that t i did you know they had uh uh they used to have well they do have television monitors stationed throughout our buildings
and they used to have a program called t news and just updates of of different things that were going on within t i
well when all the the mess with uh uh in the persian gulf came about they started carrying c n n
well now they have had so much good response from this
huh well that's great
so we can always run upstairs and you know
ca- get a quickie update on what's going on if we really want to
or if yo- you have a break in the middle of the day you take a coffee break you can always stay informed
that's um i've found that when i i don't have cable television anymore uh when i moved went back to graduate school i just didn't have the money to buy ge- rent a cable t v line or whatever you know
so i don't get c n n uh which was a big disappointment
and sometimes i teach in the evening
so i'll miss the evening news
and uh you could always catch a good news program at eight o'clock or nine o'clock on c n n
i think that's that really has changed the way uh i look at the news
and we just don't have it available out there where we are
but when we did have it uh we that's what we usually watched
and sometimes we'd watch the weather stations
that's uh same
when i had it i i watched it you know religiously for half an hour
and then you could go on you know to do what else you wanted to do
i find i i read very little
i don't even get a regular newspaper and uh because uh i i don't drive that much
i uh i find i spend so little time in the ra- in the car that i don't really listen to the radio you know
so so television is my main new source
oh i get that too because i i'm in a van pool
and i'm in the van you know uh two hours a day
and in the in the morning i try to sleep because it's it's dark thirty
but in but in the afternoon uh i try to read
so i can can uh not pay attention to what our driver is doing
and i'm in the baltimore washington area
and i know they do van pool a lot here from some of the outer areas
but if you want a nicer home you know beyond the suburbs you know
are are you in baltimore itself
i am i am right outside baltimore
and i go to a br- a campus of the university of maryland that is just less than a mile from my house
so i i'm actually in baltimore
u- well no
in in d c area
and uh uh the other one is uh uh her husband is in the m- navy
and he's stationed at bethesda
oh that's that's that's a really nice area bethesda area
it's um it's funny
but there is a big difference in things like property values
and um the closer you get to washingt- d c the more expensive it is
and um the the uh different slant
washington it really is a uh uh an international city where baltimore is hometown baltimore
you know it there's really uh
i'd i'd rather have baltimore with the home town atmosphere
i i like it i like it a little bit better too
it's interesting though um to meet different populations
i i'm just now being uh from pittsburgh originally
and i find that really interesting you know to imagine
here is somebody that was in china le- two years ago when all that was going on in in uh beijing
you know that that's an interesting uh interesting perspective
but i i really
much much like the hometown area
and i think that also goes
you you can watch different news
and i really do watch baltimore news
you know that really makes
i don't really bother with the washington station because i just it's so far removed from what i'm interested in
well most of what they're talking about in washington is is the
they in fact they just it was just a big thing recently
um they had to impose a curfew that uh in two of the areas in uh in the washington suburbs
they've gotten rid of that really bad mayor and then uh brought in
and then came a woman that's um
so that's good
so she has good national ties
but she also was um something like a t- uh state auditor or something like that before this position
and then she left that to get a position with the democratic party
and now she ran for mayor
so she's uh fiscally she's pretty tight and uh she's cleaning house
an and it looks like hopefully she'll do a nice job uh for washington you know which is
you know from what i pick up on the news uh it's a difficult process you know to get rid of a a bad mayor
well i know both of my kids didn't want to live anywhere around the the downtown areas
and i can't remember where the other one lives
but those are ni- germantown is a nice area
well they might be car pooling too
uh well now i i think he carpools
because he's got fairly regular hours since he came back
but uh now my daughter ha- they have probably been carpooling together in fact
because she had been called back up active duty
and then she was supposed to have gotten out of active duty as of last friday
so i haven't talked to them this weekend
but she was
but she had she had le- called and left a message on our recorder
but i had that from all my kids except for one
oh that's good
well i guess we should stop now
well i thank you for calling
uh uh so do i
i i really enjoyed it
it's it's so funny when you live in one part of the country you only see that perspective
it's interesting to see the the wider world
so i enjoy it
hey thanks a lot and and bye
well i do not know
i mean you have heard about dallas
and th- the crime here is pretty bad
well rome is pretty small
we hear a lot about uh new york city
and i am i am afraid to go down there because you know i mean you hear about people getting mugged
and it is stripped when you come back
that is uh probably enough to see
um are you in college right now
i am i work at for the air force
so there is a base up here
that's inter- interesting concept
the they uh minimize the access
but even so we had a uh uh
we had some people come in and uh like attack one of the planes because they were protesting uh
well dallas uh
we lived in minneapolis uh
and dallas is pretty uh
well we live in north tex- north dallas which is like a suburb near a suburb called plano
so we are out of the city
but it is uh it is bad everywhere in terms of uh you know the handgun situation um the number of rapes the number of muggings
just it is it is
but it is pretty scary
you know people put bars on their windows in certain neighborhoods
you know they call them ornamental grates
but they are still bars
but uh i do not know
i mean the jails are crowded
i i i am not a criminal justice specialist
so i do not know what you know what can be done
i do not i do not know
like i when i was h- i went home
but i went home
and we were watching t v
and this thing came on where these a group of like five or six guys went and filmed themselves beating up people in the street and and robbing them
and it was really disgusting
and my mom was like they should just be all shot right now
and i mean you he-
like that girl in new york that got beat up by you know
they were not i think they were early twenties
but they so they weren't you know
and were they uh were they were they obviously poor or depri- you know
like i say s-
how s- deprived could they be if they had a camcorder
and i mean that is one big thing down here
i mean they have like uh
and they are not all young
i mean they are eighteen to twenty-four some of the young men and women
but i mean you can you can see the crime stoppers ads on television
and they are
sometimes it is the same people that have been that have been observed
and they still can't catch them
and you are wondering how you know um we lived in minneapolis and wisconsin
i mean there was all kind of
i i know i i i know it is getting worse
i do not know what the world is or is not uh
in a small town in wisconsin near madison um a young boy somehow got a hold of a shotgun
and the child had
and he they said that he was twelve years old
and he had uh he had not uh displayed any tendencies deviant or disturbed or whatever you
and you are thinking to yourself um
you know you must
i think t v is bad because they uh show all sorts of violence on
and i do not think a lot of parents
i mean i do not i do not know how it is in the air force base
but uh i just do not think a lot of people because of the economy both need to work you know
they do not they do not talk to their kids and take them out
and and are not there all the time
so the kids are off to their own devices a lot
but i mean i sure knew as heck when i was growing up that uh my parents were
and i was the subordinate
and you know
and i do not think i do not know i think today a lot of parents um are ruled by their kids
when you go to a restaurant and like kids are running all over the place they
i mean they are not learning how to uh well like boundaries
i mean i do not i see it in work place too sometimes
but you sound a little bit
but i am in my thirties
and i uh i see uh even people that work with me that are ten years younger
that you know they kind of have an attitude that
but it's that's just what it is
i i see that too in the air force
a lot of uh
and so uh people outside the air force doing engineering get paid a lot more than we do
and so all the young engineers are like well i am just going you know
and i am like you are the one who signed up
and the air force is one of the bitter better military supposedly m- m- military experiences
i mean that is
so i am
but uh they pay for my college
i mean and that's
you know at least the air force is
i do not know i just uh i am nervous in dallas
i mean i you know i mean i go to like an aerobics class or something
and i you know uh seventy women in a jazzercise class in a public uh parks and rec building
and you are supposed to feel safe
but then there are all these
it does not matter race
but you know it is an inter racial mix
and you see these guys standing there watching you jump around in your
and i do not even think that way
but i mean you just think to yourself
nobody can think that that it can't happen to them
or where they are at you know
and you never know who is watching either
i mean did you
we uh went to new orleans for four days and came back late last night driving
and it is about seven hours
um and that is a very
uh in terms of the french quarter and all of the things you hear about
but the crime is so bad there
how to carry your wallet uh
oh i would hate to be there during mardi gras
uh the when we came back i do not know if you have seen
and on the cover of time magazine there is a girl she is in boston
college freshman i college coed
i mean and it just
sh- she looked anguished
i mean it was really just sad
i mean did not pick it up and read it
but i should have
but i just looked at the picture and thought what a world
i mean i do not
i do not have any uh cure
it is it is really scary
i mean i they we lease out a really nice two story town home in north dallas
and they have a real big thing here
people i mean even dry cleaners knock on the door and are soliciting you know
they everybody wants your business kind of thing
and my husband is the kind of guy he's he's sometime
and i think sometimes it is just he and i are very different in terms of that
i i mean i basically have started not to trust anybody in general street smarts
and uh he opened the door
and i was real upset
and i probably got more nasty
but i just said howard
oh my god
i would not i mean
well you you
or people you know
and it does i mean it is it is not a reason
i mean i have been to new york
uh but it is not any worse
i used to work for a mortgage company that was owned by uh
and i know i never felt
i mean i have been to downtown new york city
and i have been to downtown boston
and i never felt any safer on milk street in boston staying at the meridian
but i mean i never felt any safer there than i did in any other city i have been in you know
so i would say one thing
do not deny yourself the new york exper- bu- experience but go with people that you know
but i mean it yeah i do not know
i mean i i guess i could go on and on about what to do about criminals uh
i think our justice system needs to be stricter i mean because everyone they do it
and then they get out in a couple of years it seems like
are the new york uh are the new york
are they paroling uh like murderers
and i mean here it is just a real big deal
and then they are out doing it again
i do not i do not know because i am not real up on a lot of news things
but you know you just hear about that that you know
and you are like why are they repeating
and then you think i mean i ha- i mean i can remember i have not been out of school that long
but it has been at least ten years
and you think to yourself was it that bad back then
or is it just
is it just that more people think there is like excitement in it you know
i mean people that may have been close to the edge just go over because they see something or read something
there was a case of uh a couple of kids fifteen year olds
so they they picked on this kid who was like new in town
and they were like well no one was going to miss him anyway you know
and it like
ugh that is horrible
i- i- it is yeah isn't it something
i mean i i have a i am originally from pittsburgh pennsylvania
and i have a niece and nephew
and i just uh i mean
you know it is just i think kids get too much too fast
in atlanta where my inlaws live uh they had that thing you know the high top sneakers
oh for the sneakers
or the or the jackets the team like the raiders and the caps
you know stealing the hundred dollar jackets
uh i mean it is i guess it goes from the most petty like that to like what you were saying that they in boston
it seems like crime is turning into a pastime instead of like you know be
um what do you think
well the the the major cause it seems up here is exc-
so it's kind of hard for me to tell what would happen if i lived in some of the valleys inland
but the major cause here and we always seem to and it seems to be validated by the press is the car pollution
uh car pollution seems to be the one and only thing that that i can really put my finger on here
um that isn't the same in the washington area because we don't have any major um industry except for uh government and services
and the the transportation situation is such that uh all the car pollution is is absolutely awful
um also the worth of the hub of three airports
in this general area there is uh national dulles and then uh baltimore washington
interestingly some of the information i've been reading indicates that the amount of air pollution from uh uh airplanes is extraordinary
and that's always something that you know you just don't real you don't think about
well most people talk about the noise pollution from airplanes rather than the air pollution
but the uh
you know uh i- i guess it talked about all types of pollution
i happen to r- just read something the other day at least in the boston paper there were three things that that come to note
and now they've located another one or la- rather an expanding one in the northern hemisphere
so i'm quite concerned
i don't think it's involved any longer with with uh hair sprays or those th-
i think it's now is what uh from what i understand it's air conditioning units
and i do quite a bit of business in washington
i mean you know what it's like here
is is the un-
and i guess refrigerators
so solutions to this
you know improved
well i guess the fur- the to me the first thing is i wish society would get as upset about this as you do get getting people upset about animal rights
i mean this is so so basic
but uh in terms of demanding it's just not caused
but demanding that uh we can spend so much money on certain things but that research really be directed toward um improvement of polluting vehicles and not just cars but also buses um planes that something can be done i me- i can't imagine that well
well i i th-
i think that it can be done simply because uh uh we've we've
and no lead gas was came to the pumps
and and that's been done
there's the lead pollution has that problem essentially i guess because it was at crisis proportions was was licked
and i think that there are th- there are solutions
and that for buses
certainly we don't even need a need a research anymore
and passing the law depends on how heavy the car industry the automobile lobby is
well and also to make it economically feasible
uh and per- ti- also in buses
oh yeah well
that you know
that that the the smell is awful
and but you know i was reading the other day not to go on with this but that
so i guess you're
but even of course in the longer term just to get away from fossil fuels
i mean i'm i'm thinking of research in that direction rather than
we we've taken the intermediate step
but i don't think
well we you know up here in new england uh where i've
practically a you know guerilla war up here
uh my daughters marched in the uh uh against the seabrook
and i kind of uh
my feelings were that we needed this bridge to to uh to m- m- jump from whatever it was going to be from fossil fuel to whatever it was going to be
un- unfortunately though i think the oil companies have lied to us for years
so we really don't know whether there's enough fossil fuel left
or there isn't
and uh and uh
but with the pollution issue uh fossil fuel is not the way to go anyway
uh so you've to lo- you've got to look elsewhere
so uh but it is something that's a little frightening
and in fact well i
i have two sons uh well
and the other will be going in september
and we just feel that when we leave uh this area w- we're going north not south
uh i like the mentality north
and i also like the fresher air up there
so i mean that's the way we will be going
but um so i i- i'd be interested in having spoken with somebody also from the far west on this issue to see how they their attitudes are
well since since texas and louisiana and uh california that in that ranking order the worst pollutants in america
i mean i read that the other day
i mean louisi- louisiana for a small state w- it was amazing
but it's the industrial pollution i should imagine
and california seems to be taking steps
i mean you you read about the the fairly fairly stiff laws they put in on cars now they're they're enforcing
but uh again uh that didn't occur without a crisis
i mean even california was notorious for its smog years ago
well the greatest thing that happened to pollution in the last couple of years as far as i'm concerned is the no smoking rules
and it it really is a pleasure for me although i guess smokers don't
well that that's that's person- that's personal air pollution
that was its most personal personal uh pollution that i can think of
well i i d- definitely advance that
well listen i enjoyed speaking with you
and let's hope some there are other people that feel the same way
my mother's side of the family is quite large or well was quite large at one time
back uh early on they used to to rotate them from hou- from som- to to different people's houses
were they like all in dallas
uh no no not no
this was well i am actually from mississippi
it it was around there generally
uh that's where the family grew
and it was not only in mississippi in some other places
so it was uh it was a big deal
but uh they tried to to centralize it in one spot
so in the past couple of years they had it at a state park every year
we rent a pavilion and
and that's usually works out to be pretty good
and uh they will rent a pavilion on a weekend
in fact uh this past sunday was the was the reunion
but i did not get to go
uh i have
uh just uh the distance involved
uh just not
and uh i
it's kind of hard to get her
but i am going to to uh hopefully next year get to go back cause uh a lot of the family has not uh on her side my mother's side has not seen you know my daughter
and is your mother still living
oh so so you go back and visit with her anyway
i mean either way there was family reunion time
right i i usually see her a
so that's no no big thing
but uh i uh i do i do enjoy the reunions
the only problem is that now uh originally when we had them uh they were mainly
uh brothers and sisters
so it was a large reunion of of of that group uh from that descendants
and uh a lot of those people have
and at time you know they all knew one another
and now it has gotten uh that uh a lot of those people are d- have uh have died off
or you know what we are left with is the the relatives of of of that group
and so uh it's not quite as close as it used to be
so i think people feel less of a desire to really go
wh- why do you think that it's less close than it used to be
well i i just think that uh you know at that ti-
you know the those were all brothers and sisters a lot
and or they were all in the same ar- geographical location
you know back around you know in the twenties and thirties when they were growing up uh you know they were all located together
and as as time grew i mean when time went on the family grew and moved away and so forth
like say the kids of those people who are not you know anywhere near one another and i do not think they feel the
but that's just how it is
my mother was complaining last year about th- you know
is that just family's lack of priority anymore maybe yes
you know that's just i think that's just
but you know i have
uh i i
it's just the way you know i think society is now is that we are not we do not have the extensive family we used to
it's more of a you know a smaller
and you know we
as opposed to the extended family of people that we may or may not remember or know you know very well
it really makes an effort on to
it requires a lot of effort to to to do that sort of thing
i mean i i used to enjoy going
i mean i still do kind of enjoy it
but uh it's it does not it's not as many people there that i really really enjoy seeing
you know i
um um no
tha- in that
but then again uh well i you know i have some aunts that uh i i i do
but i feel closer to them because i kind of grew up with them
uh you know and and generally when i was growing up a lot of those people the only time i ever saw them was at the reunion
so uh you do not really feel that
in my my uh father's family we get together
they had chosen santa barbara california for this summer and and did not get enough people that were willing to go that far
because most of us live either in the midwest or like in the texas oklahoma area
but we have a letter a family letter
and it usually goes through me twice a year
and what you do is take out the last letter you wrote that's on the bottom and put the your new letter on the top
and then that's the way it's kept in order
so you are kind of
and i said well let's start this letter
and it just never
and that's as far as
and and but we are going in a couple of weeks to the next one in scottsdale arizona
we are real glad we got together because since that that time there were only like two of the one sister and one sister-in-law of the original family left
and the sister-in-law died
and the sister is in a nursing home
so we are glad that we took that opportunity two years ago
uh well since i initiated the call i guess i'll start off first
uh number one i have absolutely no problem with random testing uh
and i feel
so i really don't have a problem with it
i uh i've never
uh but my husband works
and they do have that at his place of employment
and neither of us have a problem with it
we've particularly like you said with the things that the airlines and and such
it's uh it's a scary thing to know that uh you just don't know what people are doing uh before they go to work
so and the the advertisements on television lately have been so uh
there have been so many you know
there's uh just about
like train tr- train wrecks and things like that that
i well i happen to be uh
and even in our field we have people that are in very high risk jobs
and we at the present time do not have random testing
and i am pushing towards that
i i honestly feel if people have nothing to hide they shouldn't have a problem with it
and if they are trying to hide something then i have to know that because we're t- we're talking major liabilities
and i really you know
they they're talking about sports and sports personalities and all this stuff that i i would much much prefer having doctors and airline pilots tested
i i have a real fear
but that at some point something's going to happen
and they're showing it with aids
so why you know
they sh- they ought to start doing something with the drugs
so i really have no problem with it
well it's it's unfortunate i think that everyone doesn't have that opinion
uh some people just uh i've heard some people just talking in our group of friends that they just feel it's an invasion of privacy and things like that
but uh in the long run it seems to me it's kind of like what they keep talking about the uh the aids testing with doctors or dentists and things and how that you know
but you know those kind of things i'd like to know
i i've had a lot of dental work done
and the last dentist didn't even use gloves at all
so that kind of
and uh so that kind of thing really kind of concerns me
well that scares me because if th- that's the way they are
well you would think so
that is because well
and i worked for a dentist
and that's uh you know
you you come in contact with a lot of of blood and things like that
and it's real real dangerous
i i would think
but with all the accidents just with with uh everything happening with
you know just because of they don't know what their pilot's been doing and and things like that
well you where you're located i i do know texas instruments has random drug testing
and i think they've had it for several years
and they're program they had i don't think had a lot of uh problems associated with it
but uh my brother-in-law happens to work there
and it it sounded very positive
and i i think it's great
i i would like i would encourage it
well and you know if they do find someone who who is uh having a problem with drugs
as opposed to just letting the problem go on with without any uh support
because a lot of people seems like would probably obviously are trying to hide that uh from their employer and friends and family and things
and too many people are just dying
but the crime rate here is just astronomical
ours ours is changing
i live in a
and it's it's it's unbelievable what what what's going on and the drugs the selling of drugs
it's just it's just too loose
i just got a piece of paper the other day uh that now they have these
i have two little very little children under two and i got a piece of paper from from my husband's office
it's talking about these uh drug tattoos now that they have got
that look like it looks like a sticker
and it's for kid
so you said that you live in coppell
so what is your house like
oh well that's neat
brick and uh
well our side
well that's kind of neat that you can even though it's a duplex you can still buy
and our home is really too small for us right now
and at the time we just had a little baby that was five months old so we moved into this house in garland
it's in one of the older areas of town and one thing i really like is it has big trees everywhere you know lots of shade and squirrels and birds and real pretty
but the the house is real small it has less than a thousand square feet yeah
and now i have a daughter
the one that was five months old is seven years old and the one i have another one that's three and a half and have all these clothes and
well they advertised it as a three bedroom house because it has a built on addition room you know but the room that's built on doesn't have a closet so um the people that lived here before us did use it for a bedroom but we have always just put like our computer and extra toys and books and you know it's kind of a catch all room
but it sure is nice to have it when the kids come over to play
and i'm thankful i have two girls because they're in bunk beds
and so you know they can share a room and uh make for more space that way
and how old's the youngest
so um and right now we have their clothes on uh like double racks you know in the closet we made a higher and a lower and it works out fine
but they're just about to get too tall
where the dresses are beginning to drag you know
and um we're going to have to figure out a new idea
but we're we're kind of looking around and wanting to move into a bigger home uh hoping to be able to do that within a year or so so that would be nice
oh it's a wonderful place to live
so i don't really know
but they say that we have wonderful schools
well i think i've heard a lot uh about coppell schools that they're real good that's neat
do you do you hope to have children
or are you not planning on having any
well do you have any pets
oh of course those are my kids i have two dogs
well do they stay inside
well that's that's neat
well what are the colors in your house
uh um kind of a mauve and gray
oh i bet that's pretty
and then the kitchen's kind of a a country pink and country blue
and it's all done in cows
oh that's neat
yeah well our house was redo- uh
and it was redone before we moved in which
it was redone at the time probably when earth tones were in everything is like the carpet's kind of a tan and brown and has um paneling in the living room and lots of lots of tans and lots of browns but the good thing is you can bring out other colors from that you know so uh that's worked out good
in the in the kitchen they put real pretty blue and tan um wallpaper had done it up with blues
so that's nice
oh sounds pretty
it's close to my uh oldest daughter's school and that makes it really handy too and she really likes her school
so and we are so close to shopping
i've always imagined it kind of out away from everything
oh well that's nice
well you know now we have that new mall in lewisville and that's just like a mile or two from our house but when we first moved to coppell it's what six years ago we didn't even have a grocery store and now we have four
yeah but it does sound like it's definitely growing
oh much very much
i moved down here from chicago what twenty-three years ago and to lewisville and coppell's now about the size that lewisville was when when i moved down here
oh i see
well when we first moved here we moved here from lubbock and we almost moved to lewisville
that was our second choice yeah behind garland
we at the time we thought we might buy a mobile home
so do you have an opinion on credit cards
um i do
what what do you think about them
and um i just got it about eight six months ago and i find that it makes it a lot easier to get things that you generally wouldn't get
and then you don't stop to realize that you know
and pretty soon you owe a hundred dollars
and you don't stop to think about it
i got in trouble when i was in the service quite a few years ago like ten to fifteen thousand dollars in trouble
oh my goodness
and then you know so i eventually got it all paid
and i never use them unless i need to
so but they
i i made a rule with myself when i got one that if i couldn't pay it in full every month that i'd have to rip it up
and interest rates aren't none too shallow these days anyway
but i know a lot of people that get in trouble with them especially you know
and we have a bunch of college kids around here going to tech
and they seem to get in trouble with them a lot
i have i have a couple friends too that have about three of them maxed out
and they they can't do anything but work to try to pay them off
and and and like one of my friends she has hers is up to nine hundred dollars
and she do- she only earns like two hundred dollars a month because she's going to school
and and so i mean that's just enough to pay rent and buy like
yo- i guess you have to pay like twenty dollars each month is the so all she's paying is interest on hers every month
it just seems crazy to to me
well my wife got in trouble one time with hers
she was making like i don't know what she was making forty-five dollars a month i think
and fifteen dollars of it was because she was over the limit
and fifteen dollars of it was interest
so she was only paying in it fifteen dollars a month
you know we sat down and talked about it and discussed it
and it's it's come out pretty good
so we kind of discussed that a little bit and shot that idea down right quick
i i don't know
but i think they're too readily accessible and there's too many companies out there that are willing to give them to you and get you dra- get you trapped
i mean you can always file bankruptcy to get out of it
but that's a lot of pain and hassle
when you know in the olden days when my parents were growing up and we couldn't afford everything we didn't have such things as credit cards
and you know we had all the necessities
i think if card cards were as as stringent as say a a home mortgage loan or something like that where you have to you know be able to prove that you can afford this and the rest of your bills we probably wouldn't have the problems we have
so i guess they trade one for the other
but they still trade one for the other
well that's good
i'm nine- i'm twenty right now
so just going to school and
so it does kind of get in the
like last weekend was homecoming
and i needed a pair of shoes
so i just went out and bought them and
so do you just have two kids
uh we have a eighteen year old seventeen year old and a seven year old
oh are you
but right now i'm out in provo utah going to b y u
but this is a extra long one
they may not they must not have too much traffic on saturdays
uh fifteen or twenty i guess
i uh i get calls at work
well uh and that's an idea that's been around for kicked around for a long time
i don't know that it's ever been seriously considered uh as far as close to passing uh any legislation or anything like that
but uh i believe israel does that don't they for their
i think so uh
wel- everybody has to do has to do something
or maybe maybe theirs is in fact one year of military service for everyone
i don't think it's it's necessa- n-
it it couldn't be
but the m- military used to do it
but the idea that uh
and then uh country would benefit from one year from from everybody and even out the
for for kids in high school it could be in the summertime
well now that's a thought
uh you know um it it could even be done while they're doing another job while they're doing you know a job to make money
and people would have to be convinced that you know
i i think the the basic message is that giving is better than receiving
and that's not the kind of society we have right now
but uh but uh anything like this that came up whether it
and uh but most of those are at l- least it it's my opinion that most of those involve adults
adults who have the time to give and and uh you know the desire to to give
it's not uh you know it's not uh
maybe the maybe it cou- uh
but it should be if it's not
uh i suspect that the- yeah that that that that's not the thing that they that they don't feel it's open to them
it's just that they uh are more self-centered if you will and not not considering
but some schools some high schools have actually started a program of like a visitation program to uh you know areas economically uh say less advantaged areas
and uh they they promote service on the part of the kids to to uh some of those people
so at least that's a step in the right direction i guess
and uh now i didn- i don't know it di-
i i think you're right that that's not the not the way that the society these days is going
and i i think we need to we need to try to figure out some way to to turn that around that everybody
it's really it's really unfortunate because
and i have have done uh gone to work for american heart and just recently for the leukemia society
and there's there's no question that doing you know doing that kind of service you get a lot more out of it than uh than the people involved
uh it's it's really a gift to yourself
and and that's i think that's a really important lesson to learn
and and maybe that's why we have so many people in society who are not uh not really happy you know
well that could be
uh it really is better to give then to receive
i i agree with that
and uh and i i
but i- it it certainly seems to me that that uh uh things in in the last twenty-three years uh things hav- have definitely gone towards uh very much the concentration on self and and loss of loss of perspective in terms
so uh what was the last car repair you had
and it was getting rusty
and the thing that they forgot to do was to um to also look at the hose
and i had gone about oh two days with my new radiator flushed
and the hose burst
so i was stranded out on the highway
i i didn't do that thank goodness
but uh there seemed to be enough antifreeze in there you know left to do that
but it cost me all kind of money you know to have that repaired after they said they were going to they had repaired it
so that was that was a horrible experience just recently
oh i guess it's been awhile for me
i had the uh the water pump break on my car
i was traveling uh
i was going on my way home from thanksgiving and it broke like in the middle of nowhere
so i had to get it towed and then fixed
and big pain
oh oh i know i know
i know well you know uh living in dallas
you know we've got uh bumper to bumper eight lanes of traffic
and uh that was that was horrible
you know to have the you know
but my car is getting old
see it's about six years old now
so i got it right out of college
and so it's uh it's starting to show the wear and tear now
so when i cross that one i'll be okay
that uh that was my graduation present to myself
oh that's nice
so but gosh it's really starting to to wear
so i've been thinking especially now is a good time to buy a car
because i can't uh i don't know if i want to you know pay all these repairs now to start getting it fixed when it's starting to breakdown
and it's not worth it
so i don't know uh
because i i need to have it tuned you know tuned up and i don't know replace some of the belts
and i was looking at the uh
and so i was thinking just a lot of money
so i'm like well that's the last major purchase for this thing
well you have to in pennsylvania boy
well especially don't you have what a lot of salt on the ground
you got to like clean out the underneath of your car all the time when you get a chance
well rust and the and the body too huh
so i've been pretty lucky there
and go like that so
plus if something goes wrong i know who to blame
well i i think i'm getting too old for all that
my uh i had four brothers
and they used to drag me out underneath the car and stuff
so i can i can do all that stuff
but i i think i'd much prefer to pay the twenty-two ninety-five to to go have it done now
so i can get my hands dirty
i'm just getting getting to that age i guess
so working on the car is just not one of those things i want to spend my time on anymore
i'm trying to you know
so i wouldn't have to worry about which car was going to run
well that's nice
so but it became a hassle trying to keep up and maintain both of them
but i think i got rid of the wrong one
i soon i need a lot of repairs done on on this one
that was uh that was something else
well are our five minutes up
this must be a a hard category
i guess um you know
unless you're um you know big do-it-yourselfer um to you know fix up your own cars and and things like that
so but i guess they were talking about experiences
you know i uh uh i did
so i i do know something about the you know the really cold weather
and uh i've always lived down here in the south
and oh i took my car up there to their house
and um i guess i had a crack in the block
and when i got up there the car
all right uh well
so i'm going
and where are you from where are you calling from
i'm calling from uh provo utah
but i'm from plano texas
oh you are from plano
her husband is the new director of admissions at uh university of texas at dallas
anyway so where's your favorite place to go
uh generally we just go on family vacations to arizona
uh mainly just being with family is it
and my grandparents have a pool
so we go swimming
but we keep cool just by going swimming
and it's fun to be with my cousins
i'm going to go for uh almost two weeks this winter
oh my goodness
well actually i lived there
so i was there longer
but two weeks is the longest vacation i'll have ever taken there
so i'm kind of looking forward to that one
so i think i would like to go to arizona
i mean i was in phoenix in january last january
but it was rainy and icky
but i would like to go to tempe
so do you travel a lot
uh some yeah
well i've been a i was a travel agent
i mean i have been up until just a few months ago
but i'm thinking of going back to work
so you know a lot of good vacation spots huh
i lo- i know a lot of good places to go
but you definitely need to go to hawaii
and i'd like to take him there
and but he's traveled all over the united states
and i haven't
like i haven't been down south
where where do you live
we i live in yakima washington
so it's cold and rainy today
but we've had some pretty nice weather
so that's a pretty good deal
so do you go to school in provo utah
oh my goodness
i i am my only b-
but i'm my best customer
probably maybe the rejuvenating cream is the only other thing i would use
and i use the celltrex
oh my gosh
anyway so we're supposed to be talking about places to go
and you have not been to europe
actually since i grew up in texas i've only been here about two years and have gone skiing about three times a- well five times each season
you're going oh you are going to school
pretty pretty down there huh
i i said i do like to ski
so where have you skied
and it's it's kind of nice being up here just because it's all like a vacation in itself when you get to go
so you're a sophomore
so just you know
don't don't be in any hurry
i'm not i'm not
and that was just
i i mean i could have had that or a down payment on a new car
and i took the trip
and it was great
and uh i traveled with a group of sixteen other students
actually they there was two other graduating seniors besides myself
and we just had a ball
uh six weeks
so you should think about doing something like that
and she was there like all winter semester
well do you have a pet
and do and oh and two fish
and what do you have
well my husband
so we have a black labrador
but to me he belongs up in the field you know in the ranch in the farm
well because we finally negotiated that i was losing my mind uh he sleeps in the laundry room
and then he goes out for the day
but this this is a beautiful dog
and he is wonderful with our little girls
and he is he's comes from a purebred line
and there's nothing you could say bad about him except that i was more of a cat or a small dog person that you could sit in the chair and cuddle
and this is huge
you know course when he runs around the yard he just digs
but he does
and the worst part that i had with him he's he's three now was when he was uh about eight months old
and i did not know what to expect from a dog having not had one
and i left him in the kitchen with the little baby gates up while i was gone for about an hour
and i came home
and he had ripped my wallpaper off my wall
oh my word
and it was in the floor
and i just about lost it
and i called
and i said come home and get your dog
and so he said well puppies just chew when they're nervous and i well i wish you had told me you know
and it was about eight months later he ate a piece of the linoleum
and i didn't kn-
the the tile in the kitchen and picked a hole in it
so the last thing he did was when i had sat out a whole lot of begonias in the backyard and he dug them all up and brought them to the porch
and i told my husband
i said you know it's either me or the dog
and he looked at me like well you know
and every night when he comes home from work he hugs it and talks to him
and he's a good dog
so it's one of those things i'm just having to get used to
and that's why i laughed when they called with the topic
i thought oh boy do i have a pet
but i i grew up with cats
and i'm very comfortable
well she i had to have her put to sleep last june
oh i started to say then you broke your heart
oh it was awful
but and she just sat there on my lap you know
she just just waited
oh it was awful
but her hair
but the bad thing was though she would pee in my husband's shoes
you know and she just liked his shoes
and he'd have these dress sh- hundred dollar shoes
oh it was just bad
and my closet
and it was oh something
oh that's awful
oh it was terrible
and once she did it you know then she would i mean she wouldn't
oh anyway i i
and i would shut i would bar the closet doors
and would car- vac- uh clean the carpets
and oh dear it was just awful
well d- now does your cat sleep in the house
they are they are house cats
i uh well i have two cats right now
and of course
my kids my my fourteen year old son has an extra pillow on his bed just for the cat
but the cat doesn't destruct does it
see it doesn't do anything
oh no i i'm not going to have a dog
and uh they both got ran over
but were just my kids' friends
they would go jog- they would go with me when i would go running
and and the last one got hit uh as she was following my one of my sons across the road to the school
oh that is
and it just it's too heartbreaking
but they do dig up
and they just they just wreck things
and i'm not a dog person
well i'm not either
and it's just been
but it's just one of those concessions
but i kind of ignore him
now today's the first cold we've had in texas
and it's really cold and drizzly
and it's freezing and people are doing their fires
and i brought him in because he's just a wet mess out there
and he's in the laundry room with this little carpet square
and he's just huddled up like if you'll be nice to me i won't make
and then my daughters both have hamsters
and i i
and how old are your girls
and i gave in at christmas
and they have they keep their cages real clean
and they just sleep and eat bits of apple and carrots and
and i don't want to answer
i've i've got incoming calls
and i don't know why calling
i i hate to cut it off
so we'll just wait
well they'll cut us off pretty soon
well it's somebody calling for my kids you know
actually it's my son
and i have i've tried to start a fish tank and i keep losing all my fish
well they've uh statewide raises
they raise ours it seems like constantly
we just uh passed a new one uh
and uh we had passed a a provisional one that if if it did if they did locate here we would raise our taxes
but uh at least we thought we'd get something back from that
uh how do you feel about taxes
well it seems like a big politics game
like up here last year the governor was up for re-election
so he said the budget was fine
and then right after he won the election he said we owed a lot of money
so they raised all our taxes
and now it's election time again
so they're trying to lower them
so they're just talk about lowering them
but they never do
well actually they're going to here because they didn't have a budget for so long
so they raised the tax rate real high for the last three months of this year
and they're going to lower it for next year
but i'll see
i feel like the middle class people are supporting the nation and uh that the rich are not paying their share
and of course the poor can't afford it either
but uh i really feel like
and and i feel like you know
and uh i get tired of supporting the whole country
i mean i'm a a middle class barely
but uh i don't think the rich are paying mo- less not enough
i mean if you're in the the three three percent bracket and they take a third of your check every month well that's ridiculous
well i don't know many rich that don't have enough tax breaks to
i mean i'm talking about the really rich
well they should just tax everybody the same amount no matter what you make
now i'll go along with that
now i think that would be fair
and i you know
no no ifs ands and buts you know
no big elaborate laws that say uh you know call for a lot of enforcement or a lot of review
it's just you know you make this you pay ten percent
and uh they have not gotten it
so and and you withhold no matter what you do
so you ought to be saving up some every month to make up for all what they should be taking out
so now you know when you sign your w-four form or whatever w-two whatever that is then they always say do you want a extra amount for state
but it's been that way for the last probably ten years
or you come down to the end of the year
and you don't have it to give it to them
but you know if you have a lot of federal deduction it ends up hurting you state wise
and you end up owing you know
and you're going to owe fifteen hundred in state
and uh it's it's just ridiculous
but i i don't know
they just came up with a twenty-five percent increase on personal property in in oklahoma county and that is a chunk
uh i guess uh i've always been kind of interested in in space and stuff
read a lot of the the uh astronomy books and and stuff like that uh
have you been following the uh the progress of the space health code
uh to a degree
i haven't kept up as uh much as i would like
i've just been so busy uh
i think it's pretty exciting that they can uh
it would be interesting to see if they can find uh other planets that are that will be more habitable to uh you know uh humans
and uh yeah
i think i would be very interested in space travel in the future if uh if it you know if it is at all possible
well i wouldn't even mind uh being a pilot on one
or right now
but i'm probably getting a little too old for that
well they they just made leaps and jumps
i think a lot of our our technology we have is is quite a bit due to lot of the space travel uh uh equipment and stuff that
i agree uh
as a matter of fact we're the ones that i have been to houston to to you know to visit the uh space center out there
and uh one of the big advances that we use every day now is velcro and uh that vacuum uh little space program was one of the big you know backers of that
it's amazing you know
i don't know if you ever watch gallagher you know
i've h- seen him before
and and you know he he talks a lot on on velcro
wh- i- what would we do without it
yo- we were talking about that just the other day
there's there's a lot of a lot of little things that have come up
i know maybe some of the big things that uh uh
i don- uh i don't know
it's also just i've i've often pictured uh in my mind you know what it would be like to just what would you find if you just kept on going kept on going
uh i guess our minds are so uh uh what is it uh finite when we try and picture the universe as an infinite object
and it's hard to to see you know
i always thought well what do you do hit a brick wall eventually
that that is uh that is something that would be hard to think about
and something that is infinite and just incomprehensible
but uh yeah
i would like to see them uh do more in that area to make space travel more uh something that the ordinary person can uh en- enjoy
i know it's i think it's in people's nature to be the first to do something
and i i'd love to be the first one to step on a planet or some like you know
i think uh it's in everyone's nature to some degree to want to get out and explore something they haven't
or experience something you know indifferent
i think that's what made us uh progress to the state we are is our curiosity
there must be some better so- better way of doing this
a better place to be or whatever you know
so you you are always looking for something better
i know at work uh people always complain to me
i well you are always whining
it's i'm always looking for something better uh
and if you are just content with being you know with the way things are then you know then you must lead lead a pretty dull life
well they are always finding easier ways
and you know just because they don't talk about it or something like that
and they are doing it un- you know unconsciously
i guess uh you don't really think about it too much
it it's in a subconscious you know thing
you know somewhere they can sit down and write down what you know things that you've improved upon
but you just don't think about them
i think uh you know
we've gotten different programs at work you know to to uh make it visible to management that we are doing things better
so how many um credit cards do you have
um i think i'm down to one
oh my gosh
well how how do you use your credit card
i mean do you just keep it in reserve
i i well
the way i'd like to try and use it is um you you you make your purchases at at prime buying time and then you pay that off and don't use it until uh it's paid off
that's that's my ideal way
how how do you use it
and i and i use it
yeah that's understandable exactly
uh like uh my car uh had a major problem and seven hundred dollars
and uh things just come up
and you just never get to use it the way you'd really like to
well actually i do have quite a few more credit cards than you have
um and i use them you know
like my american express i use for you know gas things like that
and i pay that off monthly
and then um some other credit cards like store credit cards you know i do have them up there a little bit
but living in this area uh like i live fifteen miles west of washington d c it's a very expensive area
so sometimes you have no other choice if you need to buy something
well i i know i was up in there and a lot of credit cards
and i was just starting to get to where it was getting me in trouble so we just disposed of them paid them off and got out of it
well that was good that you had the opportunity to do that
now are you married that you both you and your wife use a credit card
well now we pretty much just pay cash for as much as we can there
our our only credit card is sears
so and i have that for automotive purposes
well well that's great
um everyone i know here uses um credit cards like they're going out of business
it's it's just too easy basically uh just get yourself in trouble with those
i have like a diner's club through my um where i work so that i use because i travel some
so i use that
and i don't really have to worry about that because i only use it for business
so i automatically have the money to pay it off
uh i wouldn't mind uh you know getting back into one if they would you know
and then they just keep wanting you to increase your limit and and if i can get one that'll keep my limit at five hundred and i can never go over that or something like that then that's fine
eventually get's up there to five thousand ten thousand whatever fifty thousand
so i don't know
but so i guess uh we've kind of exhausted this uh topic
what what can you
or you don't like them
i guess uh they don't care if we end it early
so uh hopefully uh you have a good thanksgiving
and and then uh maybe we'll talk again
well bye now
so how do you feel about capital punishment
well i i'm not really certain how i uh i'm not certain that that it does a lot of good i mean that it ends up ends up effectively uh uh uh avoiding a lot of the crimes that have capital punishment penalties
yet on the other hand uh i don't know
i mean there is things that
seems like it's it's it's the right thing to do
now you know i mean somebody a s- s- serial killer or somebody goes in and machine guns you know fifty fifty children in a school yard
i uh i have the same dilemma i think uh
it's you know it seems right sometimes
and then other times you don't know
i mean people like
i mean like the arab societies and stuff end up uh having
and and they're extremely severe
uh i you know i think to a certain degree the reason that it it doesn't serve as a deterrent uh may be because y- you never know if it's going to be a- applied right
un- unlike uh like in in arab societies if you get get caught stealing they chop off your hand
and and you walk around the rest of your life with one hand
and everybody knows exactly what what for
uh and you know and here with our court system and and ways of sort of screwing it around and stuff you can you can kind of always count on the fact
or or there is a good chance you're going to get off
and also it doesn't seem like it does that many harm
i mean sure their life is taken
but they'd spend the rest of their life in jail anyway
so i think sometimes they'd prefer just to get it over with
so it's more of the easy way out than making them pay for the con- for the you know what they've done
except that i mean the the average cost
uh you know and it's sort of a
but on the other hand uh uh you know i don't i don't know if it's that is that is that serious that they're really never going to be out of jail uh
but then again also you can't bring back lives that have been taken anyway
so uh it's
it seems by that by
doesn't ever really p- uh
oh i know
i mean you can't
it doesn't taking taking one more life doesn't doesn't doesn't re- get things back the way they were right
i don't know i i don't i really don't know uh
where where are you calling from
uh right now i'm in utah
but i'm from plano texas
oh i see
so uh uh what are the laws like in texas
it's texas is has is one of the one of the s- well
i guess there is more and more states that are that are going back to capital punishment
uh texas has had it for a while
once it was it was reallowed
i think it was outlawed for a while but uh by the supreme court i mean or the interpretation of the constitution
and it seems like everybody stopped
and then and then once they sort of reallowed it texas was one of the first to uh to actually uh implement it again
they do it by uh by do it by lethal injection
uh i'm originally from kansas
and in kansas also uh they they almost immediately put back capital punishment
and uh there they do it by hanging
still uh they have
i still remember the the the movie uh in cold blood
but have you seen the movie
and they do it that way
well they they show it
i mean the the movie was made in like nineteen sixty-two or something like that and so it's uh it's not particularly graphic
but on the other hand it's it's fairly impressive to watch them you know walk into the room with gallows
i think that capital punishment is is uh in t- in utah also
so but i think they d-
a long time ago i i remember my dad was telling me this i think that uh they do it by like a bunch of men have guns
and one of them has the real gun in it
has has a
so they don't know who killed
and the rest of them have blanks
i i certainly wouldn't want to be the executioner
i've always said that if i if i had to kill and clean and do my own my own meat i think i'd become a vegetarian
as long as you're sort of safely removed from it it seems seems not so so bad i guess
well what kind of car would i want to buy
the question is i mean would i want to buy
or would i would i probably actually
oh well if you if you had all your all the money in the world or something
in that case i'd i'd i don't know
i i my dream car for years was a was a porsche turbo
but uh i don't know if i'd want one of those now
of course i would want one if somebody was was given to me
but i maybe would buy a b m w
uh or or even a volvo
i've got a uh a dodge daytona
we just we well i have
but we just bought another used car a couple weeks ago actually
so what car do you drive
uh mine is a honda accord
and and um it's funny because after i bought it i was doing a lot of business traveling
some of the cars that i got were like the toyota camry and the nissan maxima and some of the competitors and um i don't like them as well except it wasn't really a fair comparison because those were automatics
and mine is a standard and the reason i got a standard was because i thought it handled a lot better it had a lot more pickup and everything
you get a little more control over when when it's doing the things it's doing
uh what what rental agent did you go to to actually rent to rent those kind of cars
um usually avis
but we have corporate contracts you know with the various companies so it depends on your destination too
uh-huh which is how i heard about this
i i uh i don't know
i would probably if i were to buy a car mys- you know with the constraints of real money i probably would would go with something like you know like a honda accord
one thing i i really liked about about the dodge daytona is the fact that they have uh this seven year warranty
um and it really saved us some big money once
it did huh
oh my gosh
they had a whole bunch of things that that sort of broke at the same time
and i had to pay twenty five for the
oh that was great
usually you know something breaks
and it's excluded
oh i see
well we we bought the extended the the extension and uh at the time we bought it it was like you know i don't know four hundred and twenty-five dollars or something extra
oh you got your money's worth
but you know we really debated at the beginning
and of course i'm glad i did it
but um we still have we still have like you know coup- three years left on it
well i've been lucky
mine hasn't had any trouble except last week a shopping cart crashed into it but i was real lucky because it just hit the um the lens to the light
well that was good
so it cost me twenty-five bucks to replace that
and the store will pay for it anyway
um if you were if you were going to uh buy a new car would you buy another uh another accord
um i probably wouldn't just because i already have one but you know if i had to make the choice again i yeah i i'm perfectly happy with what i decided um although we did just buy another car
and that's a legend um but it's it's a used one and um my husband has really wanted one for a long time
and the fact that you know this c- this car that i have has performed so well
and before that i also had an accord
it was a real old one and uh i bought that used
and it served me real well too
so he's been impressed with all the honda cars
she drives a uh i don't know is it legend it's a
but she's liked it um
but i i have i have never had
we bought a we only had one car for a long time
and and yet most of our usage of the car was just this little shuttle back and forth
and so uh i bought a used yugo just to be a little you know little car that i could care less about
oh well it's uh it's worked
i mean that's exactly what it is you know
it's just a it's a cheap little little car just to go you know run around town in and uh it's actually kind of fun to drive
you know getting back in the daytona now i almost don't like it you know it's like too too mushy
and it you know it's an automatic
and it's too
well that's what my husband thinks about my car now that he's had the legend it's windy
the steering you know you feel like you're in a boat or something you know
i i don't like it
and it's so uh
so uh what kind of home repair work have you done
well um done a little uh repair on the uh shingles on the roof recently
been pulling them up huh or just loosening them until the rain came in
but uh well i'm right
plano's just north of dallas and there are parts of downtown or near downtown dallas that are under water right now i guess
but you're probably what about halfway across the state from san antonio though aren't you
well we're up uh we're north and uh oh about uh i don't know uh eighty to a hundred miles south of the oklahoma line i guess
but you're still getting a good bit of the rain though
uh we did have a little bit of rain yesterday
and uh i suppose that means i should be uh getting up there to look at that uh shingle
but uh i had something else planned today
so i guess i'll let it go awhile
they're uh wood shake
uh as a matter of fact we've never had a leak actually yet
and uh uh just before we took possession of it we had a fellow go up there and do whatever needed to be done on the shingles
so i've just recently had to start looking at it myself
so it's a small problem so far
but i guess you just have to keep on top of it
uh we're in uh campus apartment buildings with flat top uh
oh then you don't have to do too much with it
oh it's pretty steep
uh parts of it are steeper than others
i imagine i imagine
and remember to yell geronimo
um have you been uh
was was the house reasonably new
or you been doing some remodeling work on it
actually they say that when the house is uh fifteen it's already old
but just take good care of it
we've uh the main thing that we've had with this house recently has been some uh squirming i call it of the foundation
we're just on a concrete slab you know but uh the soil right under this is a clay
and it uh
well it uh depending on it's moisture content it either swells up or shrinks
and uh of course the soil right under the slab retains it's moisture a lot longer and so during the dry season you have to water the foundation to keep your foundation from uh from uh drooping and uh but anytime there's a change in the weather like the temperature drastic changes in temperature or in uh moisture uh you get little spider web cracks all around uh windows and doors
well that sounds like a lot of fun
well usually what you do is just wait until you think it's stopped
and then you patch them up
um what is it like uh stucco walls or
uh well this is all uh it's all drywall uh i think with uh yeah
but uh somehow or other that does manage to uh show these little cracks
i remember my parents home is drywalled and then they uh almost like a small grade stucco type plastering over the drywall to give it a textured sort of a look
and made for kind of a hard shell on the on the drywall
that would that would be in terribly terribly exasperating to have the the slab floor like that swelling and giving like that
well the previous owner had a major problem with it because uh oh probably a variety of things
the only thing i've had lately is uh my kids got all these barbie
and uh i- it takes them less than a day
and they're broken in one way or another
but i don't know if that's just kids or if that's uh
and uh i don't think they're unduly rough
but maybe they are
but uh a lot of the little barbie sets
and they're easily lost and easily broken
well my daughter is twenty-one now
so it's been a while since we've had barbie things
it's been a while since they've uh gone through the barbie stuff
but we did have barbies we did have barbies and things
seems to me that that became a craze when she was already oh like you know third fourth fifth grade
so she wasn't in it for very long before she was out of it
but uh i don't remember her breaking a lot of stuff
don't remember her breaking uh
but i also don't remember lots of little pieces
well that's one thing they've got
camping on the beach and all of these come with oh like tiny tiny little plates and little sunglasses
and uh my three and a half year old has wanted this ken doll
and so i finally got her a ken doll
and uh less than a week later the arm was broken
but they were real good about replacing it
well uh i guess if they'll replace them then they assume they shouldn't have broken
well the the you know those little arms are supposed to twist almost any way
and she's not that strong that i would she's not that big of a girl that i think could really
the main thing that they've they had when my daughter was playing with barbies was just clothes
you know that was about it
and the barbie doll itself is usually pretty durable and that kind of stuff
and the main thing my kids seem to be into nowadays are electronics
my my children are twenty-one and twenty-five and twenty-eight
oh is that right
well do you see that there's a big problem with electronic things
we uh haven't had that much you know problem with things that we have bought
they seem to to last
in fact when they offer us extended warranties we we don't buy them because we've
and uh it seems like it's just a an added tack on
plus a lot of the credit cards now you know will guarantee
if you purchase on your credit card you know then they put an extended warranty on it if it doesn't work or if you have a problem with it in a certain period of time
so it seems like it's a waste of money
well you almost assume if you're going to have problems with it it's usually bef- before that warranty would expire
and like i've even bought on a recliner once i bought you know a a an extended warranty for cleaning and stuff like that
and i never used it
you never nee- even needed it
and so it seems ridiculous
and we don't even have a repairman come
or it means it's old enough that it's time to replace the whole thing
so i mean
we bought when we first married we bought one on our t v
it was a five year after the first five years
and it was ridiculous
and they charge you a pretty good price for them too
and you're trying to think oh maybe i'll need this
you never you always think gosh if i say no then i won't you know
well my husband finally just put his foot down
and he said we're not going to buy any of these anymore
and if it goes out well you know
and uh so we really have been fairly happy wi- with things
but now we take good care of things
and we don't uh run out and buy a lot of of things either
and since our kids aren't little anymore i'm not buying a lot of those little things
well you probably are real careful of the brands you buy
and the when you do buy things you
well you look at the consumer guide
and uh you go around
and you look at the different ones and find the ones that have the
so uh what do you think about child care
i mean i'd i'd wind up uh
well too many kids and and i think too many infections and things coming in
i mean i'm sure there's some good ones
but i just
i don't think that i would uh
i took uh cammy to a
and some ways i didn't
uh i think the ratio of kids to teacher is really important
well i think they had a they had two teachers
and i think there were twenty kids
but i only had her going two days
and most of the other kids were going more days
so that was probably my own fault that she didn't
oh you know one thing i noticed is uh uh just they were trying to get her to teach her to write her name
and uh i didn't notice it until this summer when i was working with her that she would bend her wrist all the way oh not in a natural sh- form
oh she did
and uh i was kind of m- mad that they had never noticed that and either pointed it out to me or or uh tried to say look you're holding your
sh- but she was
and uh i hadn't worked with her on writing at all at that point
she was uh it was last year
and uh then this summer i got the thing from the school that says things to work with the kids on
and i w-
well they'd never picked it out though
or just never said anything
and maybe that was
well one thing that's kind of different too though a preschool than than taking a a infant or
but i think it's hard to take kids to somebody you don't know and or unless you have awfully good
reliable uh people
well i think it's hard to leave them
and they usually adapt pretty well
it it is i think just hard to leave them because nobody will give them the kind of care their own
well and you know their kind of their schedules
and you know if they're upset and that type of a deal
i don't know how uh people uh that have young kids working work full time and and do it really without being stressed out all the time
i think it's well
then then on the other hand i think it's harder to stay home in some
and at the end of the day your house still feels like it's a mess
and you haven't got anything done
and what am i going to fix for supper
well uh the work never ends
it it doesn't
but i think for taking kids to a probably people that take them to uh preschools and day-cares full time oh
they would i don't know probably just feel a different uh
i think i just think it would be hard to do that full time
or is everything okay
and you know
donna um you said you have three children
what uh kinds of activities do you spend with them
um we have an eleven year old an eight year old and a three year old
so he spends time doing that with him planning and um practicing outside
um he's a real sports kind of person
so he plays tennis with with the kids
except the baby plays in the playground
and we do a lot of things with the kids on the computer
oh plus we watch a little t v together
uh my kids have a nintendo which they play
and my husband sometimes joins them with that
uh my little girl jennifer likes to do crafty things
and i'll take some time and do that with her
and of course we always read a bedtime story at night
and even the the older kids sometimes sit down and and will join in and listen to a story
and and usually once in a while he'll read the story to little one
but that's basically my job
so do you find it difficult to find time
or is it pretty natural
it is it is hard because you know at the end of your day you want time for yourself and and it
and that's kind of cutting into your your time
and with the kids getting older now on the weekends they get to the bed like at ten which really is late
but you know on school nights the two older ones get to bed about nine
and um now this weekend we'll have a baby-sitter come
and uh my husband and i will go out to dinner and come home and um probably not too late
you have to be a very unselfish person to to spend a lot of time with your kids i think
i last year um i had a little part time job in a private um high school tutoring um high school students with learning disabilities
and even just those two days just seemed like it was a lot
people that that can do it all
but with three kids and laundry and keeping the house the way i want it kept it is hard
and that's another thing
i'll take one of the kids with me grocery shopping um usually on the weekend
and that's kind of like a special time for just myself and my little girl or myself and my son
and they'll be my helper
and then they'll get to pick out some of those favorite snacks that they get to pick out
but it you know it's it's uh
and then of course they have a pretty um busy social calendar too
you fit it in with all that that
so what do you feel are the current trends in the way families spend time in general you know in america
i i think a lot of people a lot of people s- set their kids in front of the t v and h b o and rent movies and and
kind of leave them to their own means um
i think you know it's very very easy to fall into that trap
and i'm not um
but um um i think different parts of the country
oh that's good
you know but um
well families are facing a challenge
and we're you know thinking about having children sometime in the next couple of years
and it's it's very hard because when you get used to two salaries it's very hard to to cut back to one
and um um but you know if you have the type of job
and she can pick her hours
and that's a a great career
because she has such a flexible schedule
but it's very hard to uh spend time with the children and uh and your husband and do everything at once
but i do feel like it's important that you make the time for children because
well i think it's a big it's a big um responsibility
and you do have to give things up
i i personally feel that it is extremely important to be with your own child um for the at least for the first two years of their lives i mean if you
uh we have two and another one on the way
oh you have got uh young children then
uh we do
we have uh a six year old
and then uh our baby will be a year on monday
oh my goodness
and uh i don't think we really even want to find out
well we have got two boys and a girl also
well we have got two boys and a girl
and uh does it
maybe maybe you will get lucky and get a girl this time
we we kind of like our boys though too
well our boys one is uh he is in graduate school at a and m uh
oh my goodness
and the navy is sending him for his masters in ocean engineering and we have got another boy that is us out in maryland
he is a wildlife biologist uh
and our girl is thirteen
so we have got still all sorts of good activities since
you kind of got uh a span there huh
oh well what do you do with your seventh grader
well she is into a little bit of everything
she is uh loves riding horses
so she goes out riding as much
she just she knows people that does huh
oh does she
she is into uh
well she plays the flute in the band and
and she is into this uh odyssey of the mind thing which is uh takes a lot of time for uh
but that is where the kind of
well it is a program for advanced kids
and i i taught school for six years
so i do know about that program
well my wife is involved
and she kind of heads that up for these kids
and last year they they got uh the state level
but they uh got one local and uh one region
and they got a new mix of kids this time
so it keeps them busy
and oh uh-huh
huh well so does she go actually out into a different classroom with with uh other kids that are involved in this
well uh yes
but they well they have
well you probably know a peace group that uh
i think that uh this happens to be uh uh
but uh so
oh how neat
well uh as
well you will get to different levels
they like to uh both boy things
but we we do not have any real uh
like we don't really ski
oh well yeah
we we have done that
he in fact he just goes right out here
we have got quite a bit of snow uh
well you are welcome to keep that
well i grew up in wisconsin
i i had plenty of snow
and when i was a kid
and we have lived here about seventeen years
but we use to take all of the kids tobogganing and ice skating and all of that kind of stuff it is fun really
i i don't care if i ever see any
well i don't care if i ever see it
but keep it off of here
well uh i don't mind it
but uh uh the winter gets long
you know i get ready that
and it is too early yet
we do we do
come about march it gets you know a lot nicer
out oldest son when uh
you probably uh more up on this subject than i am
but the roles that women have played in the last pup- couple of year in our or couple of generations
well they've entered the work force more uh you know since world war two is when they started
and uh i think that that is you know very significant that the percentage of the work force today consists of such a high percent of women
you know where i've noticed it more i think is
and i have traveled most of my life
and i know just especially in the last oh ten years and really since
you know as far as boarding planes and driving cars and calling on customers
and even in our industry uh there was virtually really and truly no women as far as selling the type of things i sell
and even in the last five or six years boy we see more and more women being involved
and you know it's a it's a credit to them as far as how they're doing
you see more of that you see more of them uh leaving their children in the care of their husbands while they do travel too
you know i i go to a i have a club that i belong to on tuesday that
you know one of the girls travels quite extensively
and she says well my children have two parents
you know why not
so that that's a i think that's a change
and i think that's a change you're going to be seeing more of in the in the future people having that kind of attitude that the father's going to take more active role in child rearing
i think uh it's the age old thing
every once in a while you read in the newspaper or you'll see it on t v or something where the discussion comes out that you know women are paid less than men
and they're and they're doing the same uh or carrying the same job responsibility and you know i that's a very true statement
and it shouldn't uh it shouldn't be that way
that that i think should change will change in the near future also
i think so hope so
but there's still a an an inequality in the work forces or jobs
it's you know
you know i've
and you hear some people say you know
well he's a man
he he he needs that salary
also i think uh a good argument for that is in the area of politics you know
a woman congressman i'm sure makes as much as a man congressman as and the same as a senator or whatever
so they certainly uh they certainly deserve it all the way
but i guess just the most significant thing changed for me again as i mentioned was just in traveling
you see uh more and more ladies of all ages with briefcases and uh and in their business suits and and going
and i expect you're right in regards to having two parents now
that's a good a good statement
and i think if
in the future it's even going to be uh more noticeable and more significant
i i think it will be
i think i well
an- another thing i read too the other day
but how much they're out there i guess is
the car designers uh are starting to design cars with women in mind uh because in the past the male bought the cars
but now they're showing that fifty-five percent of women are actually making the new car purchases
and that they are looking for uh different things in the car
the man is looking for the e- in the engine
and the woman is looking to how easy can she slide in under the steering wheel
uh can her makeup come off the upholstery
and if they're out there buying that many cars then there's that many out that are self sufficient and you know mobile and working
and and my wife's always worked
and then when i first started my business uh
and hers was the only income we had for three or four months
you know she certainly did her part in help getting me establishing in my business
and she still works everyday
enj- enjoying it
and i work at medical treatment center uh which is at garl- uh jupiter and arapaho
well trying to think what else i can say in
i'm kind of out of out of things
you see the old uh cigarette ads you know about you've come a long way
you think about this when you come to when it comes to a subject like that
and it's really true
and you know
i have a um p c a i b m p c myself
i'm probably eventually going to get a three eighty-six um
um mostly um word processing applications and uh just as a dumb terminal
um but i um i think eventually i'll start using it for spreadsheets and things like that
um what do you find that you use yours mostly for
well i do a lot of word processing and spreadsheets and data base
and uh about the only thing
i am uh i'm just starting to get into uh a little bit more communications now
so i'll be able to send and receive faxes right over there without using you know
uh are you using windows
i i think i i'm planning on like moving up getting a three eighty-six before i move up to windows although you know i do like the the graphical user environment
well it's getting to be more and more like a macintosh
i want i want to be able i just want it more for multi tasking which i suppose is also like a macintosh
well the one thing i used to use a uh
i used to use a just an apple two e which of course is looks pretty primitive now
but i don't have any uh any real programming capabilities on my uh mac right now
i don't have uh any compilers so i'm uh
well do you use your computer for um just things around the house or in the
well see what do you do
i uh do uh consultation and and testing of various kinds for uh english as a second language programs
um and uh are these like uh do these programs um
are are they based on on a on a um other language
or are they based are they based
like a lot of the um you know a lot of the english as a second language classes will have people from all sorts of you know parts of the world
and the teacher just tries to tries to teach english you know through natural understanding
that's uh exactly what yeah that's the kind of thing i'm working with exactly
you seem to be uh better informed than the average person on that
well it was just uh when i was high school i worked for the community school
and they had a english second language class
and it always seemed strange to me that you know all these all these people that you know spoke english not too well and spoke you know a variety of different languages were all being taught at the same time
i imagine it's a lot harder on a computer because you have to you know you don't have as many cues
you can't don't have hand gestures and things like that
well now we uh
most of the stuff that i do is not uh interactive and i use it for t- uh data analysis on testing
uh to see how well they retain the vocabulary and things like that
well just actually just uh item analysis statistical analysis of the tests uh
you know when you write a test you have to look at some data from it and see how the different questions are performing and find out which ones are discriminating well and which ones aren't find out how reliable the test is
so it's involves a lot of spreadsheet use
um so um what were you doing when you were using an apple two e
well i was doing some of the same stuff but doing it more slowly
it's amazing you know how how like in the general user community the expectations have just grown so much
i remember my first computer was a t r s eighty with four k on it and you know then then we then i started playing with apples you know
and those had forty-eight
or you know if they were really great they had sixty-four k
oh the old the old apple uh the the original apple had what yeah forty-eight i guess didn't it
uh i know i know that in my school they had a bunch that had sixteen k on them is all
and there's i remember that there was one game that i played that required forty-eight k
and there was only one computer that had forty-eight k on it at the time
and you know it's just so amazing that generally you know if you if you
but i know i b m you you generally you know you buy a megabyte at a time
you know that's that's your low- that's the low end uh
well the s p thirty goes up to eight but i haven't upgraded it quite that far yet
i think probably when i get system seven i may have to do that and and get another possibly another hard disk
and i camp uh every month uh camp at least one weekend
and during the summer we camp uh two or three weeks a year
oh well that that sounds good
um now do you have a lot mountains
well you don't have mountains in texas do you
well uh we we do a lot of canoeing when we go camping and we uh we also uh carry all our equipment with us and so we canoe down the river and then
sleep on the river on one of the um sand bars and then get up the next morning cook our breakfast and go down the river again
oh my word
well that sounds adventuresome
well um i've done oh i would say quite a bit of camping mostly with my husband and i
um we have five children
and so we have found that camping with the little ones isn't as enjoyable as just when we go ourselves
so we've tried to get out once a year and go on a anniversary camp out
and we have gone up into the mountains and uh not necessarily roughed it
but we have just found it just real enjoyable to be alone up in the mountains
well that's good
and then the boys are our boys are old enough now
and so they're involved in the scouting
and they do a lot of camping with the scouts
and so this year they'll both be going
and so that's been real enjoyable for them
what uh what kind of camping do they like best
and uh do they cook on stoves
actually they've i remember they have taken the the du- the heavy cast iron dutch ovens and done their cooking there over the fire
and i don't think they've taken the stoves
um last year they camped in tents
and this year i believe they will be in tents also
so lots of times we don't even take tents
oh is that right
oh and what does that consist of
uh it's just a piece of material that has uh that has a lot of places where you can tie off to it and make it into a tent uh like a uh
and we use them when we go backpacking
so we go backpacking fifteen or twenty miles then uh
they're not very heavy see so you carry them with you
and they'll keep you dry or whatever
well see when when we go camping here
and i like to sleep on the air matresses
so i like to i like to sleep on the matresses
um so have you had any adventures on your camping trips with encounters with wild animals or anything like that
in fact uh um last month we went camping
we saw a lot of deer uh in the morning and the afternoon just deer everywhere
so uh but it even though uh it wasn't hunting season
and we were with boy scouts
so of course we don't uh want to go hunting
but we got to see a lot of deer um out and about
and uh one thing that is a big concern in the evening at night uh is uh make sure that all the food's put away and so forth because uh we have uh armadillos
uh they're covered like with a heavy armor type stuff
and possums and uh raccoons
and we have those creatures down here that they like to uh they like to go hunting for a midnight snack
and so that that uh that can be a problem if you don't put all your equipment away
but they won't necessarily attack a human or bite you or anything
but most time they run away from you if they if they see you're up you know
oh my word
well that sounds a little less fierce than bears
we we want to
and i listen to christian music a lot because there's a christian music station here in in our city
so i listen to it quite a bit
and i listen cause on friday nights they have the uh they have what they call saturday night alive
or they have on saturday night friday night and saturday night and they have christian rock and roll
so you know they have that type of music
but they just have different words so i listen to that too
well at least your
and i like i like rap music
well i can tell we're we're together here
uh we'll have to uh i have a lot of friends that like country music
do you listen to like that really heavy metal stuff
i'm more into uh older rock like the psychedelic era like uh se- late sixties seventies uh greatful dead crosby stills and nash
so you have never heard of like the christian music that i listen to probably
oh i've heard a little bit of it
like have you heard of uh
uh now i've heard of striper
so the only one i can uh-huh
they're the really heavy yeah like the heavy metal stuff i guess
uh the first of amy grant before was you know became more mainstream top forty
cause she she plays both secular and christian
she's real good she's real good
so i like her
you know i like randy travis you know i like more of the real new ones you know
garth brooks oh
you know he's fine
i don't care for the older you know like the dog left me stuff
i don't even really know who she is you know
you know so
actually i just went to see the greatful dead about i guess about a week ago
but aren't they done with
they're they are still on tour
and i just thought that they done broke up and left
in fact i mean there are people you know that basically just follow them around from city to city on tour selling tie dye and things like that
cause they are on up there in age aren't they
they're they're like late forties early fifties
but you know like whenever one of them dies off they get a replacement
you know they seem to have a really bad time with keyboard players
and they keep on replacing them
and the new ones in this thirties you know uh
cause they look pretty rough
i mean i've seen like picture of them
and they just
but it looked like leather day at the geriatric
i mean cause they just
yuck looking i mean uh
i mean it just just looked like they
well are you into that that rock music you know all that druggy stuff and all that i mean
like i mean like they come on the stage
and like you know you
they don't even know they are there you know
actually i prefer my my performers to be pretty sober you know just uh just so that you know that if they're jamming you know that they don't just lose themselves and you know go into lala land
so i just don't i just don't like you know
so uh have you seen any concerts lately
uh so do you think our politicians are honest at this point in time
uh my my personal opinion is that uh the politicians are out for their own good because they they're entrenched
i agree uh with with both of those things
but uh do you see any way of like altering it so that they would become more honest
i think by putting term limitations on you could you could slow down some of the problems
uh but it has to be not just at the national level but at the you know the state and the local level too
and i don't know which ones
but they've been in office since the the nineteen forties and i
th- they've never had a job
i mean they've never gone out in the real world and and paid normal taxes
but they don't you know they they get paid a hundred and twenty-five grand a year
and you know i'm going like i i don't understand how they're supposed to be my servants and yet they're paid more than i am and they work less you know less than i do
uh the only prob- the only problem i see with term limitations uh is that i think that the bureaucracy in our government as is in with most governments is just so complex that there's a very lar- you know there there is a learning curve and that you know you d- can't just send someone off to washington and expect you know his first day to be an effective uh congress person
uh i think i think there really is a there's a lot they need to learn you know when you get there
i think i think that's true
i mean that's true of the presidency too
and we seem to be able to get along with the president turnover ever eight years or four years
i mean there is a lot to learn
but maybe it will keep them on their toes and a little bit more active in trying to catch up
i think it would have to be extended uh you know
or you would increase the length of the of each term of a congressman
uh but maybe standardizing on on a a four year term for congress senate and the the presidency and then uh staggering them so that you don't
uh the other the other thing that uh bothers me about our system is just that uh in for for in in in congress the amount of power any any particular congress critter has is based on their seniority and how long they've been there
so it's you know for you know uh
so unless you have actual you know across the board s- uh limitations the uh you know the idea of
well we're going to just we're
i'm i'm just going to you know vote vote against the incumbent every time doesn't work
you know it's going to wind up hurting your state if all the other states aren't doing it at the same time
i think i think that that's true
but then you have you have the same abuse of power on the flip side of that coin
uh the c i a is moving out to west virginia which is a really stupid location for a large agency like that and for almost any agency
i mean the action isn't in west virginia
i hate to tell the s- the senator from west virginia this information
but it really doesn't e- ar-
the world does not revolve around west virginia uh as far as this country is concerned
the world does revolve around d c you know as far as the politics in this country are concerned the national politics
and the c i a is a a very large very high profile agency and to have it located out in west virginia
yeah you know
it might only be two hour drive from here but that's a two hour drive and uh you know it it's a i think it's a mistake to move large agencies like that or is it the f b i
but i think there's
well i mean l-
i don't see why it makes a big difference the c i a because you know officially they don't do they don't have any operations within the united states other than administrative
i mean we all know that that's not necessarily true
but i i think that there are there are advantages to having seniority and uh turn- or not having a complete turnover every some small number of years
i think there are i mean there's an institutional memory that you need to maintain
but i think that uh all with all the perks that we've given them
i mean i heard on the radio back a a few weeks ago uh during the incidents where they were you know like they aren't paying their their restaurant bills
and they're bouncing checks all over the place uh one of the radio stations over here listed off every single one of the perks
well we have
but we haven't done m- l- whole lot of it lately
i'm uh kind of a sailor
but i was in florida
well we don't get to do a whole lot of that up here
we have uh lake sam rayburn out here and lake nacogdoches
so we do a lot of boating on
so you got some lakes around you can do that on
we've uh our
it it it was heavy when we were there though
not not not too many no
but uh no
we went and uh had a kind of a picnic in the woods type thing
but uh no i i have uh i had a boat last summer that i took out a catamaran that i do did a lot of sailing on and stuff
but uh my parents are pretty big sailors too
uh all we all we have up here mostly bass boats
i guess it's pretty uh fishing's a pretty big thing huh
lot of lot of fishing going on up here
so where about in texas is that
it's uh well
what what major city is nearby
and that's south or
well that sounds pretty good
it's it's gets cold at night and then warm in the afternoons
probably seventies eighties in the afternoon
well that's pretty temperate
have you done uh any other boating then
i hadn't done any in a l- uh lately
but that's all
i used to ha- uh have a friend that owned his daddy owned a boat shop
and we used to when i was in high school we used to go out go boating every day just about
oh that's great
and we had a n- different boat every day
oh that's fantastic
i used to uh kind of be that way myself when i lived in uh north western florida in the panhandle
i'd work go to work
especially if you get a a pretty fast boat
like those catamarans are pretty fast
do if you get one like that do have somebody teach you that
or they just
well actually i i've known how to sail pretty much my whole life
uh my family's pretty into it and uh i took sailing lessons when i was about six
and then uh
it it's kind of a thing where you get the hang of it after a while you know uh just kind of get a feel for the wind and how it works and and the physics behind it
so it's it's not too bad
but some people are more motorboaters you know which is fine
well that's about all we have
lot of people don't don't see the excitement in sailing
but then again they may nev- m- they may never have tried anything like uh catamaran and uh that's when you really start getting into speed you know
you actually some catamarans you can actually pull people behind the skiers
they get so fast you know
that that would be something
i haven't i haven't personally done that
but uh the races
i i work with a guy right now that uh
he's got a good uh
what kind of what lake do you all use
well he uh he's from detroit so he usually goes on one of the great lakes i think and does his sailing uh
for me i i go back to orlando uh
and there's a lot of places there you can go you know
so uh so that's a good thing
but yeah so what do you do for a job
uh i build transformers
well they have a you know worldwide
but w- all we do here is make transformers electronics and stuff like that
oh no doubt
but uh that's about as far as
oh it's n- oklahoma's nothing like it
well that's good because i didn't like oklahoma that well
so what kind of luck you been having with buying and returning products
uh not too bad really
uh i had a razor that i got from christmas that i just i really didn't want it
but i got it anyway
and uh it was a braun
and they were real good about taking it back
so uh i was able to get that back pretty easily
but uh i don't know
it's uh the
i mean i i i'm almost pushing it myself
and it shrinks too much
and say well i should have known better
i mean i bought it from g i joe's and it was probably made in china by slaves
but uh they uh
most of the time pretty careful shopping anyway i get pretty good stuff
i think that uh aside from the fact all markets being internationalized and if you want to buy american
i was reading something in uh consumer reports tonight about that as a matter of fact
they were talking about cars uh the car issue just came out
and about how yeah you'd like to buy an american car maybe
but uh you know the transmission may be made in japan or whatever
uh like i've got an eighty-six ford ranger
and and i know for a fact that the transmission is made by mitsubishi
you know so it's like what are you going to do you know
but uh that's the way it is
i i personally feel that uh uh if the japanese cars are better and americans buy them you know that's the way it goes
and you know people man- more than manufacturers should get a clue
and you know they should start making quality products
the the days of don't buy a car made on a monday or a friday are pretty much going away
uh they've got all the american well all the all the cars rated you know
and uh essentially i h- i don't see much of a trend
i mean just like every other time that you look at it the honda accords and the civics are right up there
there's nothing wrong with them uh and the same thing with most of the other japanese cars
but then again you look at a ford or especially a chevy
and they're pieces of junk
that's ninety that's eighty-six through ninety-one
but uh i don't know
may- maybe they're getting better
maybe they're starting to get a clue uh
well they got a three year lead time
technology that comes in right now is is probably not going to be imple- implemented until you know quite a few years down the road
because technology is so uh you know volatile and changing all the time
and can you think of any other industry where in software they
or uh maybe i say well you know you paid five hundred bucks for this program so send us twenty and we'll give you a really great upgrade
uh th- they keep up c- with it pretty quickly
and that's that's a real good thing i guess
uh i don't know
and the hardware well i mean all the chips that make up the hardware are a commodity
and the macintosh is about the only one that's going right forcing i b m and the rest of the d o s world to follow along
they're kind of the leaders right now you know
i used to see all those commercials for windows you know
and you're like
oh gee they're reselling a macintosh under a different name
yeah you know
almost is the key word there too you know because i i really i've used both
and i really don't see an advantage of windows at all
yeah it it's only an advantage for people who had to use pure d o s
yeah yeah that's true too
but uh i don't know
i'm really i've gotten a little bit out of the the personal computer business just because i don't have one at home
i i do use a mac at work
but uh uh i really don't don't do much with it at home
and they're ones were
growling consumer uh need to worry about the mac they're getting
like if you bought a power book straight off a lot of them had to go back
you sound like you must uh work in the computer business
and i have a machine at home
and i belong to the user's group
and i i've been a mac fanatic since they came out
but uh technically i'm not actually in the industry
well that's that's all right
but it's sort of like surfing on the wave of future shock to you know keep up with the changes as they happen
something that i find uncomfortable is you know you you want to buy something say you want to buy a personal computer
and you got to think about what kind of memory you want to get and what kind of technology that you want to go for you know
let let's take the example the modem for you know
w- w- what baud rate do you get
well you know it used to be that you get a twelve hundred ba-
so um how do you feel about the crime in your city
is it uh
well um minneapolis isn't too bad
uh i know that there's been some increases in crime lately in terms of murders
uh that's kind of gone up in scale and
uh i personally had a little experience the other day
uh somebody broke my passenger window
but actually you know when you look at at minneapolis as compared to where i used to live it's really quite a bit better
uh because i came from florida
and in orlando there's crime is getting to be a bigger problem than ever
here you know the real problems are the gangs
a lot of gang related a lot of murders uh just in general the whole
uh before that we lived in colorado
but in comparison to colorado it's real noticeable
i mean you can just feel i mean i can just sense
i mean i won't even i won't go to the grocery store at night
and it it's that kind of thing
we have a neighborhood watch program in the house uh the development that we live in which i think is a great way to reduce uh home theft burglary and things of that sort
well uh interestingly enough right before i moved up here
and then i go back down in may
uh but in orlando before i moved up we had a real problem with it
uh we've been broken into in my apartment about four times in like two and a half weeks
and one of the things that i i helped organize was a neighborhood watch type situation down there
uh because they were just
it's one of those things where the new thing is that they operate in the daylight because everybody went to work you know
and then the houses were left unguarded uh
that's a good way to to work it with a neighborhood watch
well you know uh also i've heard that uh the newest thing is a lot of people are
oh is that right
a high percentage of uh free time
i think it's like fifty percent of most people's free time is uh spent doing yard work outdoors
so they wait while you're out outdoors
and then they just slip in
slip in slip out you know
so i've heard that's really on the rise as far as uh you know a new type of crime
really you know
unfortunately it's starting to really you know look at people's habits and where they are at particular points of the day
like one of the guys i work with really laughs when he looks at minneapolis because he's from detroit and uh the the crime level there of course is quite a bit quite a bit uh more pronounced uh but uh yeah
i'm not real sure uh
it helps to know your neighbors you know
you're supposed to make lists of uh cars
like i know a lot of my neighbors right around my development if i see a car that's unfamiliar we we have a list
is that what you you did in your program where you have a list of license plates
i was i was basically involved in that in the organization of it
and then i left right in the middle of it
that that whole thing of being alert and kind of noticing your surroundings noticing people who look suspicious uh activities like that sure
i mean you you hate to be paranoid
but there are really only so many things you can do
you can have the house alarm uh neighborhood watch program you know uh as a woman not go out at night uh you can do that which is what i choose to do
one of the frustrating things about that is that you really are limited even even if you know that the threat is there it's against the law to set traps
it's against the law to do a lot of things you know
they could basically uh
but it's not uh
there was a there was a case about two years ago where a guy knew he was going to get robbed
and essentially what he had done is set a a elec- a electrocution trap for the burglar in his own home
and sure enough he fell into the trap and was severely burned
but he was severely burned
and he took the guy to court and won a settlement
so that really that makes you think you know
it's like your hands are re- very much tied
well i think if if you had ha- a handgun though in other words it wasn't premeditated you had a handgun it's the middle of the night someone's down-
uh i've had uh three boys through i guess uh some child care each one of them
and now they're in school
so it's all over
but uh i guess i would say it's not easy to find wha- what most parents would want
well i can profit by this because i'm due with my first in about three months
i guess uh the only rule uh i can think of is that i like to look for places with uh good respectable nonprofit behind them like a university or a hospital or something like that
uh i think it's sort of the opposite of what you would want when you buy a car or refrigerator something
and uh the child care center
so i felt confident that they'd do right
aren't don't they kind of use them for everybody kind of use them for guinea pigs for their per- for their pet theories or some such thing
i mean actual experiments they would have to get your permission
i suppose uh if you're if there is a psychology department or an education department around you might find you might find that they're pushing one form of education or another
and they you know
um well the thing i really worry about is uh the sexual abuse cases you read about
and i mean you'd just feel awful if something like that happened
so i never really worried too much about that being uh uh the case with my boys
uh i you know i think those things get into the headlines immediately when somebody finds out about them
but i don't think it's as common as uh the newspapers would make you believe
and another thing is cost
and they finding in some cases they're finding it's just not worth it to work because it's all going out in daycare
well in our case we made the decision that my wife would stay home until the boys were uh in school
and i'm really happy we did it although it was very very difficult
and i think it was the right thing to do
and we were uh we just decided that we would do it
and we went ahead
but uh not everybody can make that choice
and even even though my wife wasn't working we did have uh one or another of the boys in uh child care for part-ti- just for part of the day uh or a couple of days a week just so that uh other things could get done around the house and so on
so so we did look around
and uh so i would always trust her judgment on that
huh well i'm just thanking heaven
and he just got a new job
and so i'm just grateful that we don't have to worry so much about my working or not
so yeah do it as long you can
but i think you know you have to look through a place
and you have to get a feel for uh how they treat the kids and uh uh what kind of staff members they have and how much turnover they have and things like that before you commit your child to them
and i think you have the main thing is that you have to determine that they're perfectly open that you're welcome anytime without notice in the middle of the day and so forth
and if they're at all queasy about that then i'd look elsewhere yeah
you have other friends that have kids uh being taken care of in uh child care
uh i have one
but i haven't really had a chance to talk to her about that for a while
so but i really think the news reports are uh tend to sensationalize the problems
i think the problems are more ones of cost and resources and uh pay and exhaustion and
you know things like that rather than these uh uh really wild abuse cases that you read about because it make good copy
well i think the court systems could stand some improvement
uh trial by jury is good
but a lot of time i- a lot of cases uh is circumstantial evidence that that convicts a person which i don't think is all the time good because sometimes it's hard to get all the facts and to prove a person innocent i mean prove a person guilty if you don't really know or you don't really have an eyewitness
and how can you convict somebody on circumstantial evidence is beyond me
so you think if if trials were held by judges or experts that they they would tend not to uh admit not to convict people on circumstantial evidence
and uh that's the sort of system they have
the trials are held by a panel of three uh three or four judges who are well
they're like lawyers i guess
they're experts in the law and uh there
and uh uh they do the questioning also
and uh they
i think it's a lot harder to get off on technicalities also because they uh uh the judge is also sort of a jury
but i'm not sure i like that
what what i worry about is cases where it's the government against the individual
well that's true
because uh anytime th- the government uh is the government against the individual you need som- y- you need the protection of ordinary citizens
i think that's really the only thing i guess where i would like to see the system change is uh uh there ought to be a a well
i guess i don't think that uh uh juries need to decide sentencing all the time
i think maybe th- a judge is a better judge of that
well s- sometimes the sentencing is still is not fair
i mean even if well the jury i guess they do decide that
but but i'm like you
th- the sentencing is really light compared to what i think they should be in a lot of cases you know uh
but people who d- don't have day in and day out life long experience with what prison is really like and what the options are to ask them to decide for one case on one person based on what they see i think that is maybe uh a little bit naive
uh it's kind of uh uh a hanging jury atmosphere
but in a lot of places i think people bend over the other way
but i guess i guess i like the system that they have in some places where the defendant gets to choose whether he's goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets to choose it
some some cases in some jurisdictions they can do that
that's that's not a bad system
but i i do think it needs to be shaken up a little bit
but the thing is too maybe they need more of a i don't know more of a expert types to to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick you know joe blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever an- and call them in
and lawyers blow sand in their eyes
put- putting on a act or whatever
and uh there would be more honest settlements instead of this uh tugging of people's heart strings and uh making them cry and feel like they're doing somebody good by giving them or giving them two million dollars to make up for the pain and suffering
so in i think i- in criminal trials you need the jury as a defense against the government
recently i can't really say recently
but i think about uh about a year ago uh i bought a product from some company down at uh in atlanta georgia
i believe it was one of these uh one of these uh mixers these like these juice machines
and uh the uh the blade they sent me at first that went into the machine it looked you know perfectly okay
but i found that uh it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting uh after
even despite you know diligent washing it it got rusty after about uh three weeks of use
and i don't think it was my fault because i- i you know i had made a point of like drying it off and cleaning it
but uh it was really uh it was
i had to send it back after like you know the third week because i realized it was like it was not
uh what about you
well i don't have so much trouble with products as service
and i'm not convinced that any of them work a hundred percent
uh the one i have now is okay most of the time
but that's it
but that's that's probably the worst
my daughter has a charm bracelet i bought her that's guaranteed uh james avery
but it it's a very good company that sells sterling silver things
and uh she has a charm bracelet with lots of charms on it a lot of money into it by now and the catch broke
and she was sitting in school on a carpet
and when she stood up it caught and broke
and we took it back
and they said oh this was just obviously yanked
i mean they were so rude about it
and so we wanted a different kind of catch
and she said well it's not guaranteed
and i said well put it on because apparently nothing's guaranteed
so do it anyway
so we got the kind we wanted
and i was really disappointed with that
i felt that this was a company that should have been more reliable and i happened to need a birthday present for one of her friends
and i called there to see if they had it
and the lady was very nice
and i said my goodness
and she told me
and i said well i really appreciate it
and it turned out she was the assistant manager
well at least your talking to somebody who counts
so i felt kind of good about that you know
they might work on that you know
but i find attitudes are more of a problem
up here in the northeast we have uh well w- we have these mail order companies like l l bean
and uh they are famous for i guess having really top-notch service
they've got uh i mean i've i've i i have friends and family who order from them because you can you can literally i've heard stories where you can literally buy something from them one year wear it for a year and a half
and even after like eighteen months of you know reasonably satisfactory use they will accept it in any condition
and they will gladly no questions asked take it back if for some bizarre reason you decide you don't want it anymore
uh they'll they'll actually do things like this
i mean they're really they they go- bend over backwards service wise for you
i've uh i've found also a lot of companies nowadays have they have eight hundred numbers you can call
i guess if if you call the e- any eight hundred number uh if you you can call up e- any eight hundred number directory assistance and you can get uh the eight hundred number of the customer service support line for a number of companies
and um actually i've tried that with a few companies lately
and they've most of them have been pretty good
but i i was
one reason why i like i buy a lot of clothing through mail order is that uh if you buy through bean or though
uh i guess bean's one of bean's big competitors is land's end out in uh i guess it's wisconsin somewhere
they they are uh they're very good about uh insur-
like the customer is always right
and you know no matter how crabby you might be over the phone they are very understanding
and uh they usually get you know they they make things are they ma- make sure things are set properly if you're any way dissatisfied with their merchandise
well i think i guess nowadays with the uh with the economy the way it is i guess
there was a there was a story on the news tonight about how because a lot of companies are uh you know
there's a lot of you know
the morale among employees tends to go down and that in turn like you know
and uh one of the things i thought about was a lot of the drunk cases that they were having that especially for repeat offenders that uh
uh so that uh a judge i think would be the most appropriate person to uh to be able to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day
i i kind of agree with that
because i think in some cases uh the jury may not even have
uh i i think that in some cases that's considered to prejudice the current case so a judge you're right should have the whole dossier of the criminal
and if they're judged guilty would probably be in a better pri- position to give an appropriate uh sentencing
see i agree with you
uh one thing i heard was this where they have instead of going to the regular court they have a a mock court
i mean it's supposed to be all legal and everything
uh you go
and you present your case
and you're done with it
uh and uh but it's not that we have uh such
it didn't backlog or all of the uh the cases that are uh all ready pending
uh so i
in other words not not
i i i don't
th- there's a point on which we don't agree
and i usually it is the defendant i guess that wants to have the jury hear the case
so i'm not out for streamlining things to the point where we uh
take that you know
and and i wasn't i didn't mean that
oh oh okay
i i didn't mean that no
because i mean gee whiz if i was uh uh didn't have that right you know not to have a jury that oh
yes i would feel uh you're right that my civil rights had been violated
but i meant for some when both parties agreed that yes we're going to have a judge here
we're not going to have a jury you know
sort of like car accidents you know
well i think that's all ready possible
jury trial uh
yeah so i agree that that should be encouraged
but i think most lawyers do a pretty good job of making that evident to to clients unless they feel they can you know tweak a jury into
and i suspect it in cases like
well i i i- we're at liberty to to talk and and meander as long as it's all on the same theme
well uh in the case of
civil uh things i think maybe the the use of the jury is very
and i think that may be where jury use is overdone
i mean there are cases where they could be settled
but the lawyers are really uh
as possible so uh i was wondering too if they were thinking of about the judge making awards in civil cases not just sentencing in in a criminal cases
uh i'm not so sure i'm in favor of that
but i am in favor of it for criminal cases
so there's a difference of my view there for those two
bu- well you can tell i haven't been in too many juries
well i was called once when i was nineteen and uh but i was doing so many other things that they took pity on me
and i was doing school and things like
they they let me out
an- i've never had to it since
and that was almost twenty years ago
that would have been about uh twenty years too uh uh just last year
and uh the case i heard was a criminal case
and it seemed it really
so we we a- rendered a verdict
and then the judge was the one to do the sentencing
so i i don't know if that varies from state to state or if it
uh i guess the topic is trial by jury and how we should change that or how we would change it
uh i'm ready whenever you are
so uh what are your what are your thoughts on the subject there
well i definitely think like decisions have to be unanimous
i mean it's to easy to get a quorum and simple majority won't do
and even like you know two-thirds majority i mean it's
and there's always that that chance that one or two people could be playing devil's advocate for a good reason you know
so it's it's definitely
but uh i don't know
i could i couldn't believe they suggested that judges should be doing the sentencing
like gives them a little too much power
i i know of a couple of people at least who would be arguing with that or arguing against that pretty vehemently
plus you know you may be you know doing you know a a guilty verdict
but it may not be you know it may be for technical reasons
about the only good thing i would say about that is it w- that it would uh hurry the process up a bit but i mean even now we've got i know we've got plenty of cases out there where people have been wrongly convicted and things like that
and that's what the trial by jury
i mean jeez if if the judge was doing it himself without any checks and balances whose to say
i tend to follow it just to just to know what's going on
but uh to tell you the truth i'm not real familiar with uh the system of juris- jurisprudence the way it is right now
i know a little more about civil cases when than criminal cases
it's more in how you present it versus you know who's right
because a lot of those things it's all it's in it's largely a matter of viewpoint
uh it's kind of weird
like you know you go say okay we can't bring up this point because then they're going to you know
and it's like boy the stuff that they can twist around is
and it's like the the truth isn't really important anymore
and then you get people who who bring in cases just because they want to bring them up just because
like this this friend of mine's pretty obnoxious
and he really gets into suing people
and so he'll he'll sue just about anybody just for the chance to get into court
but it's for the more general
you know it's
and and most of the time they're looking to place blame uh and stuff
see you're from california
well originally from chicago
i wonder i wonder how how the civil system or the court system must differ between there and say where i am in minneapolis
and louisiana is completely different cause it was based on the
and the rest of the country is not or something like that
but uh fortunately i never have had to go in even even for jury duty
but uh that friend of mine's telling me that i might have to go in for uh as a witness
so we'll see what happens
there are too many big problems you know
there's there's such a backlog of court cases right now
you know to try to get them all in in a good time
and we already have too many lawyers as it is
and if it's criminal cases we you can't put them in jail because there's no room left
and in fact they're even letting some go
i i i'm originally from florida
and it's like it seems like every year they let out more and more just cause they don't have room for them you know
that's not a that's not a good solution either
well i'm kind of in favor of it for certain crimes
well i think first degree murder uh probably warrants it
i come from a state that has well i originally come from the state that has uh
and uh they're pretty liberal on it
they tend to like fry people left and right
texas i saw on t v the other night is the has had forty-six in like the past several years
so they're pretty hip on it too i guess
uh i don't i don't know
and that's not
but on the other hand there's a lot of advantages to it
and of course you have some savings in terms of taxpayer money keeping people in jail or not um with florida that's a big problem because there's so many people in jail that they have to let them out every year
like uh that's
in fact a big gubernatorial issue is the the turnover rates of uh r- uh repeat offenders being let out and doing it again
and it's like you know that's a big problem
but there's not a whole lot you can do about it because there's only so many jails you can build and it's really you know it's it gets to be a r- a big problem
uh go ahead
be a little more you know
because a lot of these guys you know they get in
and they they get off for good behavior
and i don't know
and you can almost sense that people are just laughing at the system you know because they figure well you know sure i i get thirty or forty years for maybe rape or something
uh but then for
if i if i elicit good behavior i'm out in maybe five or ten
oh sure you know
i mean just because like we said before they don't have enough room in the jails uh you know there's a lot of incentive for them to be let out early
but if you've got the death penalty hanging over your head uh
but i don't know
i yeah i tend to think the repeal system for the death penalty is a little little too lenient
uh kind of takes away from the significance of the death penalty
fantastic uh i'm a doctoral student at the university of central florida
but uh i don't know
it's it's an interesting issue
there's like you say in texas there's been quite a few
and and in florida in the last few years i think there's been a lot
i can't i you know i can't give you figures
so i think it
oh is that right
the forty-sixth in the last twenty-five years i think is what they gave a run down that texas texas tends to be a little more robust and disciplined area then
i i kind of
yeah i've heard things about that
uh they they don't get repealed as easily as they do
like the guy in california got thir- you know twice before he went to the gas chamber
and then they said okay no
and then they took him back
i mean it just seems
yeah it just seemed a little inconsistent
and then you have like two
you have these people who are serial killers that didn't even get the death sentence back when ever you know
i i'm trying to think about other crimes that would warrant it
uh i guess
what is it what's the policy now with treason
do they uh do they axe you for treason or is it a life sentence
i don't i don't think uh the military doesn't execute anymore
or death before the firing squad or whatever
so i think about the only one is uh rape
well our public schools are are really poor i feel
uh i'm not sure where georgia ranks in the nation
but uh we're toward the bottom
and uh there's a lot of things that i see that are so obviously wrong
but the system doesn't allow for the corrections
well that's interesting
and uh she has a young boy actually has two boys now but only had one when she was there
and she complained quite a bit about their school system there
and cobb county is better than the county i'm in
but uh i live in orlando florida usually
and the schools down there from what i know are not bad
well that's great
and he says the schools there are are incredibly bad uh just terrible
well i feel that we're way behind
uh i have a son that is in the fourth grade and uh they have just now taken up division
and uh i-
and we buy these math books and fractions and multiplication division things
and i feel like uh there are several areas that we're just really really slow in
well well for one thing there's not enough money in the school system
and the money they do have they're not they do not use
uh she my son's teacher has twenty-seven students
and that's certainly is a lot of students for one person to deal with on an every day
that's that's one thing i worry about
and when you have two kids in that class that constantly keeps ca- the class in an uproar and you're not at liberty to do something about it other than give them on campus isolation or send them to the principal's office it it you know it can it can really be bad
uh also i think we have a lot of uh hispanics and we have a lot of uh
the county i am i'm in the minorities are mostly hispanic
we're from a county we're from the county they marched in
oh is that right
and there's very very few blacks
uh so so that's uh
i i hate to say uh
it's not a problem uh because i hate to feel like they are a problem although they are
but you know it it's
but then again
but it is a problem
there is no denying that that
uh especially in the inner schools inner city
sure you know
teachers you have to admit that teachers have to slow things down for people who don't understand especially if there's not a very well developed special education program at the school
and you can't put all the children in special education
uh and if the parents do not care enough to take an interest in whether the homework is done you know
see i grew up in nebraska and the school that i went to there was fantastic
i i really consider myself very very lucky
uh we had a school that had classes probably about the same size you're talking twenty-seven thirty kids to sc- to a class
but your teacher had control
we zipped right along you know
i i was i was doing mathematics fractions and division and multiplication by the third grade easily
i i believe i was too
but you're right you know
uh well it it really is a concern of mine because if we could afford it my son would be in private school
i was going to ask you if there if that was an option
uh i'm of the age that could have gone although i didn't
and uh i guess uh looking back on it i tend to think it was pretty uh mostly a mistake
on the other hand uh the more i learn about the history the more i see it was incremental uh decisions any one of which was sort of understandable at the time
and uh but on the whole i think it uh probably was the wrong thing to do
well i'm uh
i was in the last last lottery
and i was glad it was over by then
you know we uh
and for some of them it was just kind of i don't know not so much a holiday
and ever now and then they'd go and shoot their rifles
and then they'd
and you know
but that they weren't really allowed to do anything
tonight i was uh
helping my kid with an essay on uh stalin
and i was thinking in the course of talking to him about it how uh in world war two the personalties of stalin hitler and churchill more or less defined the war
and actually when you think back on the big events of the war it was uh it was almost a personal struggle among these three uh
and uh and uh with their nations pretty pretty solidly behind each one of them
and i got a feeling that some of that was involved in the uh early decisions of the vietnam war that the uh
otherwise there'd be they'd get you someplace else
uh i guess you can i guess you can say that a a certain amount of resolve and willingness to fight uh brought the cold war to an end
but i don't think you can just fight anywhere just just in order to uh call the bully out and beat him
and i have a feeling that that's part of what was involved in the vietnamese war
and uh we were wrong
but i uh you know
the like i said the more i hear about it the more i can see each decision that was made as being understandable
but the accumulative effect was to really get into a a hopeless situation where
and as you say uh going halfway was probably worse than uh committing uh committing to a completely and uh winning it whatever that would mean
well i i i think we did i think we did learn some lessons that we weren't uh we weren't prepared for
uh i mean the other wars seemed like a valiant war i mean they seemed like a valiant thing
you knew you knew who was good
well you're not
and it was a it was a traditional m- the traditional battle of kind of good versus evil if you you know whichever way it is
but in in the vietnam war it seems like it was
a a the sides and the lines that were drawn are all confused as to whose good and whose bad
and and uh you know the
it seems like even the people you know
and the cambodians weren't even supposed to be involved
what what about the domestic effects
like i was thinking that maybe the most important effect it had was to make it uh possible and even popular to uh criticize the government
that pendulum started to swing uh ma- maybe even too far to the point where uh uh supporting a government decision in foreign policy was sort of optional
and that tradition is still
i mean it's dying now
but it's still alive as opposed to
this desert storm stuff may have uh killed it
but i think that was one of the biggest
that you know the uh th- the domestic unrest
about maybe oh close to a year ago now i guess i i helped my dad add on another bedroom on to his house
so i guess that
that that was fairly large undertaking
a a it's a bedroom and a walk-in closet and a bathroom all on one side of the house
oh we did it all except for the sheetrocking
that was the only thing we didn't you know putting the ceiling up and things like that
we don't we we weren't sure how to do that
and i did all the sheetrocking
we did all put the roof up and did all the roofing and the put all the interior walls up
and that's it because you have you know get those joints to go together and whatever you have to put in there to get the s- to take the gaps out between the sheets and on the ceiling and all that
i di- we didn't know a thing about any of that
it's it looked very hard to do
we figured well just
so we left it left it to somebody who does it for a living
and i we'd never done it
so we just left it alone
so i my my vast experience of home home owner's knowledge is not very much
so it's just what i have to do more or less around the house you know for my parents
did you you framed it in f- uh on on you framed in new square footage
or was it stuff that was already uh enclosed
so it was
a- and you knew how you knew how to do the framing
uh well my dad knew how to do most of it you know
he he'd we'd gotten a couple of books
and then he just started doing it
he well he did all the flooring himself
he put the whole the whole floor in
and then i just started with the walls and the roof and started there
and then we were put a like a not not necessarily a garage but just like a off the side of that
it's not you know it's not enclosed
it's just somewhere to drive another car to to park
do do you build on slabs down there or did you build it up off the ground
uh it's off the ground
it's on about uh twenty-two inch piers something like that
you had those poured or you did them yourself
those those are
well the last thing i did completely myself was an outside deck which i was pretty proud of
those ar- those are
we'd i've done one
those are those are you know
but we didn't do that way
i designed it from scratch and did it did a pretty good job
they're pretty forgiving you know
especially when you get done you've got something you know
you just sit down on on the deck and do whatever have a barbecue
i i built it two levels and with a big toy box and some benches and uh a backrest and all that stuff
all done by yourself huh
so we could pour concrete and support it with a a nice firm four by four posts
and uh and then the rest of it i just did
a a contractor friend helped me uh with some of the uh foundation work
but uh it was pretty
that's pretty that's a good size deck
it's uh not that expensive
i think it cost me three dollars a square foot and uh you know no less than that
co- cost me about five hundred dollars six hundred dollars all together
th- the wood may
it got surprising as to the fact that how much wood is you know
to get to get good lumber it costs
i don't know about dallas but arou- even in this little town it's it's not cheap at all
i'd be surprised if it wasn't uh cheaper where you are
that it probably does
i i'm not sure
it's nothing but woods up here down here
when i drive through that area that's all i see is pressure treated pressure treated lumber yards
i don't i haven't i mean i haven't
and but that was just when i was a kid
so i don't really know what the cost of living is even like in dallas anymore
but it's i don't know we're a college town
so that doesn't help us out any
gas is a dollar t- dollar twelve a gallon
so that's probably about what you're paying
my current project is a walkway which i'm building around the house and out to the backyard to uh you know digging it out and laying sand and putting uh pavers on top of that
well what d- do you think in terms of uh benefits
well personally you know i think you know
and i think that uh we've probably got one of the best around you know
besides they tend to offer ad- adequate vacation i guess
and the paid time off is wonderful
and uh one of the things that we were just talking about as a matter of fact this week at work was the coda plan that is offered
and i think that is just a a fabulous one
so i don't know if you participate in that or not
but isn't it great
it's just a it's just a miracle that how fast that adds up you know
well i have to agree with that
you know i was thinking about uh importance of benefits and that kind of thing other than salary while i was waiting for uh the system to find a a respondent
and i started thinking that over the years that importance has changed
and i suspect that that's probably true for everyone
when i was much younger it was uh less important to consider retirement and less important to consider medical benefits
but as i grow older and my family grows it the medical benefits are more important
and the retirement is more important
but i guess that's true i guess that's true
i'm still young enough that that uh the vacation's real important to me
and the paid time off is real important to me and and that kind of thing
but uh you know i was just as a matter of fact i just uh celebrated my fifth year at t i the end of last month and uh kind of started looking through the the book because of that you know
now that i'm a hundred percent vested you know you kind of look through the book and see well what exactly what does that mean and what is the pension all about
and you know when you're when you're you know in your
so you tend not to think about retirement
but uh it's
so does t i have a pretty good retirement package do you think
i think they have uh a- one that we need to recognize that we're going to have to supplement ourselves
and that's certainly one of the reasons that i'm sure that they've begun the uh coda plan
it's certainly a a supplemental way uh
and i suppose if b- maybe in in your instance if if you're started with t i in your early to mid-twenties and happen to stay with them until you're sixty-five then you'll have a very good retirement plan
but i had another career first and then came to t i a little later
so it's not uh
all by itself it won't be adequate for for my situation
so i have to find a way to supplement that
well they just they seem to make it so easy to save
you know one of the things that we're doing which is probably the worst investment in the world
but i've got money coming out to buy savings bonds just coming straight out of my check
and it's probably not a great investment
but if i wasn't doing that the money wouldn't be being saved anyway you know
i kind of have to trade off you know
i unders- understand though
uh believe me i do that myself
and i disagree with you
i i fr- you know i i debate about whether it's really good or not you know
well it's in terms of guaranteed return on investment
and maybe you don't start looking for that word guaranteed
uh it's shown a history that uh sure beats anything else
we went uh and did a a thing through i b s which is a like a financial consultant
and uh one of the things that we talked about with the counselor there was
they work up this whole big you know proposal profile for you that ev- all the things that you need to work on and you need to do
and then one of the things that we talked about with her was you know the need to save for our son's education
we have a two year old you know
and and you know we can't start saving for college when he's sixteen you know
and and uh they have a way that they can figure you know what you know
and he's two now
in sixteen years when he's ready to go to college this is how much it'll cost you know
and it's just really scary the thought of how much it's going to
it's what it costs now is ridiculous
and they sat down and figured up that we needed to save like between fifteen and seventeen hundred dollars a year at a oh you know six percent interest rate to be able to have you know money for his college
and that's exactly what we have coming out in saving bonds is is you know about fifteen hundred dollars a year
so i guess it you know
in that way at least we know that that's taken care of you know
we we can worry about other things
un- except that mine are a little bit older
and and i've shown them the numbers and said this is what's going to be available
well that's what she said to us
she said now do you all want him to go to a a state college or a private college
and and our answer was that you know we will have enough money available for him to attend a state college
and if he wants to go to a private college he can get a scholarship to attend you know
and that was kind of our view on it
you just can't do it you know
so i don't know
i don't uh
it amazes me how much the the costs are going to go up over the next ten or fifteen years
and boy it gets really scary when you start talking to them
uh i have a an eleven year old daughter now who's saying gee dad i want to be an allergist
and i said that's wonderful
and he says well i don't know
and i said that's great
well you know t i you know t i offers some good stuff
and then i think there's i mean i think there's some negatives
but there's going to be some negatives anywhere you know no matter where you go
i have you know all
always been involved in little small you know ind- privately owned s- owned firms
and so i've never had the the big benefit package
so i really don't know how to compare it to other big companies you know
it when i came on it was great because i had never had anything even close to what what they offered
so i've been real pleased
well that's fantastic
and on whole o- i would say that they're equal to uh most of our competitors
uh i can see some some potential changes that probably are are would not cost very much but might uh make things a little easier
such as offering a a smorgasbord having a larger variety of benefits
but but here's the amount that that t i is going to pay for it
and you can pick what you want
i don't even remember if it was in the dallasite or the insite one about uh companies allowing you
and they said that t i was looking into it to purchase extra vacation days which i thought sounded like a good idea
you know if you've been there you know under five years and you get two weeks of vacation
but that's really not enough
and you want an extra week then you can purchase an extra week of vacation by saying okay i'm going to want an extra five days this year
and they'll take a set amount out of each paycheck you know
and they're deducting it all along
so you you can have an extra five days off and be paid for them at the time you know
but it's coming out a little bit at a time instead of all at once you know
so that is kind of an idea that that a lot of people sounded like that they were really interested in
and t i said that they were looking into something like that
well i could certainly personally stand seeing them go to a a standardized compensatory time for overtime
and i don't believe any of us would have to purchase any extra vacation days
uh and and i would certainly support something like four to one or five to one
or or you know maybe they want to get generous and make it three to one
uh a- as a repayment for
but it should be a standard and and not left up to either the whim or the current overhead rate t- uh that's running in each department
and and a lot of that is left up to whoever your supervisor happens to be and what type of relationship you have with that person
and you know i see a lot of differences but from one group to the next you know about who gets it and who doesn't get it you know
but that's and that's that way with a lot of things you know there
it seems like it depends on what what group you happen to be in what what you're going to get and what you're not going to get
well that's for sure
but but then it's probably that way anywhere you know
oh i'm sure personalities always come into play
uh just in this size of organization
well uh i live in garland
and we're just beginning to
we we just built a real big recycling center
but as far as uh trash pick up and stuff that a lot of the communities are doing
so they're really not full full force into it
but they're trying
so we're attempting it
but i wish we could do more
there's there's been no emphasis on recycling at all in san antonio
and there was discussion for a while about uh building a garbage burning uh
but it just wasn't cost effective at the time
and there's there's a little recycling trucks and things throughout the city
but there isn't any uh advertising campaign
i recycle my newspapers and uh alumi- my aluminum stuff
but uh they make it as hard as possible
well we have those uh which i think is one of the best things is those cash for cans
and i really like that because that makes it real convenient because they're in almost every shopping center
and you can just stop by
now everything else like the tra- uh paper and plastic and stuff you still have to go to the centers
but but for aluminum that's real nice
and i started doing that at work
um i put out a a trash can and and for people to put their aluminum cans in
and that's really helped a lot
i mean everybody's pitched in
you know it doesn't bother them to walk little bit farther put their aluminum in a can rather than just throwing it in their trash can
so i really i really like that
but people are really concerned
which is really really sad because i wish we would do more
at work we started uh all the recycling stuff
and uh that really started a lot of stuff off
but you know sometimes it dwindles down
but that's about the extent of it
well that's uh
it's just yeah
and i'm sure that the uh driving factor for recycling the computer paper is that we get paid to do so
oh do you really
we sell the paper back to the uh to a paper manufacturing company
well that's a neat idea
well it it defrays the cost of buying the paper i think
well that's that's really good
i mean at least they're trying
you know that was one thing we noticed last week that we had some new people move into our building
and you know the nice cardboard boxes that you move packing boxes
and they were just used one time and thrown in the dumpster
and i thought i don't understand this you know
we're trying to cut cost and everything like that and and recycle and all that stuff
and and here we are wasting
and i don't understand sometimes the way the thinking the logic behind it
well the last time uh someone moved offices in my building
and uh the uh properties people came in with all with the good cardboard boxes
i i took several home because i'm moving pretty soon
and they're good boxes
and they were just going to throw them away
because i didn't want to waste that
and it's hard enough to find good packing boxes
and and these boxes are
so you know there they don't take up much storage space
well that's very good
i i felt a little guilty about taking the boxes for about two seconds until i realized they would be thrown away
i thought well i was doing them a favor by taking them
i found about five uh about nine of them that had not even been folded into boxes
so many people need so many people go to the grocery store and stuff and get those boxes
when you know these are perfect
so you can't use it anyway
and the real sturdy boxes that copy room paper comes in with the nice lids those get thrown away
and i am constantly scouting out the copy room for those boxes
that's what i do with a lot of my daughter's things is i'll store her you know like her out dated or out of out of season clothes in them
and they're just perfect
what what i've done in the past
but i would buy some cheap wallpaper from somewhere and cover those nice boxes with the lids
and you can stack them up and and leave them out and put things in them even
and they look just as good
well you know it's cheaper than going and buying the kind at target that are all ready with the little design on them or whatever
and you're recycling
well that's neat
well do you all have uh
we have places that uh pay for paper to recycle
but for newspaper
but ours are real hard to find
i saved pa- you know i recycle paper
i mean they're real hard to find the places that pay
and that's really discouraging
i mean i just go ahead and take it to the the regular place where it's you know they just accept it
but they uh i think they should
if they want people to recycle i think it's uh you know
like the aluminum you know
it gets people to uh doing it you know
you might you don't have to pay them a lot
and there's a big uh uh huge dumpster looking thing sitting out front
and it's for recycling
and they have aluminum and newspaper and plastic and some other category
and you don't get paid
but it's real convenient just to chunk the newspapers in there
well that's that's good
the one thing i don't like about the newspaper also is uh
like at work we have two different trash cans at your desk
but in uh in the paper one you have to separate
and you can't throw certain file type things away
and i just think it's such a hassle
it seems like it would be it would be easy to take it all
but i do get tired of having to separate paper you know
it gets to be uh
i mean you have to get so used to doing it that it's a habit
and we had uh a write up in our paper uh this last time at work about um
and every other day they do your recycling trash
and somebody was writing in complaining that the people had uh dumped all the trash in the same bin
and when they were questioned about it they said well we're running late
or we didn't have time to do those bins or something
and that's real discouraging thinking you're sitting there working to separate it
and then they
and someone else isn't going to take the time to put it in two separate bags
so they're they're really trying to start keeping an eye out for those you know
talking to the people again about you know
because that is discouraging when you when you do that
but luckily that will all get straightened out
and and they'll they'll start separating them
because i don't mind doing that
i feel like i'm doing uh doing something for the community when i'm doing that
well i've enjoyed talking to you
well i thank you
well i think uh
but i haven't had that much time to think about it either
i guess the uh biggest thing i f- find is the financial aspects uh particularly the ability of people to access you know your financial records or for example your credit uh rating almost at will
using your social security number of course permits people to do that and almost anything you do now a social security number is required
and uh of course there's another aspect of this too uh in terms of invasion of privacy
being a professional and of course you probably belong to
and that is that
some of the organizations sell their mailing lists which i think is a is an invasion of privacy
and in fact some of these things i get some of these questionnaires
it's funny because i'm i was in the process of filling one out when i decided i would make this phone call
but when you have to send that back in the mail with your name on it your salary information i i just have a real hard time doing that uh
and they ask you what type of household items do you own like stereos and t v and v c r
and and you hate to send something off with your name and address
and what types of things do you own
and what kind of money do you make
and you wonder well who's going to get ahold of this and think um that's a nice place to go rob
and not only that it it opens you to
i've had them for of course for you know real estate investments you know you get uh please send in your uh you know this particular card and you get uh a free trip or something along those lines
and so that uh that bothers me because i of course i enjoy being at home and i do not enjoy getting called by strangers uh particularly solicit- you know soliciting
so g- having your
and i know that a lot of these of course are random phone calls they just you know start going through the phone book or going through a series of numbers
but some of them are sold
and i know you
and for some
now the address is the same you know my my office address
but they have one under you know my first name james
they have one under my first name and initial middle initial
then they have a a third one under my just my two initials
so i know that they have sold their mailing list
and uh i can't really think of anything else offhand that uh
i mean it's it's one thing to get junk mail because you can you can just put it right in the trash
but it's the phone calls
and you know usually when they call you it's going to be when you s- right when you sit down to dinner because they know they pretty much know that you're at work all day
and they call you right when when you've just gotten home from work
but if it's a salesperson it's just something you don't want to have to mess with
and and i've gotten a lot of them lately
and there's a lot of hang ups on my answering machine
and i'm just assuming it's probably a salesman that called during the day
and they'll probably call me up and you know call me back and bother me when i sit down to dinner later on
but i find that very annoying
yeah you know
but it's not nearly as obnoxious as the phone calls
i think i think you mentioning the phone calls during dinner
i know when i sit down with the family and want to have the opportunity you know to talk and see what's going on and all those things
so i try to
i actually during that period of time from you know usually from six o'clock or six thirty whenever i get home until eight or so i will shut off the phone and uh my daughter gets irate
when i when i do that because you know she's a teenager so she'll you know
but so tho- i guess those three things are the uh uh most irritating to me
but when i come home from work there's times i need to pay bills
and even though it's friends calling sometimes you just feel like this is my quiet time
and the phone ringing bothers me
but that's that's where answering machines are nice because if it's really important they'll leave a message
and i can call them back
but uh at work i have so many phone calls from customers calling in
sometimes it is just i just want to get away from the phone ringing because it it really does annoy me
and uh if i've had a lot of phone calls during the day when occasionally when we have uh
like this past week
and uh phone rings like crazy
and you come home
and the last thing you want to do is have to answer the phone
and if it's some salesman that just makes it even that much worse
and uh it just
i get to where i i turn the answering machine on and just let it pick up the phone
but now with this thing i'm participating in i kind of have to answer it
well i have now we have a you know voice mail system at uh at the office
now what i have done is i have forwarded my home phone to the answering service at the office so that i do not have to have a uh a ring at all
if i if i want to do that
and uh or i will just let the phone ring three or four times and know that it will forward to uh to the office
and so it's you know it makes it convenient
but at the office when i you know
we can uh on our system and i imagine on most systems
and when i when i want to be you know not bothered during the day that's exactly what i do
and so uh
well yours is probably the same as ours
it's uh tigon
isn't tigon uh part of g t e or vice versa or something like that
well tigon is part of g t e
and so we had had been using a the aspen service before they purchased tigon so i imagine we will be uh shifting over to that service uh for a while or if in a while
oh dana i think we have probably conversed long enough
well thank you for calling
i ha- i i enjoyed talking to you
oh i honestly don't feel like it's strict enough in my opinion
and that that the penalty ought to be out there and be enforced
i mean if your going to sentence somebody lets say twenty years let them stay twenty years
but there has got to be some kind of punishment
because if they turn around they can get away they get away with it
and they get away with it
and they get away with it
and then they do something worse and they get a slap on the wrist
thirty days in jail and they final get up to where they kill somebody else
and they go through fourteen appeals and how many hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars
well they certainly are living off our ex- at our expense
uh they sure are just because
it seems like really a rough time you know i'm not saying innocent person
you know it seems like when they go to prison it they really seem like it's a rough time for them and a murderer well go to prison oh
and and be paroled and and have served the sentence
that's what that's what people face with that choice
one thing i really hate is they don't explain to the jurors in a in a trial in a capital murder trial or in cases of rape or in different things that are so horrible what it means when they sentence them to you know
they'll sentence them to ninety years and say that it's you know that it's going to you know
but instead in in
given the choice of either sentencing to death or sentencing to life they'll give them ninety years in prison or something and then turn around in thirty years that you know
and less they're out
even if if they're even in that long
or they appeal
and then they get an appeal that says it was you know an unjust amount of time
i was i would just be
i would love to see them just really get real strict on parole you know
i think people know that nobody that it doesn't you know
i- it's not a deterrent right now because it's not really effective
there's should be you know this for this crime this is the penalty
someone you know in cold blood or whatever
and i mean it sounds horrible
and but i
i i know
because they let them back out again
and they do the same thing over
then they put them back in jail
and they get out
and and more and more innocent people are hurt or killed and these guys just are on the endless merry-go-round in the legal system
and it's like i said at our expense
uh a lot of people really doesn't think that much about it because it hasn't happened to them which it hasn't to me either you know
but still i- it could
i you read about it in the paper
every day somebody who's done this or that something really horrible and they just get away with it
and nothing happens
and as far as the other states i honestly don't know what their capital punishment is
you know i i
haven't kept up you know anything
i think i think texas is wha- texas the southern states seem to be somewhat more conservative and still have the death penalty
and i think i know california had it for a long time
and then they uh took it off the books
they repealed it and people like charles manson and and some of these other people who were sentenced to death at the time they repealed the death penalty were sentenced to life in prison
and are now now that even though california has reinstated the death penalty for whatever various crimes
the people who were there originally when they when they changed the laws to revoke the death penalty are still in there for are in prison in quote for life and and are now coming up for parole
like manson who's come up you know
but still it came up though didn't it
i mean you know uh-huh
well the jury that sentenced him sentenced him to death and then while he was on appeal on his thousandth and one appeal the state of california revoked the law in the early seventies
and then they reinstated it later
but the penalty didn't go back you know
it seems like a lot of times the law is is totally on the criminal side and and isn't protecting the rest of the people
in a lot of well especially in things you pick up the paper
and you read
and the the laws are all the rules
you know you think oh my goodness uh-huh
some of the things that would make sense to to tell the jury that this this guy has a a prior cri- criminal history you know where he's raped ten women and then he gets up for this one trial
and they don't finds anything out about the facts that he's done this over and over and over again and so they say well this is you know
i i don't know if they say it's the first time offense or whatever
but they give him a lighter sentence thinking he's not a habitual criminal
or you know plead insanity
but that seems to be a good way to get off for a lot of them too
they plead insanity and then three years later they're cured and let loose on society again
it just just doesn't make sense
i mean it's a it's a scary world out there anymore where your afraid to go out
i know in in the dallas metroplex area i don't go out hardly if i don't have to at night by myself and i i certainly i i grew up in a smaller town in texas
and it wasn't that way when i was younger
well like i
and boy and
said i live in a small place you know
but now i'm raising children
it ju- it really is
when i was a kid i would run between my neighbors three and four blocks sometimes and as long as my mom had a general idea where i was and i was back on the time
and now i don't let my kids out of the front yard that i can't see them
well we're probably fixing to run out of time pretty
but i've enjoyed talking to you
well good talking to you too
well i don't find a lot of time to watch t v
and a lot of time i find it during the day when when i'm rocking my little girl to sleep
so i watch a lot of reruns old shows
so your a homemaker
and she stays home too also
um i guess i have a wide variety
not so much the bor- things that aren't
for example like the cosby show to me is just kind of like a waste of my time
but i like sixty minutes
he likes tom and jerry and uh bugs bunny and all his friends
um now if i'm ever home during the during the day on a vacation day i have to catch at twelve o'clock the andy griffith show because i usually because he's just he's one of my idles
and then uh but i don't know
it seems like nowadays everything is so electronic you know magnified and animated
and so uh now i do with the cosby show
and i do
but uh some of the crap that's on t v nowadays
i do watch the special shows that they come out with the nova stuff and and
but i think there's enough out there to pick from
we don't have cable to the point of of the h b o or any of that stuff
well i find myself watching just a whole lot of whatever is geared for children because
and you know i don't want them watching something that i don't think they should watch
and then i had well you know i'd eat
like at work we'd have a t v or whatever
and then um as my kids got older and started you know recognizing what was going on i thought this isn't really very good
so i gave it up
i watched i had watched it since it started
uh now i i don't know who the characters are
and um i'll turn it on every once in awhile
and i don't recognize anybody
so i guess that's a good sign
i used to watch uh
this might age me date me here uh
well see you're probably about the same age as me because my mom watched the secret storm
well i think they were back to back
and i was like oh my gosh
and as the world turns i think as the world turns may
i think some of the tones of the the daily prime time is questionable
and that could be uh
you know keep them on the channel eleven channel twenty one
the nature stuff you know
and it's real interesting too the difference in my kids
like um my oldest loved sesame street
she's more into walt disney kind you know
we watch a lot of movies that we've got on v c on tapes
so but um we do a lot of kid watching
well sounds like you got your hands full there
and i do appreciate speaking with you
and it inspired me to make more phone calls
oh well see i don't really
but i've never made one
well we got um a lot of uh european dishes
we got we got what some people call the best beef in the world
so it's uh bishu
like every sunday you go out
and you buy all these parts of the cow
and then you just cook them over a grill
like in our house it's already built in
so you can make a barbecue
i've had i've had that meal in new york uh where they bring you a plank sort of with all this wonderful beef parts of beef cooked and barbecued and it's marvelous
well they have one in uh they have an argentinean place down in georgetown
i'll keep that in mind yeah
you serve that yourself or the for a family
well see the problem is i'm only twenty-two but like like when i'm down at home and like somebody says okay when are when are we having this you know
and i'll cook it
you know like you have to prepare the fire and then put the sausages on
and then you know you put all these different meats which take different times
do you buy them um separately at you know an american grocery store now
or do you have to
you don't you don't go buy it from a wholesaler
but what happens is in argentina they have like all these little places like the fruit stand and you know the dairy and products and whatever
so i know
and so they got they got the meat place
and so you just go there
and you can't find chicken there
you have to you have poultry place
what do you what other what dishes do you serve with it
well basically it's what we call it impenadas
oh i love those
and then we also put sausages on a bun
and then that's that's to start out with
and then what you have is also like you know like three different kinds of salad
and uh that's about it
i guess he he retired and went back to argentina
i guess in nine- the early seventies
so that mus- that's before your time
i mean he was wonderful
and uh what i what i also eat now since i graduate
and since being argentinean we also have a lot of pasta
and you know
because there're many italians in argentina
and my mom you know like makes like what we call niokes
all this stuff that it's just you know everything like lasagna and everything
my grandparents my grandfather came to the united states through argentina
actually actually a little bit later like nineteen thirteen nineteen twelve nineteen thirteen
like pure italians
well i'll tell you
so we and we both love continental cooking french cooking
so we cook uh
our meals are well
we don't we don't usually mix
i mean that sometimes well if we're entertaining we'll do a chinese recipe and um there are really easy recipe
that is you know with chinese you always have several dishes
and nowadays with microwaves
and if you like chinese food you can take filet of fish and put a little bit of soy sauce and a little bit of sesame oil on top of it and chop some scallions and a little ginger and just cover it with some uh waxed paper and steam it just until the fish is done
and it's a wonderful um flavorful piece of fish
because i was at you know
it's like when you when you go buy fish you know well like i buy like the fish
so you can do it in the microwave the breaded fish
i've seen you know the filet
buy a fresh filet of fish a nice one at the fish mar- the fish counter
um any white fish
sole is good uh um flounder sole or flounder is real good and even grouper
so we put soy sauce and sesame
little bit of soy sauce and sesa- sesame seed oil
and not too much soy sauce
uh some chopped up scall- um you know slivers of scallions
and slivers of ginger and then just cover it and put it in the microwave for just just two say two minutes check it after two minutes to see if the fish flakes
and if the fish flakes it's done
because i got i got um one of those little uh microwaves
well you see just check it you know during
and another quick dish if you like um do you know what hoi sin sauce is
well if you go in a chinese store ask for hoi sin h o i s i n
and if you take uh little pieces of pork and you fry them like little cubes of pork
and you fry them with garlic and a little bit of couple dashes of hot pepper and then mix some hoi sin sauce with sherry just a little sherry to thin it and stir that in you can even put a spoon of ketchup in
and that makes a great pork dish with a sort of a spicy sweet sauce that you can serve over rice
for two people um amer- if it's american style i buy a half a pound if you know we if you're just serving that
but if you're serving another dish with it say the rice dish um well with guys pretty healthy appetites i'd probably go a third of a pound
and then you know you could
and you can always you can always heat it up again and save you know
so it's just it's just since i'm from argentina i just love meat
you can also do the same thing using um if you have ground beef
and you've got a very colorful side another dish
and how much does it cost
um the hoi sin sauce
oh a dollar twenty-nine a can
a can would serve you for for you know for quite a few um meals you know
i thought it was maybe like you know like five fifty or something
well listen it was good talking with you
it's it's hard topic because
is is is it doing a good job or a bad job
and you got to divide it two different categories whether you live in the city or whether you live in a more rural place like i do
and are you talking about public schools being lower level high school level or state school
well public school all the way up kindergarten all the way up to uh uh high school
but you're excluding high-level education
i am oh
a- actually i think that i higher level education
but uh it's the job that the the high school and the grade schools are doing that i see in a area like ours
even a bad school is a good school up here where if i lived in new york city or washington d c uh i would seriously consider moving if i had a child
but of course people are trapped economically
and they can't do that
i know down here the school's are you know
and the schools down here rate you know bottom ten percent across the country
and having been through grade school up there and coming down here to high school i can understand why
because they're so far behind and so poorly staffed half the time the teachers don't know what's going on
well that's really too bad because it it's giving some people unfair advantage
i mean we our high school up here is like a junior college in florida what we learned
well that was my experience going through junior high up there
and uh you know i'd been in a parochial school before junior high
and you know even the public schools are behind the parochial schools
so you know i i like the concept they've got now where they have more directed education you know
you you pick a career path
or you get counseling earlier
and then you you learn the things that help you rather than spending four years learning the same things over and over
like they have that down there that
well they talk about it
and there are a few in some of the more like in
and some of the the better parts of the metroplex the the suburbs that are richer have those kind of target schools
but uh you know
it's like if if your father owns a grocery store and you're really interested in that
or if you're going to go the science route you can go to a target school that specializes in science or art
you know there's no point in you know
and if i have to go take art classes you know i'm not going to use them
and through high school i could have gone so much further if i'd gone to a school that was directed
i'm a i'm a technician
and we had a vocational uh electronics in our high school
so when i went to my first year of tech school i had a very easy time because our high school had a a good program
i think the schools today you know the public schools are just they're just overrun you know
and too many of the kids don't care
i find that that the that in the
and the parents send them there because they're supposed to
and plus it gets them out of their hair
and i also find that that you can send a kid to school
but if don't work with them as a parent i think you're putting your child at a big disadvantage
and you know there's some kids that you know want to go learn
but most of them just want to go play
well i could i could see if a kid doesn't have any encouragement if t- they're you know come from a broken home and they're parents are more concerned about trying to work
and or maybe they're unemployed
and they're mad at the world
i can see where that wouldn't be very good for a a kid you know
and they're no get away from me
so it's got a lot to do with economics in the area that you come from
it's well not at the moment
but a lot of the industry's moving southward
are they going to move to uh mexico
uh i don't know about that
but a lot of the industry up in uh you know the northern states is moving south and i'm wondering if that's going to have any effect you know on what you see now
we're we're we're behind down here
that might not turn around in the next you know fifteen twenty years
maybe the maybe they'll bring their good schools with them
because i know the town that i come from the the uh the large i b m plant has something to do with the top rated high school because of their tax base for one
and plus for for the type of student that's going to that school it's going to raise the level of the school because your parents are engineers or chemists
they're they're you're most likely to do better in school
well i think
i i don't know
i just think it it's it's a duty of the parent to do that
i mean jeez my parents always helped me
and i don't know
and she's got four kids
is it you know
who whose supposed to make the change the the state the govern- the federal government you know
is it you know what what do you advocate more taxes or better management of what they got
actually i think it's i think it should be a civic level the city level and a a system level really to find out and t- to see what they need and not overinflate it
like if the teachers are getting six percent raises every year when people in industry have been getting cut back and you're getting raises every eighteen months you got to go now hey wait a minute
we uh our town didn't pass the school budget this year and for the first time in many many years just because people are are in the recession
even though we've uh enjoyed very good employment here for the past ten years
now we got eight percent uh unemployment when it used to be four or five
but i always
it it's it's all money based
and what you can do unless you just get down to the parent level
and and then if you're in a bad situation where you have to send your child to a bad school
maybe we do we need some more catholic schools
they seem to have done a the good job in the past
in uh some places uh you couldn't go to a public school
and the only school you could go to was the baptist school or the catholic school
you uh have to learn
you aren't given the chance to you know screw off all the time
see i don't have any good ideas or or anything that would contribute
see this isn't a subject that i think a lot about because i'm never faced with it because our school system in vermont it seems to do a really good job
well i know i'm in the you know
the only reason i asked about secondary schools or you know advanced education is because down here you know going to the university of texas the education i'm getting i think is kind of shoddy for a public school
i i don't think i'm getting what i should
but you know in texas it's next to free because th- they pay so much of it
but at the same time it's really not it's not like going to m i t
and that's it's really too bad but that's
you get people out of high schools and col- junior colleges that don't have the background for an m i t kind of curriculum
so you have to go to a lesser engineering school
and a degree out there means a lot
it's it's university of vermont
uh we also have some two year college
well there's a four year colleges
but like you say you
well uh i think the weather lately has been a bit warmer than i would expect this time of year
the uh the bermuda grass is greening up in march
and sometimes doesn't really start doing that until the first part of april
so so i think we're a little hea- ahead of schedule on that
and i noticed all that grass coming up
and i thought ooh
it's been a a fun break
but the break is over
well um oh i guess another thing i've noticed too here lately is that even though we've had some pretty warm days it's been awfully gray you know just
now the last couple of weekends have been nice and sunny
but it seems like every time at work i look out my window it's gray
but i'd rather have a sunny weekend than a gray weekend
oh i go for that
and it sounds like it's going to be a little bit on the cool side
but it's supposed to be cleared out at least by noon tomorrow
and then the rest will be without rain
well that's good
but i think the highs are going to be in the sixties and the lows in the forties
i haven't seen the wea- the weather on the news in the evening lately
but i think the average high would be should be about seventy
but you're probably right
well i like it when it's sort of a medium temperature uh maybe seventy-five to eighty somewhere in there
um one of the remarkable things about the weather in the summertime here is that quite often the average daytime high of say ninety-nine degrees is within five or six degrees of the all time record high
and what that tells me is that the summer weather is very predictable that it doesn't vary very much
i mean any other time of year that's not the case because it could be very warm or very cold
and i think it was one day this week a year ago they said that we had a freeze and some kind of bad weather you know it wasn't just a super bad storm
but it was it was that sort of thing that we never like to see in the the late spring time
i you know i was going into the grocery store
and a a lightening bolt was almost directly overhead
and it was twenty- six degrees out
and i thought well gee i've i've never known it to lightening at that temperature
that that is pretty unusual
and you really take notice of it too
it uh it probably was a lot warmer up high
i don't don't like that super cold stuff
i i'm really enjoying this now
well this has been interesting
well you have a good day
uh i i think i am
it's it's been a while now
i've uh oh
and we bought a house
we're about fifty yards from the golf course but unfortunately the house is taking up my time
so it's been uh it's been almost a year i guess since i've actually uh swung a club for a purpose
i hav- i haven't played in about two years
and then i went out two weeks ago with the guys here
and i played in a tournament out there
and i shot a net fifty-nine
i have a hard time inventing shots you know
let's go around this tree and you know try a slice through a hook here
and i can't do that
and i've been watching quite a few videos
so i took out a few videos and watched them for a while
and i i hope i'm on the right track
shot a career low eighty-nine so and my handicap is twenty nine
that's that's great
now it's uh like i say it's been a while for me too
i uh i've got my wife motivated about it um and uh i think that's probably going to be one of the next investments is get her get her a set of clubs
and uh we'll get out of the driving range and and get some interest built up
and hopefully we can uh we can start in
but she wants to get into it now after i came home and won the tournament the other day
well great great
she's she's ready to get off into it
but you know i like i just like getting out being in the outdoors
and i'm a hunter and fisher anyway
but you know
you know at least i can get out and play a few hours of golf
and it's not going to cost me an arm and a leg really
and i you know i walk
so you know i get a little exercise there too
i uh i tell you
and uh i took uh i took it as a p e course and then kind of left it alone for a while
and then finally got got into it when i was while i was still in school and since then uh we've made it um
as as the friends start getting married and things like that we've made a tradition of uh having a a thursday um
well have have probably like like a thursday night bachelor party and a friday golf day before the wedding
and uh so it
that's back in south dakota where i grew up and uh so that that's uh that's been my main my main involvement
but uh eventually i get people to come and visit me in dallas
and then i'll show them we can play golf in the middle of winter when we can't do it back home
you know here it is sixty-five degrees
and they're freezing cold back there
so but i uh actually i picked it up when i was in high school on the same as a p e course you know
when i got into the service i got into it and now when i come out here i just kind of let it go
and then one one of the guys mentioned to me at work one day if i played golf
and i said well yeah you know
but i haven't swung them in quite a few years
and then i got into it and then back out of it
and it just seems like every couple of years i get back in there
you know i really enjoy it
oh it is it's it's a lot of fun especially if you can find somebody that's uh that's got the same level of interest
that's that's true of any sport you know
and and people don't want to play with somebody that they are going to beat every time you know and and uh
and then you know we've got some guys here that they are you know four and five handicappers and they don't like to play with me because i'm too slow for them
so you know but get somebody around your own handicap and you can just mosey on out for three or four hours and have a good time
and i've you know i've
never never yet have i walked up
now i've walked up a few times on the golf course by myself with nobody else to play with
and never yet have i met anybody on the golf course that wouldn't allow me to join their twosome or threesome
sure come on out you know
and they don't mind if you make a mistake
they don't mind saying well you know let me tea- tell you how to do that or teach you how to do that or
that that's that's so
you know it's it's pretty nice and friendly out there and you can't find that in all sports
and you can gain a lot of ground doing that too if you if you know
you gets you get in a rut if you do play a lot
but you play with the same people you you aren't going to learn anything
but uh i'd like to uh eventually i'd like to work up if if my wife does get interested and maybe get involved in a league in a in a mixed mixed doubles league or something like that
we we have one down here in the summertime
uh it runs from like five o'clock to seven thirty or eight o'clock you know because it doesn't get dark until nine thirty or ten
and we play in the summertime out here
and that's what i'm trying to get her ready for
it's going to start well when we change time back whenever that is next month i guess
and it will start then
and you know we had a lot of girls out there a couple of years ago
and they were just starting to learn
and you know they were shooting a hundred hundred and twenty but they were you know
so it won't take her long
well that's good that's good that's sounds like a lot of fun
and it's something we can do together
so well she doesn't do much hunting
but you know golf would give her the exercise
it it sounds like we've got real similar situations
i i i go home uh i've gone home every year now since i've moved to dallas to to go pheasant hunting
and uh um the the last time i i took my wife along
and uh k- kind of the same situation
she's she's up in the house and talked to my mother the whole time we were out hunting and stuff
she'll definitely uh she'll make the trip for fishing if
but uh it's it's interesting
and it's you know it's a game that you don't
like bowling you know you feel bad if you bowl a hundred
but if you shoot a hundred in golf you know
so you know you don't have to be an expert in any aspect of it at all
i've i've kind of formed the attitude that you know if i could just if i could pick two or three shots out uh out of my game every time and put them together on one hole then i do pretty good and then and i keep i keep rationalizing that well you know i can do it
i just got to do it all at th- on the same hole
and and then it will get better
and you just keep going
and in the meantime just enjoy what you're doing
it it it really works that way
and when you know when i first got back into it i used to get mad because i knew i could do something
and i didn't get it done
and i just well i need to slice this ball around here
now you know the ball will go straight
and i go
but you know i'd get upset about it sometimes
and now i guess you know being in my forties i just kind of mellowed out a little bit
and well that's great
well i've enjoyed talking to you
well you bet
well i haven't had too much of a chance to watch t v lately
so probably everything i going to say is kind of dated
well i can understand that
we just my wife and i just recently moved into our house
so we're spend a lot of time on the house and out in the yard and things but
um like to keep up to date too
since i got out of college which was about five years ago my t v viewing started to tend more towards uh documentary news programs things like that
i've kind of kind of gotten away from uh being a series watcher having to keep up to date with uh
i think when you're in college you kind of you have more of a regular schedule in terms of you can watch every week
i i used to
but right now the last things i watched regularly was thirty something when it first came out
i yeah i started too and uh kind of kind of worked away from that
i i have a hard time sticking with something like like on t v because it like it gets real aggravating if you miss it for a week or two
but um right
but i tell you what um
and one night couple weeks ago it was just happened that we were exhausted
and they wanted to watch
and we said okay well we'll sit down
and we'll you know look at what you want to see
so you know it was prime time
it was what seven thirty eight o'clock on a week night and we have cable
and there wasn't anything on any channel
and the stuff that was on the prime the networks you know a b c n b c c b s was
it was just um dribble you know i mean it wasn't even funny it wasn't creative
it it was the worst i've seen
i mean i have not watched prime time week night t v i guess in a real long time because i was shocked
i uh when i first moved down here moved into the apartment and got cable and i guess i sort of kind of became numb
nothing surprised me any more seeing it on the t v you know
and then all of a sudden i started paying paying attention to
and it's surprising how much it's changed the whole moral situation everything is just gone one whole complete direction different
and we don't have any kids yet
but i feel the same way
it's really tough to find something that's going to be good and interesting for the kids even even cartoons um you know you watch some of the cartoons
and kids aren't aren't even going to understand half the humor that's in there
it's just it's just uh like a necessary evil
i mean when we when our children were younger when they were like four years old three years old five years old we just had sesame street
and that was about it you know
but now in order to seem you know humane and normal we do allow them to watch cartoons and stuff
but it's just one of those things you know
you have to shut your eyes or not listen or something because those drive you crazy if you're if you're in the room
so but it's such a shame because it could be so good
well that's true
second of all why the networks think that you know we enjoy that kind of stuff
and you know their demographic studies that they do that show you know that everybody's i q has dropped dramatically
and i didn't have to
but that that that's the
i sit i sit and watch some shows
and i'm embarrassed for the people that are even involved in the show
you know why do you do this to yourself
you like uh i like stuff that's on great performances
and i we used to watch mystery quite a bit and things like that
as a matter of fact you know when i was a kid
now there's an idea
and if they saw us watching the something
or there was some other
so we had to give a little oral report before we could watch our program
do you do you watch sports on t v
but it's well it's kind of it's kind of like reading magazines any more
i'd rather personally rather watch see a game on t v than fight the crowds at the stadium
but uh no
i'll sit down for the big games the super bowl and the championship you know things like that
but i don't follow any team
and i know how everybody's doing
and that suffices me
i like i like good comedy good humor once in a while
i i enjoy that
but what do you where do you do you get that come-
but again you're in a situation where you're watching mostly uh commercials
and then you're you know trying to pass the time to wait until the next comedian comes up
and then i'd fast forward through the
but that takes too much planning
if there's any any series that i pay attention to i try to watch cheers once in a while
now that yeah is that still real good
in fact it's i think it's on tonight
so i so i'm kind of out of it
and i consider that fairly intelligent humor
they do have a good they do have good writers for that
oh that makes me think
you know it was it was just automatic too
but we started watching again
but it's real different show than it was when it started
and it's better
but it's real different than what it used to be
but you can't be so can't be outrageous
you know if you keep that same format
that's for sure
well i guess there are a few things around still
but you have to hunt hard for them
been uh good talking to you
so what kind of cars are you looking at
well we've uh we've we've test driven the oldsmobile delta eighty-eight and a cutlass supreme and a used cadillac about three or four years old because uh i get married in a couple of weeks
and i have two kids
and my fiancee has two kids so we need a car that's big enough for six
and so we went i guess it was two weekends ago we went uh car shopping and looked around
we found something interesting at crest oldsmobile cadillac up there on central expressway that uh
but it's been uh a demonstrator model for two or three thousand dollars even cheaper than the best deal they can give you for a new car
so they call this program cars
and they come
and it just seems to make sense to me to get the most car for your money to get something like that
in fact my dad recently got a um a pontiac uh believe six thousand and he got a demo
and it's been a real good car and it's it's like new and it only had had very very low mileage on it
and so i think he got a real good deal
so it's i think it's a pretty good option
are the uh oldsmobiles that you're looking at are they the demos
or they used
well the ones that we were test driving were the uh were the new ones there
well now uh
and then the cadillac is is definitely a used car
and it's probably gone by now
uh of course we're not we can't consider getting a brand new cadillac because those are twenty-five to thirty thousand dollars
but when they're three years old they're
so then it becomes uh more realistic
that's what i'm thinking about on my next car is do i want to get another brand new car because last two cars are brand new or do i look for a used car that's maybe two three years old that but that's you know low mileage and in good shape
but i just i kind of worry about getting a car that's that new with low mileage on it because you wonder why did the person that owned it want to get rid of it
or is something wrong with it
but i guess that's a risk you have to take
well you can reduce that risk by uh having the car checked out
i mean you know if you're going to look at fifty different cars you don't want to do this but if you've narrowed it down to one or two you can have the car uh uh checked at uh an independent service station and have them go through it from top to bottom and tell you if they can find anything wrong because they don't have any financial interest in it
and then you'll have a realistic assessment of what you're getting
oh i'm thinking around twenty or twenty-five dollars
i would i would think so
well it's kind of hard for me to talk about buying cars because i just got mine paid off about a month ago
but it's still in great shape
well what you can do is take your car payment and put it in the bank for three or four years and when you're ready to get another car just pay cash for it
if i continue taking good care of it it's going to hold a pretty good resale value and uh if i consider going the used car route and save up some money i shouldn't have too much trouble at all
i i would think that's true
and i was picking up uh some background noise
so i just switched the channel up on it
but uh i really i really enjoy the car i have now
and i do want to hold onto it and and you know enjoy it while it's not having any mechanical problems whatsoever
in fact it never has and uh it's been kind of nice
and i surprisingly enough after four years i'm not tired of the car at all
and i want to hang on to it while it's still being a good car and while i'm not tired of it and while i'm single and can handle a two seater for now
because one of these days i'll be getting a six seater probably too
the first two cars i ever bought well uh uh
and i've always bought them new
and i've got a hundred and twenty-two thousand miles on that
so that that's kind of in the way i've done things is to get things that are new and then keep them forever
oh my gosh
about about a quart every hundred miles
so but uh it runs fine
but you know that's a sign that i'm going to have to do something sooner or later
it's a a buick century
my fiance is selling uh a nineteen seventy-eight cutlass supreme that she has
so she's going to sell it rather than trade it in
or maybe more than that as i've learned
when i bought my r x seven i uh best offer i got for my other car was twenty-five hundred
well i turned around and sold it myself for forty-two hundred
oh there you go
i'm glad you're you're taking care of it yourself
i i think trading it in they just use that as additional
but they just are going to give you that much less for your trade in
well that's fact
but strangely enough the best off- i mean the best bargaining i had made with a dealer on my car was also the same place i got the best price trade in
but it's a place in arlington
and i think maybe as you get outside the dallas area
well maybe because it's outside of dallas they are giving a little bit better prices
plus i was going through that t i fleet discount program
did did you use it at the car shop place
well it's before they had that
and they had a little file where they said which dealers participated in the in the fleet program
and what you could expect they said you know a five percent over cost and then options at cost and everything
so i figured out a price based on that
but i i guess i got a pretty good deal because i went back to the town north mazda right off central and offered them the same price as what i knew i was going to be able to get it for in arlington and they said there is no way you can get this car for that price especially if we add on the equalizer and the cruise control
and they just laughed at me
and i went the next morning to arlington
and they gave it to me for that price
and what's so funny
they took the car they i knew they were going to pull it from town north because that's where the white one was
and they had already told me we located one at town north
so it was that same car
well unless you're selling car with hail damage and flood damage
and you laughed all the way to the bank
oh i did
and i laughed real hard when i took it in for the two thousand mile checkup and uh that they required you to do
and i took it to town north
and sure enough i saw that guy
and he recognized me
he said oh hi dana
and he kind of looked down and saw that car
and i'm sure he probably knew what was going on the very next day of course when the place in arlington went and took the car because i told him there's a place in arlington that's going to give it to me for that price
and the next day they pulled the white car and took it to arlington
so i'm sure he knew
so i loved it
and i just had the biggest grin on my face
well dana it's been really interesting
um we just got the the dog less than a year ago
so he's still a puppy
oh what kind is it
oh so you
the only chow he's got is is his tongue
oh he's got a blue tongue
but i was out ruled
but i just love them to death
was the guinea pig for your for your child
so anyway she's she enjoys her though
so that's that's what matters
but um our chows we've had them i'd say right around six maybe seven years
they're um registered
and we've been breeding them
oh my my husband's always wanted a chow
but i'm kind of concerned about um with having cats
and how how they socialize with cats um which is one of the reasons why we got a mixed breed
um because we thought they would socialize easier
um my husband had originally wanted an
and his brother has an
and he so far he's bitten ten people
and the people that he got the from used to have cats
and they no longer have any other cats
it's telling um you know
when we had um we had a cat when we first married no took
and then we got uh the chow
and uh you would think you know that they were all dogs the way she would prance around them and and paw at their face
and they'd just play
and they were never they never harmed her
so uh they got along great
now i don't know how how it would be bringing in uh like cat to a full full grown dog
but i i wouldn't feel um hesitant about bringing a puppy in
um how how old is your child
so you had the dogs before you had the baby
and i was
i think i think a lot of that that that we hear all the time is how you bring them up
and ours are real friendly
but they're very friendly and lovable
i mean you think they're lapdogs you know
they'll just come jump on your lap and want to be have their bellies rubbed and everything
uh the female's red
and the male is black
oh i bet the black one's pretty
he is he's a big old thing
and um i was concerned about the female mainly
and as luck had it uh she had puppies the same week my daughter was born
so it was kind of like she had her babies and understood about you know
i think that really helped and um my daughter you know since since she's little has been playing with them
and they let her tug their hair and and get on their back or whatever
and she's she's grown up with them and loves them to death
and they love her
as as long as they don't have any allergies to them or anything
but i think it really helps them to understand when when they go to other people's houses
and they have pets
i see so many times kids just you know
that or or uh the other extreme
they're they're terrified of them
and i hate that
and they shouldn't be
i mean some maybe
but but um like our miniature schnauzer she's just she's just like um a little hyper thing and just prances around and jumps all over everybody acting silly
and a lot of kids are scared of that and which i understand because she is you know a lot of movement and everything
but when she calms down they're so scared of her
it that bothers me because she's the friendliest thing
she wouldn't hi- you know harm them at all
and and and that's mainly people that have never had pets around their children
so i think i think it's a good idea to have them
we've had um in the past we've had birds too uh like cockatoos
the the cockatoos are those the big ones
birds with the the orange crest on top
and those are neat
they're messy very messy
oh a lot louder than a dog you know
a dog you can tell stop barking you know or whatever
but the birds you it's hard to keep them from squawking or whatever
but but they were neat enjoyable animals to have
well we've thought about getting an aquarium
partly be- partly for the cats
i think the cats would really enjoy it um
but so far we just
and starting up an aqu- an aquarium
we we're thinking about getting a saltwater
and they're so expensive to start up
and in your the luck of keeping them alive
you know few days
the the saltwater fish have so much more color
and they're so much more beautiful
um the freshwater tank's just
really to me they'll there's
you know i really do- i really don't care much for them
like you have a little bit of ocean with you or something
but i don't mind having
my daughter had a like a little goldfish
a about a year or two ago
and it finally died
and that was neat
but the- and they're you know
you know you can't roll around and tussle around with it like you can a dog or a cat
i wouldn't i wouldn't dare have a a goldfish here because
and then my cats would knock it over
if the cats will will jump up on things and knock things over all the time
they're always up where they don't where they're not supposed to be
and that's hard
that's just like kids you know
yo- they know that they're not supposed to do it
but they're going to do it anyway because they know they're not supposed to
and they're so independent
and until we got the dog um it was real easy to to go to town for three d- three day weekend or whatever
but we never even thought that about when we got the dog
we just saw him oh
you know and then the first weekend we had him we had we were in a apartment in a two bedroom apartment
and my husband went out of town and left me with with the brand new puppy
and i had to work twelve hours that day
and so i left the dog locked in the bedroom
and i put paper all over the floor
well when i came home i opened the door
and there were chunks of carpet
and he had tried to dig his way out from underneath the door
well i had the carpet fixed
um i yeah i didn't even tell the apartment manager
but that that was my first real experience with with a puppy
when when we had our family dog growing up i was eleven or twelve i think when we first got him
and i wasn't really involved in the the paper training
and you know teaching him commands and stuff
so this was and to me a whole new experience
but they don't
and uh we found she's right at a year
and we finally got her you know house trained and everything uh
if you do not pick the trash up you know the container
i don't care how fu- full she is
so it's not like she's hungry
anything that that they think is good
and then it doesn't matter where you put it and where you hide it
and how how tight you have the lid down on it
oh i hate that
and the cat's just looking at me like sorry
i just oh
and she knows it's wrong
and she'll cower and go hide under the table
so you she knows she does wrong
but she uh she continues to do it
um but he's still chewing
oh is he
um the last thing he chewed up was uh when we
uh in dallas there's definitely a crime problem
i know it's you know worse in the larger cities
um it's kind of a concern for me
and uh it's
you definitely are going to worry about the location and uh you know accessibility of people to be able to break in
but i you know i'm real concerned that i i don't want to be on a first floor where you can have problems with things like that
and the um
the area i live in right now is is real good as far as crime rate is concerned
and we don't have anything at all no burglar alarms no guards
some some places do have guard gates that you have to get through or electronic access gates and things like that
well i i went to dallas uh when i worked for t i in abilene
i'm a little familiar with the city area forest lane and you know through that off off the freeway
and uh it didn't seem like it was that congested in that that part
you know because to me where we live out here in the north east it it's there are a lot of buildings very close to each other
and the cities are very populated with tenement housing
and with the uh people that are coming into the country from other countries not knowing the language
and uh they- they're going to the big cities
and and i've seen the same thing that you're talking about uh much more crime than ever before
drugs of course uh a big part of it i think
and uh i don't know
a lot of younger people you know into more violent crimes
tha- that that's really sad you know
and and i don't know if it's uh the family you know thing where they're not bonding anymore where mothers are working all the time and
and i i really think that we're we're falling by the wayside with not incarcerating these people
oh i agree
they're getting they're getting paroled too easily
they're just getting uh put on probation or something because the prisons don't have enough room
so they get they get lighter sentences
and some of those people they don't deserve to be let loose
and uh you know they had uh
in fact on the news last night we were watching this uh man who lost his ten year old daughter
and he had left her home alone
she's old enough to be alone for a few minutes you know
and while he was gone he had looked went looking for a job and stopped at the store
and uh someone who was in the neighborhood cleaning carpets these two men went in raped the girl murdered her
oh my gosh
and one of the men got uh i think it was seventeen years
and the other one was in for uh life imprisonment
and he's out
uh that's terrible
and the man said that you know if it weren't for the fact that he would go to jail that he would eliminate this person himself
and then go to mcdonalds and have a hamburger and not thing a thing think a thing about it
and i mean i think that what this is going to lead to is people will take things into their own hands
and that innocent people
i i shouldn't say innocent because i mean ac- actually if they commit a crime that they're in the same circumstances
the reasons that they're doing it compared to the reason someone else is in jail for it you know it's like two different things
i i like the idea that uh if someone is from a foreign country
and they come to this country and uh commit a crime i think that irregardless of whether they have already become a citizen or anything they should be immediately deported
you know once they they have been arrested
and if they know beyond a shadow of a doubt these people are guilty
i mean they go right back where they came from
we have enough enough problems with overcrowding in the jails as it is
so let let their country take care of it
well i guess i guess we do have a lot of people come in from mexico that cause problems
but that's uh the- they're so close
i i don't consider mexican people in the same category with uh
especially like uh people who come from cultures that don't have the same uh kind of moral upbringing that we have
like you take asian countries or uh the eastern countries where women are like in the foreground uh in the background and the men are in the foreground
and it's like you know
um they live back in whe- where we came from two hundred years ago
you know whe- we've advanced beyond that
and i think that their uh mentality as far as the way they treat them and that kind of thing
i went to the far east uh back in october to do some training for t i
uh some of those countries were so safe it was unreal
singapore is very supposed to be very safe
and in fact tokyo
and i thought tokyo would be dangerous being such a huge large city with so many people
at at the t i there i said is there any area i should avoid
and the guy said let me ask another girl here
and he turned and asked this girl and said can you think of any place where dana shouldn't go by herself or anything
and she she thought for a few minutes
and she said no
and he said is there any place you wouldn't go by yourself
and they said
and somebody will turn it in
and and nothing will be missing
they said they can just about guarantee that there that that would happen if you did that
but i was thinking boy in dallas if somebody asked me if there were places you wouldn't go by yourself at night i'd have to set them down for about five or ten minutes to list all the places out
i mean i couldn't believe that she couldn't think of any place
they said the apparently the crime is just uh
well wh- what's the difference there
now i know what it is in singapore is they have the death penalty
and they really enforce it
oh i i believe in the death penalty
like for drugs for drugs they they enforce the death penalty for that
uh they're just very very tough
and i guess maybe that's the way tokyo is too or japan is too
uh and we take the the uh civil liberties uh stuff too far
you know like people that are in prison i mean we didn't put them there
and as far as like them uh entertaining the rights that they should have
i mean we educate them
and they no sooner get out on the street and they're back in again
but i think people who are guilty of really serious heinous crimes
and if they're overcrowded well you know
i i really i i think that that's the whole key here
where uh you know they plead to a lesser crime or uh they plead guilty in or you know tell about someone else and they they get less time
or if they're in there and they've got seventeen years and they're on good behavior for every year they're in they get so many less you know that they don't serve the full penalty
i i i really think we're going to far overboard with all of this
i agree because it's not fair to those of us that that deserve a safe you know life to have to
that if the the laws and and were were harsher and were enforced
i mean you have to set an example
and i think that people know that they're going to get a slap on the wrist they might serve a little bit of time and that they'll be out on the street again
an it an i feel bad for the policeman
this this craziness you know people with uh automatic weapons and uh all this other stuff and trying to do a job
and let's face it
and especially not in some of these big cities
like in dallas i mean they've had
they're up in the top top five i think of cities that are getting policeman killed on on in the line of duty
and that's really sad
it is it really is
and i mean they're the first ones that take the brunt of everything
you know and i'm not saying that they're all good either because there's good and bad in everything
but they they're already uh have str- three strikes against them when they're out there
because they'll arrest someone and you know go through all that paperwork and writing a report and all this and having all kinds of evidence
and you have to even be careful how you arrest them how you talk to them uh you know what they say
what uh go ahead and tell me about your home
oh is that right
but i live in pensacola florida
oh that's interesting
so i own a home in pensacola
and uh let's see
it's a relatively i would say well
god it sounds like
but it's upper middle class
uh kind of an environment
oh that's neat
uh it has around thirty-two hundred square feet
and it is i would imagine in terms of of size and so forth it's relatively typical for the area
and there are s- you know several larger
but based you know in terms of you know in in pensacola in that area of florida
it is uh
oh well that's not too bad
and so it's
in terms of cost and and and size and so forth it uh
the hou- you know housing there is extremely affordable and uh compared to other parts of the country you know
oh you're kidding
i mean what it's
i really haven't i really haven't uh
when we built it ten years ago it was it ran around a hundred and forty thousand dollars
it it sounds like
i mean from the way you described it a home like that here would be at least two hundred and fifty thousand
i mean dallas is a very marked up
um because of all the layoffs and everything
um there's been tremendous amounts of of uh layoffs
so really housing is real bad
but housing is still real bad
well pensacola has
and it isn't because of the well
uh i don't know perhaps not in dallas
but uh i'm sure people in uh you know in uh galveston and so forth would be knowledgeable about it uh
and home porting was a possibility a few years ago
a new carrier was coming in and uh the uh attendant uh support vessels
well that's no longer
so do you think
oh it's it is
i mean the the number of single family units on sale is phenomenal compared to the population
and so i-
overbuilding is i- has been a real problem there
so you can still get a get a a good house for a very very reasonable price
and i mean
uh we have no basement
you know up north and everything do
but um anyway
and most of the houses around here were built pretty much the same style
uh we have a friend that lives two blocks over
and his house is almost identical to us except his is three bedrooms and ours is four but otherwise the layout is pretty much the same
so i i think most of them are
like most areas that are built
there were probably like two or three styles you could choose from
and and uh that's pretty much all the houses in the area
well i just
and they bought their home
and they paid like
they they had it built from you know
they they designed it and everything
and when they left the area they sold it for a hundred and twenty thousand
oh that's not unusual yeah
so i just wondered you know if the whole area was like that
and so we uh i was just looking
for example there is a uh condominium complex next to the apartment complex where i live
and i was over there recently looking at the possibility of buying a two bedroom condominium
now it was very nicely done
i i can't i can't envision spending that much money and
so you know it's
y- i guess you pay the piper
but plus the the the taxes around here are phenomenally
uh for the
and so you on that
it's not unusual for example for somewhere around here on a on a on a
what we would you know what you described as your house and what i would describe as my house
may- maybe you know maybe a little bit higher than that now
but that same house here you'd pay almost six thousand dollars a year
so it's uh
so the question of whether to buy here or move to another county say drive
but the taxes would be you know
it's it's really sad
this is one this is one of the most highly taxed areas in the country
uh and because the cost of living around here is so high
a- an- and i'm not
this is uh the figure
by administrator i i think i mean
i they didn't they did not define it
well what do you think about it
well um most of the stuff up until now in the recent months i i i don't have any problem with
uh i mean it's
you know it
i agree with that as as far as the as far as the mess that's developing as a result um you know
as a country the united states uh
i think our hands are tied as far as as as any further involvement
and uh i just i heard a comment on the radio this morning that uh you know it it gets to a point where uh if enough people are are going to be slaughtered over there over the the the internal problems um somebody may step in again
but uh i really think it's it's a u n issue
well you know the funny thing i find about american opinion is that when we have gone in to destabilize a government before the american public goes crazy
and now the fact that we're not interfering with the internal rebellion in in iraq they're going crazy
you know and i and i think that i i agree with you
i mean that's an internal problem to iraq
and until he starts doing something so inhumane that the u n gets involved then it's nobody's business
i mean these these types of internal things go on all over the world all the time
i mean yeah
some of them have been going on for for tens of years
if if i understand it right in places like the sudan and
and it's certainly and it's certainly been going on over there for hundreds of years
and it's going to continue
as long as you have so many diverse groups that are that are vying for power it's going to happen all the time
i mean the kurds have tried it before
and this is just another time that it's happening
that's that's absolutely right
you know they'll regroup out in the mountains
and they'll try it again in a couple of years
it was just you know it was
you know you
and and and i don't have any doubt that through some back channels that we encouraged it
but i'm not real sure that we promised them anything
and and i don't think we did it
but it just it it really doesn't make any difference
this is just a a another chapter in middle eastern history
and you know and it there are many of them
i mean the the british occupied the place
it it's happened so many times
this is this is really nothing special uh
well and and and so many of the so many of the conflicts um really don't have a basis in in uh politics or or human rights or anything like that
it's al- it's mostly religious anyway
and uh you know by by self-proclamation this is a holy war
and it is right
and then uh we we go on from there
it it's it's a mess
well i i i think one of the big problems
i mean looking at it from the am- the american public's standpoints they don't understand the middle easterners
i mean their politics really isn't politics
and there's a big difference
you know uh we sit there
and and we think that they think the way we think
and that's a big mistake
because there's no uh you know there's there's there's a complete different set of values
um there's there's different value placed on human life
and uh right down the list you know possessions and and everything else
and uh what's right is wrong and what's wrong is right in some cases
that's that's it a lot of the time
i i was stationed in in turkey for for a year and a half
and it it was tough
under- understanding those folks
you know it they they're they're so completely different culturally and socially and and religiously
it's just it was very strange
i can i can i can believe that
i i don't claim to have an in-depth understanding by any means
shoot i i think some of these people that they claim as middle eastern experts don't don't have a clue sometimes
you know they they sit there and and read their books and then proclaim themselves an expert
well i'm not real sure that's that's appropriate
that's that's uh
a a little bit of background study has never made an expert in any field
well i sort
and we make experts by reading books
you know and the japanese and the germans and everybody else make experts by doing
i uh i i guess you work for t i
so you guys are well aware of the problems with the japanese markets and everything else
it's it's like our car industry
the only reason our car industry hasn't gone down the tubes is because the japanese you know came into it and helped
it's it's uh there there is there is it's an overall problem in in in this country understanding uh foreign cultures
and uh it it it bites us over and over
again the the the
and until we until we start changing our educational system i mean we're we're going to be
we're we've already been overtaken
but it's going to get even worse later
i mean looks who's looks who's getting the engineering degrees and the the math and the science and everything
you know we we've got folks running around here who get who get degrees in basket weaving and you know underwater psychology
or some some ridiculous stuff like that
and and where are the engineers coming from
uh well they're they're coming from various places
and a lot of them are going back there
my uh my roommate is a uh
well it's not industrial engineering
his degree was in uh industrial engineering
uh and he's from the philippines
and the only reason he came here was because the education is so much better for those who will go after it
you know uh but i i see it all too often
i mean we've got loads of foreign students and they're coming here going after the hard degrees
and then they're going back to korea and japan
and they're applying it there
it's to me it's amazing
we're we're going to become dependent on these other folks sooner or later
bec- you know every every
the the country's got a problem with uh with quarterly reports and annual statements and things like that
and the long long-range views are are just kind of become a thing of the past
i don't i don't think there can be anymore long range planning
i think it it's it's sticking your finger in the holes in the dike
you know it oh here's a crisis
well let's plug it up
that's that's the way things have gotten
you know i i wonder
i i read in the paper just last week i b m's unveiling their new laptop computer
well at a price tag of six thousand bucks i don't know if they're going to have a whole lot of takers
now i have the i- i have the i b m p s two but i'm sorry i got it
it's uh there are many better machines on the market right now for a
the only reason i got it is because i got it through an educational purchase plan through the school and i saved forty-eight percent
so i said yeah if i can have an i b m for forty-eight percent discount i'll take it
but up to that point i had nev- i had always said i would never have one because i wouldn't pay that kind of money for their name
but now you watch
unfortunately the way the the way the high tech market goes by the time you can get get something in your hands
it it's it's obsolete
and uh we're we we fight that battle every day here at work
i i can imagine
i uh years ago i remember when i had a t i ninety-nine
and uh things just kept changing so much
and i kept getting rid of them
and i finally said well you can't do this
so i so i just
at an opportune time i got one that that suited my needs
and i've just stuck with it
the only thing i've done to it is just add a uh add a mouse and a hard drive
and that's all i plan to do
so i'm stuck with six forty
but i'm not a power user
so it doesn't matter
well that that's that's the key you know what- whatever works for you
and uh if it does the job then that's that's what you need
now my roomie on the other hand he is a power user
he's he's looking now to get rid of his
you know this kind of stuff
i don't know what the the last thing i've done as far as car repairs go is is change oil and filter an and that kind of stuff
i haven't gotten really involved in anything uh extensive in car repairs in oh oh probably a year or so
i had a similar thing that i've worked on cars ever since i was uh a kid
and that was some time ago
but i've gotten to the point where uh the newer cars are getting so complicated to work on that uh oh most of the cars
i buy i try to buy as simple a car as possible
so you know changing the oil changing the spark plugs
and so there's
and most of them now you know you don't go through the ignition stuff anymore because that's all solid state or or fuel injected
so there goes the carburetor
and if the fuel injection system breaks down
somebody once said uh i had a car that said fuel injection on the side of it
and a woman asked me what that meant
and i said that means that i can't work on it
you know they've gotten so complicated or so high tech that uh the guys average guys can't really go out in the in the garage and do a whole lot of repairs uh
i've got uh an eighty-four chevy van that's uh a one ton van with a camper conversion on it
it's got the the the good old three fifty
and that engine i understand
i can wo- i can actually work on that engine
i used to have uh ch- chevy van
that had the the three fifty in it
and basically it it was a motor
and you didn't have all the other junk around it
and you could get to it to work on it
and it was really fairly easy
and you can just stand there and work on it
the hardest part about uh water pump changes is getting all the junk off before you can get too it
well that's true
you're right you know
well that's kind of the way i was
and i don't think i had too many nuts and bolts left over when i got it all put back together
and uh the
and uh i bought it when we were living in lubbock
and uh i don't know diesels got pretty unpopular
and you couldn't sell the thi-
i mean though for what you could get for one
and uh the injector pump went bad
so i found a outfit down here to rebuild it
and uh i- reinstalled that
and that was probably one of the most miserable things i had gotten into in a long time
oh well it you know i-
well that's true
i think the onl- closest thing i've come to to a diesel is i've worked for a tractor repair shop uh when i was in high school
and uh we used to overhaul farm tractors basically
and they were nearly all all diesel
but as far as cars i've never never been involved with them
well the injector nozzle and stuff in you know the big diesel farm tractors you know what are about the size of your thumb
well ye- yeah
and you ca- you can get to them
and the ones in in the diesel cars were little tiny things and just almost impossible to do anything with
but uh uh i finally gave it to my son
and he drove it literally into the ground you know
and he he finished it off
i'm i guess you're right
the the diesel has almost fallen into unpopular status
i i'm beginning to wonder is where do you get gas at
i don't know if it's still uh limited like it was
i don't i don't notice
but maybe because i'm not looking for it
well i'd bought uh a g m c diesel pickup and uh loved that thing you know
but it turns out a pickup wasn't what i really needed
and it was the van that i needed then to buy the you know
but uh sure enjoyed it
but yo- you got the the three fifty in the van
i'm convinced that uh detroit or whoever it is made a major mistake
i'm convinced that the small v eight like the the mustang's original two eighty-nine or some of the chevy two eighty-threes
but they had enough power t- pull all this weight
and the four cylinders just don't have it
i think that little the little chevy v eight when it started out in sixty in fifty-five i think was two sixty-five something like that
little you know not whole lot more than the than the than the six cylinder that i think was like about two thirty-five or so
i think those gu- those little v eights could have been made to be pretty powerful little engines if they would have gone with it
well that was uh that was a short stroke engine it could really wind up
and and it was normally carbureted
and it's fairly easy to work with because there's not just a whole lot in it to go wrong
and you know changing the plugs and stuff
the the first well my first car was a fifty-six mustang
and uh over the years uh all
i had a uh dodge pickup several years ago
and uh i can't remember the size of the engine
it was a three oh seven or something like that
but uh i remember working on those cars
and there was basically nothing in there but an engine
the friend of ours over here he's got uh sixty-five or sixty-six mustang the six cylinder
and uh i was look under the hood of that the other day
and like you say you can see the road
well if you had to you could climb up in there and do what you needed to
you coul- yeah you could stand in there if you really wanted to i guess
my dad's got a new um
i guess it's an eighty-nine or ninety uh chrysler something or other
and uh he was showing it to me
and we're looking under the hood and everything's nice and clean
and you know you can see the three spark plugs there in the front
and i said well where are the other three
and he'd never really thought about it
and he says well hopefully i won't have to change them before i trade it off
so they just about complicated the things so much that shade tree mechanics can't do much with them
well when they went to the
started with the newer engines you know
when they started putting all that pollution control stuff on the older engines is where they started getting into so much you know trouble because the three fifty with all the you know
like well actually i guess her-
the three oh five was that that
v eight that they put in the the three quarter and and half ton van
and it had all the air pump and uh uh
i don't know all that all that stuff
and all the anti-smog stuff
and uh boy that was uh really a mess back under there under the in that van
and all that stuff loads the motor down
so it's trying to push the weight plus have all this drain on it from all sorts of belts and things
but that's one good thing
i've got a uh eight ninety uh chevy blazer now
and it's got one uh belt on it a serpentine belt
oh it's that one that's about uh what an inch and a half wide
it looks like it would be uh better than having
and i had to get all those off you know when i was replace that uh water pump
and uh i had to struggle with that for a while to figure which belt goes where
you know when one of them breaks
it's it's the it's usually that power steering be-
or something that's way back in there
well it's a pleasure meeting you
and we'll uh
uh i've got uh five stickers here from t i
so i guess i've done probably uh i'd say seven or eight of them
i hadn't uh hadn't not gotten any calls here in the last uh
so i don't know if if it's tapering off or what
if ta- it's winding down or what
i had a difficult time the past couple of times of getting uh answers
so it sounds
it's taken them ten fifteen minutes at a time
so people are either not
anyway let you go
so do you do a lot of cooking in your family
um i do some every now and then
i i work
and my wife's home during the day
so she usually ends up doing most of it
do do you like to cook
um there's a few dishes
like i i grew up with the um you know having polish and ukrainian food
and my wife she likes italian and stuff
so we we definitely have different tastes
but that's neat though because you get to have different stuff
i'm not i'm a pretty bad cook
and uh he's much better cook than i am
so when i was home i still cooked a lot
and i was in to a lot of vegetarian stuff
and now i went back to work about a year and a half ago
so one of the things that he took over was the cooking
and the kids are thrilled
one is uh nine months
and the other is two and a half
two and half oh
that's the hard part is cooking with uh kids around because uh becau-
or are you not at that stage yet
we try our hardest to get them to eat what we w- eat you know
and my sister uh she's the master of the fast order grill you know
she can make uh she makes six different meals
oh my gosh
like to have one thing you know
oh my gosh
and then she makes noodles with uh with
s- soy sauce or whatever
so all things
but um yeah
i was thinking of the one recipe that uh that we made
and that was um
uh scallops uh scallop um
and you pour it over rice
what's what is that saint jack or something
but uh i- it was basically just ground up swiss cheese and then uh standard cream sauce base and then uh the scallops
an and it sounds sort of funny
but it tastes really good
so we we had um a lot of seafood before we moved down here
and uh that sounds delicious to me
i think we're just thinking of having a uh dinner party
they had uh a murder mystery
and you came dressed as one of the characters
and you had to solve the mystery during the dinner
and it was really fun
and so we we were thinking we wanted to do you know we were going to try doing it ourselves
but we're trying to decide what can we serve because at this one the hostess was pretty busy running around trying to get stuff ready for the table
and that kind of interrupted the game
so so i was thinking there's this beef bourguignonne recipe that i've tried before that's pretty good
and then you can make that ahead
and you can just leave it in the pot on a stove until you're ready
so that's uh
she uh she likes to um she doesn't like the beef dishes
and like i said we always ate beef and uh pork
you know a lot
and they uh always made sure they had a lot of meat at the table
my dad could eat a a meal with out any vegetables at all
oh my gosh
and uh susan's you know they had you know meatless meals you know
so do you
oh they did the
so you know they they sort of come with the
we didn't my family didn't
but when i got into the vegetarian cooking we got kind of used to that
but my husband always did it kind of grudgingly
ther- there were several things that he liked
but it never was really something that he would have chosen
so he had to put up with it
so but there was one thing that he couldn't stand
and that was soybeans
and he just could not eat it
so i never
i like i like them every now and then for a change
ye- it's nice
but it just it was a tremendous amount of cooking
because you do have to make sure you have the right combinations of different proteins to make sure they're complete
and we had little kids at the time you know
when i was home with them and it it was just so much cooking
i couldn't i don't like to cook
and i'm not really that great at it
so it just turned out to be too much of a too much
or do you do you get into that's that
we used to do that um
my mom used to go crazy every sunday until my dad like blew up you know
af- after he gained about eighty pounds after coming back from the navy she stopped doing it
but um she used to have you know two dozen sticky buns three bread rolls you know every week
and um the sticky buns of course would last you know three or four days
and that would be it
i used to i i don't mind baking at all
and i i can do a pretty good pie
and my mother taught me how to make it
and um so i can make a pretty mean pie
but um i don't do it anymore because it's just too fattening
i mean forge- it's supposed to save you money
but you eat like three times the amount of bread that you usually eat
we always we had that bread that was uh um
you ever seen the the starter bread
they call it the um amish bread here
oh uh yeah
uh it's made with
you just le- leave it out
you know and you let it spoil sort of
i've heard of that i've heard of it
but i've never done it
you know yeah
but uh it's the sort of thing where you let a portion of it go bad
and then you add all these other ingredients to it
and then you sa- you make the bread
but you pinch off a portion or save a portion of it for the next time or something
ye- you take some of the batter out and give it to someone else
and that's how they continue the thing
i know it sounds it always sounded
i figure well you're baking it
so you know yeah
that's that's got to kill anything i guess
well i'll talk to you later
must be a uh t i connection
i thought for sure i thought for sure you were in dallas or something
i i talked to so many people from texas
i think that's why they call me because they want to get people outside the state you know
they're doi- they're trying to get all different amount of people
well gee my husband is from richmond
and i went to u v a
oh oh really
i went to school at uh well i went to school at west virginia university
oh you did
but i grew up right here in falls church right outside d c
one of my one of my friends here he was just talking how he's thinking of leaving the company and going to dallas
well things are doing pretty good down here
we we were we tried to move over to raleigh last year
and there just was there was so little such little going on in raleigh you know
so we decided we'll try in a couple of years
but but business is
we were saying we could sell our house here and buy one down there cash you know
you probably could you probably could
well northern virginia
well it's good talking to you
well i don't i mean i don't know what you think about the subject
i'd the i had never really thought of what they said before about allowing the the sentencing to uh to go to the judge instead of the jury and allowing him to do that
and i don't know that that's not a good idea
um uh that you know
they probably need to change it somehow uh
and uh are putting too many uh people in jail that probably don't need to be there
and it's another form of sentencing
but on that one thing i i still think it should be a unanimous decision
uh i think we're getting to the point now where they're going to eventually let it be um majority vote
and that's not going to be good
i know my husband served on a on a jury a few months ago up here in denton
but uh it was a guy it was it was a drug conviction
and i don't remember
he had some cocaine and th- it was accused of selling it
and i don't remember exactly how much he had
but uh actually not selling it
cr- cro- couriering it is what
and uh they he's he sat on that jury
and they found him guilty
and they went through the sentencing phase and everything
and uh you know they were told that you know during the trial that this is this guy's first offense
and he's got this clean record
and and they ended up
the jury you know decided hey it's time to crackdown here you know
and it was time to do this drug thing
and let's crackdown
and let's really
and they sentenced him to fifteen years
you know which they thought first offense okay this is they thought that that was that was a good thing
and they sentencing him to fifteen years
and um after it was all over uh the jud- they sit down with the judge and with the other two lawyers
and they were told that uh he would probably serve three
however they could not tell the jud- the jury that during the trial because all three of them were in appeal
so the jury didn't know about it
so here they based their sentencing thinking that this was this guy's first offense
and so you know we'll give him fifteen which will teach him a lesson
but it's not just you know horrible
and he'd been convicted three times before you know
and and the jury was very upset
and my husband came home a home very upset
i mean he felt like that that they had been tricked you know
and so something
i wonder if a judge didn't have control of that if some of that would change you know
or at least it it wouldn't hurt to switch over there and see if it worked any better
or or what we've got
well we definitely need a change in the system
obviously what we are doing is not working you know
and there's you know there's people in our prisons that are not being rehabilitated in any way shape or form
and either they're in there
forever or when they get out they're you know it's a matter of a few months
and they're going to be right back for the same thing
so the system
we're just not willing to set a society not willing to spend the time or the money to do what it takes
and i said you know i understand that there are a lot of countries that rely on the united states to
and and the and the people in those countries rely on our money to survive
but i really believe that we need to take care of ourselves
i mean we
and and the-
i know people say oh it would be cruel to you know pull our aid from these other countries
and and maybe so
so tell them you've got five years
and we will continue funding you for the next two years
after two years we'll cut it down seven to seventy fiv- you know seventy-five percent
and after another year we'll cut it fifty percent
and in five years it sh-
by then you should all should have a plan worked where you can make it on your own without our help
and then we'll have all we'll have we will have the money if we would do that to to work on your own system because we've got some serious problems here
and we're trying to
heal the world you know
it's just not it's just not working
i look at the i look at what you know thi- what the aid presented to the kurds
and i i feel sorry for them
and i know they're suffering
and i know they're dying everyday
but we've got you know kids here in the united states that are dying everyday too
you know and being
and you know i don't know
uh trying to heal the world when you're so sick yourself you know
well we seem to agree on the jury thing
and uh but uh we'll need an unanimous verdict
but i think it would be a good idea to try it
so anyway well we all agree
so i own a a p c a t at my home
i could never justify owning a personal computer at home uh
i mean that's quite an expense to look for uh
well who is this
well that's actually a good question
my wife works out of the home our home
and in fact she sits in the office
and she uses it to compose and print out letters
so that's a very regular use of it that she has
and in addition to that i tinker around with it
and so i write programs to do little things
and also i'm interested in writing some programs that will kind of like remind me of things like remind me that wednesdays is trash day and the like
uh huh well
years ago t i sent me to their uh computer school down in austin
so uh i learned to repair one
but you know i never really learned to operate one
oh that's a key thing
well actually that's a
so that yo-
but if they were careful they could make the use of it totally without understanding how the computer works
but i think you you really hit the nail on the head
and if your wife isn't working out of the home and sending letters
or if you don't want to build a data base to keep track of the
there your issue is then there really
well uh space is a handicap with me
oh i see
and i'm preparing for retirement
well congratulations on that
and i'm not to far from it another year and a half
well actually one other thing i might ought to mention is that they are actually getting quite cheap
but just like the computers
uh remember how they started out running three four hundred dollars
oh the calculators you mean
i mean ca- calculators
well actually i wasn't including a printer
but you you can buy a printer now for a hundred dollars
so make it seven hundred
well see of not being particularly interested i don't keep track of prices on them
but i'm i'm that does amaze me
you can buy the computer the guts just the guts with the power supply
and then the keyboard is another fifty
and then the disk drive is two fifty
well what what is a a good brand a inexpensive
well that's that's the deal is you're not buying brands now
it's twelve inches acro- narrow the narrow side and seventeen inches the tall side
and it's probably an inch thick a thousand pages
but the book is the magazine is full of these mail order computer mail-order houses
and they're all competing with each
so you just flip through there until you find a
that that's called it's the original p c
we call the t i i'm sorry an i b m p c compatible
and you'll find all these things and you'll find the monitors forty dollars and the card that drives the monitor that goes in the back of the board for twenty-five dollars which is amazing to me
and you mix and match
and then you do it by mail-order
but there's no real brands
they're available in you know the b daltons that that type of thing
you'll notice that in that it's it's a it's a although it's a magazine it's large
and like i said it's about an inch thick
well getting back to the p c
they they are pretty stupid because they add one and one up and come up with ten
well anyway that's one ever my favorite jokes
course it's it's kind of an inside joke you know
do you uh uh work with a computers a at t i
and then i was a scientist over in central research labs
and just recently i've changed my job to actually do some of the marketing
uh now i i type that one
but i don't use it anymore
well i just recently started using one
uh i keep track of an inventory here
and of course now that is where a computer is very handy
and well i it's my responsibility to see that equipment is sent off to be calibrated
see i'm with the q r a lab
oh i see
so naturally our equipment has to be in top condition and is constantly calibrated
and they're dated
so i have to keep up with them uh
and and it's very handy doing it on the computer
and and it puts me right up-to-date what i'm what i have to do what i have to ship what i should be expecting to be returned
it it is handy
and i must admit that up until i did start using one uh it was i had very little interest in computers
but they are amazing
so let's see see
so i guess with respect to the question
uh i guess i've had to return something
but i'm ca- can't decide
or um i'm not sure whether i've had to return that many things uh
well i'm having a problem right now with a computer that we've just returned
oh are you
so for me it's actually a pretty good topic
so we'll talk about that some
well we could talk about that
and then we could talk a bit about um just quality of products in general
if y- they're better or worse like if they last longer or something like that
i for years i did all that shopping and whatnot
but for the last four or five years i've had eye problem
and i've had two cornea transplants
well see i don't
i can't see good enough you know
and uh it's hard to tell what i'm doing
and it's just aggrav-
and you can't
oh i just thought of something we have to return
it it'll come to us
all right uh
well we bought a computer because my husband needed to use it to do some work for a consulting project
and we called up the company and asked them details on it
we bought it sort of your not a name brand because the clones are so much cheaper
and we called up the company that somebody else we knew had dealt with
and they were very happy with the system
and they felt they've gotten a good price
and we went in
we had to go across the george washington bridge to new jersey to get to meet these people
and so we went there
and the guy said uh that the computer would fit our needs
but he told us there were
and it's called a user boards
or slots is what it's called
and he told us there's two sixteen bit slots and two eight bit sorry two six- four sixteen bit slots and two eight bit slots available for the user
and we can put full size cards in there
and so we said great you know
and we put in our order
and a week later we went back and picked up the computer
and then we got it home and tried to put our own board in it
and there's only one slot we could put it in
and at this point we only have one board
so it wasn't so bad
so we used it a bit
but we tried to figure out whether we could put three in because we really need to be able to put at least three in
well it has them
but the problem is that you can't put the type of card that we need to put in it in it
oh i see
and even though they told us in advance that you could
they told us there would be no problem because you know
so we went back in
and we struck an agreement with the people
so they did that
and we said are you sure this will work
and they're they were doing it at their own costs
and so we said fine
and we went back
and we talked to the person a second time and things like that
and then we come we get the computer home
and we couldn't go get it sooner because i just had the baby
you know life's just a little bit complicated
and uh he goes and gets it brings it home
and then second thing we still can't put the boards in
and see now we're dealing with having to bring it back again
and they say they can you know do something different and change some connectors
and we hope so
but it's a hassle
you kn- you know it's just this problem with sales people just not knowing what goes on
and and so much time goes past before you finally get any kind of satisfaction
so well actually some things are pretty good with that because i put it on a gold credit card
and i just called the credit card company and explained to them the situation
and they said well you don't have to pay for it yet
now that's an advantage isn't it
i think uh uh there's a lot not to be said for credit
but that's one thing to be said for credit
so and so you know
and i think that's really important
well because these guys if they um give us a hard time we're going to say you look you know
if if you can't fix this to our satisfaction
and if we do that
but they'll just you know
hal bought me uh uh small uh well uh uh
my i have my ninety-three year old mother living with us
and so i she doesn't remember anything
but to keep her entertained music and some of these things do help
and i thought well if i had uh a nic- a nice little um tape recorder you know so that i could put some good music on in there for her every once in a while and then also so that i can uh uh copy uh parts off i i do some musicals and things like this and if i can copy sections off that i can use someplace so i figured well this will be good
well the first uh uh the first time i turned it on uh i was recording
and the next thing i knew the tape was chewed up in the
so after that then you couldn't get a
and then on the other side when i when i uh i loa- loaned it to my daughter the other day to take it over to uh to uh videotaping they were doing
and she says it's wrong too because the little thing pokes out too far
and so you can't you can't get it to run the right the right way
so i i wish i could tell you
but i was wondering like you know
and i was wondering if you
i think this is a i think this is maybe a name brand
and i suspect that it's probably
and we're going to get just take it back
i think just uh just uh one of the maj- major i think it was a you know i don't i think it was uh you know like a highlands or something like this
well this is is was a regular uh electronics store you know
so i don't think i don't think there will be too much problem
but i i guess i'm not sure whether i think things are not made as well
i think they deliberately sometimes um
what what for instance what are you
um oh wel-
but i think that um
i just have well i like electronic stuff
for one thing i know their work you know
the fact that they that they have competition with the japanese and whatnot sometimes uh dwells on a fact that you know uh
i've had i've known people who have had toyotas for years that have had almost no repair work to do on them
well they may cost a little more
but they don't have to take them to the shop every other day
and i loved it
it does the it did a good job
so part of it is that we need to develop more of a of a pride in in uh the kinds of things we do so we make them better
and it kind of has to start from the top and and go clea- or from the bottom maybe and go clear up
well i think part of the problem comes in sort of shoddy workmanship
you know the whole
nobody cares no nobody's
attitude is is just get me my dollar so i can go do what i want to do and on
and it's a shame too because uh when you get right down to it most things there isn't any if you do a good job nobody can pay you enough
but if you do a good job you feel enough satisfaction
so whatever you're paid is enough
and also i think
well i do research
and so i'm used to sort of being underpaid for whatever work gets done
but and you get satisfaction out of it
i think they underestimate how much how much value the satisfaction
and but i think a lot of it you know i think things come both from the uh individual side and also from the company side
because the companies that let give the attitude that well you know
so you'll be the first one fired
and we just want you to do your days work
and we don't really care about you
it probab- it probably basically goes right back into the h- home though unfortunately
starts with the one person that you know
and so you need to really work hard at helping your kids to understand that there is value just in work for itself without any pay you know
the the the that the value is in doing it well
uh right at the intersection of the busiest highway in the state and a uh it goes east and west and a north south tollway
it's the looper that goes around the city and then uh the tollway is called the dallas north tollway
oh is that right
just moved here about uh oh uh one about a month ago after twenty-one years two miles to the east
oh how about that
so it's a very different house from the typical dallas uh
it's uh it's a duplex type thing
uh very modern and uh very open and airy light
so it's different than the than the long texas ramblers
well we we live in a brick story and a half uh
and uh have a big sun room on the back of it
so it's got a lot of o- openness and light also
oh it doesn't
well that's what my wife really wanted
and so uh
uh our our last house wasn't too bad
but it was just too traditional
and so if uh
the n- the next time uh probably a year and a half from now we're going to try to build
so make one really uh contemporary and and very modern and very open and very light
they they usually get back for the at least two of them for the summer
we we have a lot less than we had
it's uh oh about twenty-five thousand twenty-five hundred square feet
oh that's good size
we we had
it has one wing built on that's a kitchen family room and then the big room on the back uh
we had four bedrooms two and a half baths uh in the place we just left
so down now we're down to two and two
so it won't be terribly wonderful when the kids are home
but it won't be that long because we not for sure you know how long they're going to stay or whatever
i was just reading an article uh that there were nineteen thousand properties available in texas uh for sale by the reso- resolution trust com- corporation
and if you get in the if if you can find one in the right area you can really pick up a steal
i i guess so
uh we we really didn't go that route and didn't look
uh but uh the planning of them
and the the housing market probably still going to even go lower
there are many many houses ju- for sale just by the regular route
and we just decided uh uh sell
and we got we got a pretty good price uh for for what we had
uh not as good as it would have been say three or four years ago
but that uh that was just the timing
well our daughter and son-in-law moved up back up here he's from texas but course she's from here uh about a year and a half ago
and they never did sell it
so they stayed six months
and she got her job back and he got a job down there
and that's a good uh example of it
i've been we've been here for twenty-five years
and my wife's from kansas
so i te- i teach at a college here
so it's uh it's sort of home now
i'm at uh one of the brook- uh it's called brookhaven college
and it's just about two miles to the west of where i'm living
so it's very nice
now richland college is out it serves richardson and uh garland
and that's about nine miles to the east of here
so uh anyway well it's good to hear from you
well i enjoyed talking to you
and i hope we hope we did them some good uh on their little computer dealy
and uh have a good life the rest of it
what what changes do you think have taken place in the last generation
few are uh basically staying home and being homemakers and raising kids exclusively
i i i grew up in uh sixties and early seventies
and uh my mom didn't work at all when i was growing up
she didn't start working until i was um well into high school
so i i had the advantage of having a mom at home that nowadays kids it's a luxury item for mothers to be home with their kids
well mine taught kindergarten
but she was always uh
so she was always uh
that that statistic i guess has been growing every year
uh i'm not sure what the future holds for that
it seems like there's it seems that there's a grass roots um effort or whatever going on
i i um clean houses part-time
and almost all the people that i clean for believe it or not are mothers that don't work
they are th- they're all um
it's and it's i think it's kind of a new movement
it's going back towards you know
and now they're wanting to go back to the old days where you know women stayed home with the kids you know and try to give the kids quality time
and i i think that in the future you're i think you're going to see a lot more um women choosing to not work after they have a baby
um i think with uh the uh the work force with the the salaries that
a lot of a lot of the women that i work for have husbands who are um vice-presidents of companies
and i think with uh um this it seems like it's more the upper-class people
um i don't see it as much the like in my situation where i don't i don't have children yet
but ideally i would like to be able to stay home with my kids
but realistically that's i'm i'm realizing that's probably not going to be possible um for middle-class people to be able to live just on one income
you know it's going to kind of
um and the quarter of a million dollar home or whatever
believe it or not though the all the women that stay home are real busy when they are home
um they're real active in volunteer work
um one of the women is real active with uh muscular dystrophy and uh does a lot of of work with them on a volunteer basis
but it's still it's almost like a job
huh well i guess that's good that they they've got something to keep them active
when when your wife has her baby is she going to stay home
or is she going to
we're we're going to try and have her stay home for as long as possible
that that that
i would i would like to be able to do that
we think it's uh that important
and i i kind of hope that the trend goes back in that direction
i'm a a counselor and a therapist
and i work with adolescents
and i see some of the problems the kids have when they don't have a real good family structure
i i see a difference in the generation of even the generation before me
uh were you know mom was like um mrs cleaver uh you know june cleaver or whatever
where the the attitudes were a lot different
um as far as i think the kids back then seemed to be a lot more
um ther- there wasn't a lot of the drugs and alcohol and
um a lot of the the things that are going on in today's society
i think morally um it seems like there was peo- people were a lot better back then as far as hig- higher standards
well the husbands' roles are almost nonexistent in family anymore in terms of being the father figure
and with women working so much they're kind of pulled out of it too
so kids are raised around their friends and by the media
and that's you know that's contributed
and i think i think you're going to see a lot more of that in the future
so if there was some way for for women to to stay home even if they could work you know
and those types of things that would at least in some ways um bridge the gap
i i think that um in the future um the the family unit as it as it once was known is is going to be nonexistent
what how do you what do you think
do- do you think there's going to be still a family unit
or or do you think that um the trend is going more towards single parenting
the the divorce rate keeps hovering around fifty percent or so
and it got higher than that for a while
um that's hard to say
um i i see a lot of families where
you know in the in the back
and back in those times we pretty much were taught how to be responsible
uh nowadays it's not the case
kids don't kids are bombarded with all kinds of junk
and one of the reasons i guess is because there's so much more income in the family with both parents working
and they don't have to do anything around the house
and they come back
and you got twenty and thirty year olds who are living at home with mom and dad
you know you create a bigger bigger family generation after generation but not really on purpose
so it's not not a real functional situation anyway
so you know i don't know it's i don't know that that trend's going to change the single parent type families
and the families as long as we've got so many other crazy things going on in society
i i think that eventually the the family unit's just not going to even exist anymore
like you said the divorce rate is getting so high that i think there's going to be more single parent families than there are um you know two parent families
i guess unless unless there's a a major swing in the change of what's important to people you know probably keep going downhill
and i i don't know
we we feel like that that we can make it on one income
it it may be tough
but we may have to give up on some some things
i i think in the long run though your child will benefit from that
and it will it will make the the strain worthwhile
well i i need to go ahead and and wrap it up
um it was really nice talking to you
well i've enjoyed it stephanie
and uh thanks a lot
have you did you have you grown up in dallas stephanie
i've only been here for the last ten years uh
oh where are you from
we we took a lot of vacations while we were there because everything was within driving distance
now there's a place i'd like to visit
so we we travelled all over europe
oh that's neat
when i was when i was very young unfortunately a a little bit too young to really appreciate
uh i was grade school age uh
my hus- my husband had a bicycle tour of europe or took a bicycle tour about five months right after the second world war
and so we've seen lots of pictures of the of the beautiful
that that would be a to me a really nice vacation because i'm i'm not in physical shape for something like that but uh i i sure would work on it
that's neat neat
uh well my husband and i are scuba divers
so we both like to go to dive resorts
uh we went to hawaii on our honeymoon
and we dove there
uh but we we did about six dives while we were there
and uh we were originally planning on going to cayman
uh last year uh but we weren't able to get enough people together for the trip
we had to have like eleven people for
this package uh deal
uh and we couldn't get enough people together uh to go
so it ended up falling a- falling through
when when our children were younger we enjoyed we lived up in uh new york or new jersey and and used to like uh traveling into upstate new york and camping and we had a little collapsible sailboat and liked to sail and that sort of thing
but we've never really uh did any diving or anything
little bit of s- of uh uh
s- water skiing
but not much of uh
well my husband and i both like water
so any any vacation that we go on is usually
involves close to the ocean
or or something like that
when when we were in jersey we used to go down to the jersey beach a lot and really enjoyed that a lot
it's really they had
we after we moved away from germany we moved to new hampshire
and i lived there for seven years
oh i see
and i really enjoyed that because you know the mountains were real close
we like the we like the white mountains
uh unfortunately i didn't really get to go skiing much while i was there
we loved the we loved the the new jersey area too because the
you could you could drive within twenty minutes to an hour
and then we weren't too for from the appalachian trail
are you a you a hiker or not
not so much huh
not not really so much
if if if there was some place that that we went to where there was hiking involved i i would be you know happy to go hiking
so your your next your plans are try to find someplace to s- scuba dive
our next vacation will will be scuba diving
so some of the things are not as quite as uh adaptable
it's a it's a little more difficult planning a vacation
when you have have children
so i think wha-
and diving is something that
especially for small children uh
i think the the minimum age for diving is is probably legal anyway would be probably about sixteen
but maybe fifteen even
i know that uh uh one of one thing that happens to us to vacation trips now is that usually that try to involve some of the members of the family
you know we go wherever somebody is
so that that's kind of
uh we just came back from uh uh grand rapids where we saw one of our sons graduate
from uh with his master's degree in social work
and so that was fun
and and the summer we have a we have a a reunion in in salt lake area up by park cities
where we're going to camp for a week with as many members of of a rather large reunion group that uh as we can get together
that that sounds like a lot of fun
that there were several hundred uh people
and they all kind of met at a central place
i i didn't go
uh but it would have been nice it would have been a nice vacation
we we've tra- we've moved around enough so that we now have people in different parts of the country
i guess my favorite vacation idea would be to somehow figure out something kind of mobile where you could stop and sleep maybe you know like a a small camper
we've we've travelled in a big one
but maybe a pickup with the back on
some- or something like uh what's the like the volkswagen vanagon
so you could kind of sleep in it sometimes
but you wouldn't want to do it all the time
uh we have enough friends here and there
and visit for a day and then go on and you know
my dad has been talking for years about uh getting a fifth wheel and just picking up
he's retired uh he's in his sixties
and he uh would like to just get a fifth wheel and just travel across the country and spend a month here or a couple of weeks there
and just you know not
and i would like to maybe not take great long trips but but have your home base where your home is and then just travel out for like maybe oh a month maybe go
he he does that quite a bit
he he hasn't lately though uh because he's been ill
uh but he's been known to be gone for a month or two at a time
and you know he'll say this is my itinerary
and i'll be back in about two months
there are a lot of neat neat places to visit in america
we've i haven't been much to the south
i haven't been in in georgia or florida or mississippi or alabama
i guess that's those are the only states i have not visited
but uh up the coast uh at uh uh in maryland and around there where the where the early history is there's some
johnstown and uh in s- in that area is just really neat
so you know
have you been a to a lot of the different historical sites
we took a trip uh around to the uh civil war battle grounds and things back in nineteen sixty when it was the centennial or something
uh had about three kids then i think
but that was a really fun interesting trip
and so we were ready to look up the places we read about
i i think right right now while my husband and i don't have any kids we'll probably take as many vacations as we can doing things like scuba diving and and adventurous types of things
and then when we- eventually when we have kids
now his his folks did a lot of traveling across country
you know they went to the grand canyon and did things like that
well now camping is fun with kids
but even even some little ones do pretty good
but but when they get a little bigger so they can help
that that's a fun way to
and it's enjoyable too
i mean i find
i i do enjoy camping
i find the outdoors very relaxing and you know kind of
well i'm with you
well it was great to talk to you
well i have wallpaper in both of my bathrooms right now which is really pretty disgusting
and um it's a rent house
and i decided it's too expensive to rewallpaper
so i decided i'm going to paint
and i've been buying some magazines and stuff and looking at different ways to paint
and i'm thinking about maybe sponge painting them
oh what would be interesting
and you get some beautiful effects with them
uh one of the books that i bought where it's d- describing the sponge painting said you can like layer different colors
i've seen that done where there's uh oh
and then it had a little bit darker sort of peachy color
and in between there was a sort of a rust uh put on very sparingly
and it gave the impression of very old weathered stucco
um what i what i'm trying to do is i've got yellow tile in both the bathrooms so i want something that's going to tie that together
and i'm changing the like the towel racks and stuff the the fixtures out to make them wood
so it's going to have kind of a country look
um and i haven't even decided as far as um what kind of paint to buy
so i'm really in kind of the beginning stages right now
um it's going to be a big experiment
because you might find that it's beyond uh what you're willing to put into it
but i sure did my share of just regular painting
uh i've painted several houses inside
what what kind of what kind of paint do you normally use
well uh we used a latex uh wall paint and then a semigloss enamel for the woodwork
and my job was mostly the woodwork
and i got to do all of the masking tape and then all of the little fine uh trim work
where i'd use a small brush and uh try to keep the paint from dripping on the windows and things like that
well we only have on- only one of our bathroom has a window in it
so i'm hoping that um it won't be too much of a a problem
um i'm wondering if my bigger problem is getting the wallpaper taken down first because i i think
well i was going to ask if you planned to paint over it or try to strip it
i'm i'm planning on taking it off
um i tried to get wallpaper off once twenty years ago oh with a just a scraper and wet sponge
and it took forever
well that's something that that's worthwhile checking into then 'cause i
uh if if you can rent a steamer if it's modern wallpaper it should come off without too much trouble
it it's hard to tell
and i know the house um was built around the mid fifties
so it may be the original wallpaper
um if it's vinyl it should be easier to strip too
um in one bathroom it's um it's probably paper uh
it's silver silver and yellow
well the wallpaper that i was trying to remove was black
i- this was in a bathroom too
and the the tiles were sort of a mottled grey and had a little trim strip of maroon and white
and the the wallpaper in that bathroom had a black background
and then it had vivid uh almost neon colors of hot pink and turquoise and lime green and silver and uh a little bit of yellow that looked like coral sands and sea horses and things like that
um that's kind of an odd color for a bathroom
oh it was awful
and and we had a dinner party before we started renovating it
and a a guest went in there
and he said it's a good thing i went to the bathroom before dinner because if i had had something to drink and went in there i would think i was having hallucinations
well i i've also been thinking about after looking at all these magazines um these design magazines and stuff i'm thinking about maybe painting the bedroom walls too in a color that will kind of um tie in our um our um our uh comforter
with a color that's kind of a um burgundy and green and yellow and blue and beige floral design
um and i'm not really quite sure
well i'd say tackle one project first and see how it goes
and if you discover you like it then you can always upscale
well the bedroom would probably be the easier of the two because it would be just plain painting
it wouldn't be any kind of special um special effects type thing
well it's not hard to do if you get everything prepared ahead of time
because if you uh use drop cloths to cover everything and you use masking tape to trim out uh all the parts that you don't want to slop over onto you don't have to be quite as precise about how you do it
and it can be done a whole lot faster
and with rollers and uh modern latex paints
and they dry fast
so you really don't have to be disrupted for more than about a weekend if you have some help
and then if that if you discover the little tricks and tips about you know how you get through corners and how you do trim and uh how long to leave the masking tape down because if you leave it too long and it dries it can flake when it when you pull it up
it it peels the paint off when you take it off
i- if you leave it on for weeks it will do that
you want it to get dry but not uh just real hard
and i've i was told
but i've heard from people who tried to get by and skimp on narrow masking tape that it was more trouble than it was worth
because it it rips as you pull it off for one thing
and then you end up tediously scraping these tiny little shreds of masking tape
and the whole point of using it is to save yourself work
but use use good uh stuff and buy it at a paint store where they have the right brands
well i really appreciate all the helpful tips
i think you are just made my project a lot easier
well i wish you very good luck with it
and i will tell you that i have retired from the painting business
and i decided that was too much to tackle
if you were if you were closer i'd i'd i'd tell you you could come over and supervise
oh well i hope your project turns out great
and i really think that it's exciting that you're going to try the sponge painting
i think that could give it a really a
well we'll see how it goes
well of course that's the other advantage of paint
i i need to go to the dentist
i think i get most of my news uh in headlines from the radio
and then i follow-up by reading the newspaper and news magazines about things that attract my attention
well i i do about the same i guess but in a different fashion
i i i'm from new york originally
and now that i live in florida
i live in the florida in the winter and then go back up north in the in the summertime and i i feel that the the only legitimate paper
and i try t-
i also read uh i i i guess i do watch uh mcneil lehrer on p b s because i i lean to that coverage
and and i guess i'm
but they take so long
actually it's an hour show each evening
and and we we turn it on when we start dinner
i find that i'm leaning on uh
i travel a great deal uh even overseas
and i find that i lean on uh c n n quite a bit for concise and quick stuff
and i'm i i'm quite satisfied with the way they put it out
i mean i i don't believe everything they say
but it's it's coverage you know
and they seemed to have the best coverage
i i i uh
peter arnet was reporting direct from uh iraq
i i think that what he he reported what he saw and if you didn't like it that was just too bad you know
well uh i know that the coverage he was allowed to present was slanted
but i think they said that frequently enough
i mean uh
that uh you shouldn't criticize the man for giving us one perspective
that that's right i think so
and and i guess when it comes to um to magazines i don't read
i i have seemed to slide away from that and rely more on the local paper
or i i i also subscribe to something called world press which is a magazine that only talks about other ex- excerpts from the world press
but uh that i guess and the radio
uh i listen to p b s radio a lot
and i also listen to uh these twenty-four hour news stations when i'm driving
i'm from uh
is that what is that
the san francisco paper out there is uh
and that's a terrible paper
so i subscribe to the san jose mercury news
well it's a whole lot better than that san francisco paper
oh the what is that the chronicle isn't it
but they're uh both run by the same peo-
they ju- they really are probably the worse papers i've ever read
i uh uh
they're just horrid so we read
well can you get the l a paper up there
uh we can
but i don't like it
so we subscribe to the new york times and the wall street journal and uh mercury news
well that's another one i read
not as in depth as i used to because they their articles seem to be getting even longer and longer
well again i read that uh
i i think i i agree with you that the problem seems to be they don't have enough time to do all the stuff
i feel pretty well versed in in what i'm doing because i i do spend more time on that than i do say on sports or
i find it very exciting to for the coverage we have now today
and i think we do get pretty good coverage
i don't feel that the american people is being shortchanged by the uh the news coverage
if anything they i think they list-
well i don't know
i i hear a lot of criticism about listening to these the dan rathers of the world and and listen- and taking their word for it or their comment
actually they i think they slant things
well i cannot stand dan rather
and i hated him then
and i would not watch that man for money
and he and barbara walters just really turn my stomach
was was he
so i watch peter jennings and uh and tom brokaw sort of alternately
i guess i i got to say if that's the subject if the subject is do i feel that we're well enough equipped to
if if it said that i feel i'm well enough equipped
do we get uh do we get the news that we want
and i do
i think you have to let yo- you got to segregate some of it
well that's about all i have to say
well nice to talk to you
well we uh
but uh i think we do get quite a good value for the tax dollars we spend in most cases
i i think so
i i'm uh i think i'm i think i'm uh a little out of the ordinary in that that i i uh i think i'm more worried about the deficit the national deficit than than uh a lot of other people are and think that we need to we need to either raise our taxes or or cutback on something
and i don't know what to cutback on to to get to get that to get that settled
and and uh
and uh i know i'm a real a real uh out of it in terms of taxes
so i'm no- i'm uh think that the we really ought to seriously consider what an income tax might do that uh for texas
well at this stage i think we've taxed property almost to the limit because
like the the property taxes on the homes have reached the point that it's precluding people from being able to own a home because of the cost of the taxes on them
i live in richardson and it's up over two thousand dollars a year for taxes on my house
but now we're getting public services the schools the hospitals
and if it weren't for the taxes we're putting in there uh look what the schools could cost you
now i'm uh uh oh i
we'd when we moved to r- richardson one of the reasons we chose it was for the uh for the schools and and realizing that that that that quality of schools might well have higher taxes than other places but that we were willing to uh to go for that
then again the the community college system here is excellent for the dollar spent
and the public
uh i believe i don't know which one it is uh down there whether it's hobby or uh
well if you double the tuition it would still be considerably less than the public school tuition in most other states
that would provide uh possibly some relief there to utilize some of the property taxes for other things see
but i p- eventually i think you may tax people out of smoking even
well i quit ten years ago
well that that that would be true
i know uh
but all the various taxing authorities that come through i think the one tax i resent the most though is the additional sales tax for dart which is probably never going to be in existence in my lifetime
and and even if it is isn't going to uh uh provide you with any any services in that it's not doing to provide a route from your your home to a business for instance you know
well this this is a thing
i think it's like uh back east
and had a public transportation system starting in the horse and buggy days and when land was cheap and uh construction costs were cheap you could afford it
and the other thing is that when it when it's the public transportation is established that early on then then the business uh business and residential patterns develop to take advantage of that
whereas in in uh in dallas here we've we've got uh those patterns were well established before before we really tried to tried to do the dart
and uh for instance all the all the the uh office buildings and stuff that are out here in in uh north dallas as opposed to downtown
uh to try to to try to provide efficient transportation from everywhere around the the metroplex to to uh both those centers of of business plus everything else that's scattered around here and there as opposed to having a concentrated business area
you know like new york does
someone made the analogy uh with texans as being like the old cowboys and their horse
well most texans will jump in their car to drive across the street
and i'm just as guilty as anyone else
i drive to work every day by myself uh without even even any thought of car pooling
so but i here again i think i resented where they were collecting the sales tax for five years before they turned a spade of dirt
so and doing all these studies and the things
oh the c-
well that's about all i can say at this time
i th- i think so
uh do you own a p c by the way
and they live just about three miles away
so we use that one
and my in-laws also have one
and they're almost as close
and what kinds of things do you use it for when you us- when you go to their hous- houses to them
um usually uh word processing something um
also i have a nine year old that i've been home schooling for the last three years
and we got
uh the one that my parents have is an apple two e
and i have a sister-in-law who is who works in the fort worth school district
and so she got me copies of uh several of the apple programs for school programs
and so we use those
and there's some
um my husband has used the one at his folks house for mostly business things
uh his resume his uh letter
so that type of thing uh forms for his photography business
well i tell you once you get used to having them you you get spoiled really quickly
and they have a bunch of computers leftover from that and we're hoping that they can put
but um they're kind of
so i'm not sure that we'll be able to do get too many other programs for it
um i n- i'm a a writer by profession
and uh when when i was first here in in dallas or in plano um and was finally able to this is oh been like fourteen years ago we moved here and i was finally able to afford a new typewriter and i got an i b m selectric i thought i had died and gone to heaven because
i thought oh they're so wonderful
well then um
but but then my husband um worked at t i
and i got a um this has been years ago he doesn't work there anymore but he got a um
and i learned wordstar on that
and boy once that happened there was just no way that i could ever go back to doing anything of length of the typewriter
i learned i i learned wordstar uh
i did some typing for my father when he had the company and so i learned that on there too
have you ever used do you use wordperfect ever have you ever used wordperfect
well i guess i have used it once or twice
uh it's the one that's on my father-in-law's computer
and uh so that's the program that they're using there
i have that on my uh computer here
and also um i do some work at u t d
and uh that's what they have there
and it was just so nice to be able just to step into the position and and already know the langu- you know already know the the software
and um i don't know from my own experience um
wordperfect is just so much better than than wordstar at least the version of wordstar that i used to have
it's uh wordstar was never very intuitive to me
i mean you know you
some of the commands just had nothing to do with you know what you were supposed to be doing what they what they did on the com- computer
i mean like going um forward and backward a word or up and down a line that sort of thing just you know didn't match with the kinds of keys
and but wordperfect is just a lot more intuitive in a lot of ways
and you and it does a lot of things too that if you if you do any kind of uh research or anything like that where you have to uh use footnotes it is just wonderful
oh that's neat
and if you add it if you put a footnote in in the middle you know if you come up with some new piece of documentation and you put that in the middle of your paper and have to footnote it you just change um it just automatically changes all your footnoting numbers for you
oh how wonderful
that i had heard that that was better that was a better one
and i think about how it used to be if you were doing a paper
and oh it was just awful
so um i don't know i think we have just become really spoiled
but i think
so um well i have not really paid much attention because i
so um if you um unless you have some other things you want to talk about as having to do with p c
what kind of what kind of things do you write
well um i was a technical writer for many years um
and my husband and i actually met in a computer company
um i was a tech writer
and he was an engineer and uh so i did tech writing for a number of years
but you don't need to drag it down the hall
oh trying to figure out what all that was about huh
but um i have
um that that was the majority of my writing although um i have also done oh free lance magazine writing and some educational writing
so i did some advertising and p r
um now i'm actually i'm i'm not working anymore
i'm a student i'm a graduate student
so i'm doing a lot of writing
but uh now all of the sc- scholastic majors though
but i i just know right now that i couldn't have put out half of what i did if that much without the being in computers
so that's been really great
and uh i'm so i'm real spoiled
and they just talked to the other day other day about setting something up again
so hopefully pretty soon we'll at least have the word processing
well those are skills that she certainly w- is going to need early on
and you know
um i think that that would be a real a real uh advantage to to her to have that and uh
so uh do yo- d-
we've been we've been uh writing a story together
and so i and i wanted her to put it into the computer
make a book with it you know
and so i decided well if she's going to do that it would be a whole lot easier if she could type
so we'll slowly learn just to type here and then then put the story in
well that's a that's a skill that she can use for the rest of her life
might as well start now huh
well nola i have enjoyed talking with you thoroughly
and um my husband is a ham radio operator
and i think about all the people that he talks to all over the
well steve did you go to college
oh that's good
so you probably could give some great advice
uh well i don't know about that
but i in fact i'm in the process of trying to choose a p h d school
well what's your ca- what's your interest
uh well computer science and cognitive science
that that's similar to what
oh i see
and uh my area of expertise it's information systems which is a little bit less technical i think than uh than computer science
but my area of expertise is uh uh human computer interaction
and i think that's one reason why i'm part of this study uh because it's of i'm working with voice systems
so so good luck
wh- what what type of advice do you think you'd give to a a parent
well you know the thing is when you're a kid and the kid at that age especially if they're going into undergraduate it seems like they think they know what they want
an and i mean choosing from my experience you know i thought you know my i know what i want a lot more than my parents know what i want
but uh i don't know
you know the size of it or
i kn- i know very few people that uh started in one field and stayed with it
you know they
i think that's what you just said you know having to do more with the size of the school the environment of the school uh
i i think i'd i'd advise a parent to send a kid to a school though that has a number of different types of programs you know
that uh some of the smaller schools might be very limited in what they can offer
but some of the uh the small some of the larger small schools you know i guess around three or four thousand students have a can offer a broader range of curriculums and things
so if the kid does change they don't have to transfer
or they don't have to uh uh
i don't know they don't have to give up years of you know of credit transfer and things
and and parents hate to hear this you know
because i i actually teach college
i hate to uh i hate to talk to the parents
and i always say make sure you major
i i think most employers would probably rather hire you know a a three six in um
i always you know tell them that you should major in something you you're going to get good grades in
because that that's always i think more important you know overall
oh you you're at the office now
would you uh advise a private school or a public school
you know what's the trade off there
i would i would it would
i i tell you
and the public schools here are
and i know that the s a t scores for our admitting freshmen are higher than a lot of the public sch- a lot of the private schools
and um i actually i would full time at a at a public school
and then right now i'm teaching part time at a private school at a
oh i see
and i think the kids are a little bit more challenged because their parents are probably college educated
where at the public school i don't think as many parents are public are are college educated
and i don't i think because it costs less the kid doesn't take it quite as serious you know
they're not th-
it it's the minimal cost
but i think you can also get a bad education at public or private you know
i you have to really you have to look around at the school
i i think the bad part is that most parents or kids don't know what to look for
i think uh i would agree with that
in fact the thing that i'm going through the same thing where in graduate school
you know a particular institution might be better for my area yet like say you know the university of small town in arkansas or something
yet if i go to u of i or c m u or you know some you know any big name school my quality of education might not be that much better
but it's the same thing
there's you know what will the name recognition
i mean uh yeah
is it a pac ten school you know
but i think
see i'm i'm at the university of maryland so in this this region um though i go to a smaller branch of the university of maryland my diploma will still say university of maryland
but i i think you know i'm actually at a smaller program
i'm not at the col- the big college park campus you know
so i i think um i think you're right that there's a lot of there's difficult decisions there based on name recognition
so it's got big name recognition in this area a big science school no football team but a big science school
and technical people know that
but i don-
and when i
now i was in education at first when i was looking for jobs
so most people recognized that institution because it was a teaching school sort of
you know but then when i went um
and you know when i went into higher education even at other universities they weren't aware of it you know
so i think yeah
i i guess another thing that concerns me is uh so many people it seems like everybody today is still in that job market
and uh um where was i at
oh go- in going to school you get taught the things you learn in school
but there is also a whole other dimension i mean the growing up while you're going to school part
and uh actually in the midwest especially a lot of the schools have like university of missouri will have a main campus like columbia which is big multi disciplinary
and they'll have a satellite campus in a usually in a smaller town
so you've really uh i guess sacrificed some social exposure to different groups and everything
but you know at some of the large schools i know that at at at university of maryland where i am you know in a p h d program i i haven't even met uh someone outside of my area of information systems except for
not it's not really on a regular basis
but usually sometimes every few summers
well all see all the family lives in once place except for a few of us are scattered about
so they're pretty much just reunited always so it's it's just once in a while we get the special gathering with everyone together
well it might be a good time for you to be- to to start a tradition
well in my family let's see last october was the forty fifth annual uh reunion
oh that's good
and all of the descendants of the civil war i mean yeah the civil war veterans come together
and they come as far away from california
and there's usually
and then where do you meet
uh there's a big community hall in vernon
and uh that seems to be sort of a middle ground for all of the texas family
um all of his direct descendants descendants have now died
and the grandchildren are in their seventies and eighties
so we're talking about second and third great children here
uh i take my boys
they're grown and gone from home now so they they take their family
so it would be the second great grandchild
and so they
so this town hall that you meet in is that like a um
well it's a community center it's a community hall
and uh you just bring the covered dishes
every every family brings a a dish of some kind
and you get all the wonderful old family recipes
potato salad and uh
well we try to stay away from those things which might have uh salmonella in them
oh that's good
and we choose to bring congealed salad
and we are very conscious of most of us are very conscious of of uh sanitation aspects
oh that's nice
uh that happens to be my specialty for that family
but there are others in the family who do them better
well that's good
well i had a professor in anthropology at school who studied family reunions
so i learned a lot about them
but we talked
a lot about the the rituals
it was it was an interesting theory
she talked about the uh the catholics
all it's a home centered you know it's all family centered anyway
so you usually are living where your parents live
and it's all
your you don't have to come home
so the catholics would make a pilgrimage in older europe
but when the protestant ethic happened in america there were people who ever went out and you know went away from the family to seek their fortune and then had to come back home for their reunion so that
but she had
it was interesting you know
but she talked about that and how the the big picnic table was the symbolic communion of the people gathering together and um you know about the bread and the ritual placement
do you have a a certain way that everything is placed out on the table every every year
is there kind of a you know
well it's uh
we have uh uh kind of a core group that that serves as quote officers of the organization
and they plan the reunions
the organize the you know who is going to see to it that the coffee pot gets there who's going to rent the tables who's going to see to it that the silverware gets turned back to the caterer
uh and each year it's done a little bit differently because different people serve in those roles
well that's pretty
we have a biographer who who continues every year to save clippings on any family member
and they're entered into a a wonderful uh scrap book and pictures of new babies and new people who have been added and and obituaries to those who are gone
and it keeps the family alive
even you know even though it's very fluid
and they're very dedicated to that
and uh it's been really wonderful
and it helps you feel a strong sense of belonging
and i asked him i got to talking to him
i said well how is his nephew doing
well i don't know
uh you know my son keeps in touch with him i think
but i don't
but i'm you know
so i got busy got together and put a reunion together for his family
oh that's incredible
liked to kill me because i ha- it was i didn't have that group cooperation
and uh nobody brought covered dishes
and you know i fixed a salad in a number three tub
and uh we had to provide sleeping arrangements for all of them
and i told him
have you have you done this repetitively or just once
and then the following summer we did not have all of the family there
it was when uh his mother his step father had died the year before
his mother was alone and so they came to support her
and then one by one his broth- you know his sisters he began to lose family members
and it was difficult to hold them together
and then of course he died two years ago
so you know that family has gone down to one brother and one sister now
and uh it
the the family unit you know falls
that's our was our problem
we had uh the first reunion or the first you know major reunion was probably six or seven years ago
and then the second reunion people who maybe you know had sacrificed things to come to the first one thought oh well it's not that big a thing this year
and so it kind of wound down
and then finally you know you're lucky to get you know you get the shreveport relatives there but no one else
well see we manage those people who are at that core group manage to keep keep the vigor alive
hey guess who got you know elected to the legislature
or guess who our local sheriff
so i am assisting them with their children in their selections
well my children are grown
but they're teenagers so i have three children um fifteen ages fifteen seventeen and twenty and um about i guess about when the first when the youngest one was in kindergarten i started working at a preschool and uh you know doing some work
and then i i took a couple of years off and then went back as a music teacher in a preschool
so so i am around not a day care situation but in the you know in the child care environment so um
well i myself really feel like the structured day care program is more successful in today's environment than the one on one care is
uh when my children were growing up i actually had them up and until they were in the preschool situation i had them in a in a home with a lady who kept two or three kids
and i felt like that home environment was very important to them
it was important to me and uh i feel like that they they had that one on one that's so necessary at that age
oh it is
however in today's environment it may be more critical to have the ability to interact in large groups simply because that's the way our young people are are dealt with
that's that's an interesting point of view
i uh you know
seeing the children in the school the way i do i i mean i see the ones that we can always tell the ones that have not been around children at all when they come in as three year olds as opposed to the ones that have been in the program that started at twelve months maybe and were were even in there one day a week which is all our school provides for the you know for the under three year olds but still they have an op- an opportunity to be with other children and it is true
oh absolutely without a doubt
and uh i but i think that would but as far as looking for a place you know i the criteria i mean i think it's very important to have very caring people you know to take care of the
and i was sitting out in their little playground while my granddaughter was playing on the things and was visiting with another mother who was there with her children
and she was telling me that she was given the opportunity to manage a day care center
and of course she was she had just gotten her degree
and she was so enthusiastic
and she was excited about it
and she was going to accomplish all of these things however uh when it came to hiring and staffing people who cared and who were willing to take care of those children and spend that kind of time the pay is minimal and it takes people with total and complete dedication who really don't want to make a living for themselves in order to be in that environment
that maybe have another salary in their family that where they can do that
and that's what i had the opportunity of you know doing and and i could concentrate on the creativity and and you know really having a lot of fun with the children and and providing
well they ask
so much of those caretakers for the amount that that they pay
they are to be there ahead of time you know
and they have to be there at sometimes six o'clock in the morning
and then then they have to work until the shop until the place closes at six p m
and then it's their responsibility to clean up and be prepared for the next day because they don't have cleaning crews in most of those
and uh she just had a terrible time keeping sincerely dedicated people simply because they could not live with a kind of hours and the salary
uh and she
well ours is not you know ours is just is a church
and so we we don't have the the expenses of a building you know we share the expense with the church
but we don't have enough you know taking care of a whole building and that responsibility
so uh it is it is a lot different
well i know that when my youngsters were small
now my older son was adopted
oh my goodness
so he went into child care at two weeks and uh my younger son went into child care at six weeks
so they were in that environment actually up until they became uh seven and nine
and at that point i said look they have been given the custodial care that they need
and the after hours care has been as good a quality as i can provide for them
oh you did
so i quit working after my kids started to school and got involved in volunteer work in their private school so that i could help direct their their learning experiences and their development
i i felt like that anybody who cared and loved the kids could change their diapers and feed them and bathe them and hold them
but when time came to direct their ability to make choices to develop the kinds of things that that they're going to need to interact with other people i felt like i needed some strong influence there
so i di-
well that's different than most people do it
i mean a lot of people do it really the reverse and go to work after the children are in school you know
well i just felt very strongly about that
and i i did not work as a matter of fact
and when he started uh at skyline high school i asked him son when uh you know where do i go to sign up for the p t a
and he said mom don't do that to me
so i knew it was time to go back to work
but i feel very good about spending those years with my boys
uh and i was just really grateful i only had one bad child care experience
uh the care taker that they had had since they were infants just could not do it
she was from um uh uh argentina and she was going back home
and i couldn't just you know wait for eight three or four months and then bring them back to her so i had to find a new place and i put them in this home
the kids cried wh- i could hear the kids crying when i went to pick them up they were always cranky and irritable so i just took off and went there one day
and uh the children were left unattended in a room you know
oh how awful
they they were not well cared for and uh so it didn't take me long to take them out of that place but that's the only bad experience i had
the rest of the time they stayed in la petite academy and i was very pleased with their development and their progress
but they're going to learn it sometime
so but for the most part they did have good care
and it did appear to me that the people who cared for them had a good concern for them
and in one particular case they had a summer program where they were to be taken to the y and taught to swim which just pleased me to death because i've always been ha- you know been afraid of the water however my older son came home
and he said mom i don't like that man
and she said well she said you know kids do exaggerate
but she said let's go ahead and send him another day or two days
and i promise you faithfully i will watch the instructor every minute and see exactly what's happening
so what were you saying
do you work with do you work around children when you work
but you have friends that have children
i have some friends that have children uh not that many actually
i was uh a student for many years and then graduated and went and worked in france for awhile
so i am just taking a little bit of time off right now
uh and and i might
well i hope you can stay as long as possible with it
and if i can do that
uh i might start to go crazy with it too
but at the same time i really it would break my heart to give her to a stranger right now
i think it does when when they are real little
and they are changing every day
and you just miss the little things
and and uh
well i think for me the important concerns i do not think i would put her in day care for joint
situation right now unless it was like one other child with a with a person
i would not want her to be into a in a large day care situation so young
maybe if i needed to work part time like four hours a day i might do that cause like you should get enough stimulation from you the rest of the time
but uh i just think that you know when there's two year olds running around the whoever is taking care of the care givers are going to pay attention to the two year olds
and only when the infant screams
and if not the infant is going to lay in the crib all day and maybe have a mobile above it to play with
and you know i play with her most of the time she is awake
and i think that is so important
well that it is important for the bonding that they do it
well such as things for learning gives the child stimulation i think is important
our oldest grandson when he was eighteen months old went into a a montessori
and they took infants starting at six weeks
and they have a program uh in that was devised by this montessori person
and uh and a certain type of stimulations
and there's times of day that even when the child is awake that they that they lay quietly and look at certain things
they keep deliberately keep the room not real bright
and and uh they have different things they will they will put them down on the floor
and of course they never have more than like five
and and they will put them down on the floor
and they will have on- i think one of them was a little mirror
and some were just different objects that have had a definite purpose for kids you know
and there's something about their eyes
well she's she's just been doing all kinds of stuff where she's you know
and she's just drastically moving her eyes from one side to another and things like that
and she's just started that like yesterday or the day before
and so every days are different
and i think that you know i think child care for infants is much harder than when they are older
and i will probably be going back to work around january
and so i think you know she will be at a
so you might have a real problem with that
but but i think it
i think it it hurts the parents to leave when the child is crying
so it you know it would be ideal if you could get somebody in so you are not really
but that's unusual
uh but i am trying to you know leave her a fair amount even at this young age with her grandparents just to
so it's a little bit harder
but during you know
sh- sh- she's met them already
but she's met them
that's nice when uh
i my i have three grandchildren
it would if they were where i could not get my hands on them i am afraid i would probably
you know i i like that
but if it you do not have to put them in child care that's that's an ideal situation for you is to stay with them
or you can set up your work program and your husband's so that one of you is there all the time
that's that's wonderful for the child
well if i work part time that might be doable
and you need to look at when you if you do decide to go with child care you really need to to look at what your options are and and look at the what they offer
but you know since this is
and you know i just find that incredible
and my sister-in-law is going to have a baby
and she is intending to stay home with the baby
and you know maybe do some free lance type work at home
and so if i go back to work on a part time basis i am hoping i can leave my daughter with her
oh that would be wonderful
but like when she is a month or so
and so uh she might be able to do it a couple of hours a day
and we cou- might even be able to do it on a trade off basis that i watch
uh and not be bothered
and so we will just have to see how things work out
but i think the whole you know ideally
and uh you know parents come down to supervise or
and have have some kind of real good program
set up so that you when you go you can be assured that if there's an emergency that person in charge knows c p r or first aid
they they adjust to what the parents
well she's been staying up late at night and
we- you know that works until they start school
and that's a problem
society is geared to a a day person
i think our next car i would like something like a an economy car that gets really good mileage and uh one that's really reliable
i would i think probably not a a brand new car
but maybe something like a nissan sentra
or something like that uh
and of course it has to have air-conditioning
air-conditioning and a radio uh a m f m and a cassette player
and uh what else do i want
uh i would think kind of a subdued color would be nice
you know a a navy blue or a
well i don't think we're looking for another car right now because we just bought one
but when we were looking we were looking for something that had enough seat belts of course
and we wanted air-conditioning and a five speed
and that was kind of iffy
but that made it better economically
and we'd look for about what you're looking for
s- but probably real cheap too
so but no
i think we would want one that even though it was a compact car or whatever that it would still be nice enough that uh you could take someone in it and not be embarrassed
or doesn't really matter
prob- well probably probably that would be a good idea
it it's hard for people to get in with a two door sometimes
so if we wanted it to take people out it's that's a good thought
well i think that's all that we need to say
well thank you for calling
and what is your feeling
um i think that uh it's kind of discouraging to uh
and it's really discouraging to be in a phone bank and call people and not
a lot of them are so ill informed they have no idea you know even that there's an election
or and these are people that are registered
and it's the most discouraging thing in the world
and up there if they miss three elections then they have to reregister
and i have often wondered if if maybe that would help the situation
well that's a thought
well can you come up with anything else that maybe we could do to these people
i i like that idea
um oh i had a thought just a second ago
but it slipped my mind
um one thing that i- that i think probably one of the reasons that people don't vote more is because they don't know the candidates
and i think sometimes you know
that's one thing that i have learned in w- working in elections and things is you know sometimes even when you work for someone you don't really know what they're like
and when they got in office it was just a disaster
uh and and i'm not sure how you go about really finding out what people are really like before you vote for them
i'm i'm not sur-
it is um
but i'm going to vote each time
and then if i'm unhappy with it i have the right to express my opinion
so uh there was something else i was going to
and i'm like you
but they have been more little more s- effective in oklahoma with having this program that you vote or you lose it
now if you just lose if you just skip one election
you have to lo- you have to skip three
and uh of course those can be they can be oh a long time apart
what do you think and this is not one of our questions but what do you think of this no excuse absentee balloting
uh i'm not sure if i'm familiar with that
and you don't have to h- be sick out of town or anything
they there is no excuse
oh i think that's great
actually you know my husband has run for office before
and sometimes it's nice to be able to go ahead of time and vote because you know if you're going to be tied up that day uh campaigning or whatever it might be um that kind of just kind of takes that load off you know
but that is an excuse and that would i could live with
but this idea of anyone wel-
i ju- i am so bitterly opposed to this
but to have the expense of
and i don't know why we couldn't have duplicate voting on some of this
well hopefully once they have uh you know once they've checked them off the list
they they do have to check them off a list when they vote
so hopefully they couldn't
but is there is every list checked as thoroughly as a
you know we
well this is a subject that you never think you'll be assigned to
one that kind of comes up when you've lost it the others
um as i was sitting there i thought the weather's been perfect
it's uh it's you know
i mean it didn't foul one launch
and that's kind of unusual
and it's kind of cold in the mornings
so you dress up warm
oh how fun
i spent the weekend in ohio with my family and the trees are changing color there
it was real gray but as soon as the plane got through the clouds
and i saw all those trees
and the high was only fifty
and it was supposed to drop and get sleet in the afternoon so it was nice to get off the plane where it was in the seventies
and they you know they have tons of canyons where the leaves change
and they're gorgeous you could spend every weekend of the
and they actually printed out maps of routes you could take so you would get maximum leaf exposure
and then on leaf weekends it was which is this time of the year it's bumper to bumper traffic
but i can't complain
and my family said that in ohio there was just an article on at the t v news that they are three weeks ahead of schedule as far as the coldness of the temperatures and uh the first frost
but then we're back to being warmer than normal this week or last week
i don't have to live through many any of those really
i mean nothing comparable i guess to what you've had before
well i've only been here just a short time too
so i haven't been through any of those either
so i have in michigan
but in michigan you can get twelve inches of snow
and life goes on
so as i understand it here if there's anything they'll call off schools and and close businesses
well they get ice
and no one can drive on ice
i mean we used to think they were pansies
but then when you decided what ice was
it was it was good talking to you
oh what a deal
but um so did you hear what the topic was did she tell you
well if you're ready then uh i'll just go ahead and start
well i guess we're supposed to talk about the changing roles of women
seems like um to me everything is just changing so much that it's almost like um you can't keep up with things any more
and everything is uh ther- everyone's striving so much to make it equal between men and women
and i like it the way it used to be
you know i think it's kind of coming back around to that don't you
i mean that there's a lot more people that stay home now than before
but i guess more than anything i think maybe people were just kind of wanting to have the choice of what they could do you know i don't know
i mean i think sometimes some of the the women's lib though is kind of like they wanted it all you know
and you can't have everything i don't i don't think that you can have i mean there's no way i could have a career and then be the kind of mom that i want to be and to me that's more important
ho- how many kids do you have
and mine are two and nine months
so um being being home is real
i i just am fortunate because i don't know a real lot of moms that get to stay home
and uh i just it's just weird that i was just talking to somebody this morning who's who's a working uh lady a working mom
and you know these people have secretaries and these high power jobs
and it just seems like um
she she told me now her daughter took her first steps at the day care
and uh i just think i i i just don't agree with that
i think it should be that people should get back to staying home and and being family more family oriented than than not
you know it seems like everybody's always so busy with everything that they're doing that there's no time for this and that and the other
and i hope it just doesn't get to where you know there's more women more and more women going into the work force
well i agree
i mean but i i hate for them to make people feel bad that have to work too saying you know you should stay home you know otherwise your children aren't going to you know turn out or whatever because that's not fair to you know like the single moms that have to work
or if they wouldn't be able to make ends meet not working or whatever
i mean i think it's got to be a personal choice
and it's nice that that we could have the choice to stay home
well i find that i whenever i have to whenever i'm in a group of people and we're discussing things
like just over the weekend i visited my family and some cousins i hadn't seen in a long time
and everyone's all interested in what everybody's doing
and uh you know well i had my baby with me
and i found that all i talked about was my baby
but it's like you know here these people are
and you know they kind of looked at me like i was from the dark ages
and you kind of feel little bit like an outcast for a while in social situations sometimes
which is too bad because you know i i feel like i don't obviously i don't get paid for my job
but i should get paid at least double what my husband makes
but you know i don't know
this is kind of a um
at at least here i've noticed
but i've really noticed that there are a lot of uh a lot more people that are more comfortable at least with some women being home and at least in the circles i've travelled and in the church that i go to you know
well and i think a lot of companies are realizing this and offering more opportunities as far as like job sharing or you know even having a day care on site and that kind of stuff
and i think that's really important that that they do that
and they realize there's a need for that
and um i don't know
and it wasn't where i had to be there every day
but i mean we were going to the doctor once a week
so i don't know how you could have a full time job and ever have any vacation time to do anything besides go to the
um i think i'm concerned about the large number of children that each teacher is expected to to deal with in some quality way
and i taught for fourteen years before we moved to texas
and the the one thing i see is changing is i was held accountable so much
and instead of spending my time coming up with creative learning stations and things like that i was filling out all these forms for all the children everything had to be documented
and i had file cabinets that weren't filled with neat stuff for kids
well um i'm i have three years toward a teaching degree and am trying to get headed back
and and i'm just really in a dilemma if that's what you know
but i'm really having questions if if i can deal with that system and and have a good conscience about you know what i do
i don't think i don't think it's the teachers
i think it's the system but um
they're so worried about lawsuits and the scores the children get on tests now and teacher competency you know
and it's not like the teacher can just get in there and do her best
what child's going to say something some parent's going to overreact to that's that's true
well it's it's hard on the children too
i think you know because the um the teachers are overworked
and just like a mommy that's overworked you're not at your best you know um
and one is in seventh grade
um i'm home schooling my kindergartner this year
we um live in a district that has open classrooms
and i wasn't particularly comfortable with that for her
and i have one in ninth grade at clark
and one at hendrick this year
and he my nin- my uh sixth grader came from an open classroom at matthews
and the very first year i taught back in seventy-three we had open classroom
and it didn't work then and when we moved down here i was just appalled that they were still doing it here
well the explanation
they they seemed to admit that it wasn't working
but they didn't have the money to restructure
but looks to me that it wouldn't take really that much money to at least come up with i mean some kind of partitions you know
partitions or just to face the children different directions or to do something i know last year my son had to eat in the classroom because there was no cafeteria at his school so he spent all day in this one large open area
so i didn't really care for that
well we were from north um carolina
and of course north north carolina has a terrible reputation as far as education
i think they rank about forty-ninth but our children got a very good education there they were in the magnet school program
and a lot of their classes from the time they were about third grade they they changed classes several times during the day which has its pros and cons
but a lot of their classes there were only eight or ten children in their classes and it was wonderful so you know i'm coming to to plano thinking well gosh it's going to be really great
i i i don't understand how they get this this reputation unless it's just that they spend a lot of money
probably so on publicity and letting realtors know and key people how wonderful the schools are so
well my son is at clark this year too
so uh we're
i i i don't guess i've been in
and i ran over and picked up her report card
and she did very good
well that's good
so and she seems to be studying and has just about the right amount of home work i would expect for a freshman to have
but yet she has some every night
well eric seems to have quite a few nights where he doesn't have any
so that's interesting
but he his grades i haven't seen them yet
but supposedly they're good
well i did hear the end of the prompt this time
and it said that what what do we do we think that cri- certain crimes should fit certain punishments
and uh i was thinking about it after i got off the phone that that i really you know wish that there was some way to uh send a message to people you know about um child abuse and things like that uh-huh
too often i feel that people get off uh
i i agree with you although i will say
i'm not sure you know
i sometimes have a problem with some of the especially more famous people who all of a sudden are crawling out of the woodwork to say that whatever problems they have you know was was because they were abused a- abused as children
and the parents are saying hey wait a minute
we didn't do anything like that you know
and and and i guess before i'd like to see that severe of a punishment for it
i don't buy the routine oh they're just sick
or they were abused when they were little well you know forget that
well sometimes they even wonder when when uh criminals plead temporary insanity for for punish- for crimes that are so severe and then you know they get sent to a mental institution
and they play loony for a while
and then they're back out in public
well but i can't see that either
i don't feel that that should be any excuse at all or any deterrent ag- uh you know reason to not use capital punishment
oh i agree
i think uh
so my family may say that on occasion
you know uh i i don't think it's that hard to do you know to to convince somebody that uh gee you just had no control over what you were doing
well and too you know they can always be blaming the other person
well she looked like my mother who abused me when i was a child or something which i think is unfortunate for that person and yet shouldn't be an excuse
i guess you know a lot of
and i was just seeing in the newspaper or the grocery store that some miss america was abused by the man she loved
and i didn't couldn't realize if it was the husband or the father or what
but i thought uh you know if these things if children are being abused i i'm wondering how our school system is failing that they're not even seeing this you know
and that kind of that kind of worries me with my kids only being under two and not having you know to to deal with that yet
well you you're right uh
and yet i mean did you ever in your life when you were little know
never and i lived in california which i feel like california you know
i but i was from conservative wisconsin
and uh you know there was there was nothing on it
which makes me wonder you know if it's as uh prevalent as as some of them claim
it uh it it it's
and it all
unless they're caught in the act or the- the- the child is very badly you know beaten up it comes down to a one word against the other that type thing
now texas is capital punishment for
and now the- they added mass murder
i really would have no idea i um i don't don't really know
are those the only two things that we uh uh you know because i have a feeling it is
and i i think there ought to be more things added to it
i i think that's i you know uh
killing a child or kidnapping uh
and possibly not well
i guess kidnapping maybe if the person gets very badly hurt you know
or like when uh i've heard when i
well i like dining out
but um i'm a divorced woman
i have one child and you know when when we dine out we go to like medium priced restaurants
i don't i don't particularly
i think it's sort of a waste of money to go real to a real high priced restaurant
do you go like home cooking like black-eyed pea and that kind of thing or cafeteria
we go wh- more for the uh chinese and italian and stuff like that mexican stuff that i can't cook
uh we do too
um well i like chinese food
um there's a little place down on what is that coit road um chinese pavilion or something
and i like it
and um i do i do like chinese buffets
well we go we've gone to august moon
and we think that was real good but our favorite when you have a little more to spend is to go to taiwan or may dragon
and those are excellent
it's not the the rinky chinese decorations but it's a very elegant nice place to eat
we go very very often we go out for fajitas
and we go to on the border
and lots of places that have uh i think
and some of those and get fajitas
and he'll just eat chips until we've got three or four baskets coming back
and then uh last weekend we went out for italian also
and for some reason the cooler weather makes me tend to want to go eat lasagna and garlic bread
so we went to el sorrento
have you ever um tried pappasito's
this is that's real funny you said that because we were coming back sunday on central from church
and bob pointed to it
and he said i keep hearing good things about that place
oh it is delicious
so i guess we'll have to do it
you always stand in line when you go but it's worth the wait
that's what it that's what d magazine said that
but that's probably i mean that's a good that's a good sign
and have you ever tried um the macaroni grill up on
now my kids didn't like it because they just wanted to get plain old spaghetti
and most of those things were a little more northern italy
and they like just the traditional
tha- th- they're the spaghetti warehouse type
but my little girl likes uh spaghetti warehouse real well
um not really
that's a steak is something that i cook at home
you know tha- that you grill out and i really don't particularly um
well i'm i'm real curious to try this one that has such commercials the uh that del lincoln
and oh what is that guy's name
it's uh over there's one over there in addison
there's a there's a second one downtown
and they have these really corny radio commercials but the- but they're steak is supposed to be wonderful
so i ha- i had not tried that
and it seems like i've been
w- we found those one time
and then they discontinued
and then they uh closed up
so most of these places are pretty much just uh theme restaurants around here
i think that's what goes you know really goes right now in the in the dallas area
well that's exactly true
of course you know down next to downtown up around mckinney and everything you know there's just a there's a different class of restaurants up there that i can't even touch
you know it would probably take my whole paycheck just to go in and
and i haven't been
we've gotten so used to doing chicken and things at home that that's that's usually the way we'll go if we're not going lasagna
when when i go out it's it's normally to get um some specialty type of food besides you know because y- chicken and steaks and everything i grill at home
well i understand
and and really it's they're a lot better than what i get in the restaurant
and save you some money too
well now what is your what's your child's favorite place to eat
um favorite place
uh she has a lot
well mine enjoy that too
and they'll and then our favorite thing on fridays we generally order pizza in
so not pizza inn but pizza to our house
so we've done
well um is there anything else you'd like to discuss about it
i think we've i think it's come to an eye conclusion
so i'll talk with you later
but i don't have one at home
my actually my husband and i are taking a class at our local junior college called micro micro computers one o one
and we're just touching on data base spreadsheets and word processing and just kind of you know different kinds of
and we're just kind of touching on a basic computer
well that sounds interesting
i have a a p s one i b m type
uh and i use it all day at work
and i put all my personal stuff on it at work
so i really don't haven't had a need for one at home
but probably if i didn't have access to one all the time at work i'd want one at home
but i didn't
what is that tracing tracking the flights and things
this is this is my very first time
and it's time for you to wind up in the next thirty seconds or something like that
but i'm going to ignore that
so i'm just going to ignore it
that i have that too
but other times
w- where do you work
oh you do
oh well of course
that's why you
oh i see
well this is a pretty good deal
i i'm i work in the legal department
so i'm pretty busy
but i use my p c there mostly for creating legal documents
oh you do know lotus huh
oh that's great
and i know there's still a hundred things i don't know how to do on it
but uh you know you learn something every time you use it
on this this thing that i'm this survey or whatever you know this
or do i wait for people to call me
and eight hundred number
but you can only make one call a day
oh only one a day
so you cannot make a call now until tomorrow
oh i see
so then do you get the five bucks
or do i
oh we both do
well that's a
so you both do
well that's a pretty good deal
so why why are we doing this
actually i'm doing this for somebody else but you know for a friend of mine
it's a research type project on uh voice activated electronics you know
it's uh well they call it the speech lab that is setting this thing up
it's almost like that like a voice command computer type thing oh
well that's wonderful
now i don't know i don't know everything about it
but they uh try to get as many people as they possibly can to contribute to this
and that way they can check voice patterns
and get the computer where it recognizes voices
see that's why i it's interesting because you have i i'm going to say you have an accent
well i probably do because i've
and i and i think that i don't
i mean to you
well i've been b- i was born and raised in texas
so i probably do
and you're in what city
my sister one of my sisters lives in plano
and that's right outside of
well richardson's right between dallas and plano
and then i have a sister that lives in austin
well what are you doing way in washington
well we're actually all from nebraska
well that's interesting
and then my sister works at the air force base
so i imagine they use personal computers
uh i think they just send christmas letters on it
you know children's games
well what i believe is one of the major pro- uh things that is wrong with our public school system is that um we do not have enough discipline and the parents do not let the teachers discipline the children the way that they need to be disciplined right now
uh when i went to school i know i was scared to death about being disciplined
and the discipline that my daughter receives now in going to school is just totally different
you know you just you did not see i did not see anybody in my classrooms when i was going to school act up the way that kids do these days in the classroom
what uh grade is your daughter in
my my daughter's in the um fourth grade and um there's children in her classroom that just totally disrupt the classroom where the teacher cannot teach and when i went to school that just wasn't put up with
well they they just don't do that any more
but the school system's afraid of getting sued and um all sorts of lawsuits i'm sure because of things like that
and i also believe we don't even though i feel like i pay a good share towards the school system that the teachers are still underpaid
and we still don't have enough money towards put in toward public school
and um i think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more that maybe that could solve some of our problems
and you know we'll just have to wait and see whether that's approved or not
you know i don't know your feelings toward that
but um and what else um
i have heard stories uh from other parents that i know of their children are in high school that teachers are out there giving drugs and selling drugs
i've i've heard some horrible horrible stories about high high school teachers and you know to be be more careful of the teachers that we place in our school
um that's basically about all that i know that may be wrong with the school system
i think with what they have to work with i think they're doing a pretty good job
oh i do too
but then what do i know
so this is probably a real hard subject for you
well i guess um we can discontinue our call now
well it was good talking to you too
well what do you know about latin american policies
uh i just have a feeling that we've kind of talked out of both sides of mouths down there like we do in some other situations you know
we we don't know half the time we don't know who to support
are you uh relating this uh to the uh affair we've got going on in haiti right now
that and you know maybe it's maybe it's tough for a big powerful nation to deal with with uh countries like that that depend on us so much without you know just telling them running their country for them
that that's just it
but i mean uh uh you sure you still have to you know let them know how you feel
and uh like you said they're such small countries that we're bound to upset somebody
but we seem to be lacking the ability to take a stance
it worries me that uh the economy of so many countries in in south america and central america depend on something that damages people like the you know like cocaine from columbia
but but that is that's a tough deal
maybe i maybe it's you know i'm reflecting how i feel about it
but i have a feeling that we that we really don't understand basically the the the competing factions
and i mean they've been hammering for the last you know ten centuries
and it's still going on
and uh we we dabble in it just enough to make both sides angry at us some how
well um i was speaking with a a woman
from i believe she was from the honduras or guatemala or somewhere in there
she was from el salvador and uh she was from a relatively wealthy family
and when uh the contras came into power of course with
uh oh gosh darn what's his face
he's in in florida jail now
marcos uh no
he's marcos is philippines
um well i'm blank
well you know who i'm talking about
i i know it uh
anyway when he came into power he basically just took everybody's property you know just assigned it to himself
and uh so she's been a real strong supporter of the sandinistas and has been trying to back the u s government in that respect
and in that respect i have to agree that i think we're taking the right stance uh because they were a democracy turned uh yeah
and it seems like those countries are so easily susceptible to that kind of thing
it just you know unstable
well what do you think of uh this uh u s free trade agreement we're working on with mexico
well i think it's long overdue uh i just you know
there's so much difference in in the economies of the two countries i'm not you know i have a problem uh with whether it's going to work or not you know
there's uh it seems like there's
but it seems like there's a lack of honesty in in foreign policy a lot of the times
they're i know they're trying they're really trying the mexican government is trying
and a lot of the larger mexican businesses are trying to
the big problem with the united states is we have our basic nine to five schedule you know
and we don't have the siesta
and there's the cultural differences is what's is what's kind of it's what's really hurting uh the mexican people because they've had their way of life
and we've had our way of life
i think their their version of the good old boy network going that
uh you know has a lot
well let me just start by asking what you think of this middle east affair we've got going on
i uh i think that uh for once we should we shouldn't even be at at these mid east talks because with the exception of our hostages we really don't have too much of a uh real in- we shouldn't have too much of a real interest in deciding who's land it is
just let these people fight it out you know we've got so many domestic problems
and and what does it cost these people over there you know
oh so how about the soviet union
um i'm glad to see that
but i again i don't want to see us pour a whole lot of economic aid into the soviet union without a uh well uh a whole lot under any circumstances because i i don't know
i'm i'm a believer in the old adage that if somebody earns something it's worth more to them than if you give it to them
and so i'm i'm not much in favor of it
but i'm glad to see us advising them that doesn't seem to cost a whole lot of money
but i'm ready to have a president elected that at least has some sort of a domestic agenda
even if it doesn't work at least he is somebody who who is working on that problem
and i i haven't seen that in the last eleven years
well all i've seen
so they don't seem to have a clue
i i think bush's kind of followed suit
um international is important
but uh we've got a budget deficit that just won't go away unless it gets seriously addressed
uh you know and then there's the homeless issue
and there really is a lot we could be doing stateside without uh hurting our international aspects or straining any international relations i think
and we wouldn't have to spend the billions and billions of dollars each year that we're spending
oh i agree
i just i think we got once we started economic aid overseas we have really set ourselves up to be sort of the the world bank and
and i think there's a limit
and we passed it a long time ago
we've been writing off way too many bad debts uh country bad debts
that's another thing i don't understand is is is things like selling technology and uh even military hardware to foreign governments and then forgiving their debt
as as much in debt as we are i just i don't know
but i don't see anybody
and it's either one way or the other
this it s- seems to be we're turning into a black and white society
or you do it that way
and there's no in between and that uh it obviously isn't working
well i think uh it wouldn't hurt
and i know the independent party's been trying for years to get a a a real force in in the uh in congress
but uh you're right
there's just too many issues that come up that uh our senators and our congressmen vote on simply because it's a democratic issue or it's a republican issue and if they would vote with their conscience and with what their constituents feel i think uh we might have a a lot better a lot more efficient running government and a lot better laws passed
oh i agree with you
well of course you know we have the national embarrassment in our state jessie helms
and uh as soon as as we can get
of course it seems to me that every time he opens his mouth he he just lines up people against him
it's not too it's not too often that you see him swaying too many opinions
he's uh usually on the ninety-eight to two side
he's one of the two huh
well let's see
senators are in for six years right and uh when did you guys vote him into office
oh unfortunately nineteen ninety
oh you're stuck
but uh unfortunately for him but maybe fortunately for us his health is not great
so i hate
well what do you do on your yard
well uh typical lawn stuff
saint augustine uh with a little bermuda mixed in in some of the sunny areas uh and really all i do to it is
uh in fact i didn't even fertilize it this year
and i i mow it uh you know with a mulch mower so the the particles fall down yeah
comes back in the yard so you don't have any one do your yard
so what the heck
well we um we my husband does the same thing
and he wants me to learn how to work the lawn mower
but i keep putting off learning
but i had recently gone out and planted mums
and so while my husband was painting i went out and bought about fifty dollars worth of mums over at calloway's and put out yellow and bronze
and they're just gorgeous and so then last week my mom comes in town
and she says well those are going to die just the first frost
and i went well now you tell me
so the first night that around halloween
and we went out and covered them with a sheet
and they did okay that first night
but the second night we were at the movies and didn't do it
so i guess i've lost them
but um the worst problem we've had here with this grass was about the third year we were here
and we did not know in august to put down the uh whatever it is for grub worms
and the next spring i guess in that march every time we would go out and just try to walk on the grass or reach down to pull a weed we'd have big whole patches come up
and we pulled up almost half of our yard just by raking it
so we had to go out and resod the whole thing with squares and wet it and put it down and rope it off and everything
so the most careful thing we do on our yard every august is put down that diazinon
you you think that's what it was huh
and you could see them
and they said they turn into black bugs in the spring yeah
but in but in the
those kind of brown uh ju- what we call june bugs and some people call them may beetles
so any how occasionally i find them in the flower beds
they said that every yard has some but it was a preponderance of them that caused our problem
so that's the number one thing we do whether we fertilize or anything else just because we got burned so badly before
well i had some of that problem
but mine was freeze
i'm still i'm still replacing that in the back especially under the trees uh you know kind of slow and as you say very expensive
i caught wolfe with uh uh one uh one of the sales where they have those big blocks for fifty cents
and uh i bought about
uh well i put you know that was late
because i started to say you can there's different times they say it's okay to do it
and i had to water it you know gosh
out here you know we don't have as many trees in plano
and but a lot of the shrubbery that we have in the front like the pittosporum all died
and all those variegated uh things died
so we pretty much go with that dwarf yaupon and that yaupon holly
and they just live
they're pretty tough uh
you can you can stand those
pittosporum is kind of borderline here and usually it'll do pretty well
but uh you know every once in a while we get one of these really cold deals and it zaps it
well it's kind of like one of these
oh wax leaf wax leaf ligustrum is the same way
that they they warned me of that one finally
and i said you know you need to either read neal sperry's book before you shop or get a reputable nursery because lot of places that would are just trying to sell whatever was pretty out there
and we didn't know the difference
and every year we learn one more thing that we didn't know before like about these
and my backyard we had it really nice
and then my husband wanted a labrador puppy
and so it was about
so the first summer he was here he dug up all of my bushes and plants and brought them to the front door and the back door
so it's like our backyard is just kind of like
and if he'll if there's anything he'll hurt we just don't put it out there any more
i had a had a small vegetable garden that uh
it's it's like on the side the apron of the of the parkway out behind the garage and uh our our garages come in from the back you know from the alley and uh it's it's a little piece of land over there
well i had uh tomatoes and and uh uh peppers
and i had i had okra
and by the fence i had cucumbers which which didn't do real well uh they kind of came out looking like gourds
and you say well i made it though at least it's mine
but i had squash
i had zucchini and and yellow crook neck squash
um i guess my initial view is our tax burden hasn't gone down in recent years despite our total tax burden despite tax cuts but among industrialized nations we have one of the lowest in in the world
uh i suspect i take the view that cutting income tax rates has been good for the the economy that most other countries have a higher share of the tax burden in various kinds of sales taxes uh energy taxes particularly and that to the extent we need to raise more taxes that's the direction we should look
well i guess i kind of have mixed feelings
um you know you always sit there
and out of each pay check so much comes out of it
and you wonder you know where's it all going and we have such a huge uh national deficit
and and i guess a lot of times there's questions wondering well if it's doing a whole lot of good
but you kind of always wonder well where's where's the money going
well one one one of the big tax that has gone up a lot in this year is the social security tax which in principle is going into into a big trust fund
but that is a particularly regressive tax uh
and senator moynihan's uh proposal to to to cut there i think wou- makes a lot of sense
i think senator moynihan's proposal to to cut the social security tax which isn't really going to going to beef up up up the social security program could make a lot of sense
as far as other countries i'm not um i don't keep up on it too much as to far
we were in ireland last year and i know that the tax there is extremely high much higher than we pay here
but but as far as other countries i'm not uh up to par on
i think japan i think japan is probably about equal to ours and other major countries are higher
our friends were amazed that the sales taxes the cost of things when they went to canada not so long ago
and as a whole most other countries have a higher level of cradle to grave government services
and it's a real real
they're they're real trade-offs there
but and and you sit there and wonder um
i guess this doesn't really have to do with taxes but just money in general and and um wondering if you're going to have enough when you retire
that's that's a scary thing that there's no no real knowing about
uh the the there's a lot of inflation risk that isn't taken care of in most private pension plans
but um are you involved with the legislature up there
uh part of the commerce department
and you and you picked this topic
oh you didn't
well well i i i didn't pick it uh i mean um i like i don't really recall
i may have filled out on the on the form
but i i certainly certainly have the feeling i've been given topics different from the ones that i mentioned before
oh did you
see i haven't placed any calls
oh i didn't know that
because i haven't made any calls yet
oh you should try it
oh i didn't realize that
because it's kind of a it can be a rather controversial subject depend on who you're talking to
uh many of the subjects are uh taxes taxes especially
um one thing that has kept our tax burden high and this will change somewhat in the next few years is the is the level of def- of the defense budget and that's that same subject
and i'm calling from plano texas
and i'm in garland
um would you like me to go first
i have three children um two two who are in regular school uh eleven year old an eight year old
and then my little one three year old is in um a university of gymnastics
it's a a preschool and um i think it was really hard to um to pick the right uh day care or preschool or mother's day out
um some of the qualifications that i look for was that uh you know the cost and um exactly what they did if it was structured or nonstructured if they had a little academic um uh in there and um you know um you know what the qualifications of the teachers' were and if the place was clean and um the hours
and um just just kind of going by word of mouth and finding out if anybody else has been pleased with their program that kind of stuff
well we don't have any children
but we're going to have one next year
so um that's something that i'm probably going to be looking at maybe in the future
and i don't know if i'll be doing that or what we're going to do
but if we do then i'm going to need to find somebody
and our church has a mother's day out program which they started last year
and we know a lot of people at the church
so i would feel very confident with leaving my child there
and that's where shannon had started in a mother's day out program and uh the churches always have i think a a pretty good program
and you have to make sure that you um that you apply pretty early because they do have a lot of places have very long waiting lists
and um and another question to ask is if they're um state certified um you know if the teachers have um their master's degree in in child education and um child development
um you know what what kind of a structure is it going to be
um when your child's a little bit older like a three year old you'd be more concerned with if there's a type of care that it's torture for them to lay down and take a nap
is there like a mandatory nap time
and if and they lay on these little mats
and if they fall asleep they kind of let them sleep
and the teacher stays with the sleeping ones
and the other ones get up and go do something else
so she doesn't have to necessary take a nap there you know which is which is nice um
um you know it's kind of scary i guess because you hear so many bad things about day cares lately
and so it's i guess it's such a growing concern
but then there's a lot of good things you don't hear
and sometimes when the child's a lot younger before they're really um before three years old you know like the church is a good program
and sometimes you even consider um you know having a private person come to your own home when they're real little or or something like that
and another consideration is how many infants or children are they what's the ratio of of teachers to to children because that makes a a a difference
and if your child would be maybe sleeping in that crib all day
just your child and or do they just put any child in any crib you know
you would want maybe your child to have their own sheets all the time and not have another child use that bed you know
i'm sure that um whatever you decide you'll be happy with
and it's exciting time to have a new one
that's that's wonderful
but that you know we have been thinking about that
but it's a little ways off in the future but um i figure you know i'd probably start asking around at church because i know they have a limit as to how old they can be before they you know before you can bring them in
some some places um start them as early as i think well some some places take them as infants i guess you know like eight weeks even
um there's a place to look into um um
a friend of mine who's a nurse is was telling about a wonderful new place that opened some place in on fifteenth street
it's in plano somewhere where um
nurses that used to work in the hospital take care of infants infants and then only up to like two years old and it's it's supposed to be really a a
you know some places just specialize in just real little ones and then other ones uh are the older children
but it is a difficult situation i think
when they're when they're little it's almost easier to leave them because when they're three and they're cry
and i'm calling calling from plano texas
oh okay um
i um find exercise kind of a task i guess i'd say
but i also have
so they keep me pretty busy
but i enjoy um
well i uh i have
i walked and run ev- um almost every morning
but uh it's about a thirty minute exercise every morning
oh that would
well my husband swims every day at lunch which he loves doing yeah
once in a while or if he has a business meeting or if he um someone invites him to lunch he'll he'll not go
but he goes um every every day
and then he ru- he's a runner too
he gets up about five and and does his his deal
and some days he doesn't
but then maybe he'll catch up on the weekend and go for a run
and um we
but i have an ex- i had an exercise bike in the house but didn't seem to use it enough
so somebody sold it in a garage sale
and so uh but i'd like to get a bike and just do uh do biking outside
the the the bicycling is nice especially with the weather around here
and i know um uh we we both of my husband and i both do it to just
so we need to keep exercising just to be able to uh
because i'm fifty-five
and it uh it just gets worse
oh i know
and uh but you just
and i take my three year old with me
and it's kind of another day out for her to um have little friends
and um i i enjoy the socialization of it you know
but um there are some parts during that exercise that i think i cannot do
i know it it it some of it is so tough and uh especially when somebody's uh planning lunch for you and they know what what's good for you
so anyway thank you for calling
well uh guess it's logical to ask do you exercise any
well unfortunately very little
uh much less than what i need to
i i do a little bit
and i don't really get out a lot to because my job to to exercise
well i uh am an assistant teacher and uh in business technology
and i've i think the most exercise i've gotten in the last three to four month is jumping up and down to go answer the kids' questions
but it's not really the kind of exercise that gets your heart rate going
and uh you know it really
and i realize that
that's that's the way i feel
but i've got
and i go to school during the day and work at night
when you uh exercise what do you do
well uh i usually i usually play at home
so me and my brother play basketball and have a bunch of guys come over and play
or a lot of times we're we're up at the church
i got a hold of uh richard simmons' tape uh what is it uh
oh the sweating to the oldies
sweating with the to the oldies
and that's not bad
so you know i every once in a while i'll put the cassette in and go with it
but uh i don't know
and my fingers exercise more than anything now
uh do you ever ride a bike or anything like that
and i'd ride about two or three miles a day
but but it would last about a couple of weeks
and it got real cold for a little while
so i gave it up
here about the the most common exercise for people is to go to the malls and walk uh
and no matter what the weather is they can walk at a pretty good clip and and not have to worry about the weather summer or winter
and people will walk around the mall
and it's safe
it it is fairly safe
that's uh you know inside the mall
i know a doctor once told me it it
a friend of mine uh suggested swimming as being the best exercise there is
we have we have a swimming pool
but it's an old concrete pool
so we haven't got to use it much
but i love to swim and water ski and stuff like that
the uh swimming they say uses more muscles than any other exercise with
and the water takes the resistance
and you don't get the soreness
i've i've done some water exercises
but our pool is not is not heated
hot tubs are not uh not too bad
so what part of mississippi are you from
but we're about two hours from the coast
and you do have cold weather down there
it it started about yesterday i believe
and uh from there just well
but uh oh sunday the snow and ice came in
and uh there was no exercise
i think i think i played better golf when i was fifteen john than i play right now
i know i oh i know i did
course i know i watch my thirteen year old play now you know
and it's like they don't have a muscle in their body
oh i know
i you know i'm a guy that plays
i mean i was raised by a man my stepfather who with a two handicap i mean he he he he could get down on his knees and hit the ball i mean further than most people could hit it
and my mother who is now he's my stepfather is dead but my mother who is now seventy-one
but but uh all they did every day in their life was to play golf every
they'd leave work and go to a golf course or a little country club they belonged to back in richmond virginia and just uh play nine holes of golf
you you need to play that often to get a really good handicap
but uh i just i just never could do it
i have a brother-in-law who is uh an ex-college coach and like a pro
and he has a very good handicap and plays good golf
well i went to
and i i went after it
and did and i really didn't find much improvement
go go back up
i i think i need to uh
i probably need to take some some more lessons uh more current and uh and practice more often
it's a hunter's type affair and i buy in in austin texas
i live in the dallas area but i go down to austin and go with my good customer and friend of mine and we always buy this weekend at a at a country club in the hill country
you know at uh horseshoe bay
and we just have a ball
and we play three days in a row three different courses
and course believe it or not by the end of the third day and the end of the uh third course my score has gone from you know a hundred and twenty down to about a hundred and five
so it that makes a lot of difference to me
i well i've also found too i i try to work out regularly
and when i am doing that uh and feeling loose and that i swing better
i i i get through the ball better
uh and i also if i
and i just sort of
and that's something my stepfather never could teach me you know just to relax and hit the ball
and you know so subsequently when i do tire out from playing like twelve fourteen holes my you know a lot of my energy's gone
when i do swing it's an easier swing and i do actually hit the ball better
have you ever have you ever tried a one iron
off now off the tee
that that's why i need my driving lessons
well you know i put mine back in my bag this year too
and i i used a three wood rather than a driver
uh i had a lot more control on it uh
but i wasn't in trouble every time i got down the fairway
well that's that's a good idea
i think this next year i'm going to i'm going to attempt to play more
and i'm going to do the same thing
i i laid off my woods about three years ago
and i just use a two wood off the fairway
and i'm a fairly strong person
so i get a pretty good little drive and i and i guess control my irons better you know
and uh i still remember that watching myself and my son
so but i think the key is you just need to you need to play more often than i play
well i i read recently here they say if you're playing if you're scoring well you should play more
if you're scoring poorly you should spend more time on the practice g- uh range
uh i think there is less flus- frustration factor there too uh
makes good makes good sense
so but i i
the one iron is something i've been thinking because my driver's gone so badly lately that i i should pick one up and try to start
but with practice i would imagine you could groove that swing too
and i play with a fellow that can knock a one iron
and but and his accuracy is what's so startling with it
and it but it's an iron that he's really practiced with
and uh it would be fun to get that good at a with an iron uh distance iron
my cha- my challenge of the game is just if i can get off the first tee when everyone's standing around watching you i'd be
if i get off the tee box and i and i've you know you know anything from a hundred fifty to two hundred yard drive through a straight i just want to get down and kiss the ground you know
and get away without embarrassing yourself
well do you exercise regularly
well i am a school teacher
there is uh uh girl that went through our school district i teach in highland park who uh does aerobics at the y c a and i say y the y w c a
any way uh she comes to the school
and there are a group of teachers
and we exercise regularly and uh for an hour
and we do it twice a week
oh that is good
and uh we do uh aerobics for our cardiovascular fitness for thirty minutes
and then we do stretching and toning and cool down for another thirty minutes
so it is an hour
and then my husband and i take uh ten mile walks uh as often as possible
and uh not on the nights that i do aerobics
but if if he wants to he jogs
but i uh i we take the fast walks
and we walk a couple of miles and then come back to the house
and so we we take it seriously
uh well i use to exercise regularly
and i haven't lately
uh i use to also take an aerobics class about three days a week before work
but uh i guess my job change my husband's job change and it is just not easy to get up early in the morning any more
oh i understand that
well i and too i just make myself
and i am at school at seven thirty
school is not over until uh four and our class
but it is in the building that is the big difference
because there are other people around that uh
you know there is motivation around there
and then uh we we can change right there in the building
and i just go
and we uh exercise
and until then you know i have belonged to exercise clubs
and oh i have gone to uh oh like uh oh these gyms you know that the like in plano and richardson and uh where they offer the uh rec centers really where they offer aerobics
and i have done that before but it has always had to be late at night after i have got home and after dinner
and you are just kind of going ugh
and i have tried it immediately after school
like try to get some place and exercise from five to six
but then by the time you get home and you get dinner you are eating so late
well i know some people go during lunch
but you know by the time i get over the gym and and go for my class and shower and get back to work it is probably two hours or more and that is just too long
but uh and they are nice because if we are running late it usually uh
you know cause they know we are in the building and coming
where as at uh another place you are paying a lot more money
and uh it does going to start whether you are there or not
so this has worked out real nicely
well that is not much
so it's it's
we like pay her for six weeks at a time cause that is like a unit in uh uh school uh report card period
and so it is like twenty-four dollars every six weeks
we belonged uh for a period of time to the signature club for about a year
i mean we were paying a hundred dollars plus month for our family membership and at first we used it
and then it got where we weren't beginning to get out money's worth
and they offered lots of things
but we weren't taking advantage of them because we didn't have the time to
so we decided to forget that
well we have one through work
and its its probably about a hundred and fifty dollars a year which is bad
but i uh i don't know
i still just don't don't end up going cause it isn't at a convenient time or i don't know something
but i need to do something
if if its only walk the dog or something
and if you have somebody who will do it with you
like for a long time my husband didn't want to walk cause he wants to uh jog but he decided that uh maybe uh you know
well i'm not planning the menu
oh you're not
we usually go out to ei- either one of our folks
they both live close to but um i don't know
it seems like a a big thing for christmas is usually ham
well funny you should mention that
oh you are huh
well now it's kind of a hobby more than anything else
but we're going to have uh wild boar we uh we killed a boar the other day
it was you know mating with the sows
and you can't use the piglets you know
so we uh we shot him and cleaned him out and had him you know processed into ham
and uh we're also going to have a little roast suckling pig because i i've got one that's got a a hernia and rather than you know pay the vet four hundred dollars for surgery we'll just cook him and eat him
is that is that hard
hey i tell you what preparing a little pig is is a snap
you just uh
you kill him you know
they go you know
in a second they're gone and then you just dip the carcass in uh boiling water pull it out and there's a we use a little raspy brush pulls the hair off and uh gut it and uh just stick it down in a pit with some cloves and uh some pineapple about three pineapples you know sliced them up and uh cover him up with uh wet uh sacks feed sacks is what i usually use
oh my goodness
and after about six hours you put the fire out and dig that baby out of there
and it's the best eating you ever had
oh well does a boar taste just like regular ham
just like a pig i mean you know uh it has a lot less fat
this wild boar weighed probably about three hundred and thirty pounds and he dressed out to almost two hundred and ten pounds
oh my goodness
well you know we took the skin and the head and the le- and the feet off
and that was about you know a hundred hundred pounds of just ham
oh well how many people are you planning on serving at christmas
oh well we're you know we're not going to eat the whole thing
but uh you know we're going to drive up to kansas city see my wife's folks
and uh she she
what's what's what's your mother cooking for christmas
well her mom's doing brisket
it's just tough as a boot and uh you know they used to use it for leather i think
oh my goodness
i mean no
but uh it's it's a part of the loin you know the rib cage
and it has a lot of muscle in it and a lot of
oh my goodness
so it's really really a tough piece of meat but it's so tasty you can't stand it
so you just take it
and that softens it up huh
and you marinate it for a couple of days
and then uh you just put it in the oven
and uh we're going to have that
oh well we'll have cranberries and hominy
and uh we we are we're big on olives and cucumbers and stuff up here
we have oliv- olives black olives and cucumbers and uh tomatoes
oh do you
oh we we just got lots of snow
i mean it's thirty degrees this morning
but uh it'll go up to fifty or sixty almost
oh my goodness
well it's desert you know
where where we are it's it's it's uh the edge of the desert
i mean it's part of the great plains
so in the day time in the summer it goes up to a hundred hundred and ten and at night it goes down to about sixty
we get a fifty de- degree temperature swing in about four hours
so everything that lives around here is real tough
that's trees you know
we got hundred year old trees that are you know twenty feet tall
they you know they're just hard as a rock
well uh until recently i was taking the wall street journal
and i thought that was a good way
but i have about five different magazines that i get that keeps me up on things
you know it's a week or two late
but uh that's how i'm staying up
or or occasionally i'll read the paper
uh do you like how it's presented on the news
they allow you uh
they they try to lead you too much i believe
and sometimes they're not very open
i i don't know
like for example the kennedy the kennedy rape case
the coverage on that was you know
you know they try to have you form opinions or whatever
and then i i didn't like the thi- the things that were going on when we had desert storm and stuff like that
you know basically i i i think they don't present the the whole sides of of everything
so it it makes you feel like they're uh wanting you to take their opinion
it's it's it's instead of reporting the news it's more like an editorial i believe on a lot of issues
and it's kind of distressing isn't it
and they just i've noticed that they do it just with subtle little words uh usually uh just that sway the whole uh report that you know by just a couple of words
well when when i was in school i um i was a communications major
so i i i'm well aware of the little subtle words and persuasive speaking and and so forth
so communications huh
and um i we- i ventured off in a whole entire different field field
and uh i um went with the department of state treasurer in retirement disability
so and you know working you know working for state government you hear all about current events about things going on within the state itself
so that that's another source that i i where i keep up with current events
it says a t and t to account for the the benefits that the a i c p a now says you have to show as a liability
and it'll drop their earnings by a hundred million a year forever more
and yeah you have to stay up on stuff
and i bet in your your job that you have to
i i i primarily deal with the state employees
but i i find interesting tidbits in what the news reports as far as the like the state of north carolina's budget and stuff like that
and i really know what the budget is
and and uh uh when they were saying we were so poor and they couldn't pay taxes and pay people their income tax refunds and things like that
and you know i'm well aware of the billions of assets that the state has
and it it's just funny
you know so that's that's that's
so i don't have a whole lot of faith in in you know the news
they they get what they hear from
but you know it's not always i i think one hundred percent reliable
i think they need to do a little bit go into a little bit more depth uh before they would just report like somebody wants to make a statement or something like that
because i mean another example is the uh aids issue or whatever
you know someone said oh i found a cure
and then two months later it's discovered it's not you know
before they before they come out with something like that they need to to research the matter i believe a little bit more
i guess they do that so they don't get scooped you know
so they have the big story
my husband does the majority of the um the uh gardening uh taking care of the lawn and fertilizing
but i um tend to all the planting the annuals and and the spraying and um taking care of them and maybe putting flowers in you know throughout that season and later on maybe planting some mums and that kind of stuff and um any kind of decorating for the holidays you know
but basically he does all the heavy stuff
and i do all the fun stuff
my wife works in you know at at at the t i
and she's uh sedentary all day long so when she gets home she likes to mow
and we have about ten acres
and she tries to mow about half of it
wow that's a a big job
it keeps uh well
because when we got this place the the dirt was just overgrazed i mean you know it was bare dirt in a lot of places and now you know since we've been mowing it
and you know of course we water a little bit
but but just by keeping it mowed and getting it mulched in we've reclaimed a lot of it
oh i bet it's beautiful
but we don't do much in the way of uh flowers
we have one little flower garden that we that we work with
the rest of it is just like wild flowers and in the summertime we get the prettiest yellow flowers
oh that sounds lovely
they're about oh i guess a third the size of your palm of your hand and course in the spring we get the bluebonnets and indian paintbrush
oh the wild flowers are beautiful
i think um i was thinking about throwing some for in the back just where the kids um just way in the back behind the swing sets
or just have some wild flowers growing back there would be real pretty
well my wife and i really enjoy that sort of thing
uh she enjoys mowing
i mean i hate it
a lot of women do um
i've just never really you know
but um my husband takes it on
and i'll help rake up the grass
and um sometimes i'll help him edge um
because we don't have that much property
but we're on a corner lot
so there's a lot of edging to do and um uh that's what's nice about living more in the country
oh that's nice
and um it's been a little more country with the trees
and we do miss that
um if we had a chance to move i think we'd move back to somewhere that was a little more countrified and a little less maintenance required as as far as that goes
yeah but you know we do everything together
this this spring we got a thousand pine trees from the
two weeks ago we got a thousand pine trees from the you know soil and conservation people and uh we're in the process of of planting and we're building a stand uh just to the north of our house and along the east uh property line and i uh i think what we're what we're trying to do is create sort of a wind break because i tell you in the winter time when that when that wind comes out of the north it just cuts right through you like you're not even there
well i put
on the other side of the house though that's where we have all the the delicate flowers and the mums
and we have morning glory and we have trumpet vine and moon flowers
and we planted those out by the septic so that uh they get plenty of water and we get hummingbirds come in the spring you know all summer long
oh that sounds so pretty
and well when we leave the doors open they fly in the house
do they don't do any damage though
they don't like it in here because there's nothing to eat and when you're as busy as one of those babies you've got to eat most of the time
and we got a few you know
but you know for the most part gardening for us is
well we got asparagus
and uh we've got some plum trees and some apple trees and some tomato and some blackberries and strawberries
oh oh that sounds wonderful
oh i love home gro- grown tomatos
well these are accidental tomatos
well last year the birds came and ate a few of the tomatoes
of course you're going to lose some that way and the seeds go right through them
and wherever they pooped
but the ones that are out now
i i've watched that sisters a couple of times
oh i like that one
and um i'm trying to think
i i don't even know if i have any other real regular ones that i watch
um i like l a law not because it's realistic but
actually when there isn't a good movie on too
i just like to have the t v on if you know if i'm home alone or something have
uh oh i do
i've well i've been home with a um
and and so i've haven't seemed to have gotten out as much
and so i'll i'll watch a soap occasionally
i well i don't because i work all day
but um i pro-
i usually do if i'm home for a couple of days like you know around christmas or whatever
after a while i'll start watching it and then on
for a while i'll ask people if they know what happened and then i'll just forget it
oh what what ones do you get into
uh i don't even remember
it was like general hospital or something and i maybe watched it for a week but um i know that people used to arrange their whole schedules around the you know
oh i don't get into them that much
when i'm home sometimes in the day i'll i'll watch them but yeah oh i was really trying to think
well you said you have kids
oh i have a six year old
and i have a um
so you're you aren't a sesame street fan
they do they watch it
but but i've started to turn it on a little bit for the baby
and he's kind of he's entertained by it
i i do watch that one
well they're not entertained for too long with it
he's he's still too little
and i i do like um donahue
um that's on at let's see it's on at four
so other than that i don't know
well i guess it wasn't a real good topic for us
it snowed a little bit um probably about four days ago and they said we weren't going to get any more for christmas
wow but do you have snow on the ground now
well that's nice
i i wish it would snow a little bit more
i mean we still have some highways closed
and it stopped raining almost twenty-four hours ago
oh my goodness
but um oh just phenomenal
i mean i you know
but until you've really seen it it does- it doesn't really hit you
but i was driving home from work friday
and i saw there were some stop signs i mean submerged up to the writing on the stop sign
and that was just it was amazing to me
so there has been some flooding
oh there's been a lot
it's it's too bad
but you know the thing is that this happens
so i don't know
i mean you got to wonder how long they're going to keep doing that for
because they just finished cleaning up from the last flood
oh what a mess
well now do you work for t i
huh well this has been an interesting thing to do
um i've i've probably talked maybe to five people
and he's talked to a few more than me
and but it's been real interesting and kind of fun
um five dollars
uh don't you have to do it as part of its
um well i really enjoyed um
and so that was nice
i like um driving to different cities because of the scenery
so that was nice
we've i've been all over the states except for pretty much east
um it's very pretty driving like um up north in wisconsin too
um how how far do you usually end end up driving just
um the furthest i drove was probably texas
and then i've taken a train before to california
now where you're from where
we went to california this last year and uh liked it
but it was too crowded walt disney world and other places it's just the wrong time of the year to go
and uh course uh you get in any of those tourist traps and everything's uh outrageously priced
and uh kind of
you wonder if they're it's really worth it to pay uh thirty-five dollars or forty dollars just to get in
there's lots of fun places to see um
that's something do to you like to get up in mountains
um i think uh the biggest limitation is a lot just time and money isn't it
uh um probably uh when we go to wisconsin
um it's pretty fun
you have to like crowds you know
um oh it's a like a huge amusement park um they have water slides and it's just a big big tourist attraction
the downtown is all like little shops and candy shops
and it's it's really neat
i don't think uh hardly anybody lives there
because it's just kind of like you know tourists
it's mostly a a summer summer place
um from kenosha it's about three hours
so that's nice
it's it's a pretty ride up there too
oh i like all the nature things there are to look at you know
well and you can probably
so you have probably a lot of green and lot of real pretty things
our our climate's real dry and you have to kind of get up into the mountains to get much of the greenery
most of most most of the land's pretty brown
uh idaho is where i live
it's by uh
it's uh lot different kind of
and it's a real different uh land and scenery than there
i think uh there's a lot of places uh oh down even in southern utah the canyons canyon lands
and oh boy they're gorgeous
and that's real pretty over there too
but i think i'm kind of a summer vacationer
me too uh
uh are you presently looking uh for a used car
well as a matter of fact i just bought one
just just within the last three weeks
because they're talking like it was an american built car
it it sounds like it but it really isn't
it's uh marketed of course it its own dealerships
usually or somebody that's maybe got a cadillac or lincoln and lexus dealership uh sometimes they do that
but it's uh a brand car
but i've really liked it
it it drives just wonderfully
and there is
that's their big selling point uh other than general luxury
and but the particular seems to be the uh
so i can i can play those
that wasn't a standard p- feature was it
but there is not very many options on that car
uh some of the tracking control things and skidding control things for up north
it's it's not just antilock brake
this is a uh
but there is a further traction control uh
uh probably suspension tied into the brakes
and and also the suspension can be raised for driving like in the ice and snow
uh shoot some of these muddy driveways could use it around here
mississippi probably doesn't mississippi probably doesn't have to worry too much
uh originally i'm from west virginia
well you had some there
but uh i got down here in june of eighty-four
and the first winter down here was probably the worst winter they'd seen in twenty years
and it was amazing how a few inches of snow would turn normally sane manly adult men into playful little children
oh i know
we had this group of uh surveyors come into uh a shop i was working in uh four or five of them these big old flame worn suburbans and the snow all over the place
but while they were there they set back
well the uh the lexus uh really
and the moon roof i think is also an option
but there really is only about a half a dozen uh things
and everything else is pretty standard
i did not get the traction control which also when you take the c- traction control and the
so that's kind of
you go out and get in that real cold car and you turn that on
and it yeah and it kind of uh
but that's only available if with the traction control and the other option
and those two are sold together
so you have to take a two thousand dollar option there to to uh do it
so i i opted not for that
but and uh the dealership i dealt with they order them all with the uh moon roof and uh you know nice floor mats and everything in there
so the only thing i had to decide on was whether i wanted a c d or not in the stereo system
and that was pretty much it
and they had like three or four basic packages that they they offer
little mercury tracer imagine or not they make a they make a luxury mercury tracer
and uh i'm leasing the lexus
but but it
the lincoln ride is certainly good too but the this lexus is nothing like i have ever been in before
and it's got a lumbar support in the seats
adjustable uh power
and just kind of brings that support up in the sma-
well i'm a vietnam era veteran
and uh i was uh fortunate not to have to serve in the theater
however my support roll in the service was to support those in the theater of operation uh
i'm of the old school that believes that uh the uh uh contracts that we made back years ago needed to be honored
however uh i think we could have executed the war and gotten it over a whole lot quicker uh
but those are my personal thoughts
and i think that if we'd let the generals run the war like we let the generals run world war two we'd had got it over a whole lot quicker and lost a lot fewer people
but as it was the politicians ran the the korean conflict and ultimately the vietnam thing
and we managed to come out uh losers all the way around
and so this is what trigger- ultimately triggered us uh united states uh per se being uh deciding to get out of the role of world policeman
uh as i understand it and i uh
and as it turned out they were in a civil war one with another
and really we
i i question us you know now
uh so we're we we have to have to deal with with the uh situation as as we played it
jerry what did you think of people like uh jane fonda another war an- anti-war activist
you know before she before jane fonda did did what she did i thought she was a wonderful person
but after uh uh well
i i just don't have anything want anything to do with her any more
because you support uh you support your government
i don't think is is we can determine whether we were right or wrong
because you're you're having to deal with again uh
i think we could have made a different agreement back in for- the for- the late forties era that would have kept of there
uh you know i i didn't realize that we'd signed some type of deal like that
the uh the the uh mutual defense thing was uh
and i don't think everybody knows the whole situation
but from what i can gather is we went and said yeah we will help the south vietnamese uh should they ask
well the french went in and tried their old style warfare and uh got soundly thrashed
and we didn't do a whole lot better
i had thought that they had uh colonies there or something
that was the old french colony but see the french the french were our uh allies in nato and they're also our allies in seato which was the southeast asia treaty organization which has since been uh disbanded as far as i know
you know nato is is on the way of being disbanded uh
but uh the you know the french yeah
we go in as an ally to the french and says yeah we'll we'll help you out if you get in a bind
well they got in a bind and says we don't want to you know play any more so uh we we kind of we kind of got got the ball rolling ourselves versus a bunch of top secret silly organi- uh um oh operations and then the full scale you know full scale troops et cetera et cetera et cetera
so uh i bar-
well i missed it
uh i guess i uh i like to play golf
and uh i also like to plant flowers and do do some gardening and do arts and crafts
so we will play either out there or at firewheel
but i have played you know different courses in in the dallas area
do you uh do you ride or do you pull a cart when you play golf
and sometimes uh we pull
we like to to uh a lot of the times just walk uh for the exercise
but i find that when i ride in a cart i play better
and i think it is cause i don't get as tired
and that makes me so mad
you know it is like it is not going to do that much damage to the course but apparently they think differently
i like the course but i don't play over there because you they don't uh you know don't allow you to pull a cart
and i don't think a cart damages the turf
well the reason why we play over there is because its where since we are a garland resident they gave us a special deal where you can get uh ten rounds of golf for a hundred dollars
cause it is half price what the normal green fees are
so that is
cause we have got our card
well i guess i could use a card too
i live uh very near uh very close to the firewheel golf course
oh do you
so you live in garland then
well we are in south garland
but yeah next time you go uh you know check into it
they have uh
it is just like uh a bus card
and they just punch it you know
and every time you go they just punch it for you
well in the last two years i have not played very much golf because i am involved in boy scouts
you must have a a son
so i have uh i have uh i have children boy scout age
and uh so i am very active in boy scouts
so i would have to say that camping and hiking and canoeing and boy scouts is my hobby
oh well that sounds like fun too
but i but my golf clubs will probably rust before i get to use them again
because my boys are still right at the beginning age
and it is probably going to be six to eight years before they go to college
well you need to uh teach them how to play and take them out on the course with you
well they would probably never make it then
because i don't think uh
uh as a course for p e you know
but uh that is the only time i think i have ever really taken golf lessons
and that was kind of a group scenario and not individual
besides that uh i just uh try to make the club hit the ball
i don't want to play strike out you know
but i have fun doing it
some uh you know i have some good shots and some bad shots
it it is just nice to get outdoors and do something
so you said you work uh in the gardens too
do you have uh a special flowers
well flower gardens
so those ought to be coming up around spring time
my wife had uh just put in a bunch of i want to say they are pansies
and they have been
oh they do great
and i don't do anything to mine water them or anything
and they just
and i even had uh i guess it was last year or the year before i had some out
and it froze
and the pansies looked terrible but they came back later
so they are uh they are good to plant in the winter time
so if you start putting them you know you can put them out in the spring too
but once it starts getting real hot then it just kills them cause they can't stand the hot weather
but they make it through probably winter and spring
cause i love flowers
well that is good
and i do i try to do some arts and crafts
and i love to go
so you have a child two years old in child care right now
and we went through the process of searching for child care and uh finding what we consider to be
real good child care at a uh pretty reasonable price we think
and he just turned three months
uh university of southern mississippi
uh are you going to uh put your son in child care in a a year or two
uh probably uh
actually spring semester a year from now he's going to have to be in child care f- uh five days a week more than likely
uh depending on how my class schedule runs
because my wife will be doing her internship that semester
it will be forty hour week not no eight to five type of thing
but we just as a matter of fact just yesterday hired a a girl to uh watch him
and my wife is already supposed to be on her way to her class you know
so for about twenty min- twenty thirty minutes a day we got a baby-sitter comes in
well that's a good experience i think
and the articles that are written on the topic
and they kind of boil down to uh
any other important decision you really have to explore the alternative and what we found uh to be the best guide was our own instincts about
people who were going to be loving and uh
we could have sent uh her to a fancier uh facility
uh she goes to a home
this is a uh
a couple uh emigrated from china early in in their lives
and uh they're both there
and they have a kid that comes in and helps them in the afternoon
and our daughter is healthy happy well adjusted and enjoys going to see her friends
uh that makes a big difference
so it's a good experience
and if it's
and and that's really what we've learned about it
she'll have to go on to something more stimulating in terms of preschool in a year but uh we feel real fortunate
and we were able to uh just uh choose in the marketplace
i don't know what it's like around uh hattiesburg
and we were a little slow getting on the waiting list with the uh okay the university uh university's uh uh department of uh uh their home ec department uh they uh they have a subbranch uh american family counseling
and their people staff this this uh the child care center just off campus
but uh they have a pretty good size waiting list
well that's uh
i know it's it's a real hard thing to do even for people in in uh university communities
out here at manford they have a you know a a a real good facility
and there uh is quite a waiting list to get into that
so it's uh uh you know it's a it's a it's an important
well it's best
it's an industry that's still a cottage industry and i think this is b- really is buyer beware
because if you over
well it is the best way to do it interestingly
i think that uh my own interest in in development human development leads me to believe that that's a good sign and that uh private enterprise is the way to go and that it will lead to a fundamental change in the way we learn
because i think what we're going to go to is much more commercial entrepreneurial learning ventures in the market
as a matter of fact my future is banked on that uh professionally because i believe that that there are uh pressing needs in the marketplace unmet by schools colleges universities for uh learning a lot of things that kids can learn watching sesame street and in child care
and it's amazing how much good things like uh sesame street will do
it's it's phenomenal
it's phenomenal the programming the human operating system
i like uh a lot of different types of music
i have a a tape collection that i like to listen to uh cassette tapes but it's pretty varied
oh i i'm very uh i'm very varied as well
i uh i don't think i've ever met a type of music i don't like except for uh maybe you know heavy metal and that
that that doesn't appeal to uh my ears
well as far as the rap goes i think there are a few artists that appeal to me themselves and i like some of their songs
but as as
i agree with the general rule i i wouldn't choose rap either
but i i like to listen to uh what you might call pop easy listening country western jazz
i i don't
i like uh like i said pretty varied uh music
i really love to listen to her and uh i even have a a tape of lady smith blackman bazo
so they're interesting to listen to
well um i listen to uh specific
most most likely i would be listen to uh jazz or classical music
and i played in the in the jazz combo all four years
but you know jazz can get on my nerves after a while
uh you can't just listen to it you know to uh especially a lot of the deeper stuff
you just can't listen to it for enjoyment unless you're
it's too um uh
yeah unless unless you're playing it
it just it just doesn't do anything
uh uh blues are okay
i i tell you i do like um
and so um
i i like some of it um
as far as like the cou- what they now call country western it doesn't sound like the old country music at all does it
um some of it sounds more like pop music
and i even liked jim reeves you know or uh what what merle haggard and faron young that type of country western is what i i like to listen to
uh sons of the pioneers you know stuff like that
um oh i like sound tracks a lot
oh do you
i mean you know think about like the twin peaks and stuff like that that's just real recent things like that i like to listen to
um i like instrumental things
um i have some spiro gyro tapes
oh they're great aren't they
oh they're wonderful
i mean like i said that that's pretty varied
he's pretty kind of jazz inspired but but still kind of pop too
and you know what i like the most about him is i've gone to see him in concert and he always he looks like he's having fun
i mean some people sing
but he looks like he's having a good time
i mean he's up there moving around and smiling like he's happy and and like all he wants to do is is make the audience enjoy it too
and he he is real fun to listen to
um bonnie rait i like her a lot
um in fact whenever she won her big grammy i think it was like five of them or something was was it five
it was last last last year wasn't it
but um i was listening to a particular radio station
and and the one d j said who the heck is bonnie rait and why does she deserve five grammies
well i vowed then that i was not going to listen to that
well mark our situation is that we do have a daughter that is uh in the situation of choosing college
and uh i guess
and then it comes down to the dollar
you have to uh
you know it does
it comes down to uh trying to come with a trade off of the costs
uh what do you feel about come of the things that need to
damn it i agree with pretty much with everything you've said
uh the one the one thing that i you know i'd advise any parent uh you know or any or any person looking for a college uh is that i think i think you know it's really important for them to actually visit the college and actually try and get away from you know the guided tour of the college and try and talk to the you know actual students there
because you know they're just uh in my experience
i've talked to people at other colleges uh that you know
the the the way the you know the the the lifestyle pictured in the cat- catalogs isn't always
the the college
the the catalogs are sales material
it doesn't matter whether you know they're they're selling school
and uh and true
it uh really is helpful if a parent and the student can get there and see the real character of the school and the real life experiences of the school
uh i guess there's a difference in
the university here in saskatoon is primarily uh off campus resident students
like they just live in the community
uh you know i know that there are a lot of colleges and universities particularly as they get to be a little bit on the smaller side where dormitory life is uh is right on campus as well and that you know that changes the character of it quite a bit
i i go to georgia tech which is you know primarily an engineering school and uh you know i think i really do miss the fact you know that it's not a university that there's there's not the the you know
and there and there doesn't seem to be the diversity of views that a lot of you know universities will will have
uh i guess we're here
this is the university that has for years had the the car that uh will travel the farthest on uh on a small quantity of gas
uh in competitions
and that's the kind of thing that also you see uh if you can see the kinds of achievements that have been made by students as well as graduates can give you idea of the character of the school
uh whether you you know in one sense whether you've got a spirit of innovation and excellence or whether you've got a a spirit of somewhat unkind but producing graduates
uh you know as sort of some development and some training uh
like it's easy enough to crank out graduates but to really challenge them and uh and that can vary between colleges and faculties even as to how you know what the attitude towards achievement is
uh do you uh have anyone that you're seriously needing to uh feed information to
uh i don't really know of anyone that's like look- that's looking for colleges now you know because it with the exception of uh people's younger brothers and sisters
uh but uh no
actua- actually i'm i'm i'm more interested in in in choosing the right j- job when you graduate
well that's that's one of the really a valid point that people need to consider as well
uh you know to
going to college university is going to take four to eight years depending on the p- pa- programs person's involved in
and after that you have to be out in the real world and have to be able to support yourself and if you go in an area that there is just not much of a job market jeez
best training in the world is not going to f- put food on your table
and i have two dogs
and i have a sheltie
it it's a miniature
i'm going into all this because i used to w- i just got done
well the schnauzer i'm i'm watching for one of uh the managers where i work
and he's been transferred to germany for a while and i'm taking care of his dog
and uh and i had just got the kitten when he asked me that
and he says well my dog doesn't like cats
and i said well we won't tell him it's a c- we won't tell her it's a cat
and you know they just they just love kittens
so she doesn't know that this is a cat yet
and they get along real good
uh let's see
oh a sheltie
she's real s- sweet little dog
uh they're not as aggressive as a schnauzer
you know the schnauzers are a little aggressive
they're a good temperament and they and they just uh
i think they have a a higher level of intelligence than other uh dogs that i have encountered
but also some poodles uh they're kind of
but there's some also some uh not so smart ones
it seems the smaller the are the the worse off they are
that's that's maybe that's there's uh some credence in that statement
the- they're bred down so much
i i'd i really don't know what the best pet is
i mean some people seem fairly well suited for for uh miniature poodles and such
but i don't know about these uh these uh uh these pincers these now what are they called pit bulls pit bulls that are so vicious
uh they're really nice
i i've dealt with quite a few of them
people uh customers that bring them into the shop and ask me like they uh fit collars and stuff on them
and they are they are just really nice really friendly uh kind of like medium intelligence uh
well how do they become s-
well because some people uh want to train them as
oh they train them to be that way then
so the the poor animal is doing it in self protection
they aren't they aren't by nature really nasty critters
they are very determined critters and so once you get them going it's not good to
i was i was impressed by them
they're they're real sturdy little critters
and they aren't that big
and uh just really friendly
well that's unusual
i was i was overwhelmed
huh well i suppose you were surprised
after the reputation that you know
they have quite an uh uh notable reputation as far as you know
they're banned from in some areas i understand
but any any any pet's going to can can be bad if you train it to be that way
you know that
in my hometown they just outlawed ferrets because they had one incident of a ferret uh attacking a k- a child in a house
i mean these people had left this infant in the same room with this loose ferret
the the ferret is used to running the house and was kind of wild and you know they should expect something like that to happen
and so bas-
oh did it attack the child then
it it bit him
and that was that was not a good thing
but i think it was probably a an individual ferret thing because it was f- it was a fairly wild ferret
hadn't they hadn't
well the the people that owned him should have been on the lookout for that
i mean they really should have should have expected it
and taken the precautions
because then the the animal's in trouble and not the person
uh have you every been tested for a new job or anything
but in my job i'm a nurse and we are allowed to be
i mean you know this is the rules that they can do this anytime
uh i don't know of anyone who ever has been picked out and been tested
so it's just sort of uh
have you well wai- have you had any experience with it at all
uh not really
but i've always worked on a university level
but a lot of my friends had to be tested before they got summer jobs and stuff
so what do you think about that
uh i don't i don't think they're very accurate
because i mean i know their lifestyles changed p- prior to the drug test
and i know they changed afterwards
see i know of that too
and i also know that things like antihistamines sudafeds things like that can really throw it off
and you cannot get a job because of it
and they may not tell you the reason why
i i had a friend
but it came back that she tested positive for using a hallucinogen
but what it was was she had been u- she had been uh in the jungle
and it was some malaria medication
and she tested positive for that
see and so it really is a dangerous thing that way
because i know of somebody that tested for an airline and didn't get the job
and they weren't told why
but a lot of people say the reason why after you take a physical will be because of the drug testing
see i always
i thought they got you got called back if you tested positive for more tests
uh you should
because you should be given another chance or at least be able to justify it or something
how do you know how wrong they are
are they i mean is there a margin of error
but i know there are a lot of things that can influence them
and i think that a person deserves a second chance with it or something because most things will stay in your system for a long time
and if you could show that
i i interviewed for a job recently
and i was taking entex
and my doctor gave me a prescription for it
and he said this way if it were to make the drug test positive you have proof that your doctor ordered this for you you know
and it didn't come up that i needed to do it
but this could happen to anybody
and if they would just say oh this person's drug test is positive we won't hire them you know then you could lose out on a job when really you didn't do anything
so i don't know
and i i'm not so sure they are that needed
because they say they can spot check
but the occasional person then it's almost like it's almost an infringement of your privacy
well it sort of is
and this is it
you know as a health professional i wouldn't want somebody to take care of me that was using drugs
you know so as a patient i feel well yeah we probably should be protected
but on the other hand there's a lot of things i should be protected from that they don't test my patients for too
so i don't know
and i i think it could be used to hassle somebody
you know they could keep on doing this to you or something i guess
and it it's like it seems like now they have tests
oh wow but
i mean a lot of a lot of people as kids or you know young people get into some things that they get out of later on
and i don't think they should really have to pay for that forever
but you can't say it was wrong at the time
so that probably wouldn't be too good either
well i have five
well you do have a hard time finding time then don't you
well five are i mean four of them are grown
so i really have just a thirteen year old at home
well i work at it
to have them uh
and uh i don't think uh
well there's not much i can do about it
my my wife and i are u- in our forties you know
so uh but it's hard to raise one child without them thinking they're the they're the pivot point of the universe
because i was an only child too
and that's one reason i have so many
and my thirteen year old is pretty separate from her brother and sisters
and so she is sort of like an only child
and it's the same type of thing uh
and i have a brother in his twenties
and i was i was the youngest
so i understand how that worked
and he was treated like he had five fathers or something
that's exactly how it is you know
but uh yeah
it it's a little bit difficult though
we we really did not
and we did a lot of things together
and that was a lot of fun
but that that i guess you could consider that organized
i mean there is a competition all the time
you know i think that's probably true the
and if you have a large number of children or then you don't
well you can't afford to
and there's not enough time uh like my son is in uh little league this year
and they practice three times a week
and they have a game
and it's just uh if there were more than one child i don't know the- there would be no way to do it
you know one parent go one direction
and i'd have to go in the other
and we could only cover two at that
well i know i spent hours in the gym every day with my daughter
and my little one also competed because really she had no choice
so the three of us just spent a lot of time traveling and and competing
and of course the competing itself really didn't matter what it was
and it was a really neat experience
i did not work uh when i did this
and it's just
and so we really have to keep it together to get just her activities in and still have time to spend with each other
i don't think although i- i-
i think a a more than one child probably three children is probably the ideal to me
but i'm not sure i could afford three
i don't know how my my parents did it
i mean there were five of us
and i don't recall you know wanting anything in particular
uh but i don't know how my father did it
and he just didn't make that kind of money with five children
but we did okay
but now my wife and i both work
and we don't i don't believe we have as much as my parents did
and we only have one child
well things cost a lot more
i don't know how it is in georgia and i don't think our part of the country is particularly bad compared to some
ha- we have a lot of people moving here from boston and and different areas
and from talking to them they're shocked
and they you know
and i work with a lot of them
they they think they they have really done something
then when they get down here they realize the cost of living is outrageous compared to to where they came from
but that's about it
um well uh partly due to ownership
you know uh victor kiam owned the uh the patriots uh for a period of a number of years
and he always had this uh this wonderful quality of c- being able to put his foot in his mouth every time he went to say something
and uh they've had some financial problems with the team and so forth
and it recently was sold
so hopefully this ownership can set up new direction and uh keep uh the patriots in the new england area anyways
well it will be fun for you to watch up there anyway to see what happens now you
i've been to a couple i've been to a few games before
now you you're you're from texas
so you've got two football teams down there
well it depends on where you're from in texas
oh i see
there's that type of segregation huh
so we've got our cowboys here
and and uh i don't think anybody roots differently
but i have a boyfriend that lives in fresno
and he is for the l the uh raiders
well i just started to this year because of these silly raiders that didn't do very well
so i'm trying
well it's a good past time you know
they say uh i- football attracts more men because of the you know y- the you see the the physical aggression on the field
and supposedly psychologists say that uh that uh men take out their frustrations by watching football
and you know they get together with a bunch of guys
and they uh uh and they have a good time and everything
and that's suppose to be some of the uh the male bonding and the and the uh the male instincts i guess or something about the uh
so i shouldn't even try to do it huh
it it's good as in terms of in terms of uh of a contest
i think that uh
i personally like hockey better because it has contact it's a contact sport
and it takes a certain skill to play hockey
i bet up here in new england as well as you know in in the minnesota area
so i don't think we do
there's no professional hockey teams in in texas
and we have a soccer team that comes and goes
like they have this world football league
you see we have the n f l that that dallas and houston are in and new england patriots and l a raiders and those teams
but uh now they have what's called the world football league
and they have all these teams from
and there's a team
and there's teams in the united states
an- and they're playing now during the summer months
and it's really
and there's only so much football you can watch
well i like to do
so it kind of annoys me when people just lay in front of a t v and watch all this stuff
and i i can see what you're saying about the male bonding
and the guys get together
and that's kind of cool
that's fun you know
but it can get really overdone
now have you ever been to a professional football game
did you do the whole big th- the whole thing the tailgate party and the whole
well see now see that's what you got to do see
now we talked our
well the same thing
we we talked our wives
and uh we talked our wives into going with us one time
and they had a real good time
and it was basically for the social atmosphere
and that's the thing you know
you go you know three or four hours before the game
but but that whole
it it's not so much sure the contest itself and the game itself
but it's the whole atmosphere of playing uh of going to a game
that you miss sitting home in your parlor you know uh with with a six pack of beer and some uh potato chips you know you you miss that
and and any professional sport i think
the atmosphere of being there you know
well in high school i went to every football game
well i twirled you know
and i you know i didn't
but i still had a good time you know
uh do you have children in school
uh i have two that are uh now just about ready to graduate from college but i also have two that are just entering school
so you see a big difference then in before and now do you
i think they're just pushing them mu- entirely to fast
uh well it seems to me that kindergarten is now the equivalent of first grade
and i think that's such a long day for a kindergartner
i oh i think that's awful
and uh i have a preschooler
uh i was told by her preschool teacher that she thought maybe she was to immature for kindergarten
and i thought well how mature do you have to be
what's the new criteria huh
and uh there is a
and it's over and over
it's i t b s or and uh just everything everything
and they test test test
and i don't know if you've heard of plano
but it's a very transient community
it's just north of dallas and it's grown in leaps and bounds
i we must have maybe a hundred and fifty thousand people now
and most of them from other places
uh j c penney's come down from new york and of course t i and xerox from rochester
and we just
and it's a very wealthy community
uh not that i am
but other people seem
and i would love to know why
but i mean they do
i i would
i mean they just have beautiful beautiful homes
and they have everything
and it's one of these things
well that makes it hard for you doesn't it
well it does you know
and uh you know it does
i mean we do it to a point
but uh not to where she feels different
but some of them are very rich
and so uh we just kind of have
and we have a very goal oriented population because their parents are
and so i don't know how much of it
but the kids are expected to excel in
and it's almost impossible because you have so many children and just so many activities that everybody can't be first
and they're expected to be
you know their parents expect it
texas wants very badly to be considered tops in the school system and if you read national surveys they're far from it
and so there's just a whole lot of testing and a whole lot of pushing to do well on these tests
well not very well
i mean they make a big deal
and say just do this
you know i just feel they do better that way
and and i have older children too that now are out of high school
and they've always done this here
i mean it's always been the same
but it is it's getting worse and worse
and i just think it's really awful
and i i'm with you on that
but i think it's a very long day
oh it is
and my feeling is that you know you're only a kid once and you don't want to spend your whole life in school
my son said that came home
and he said he said mom all we do is work
and i don't think that's right
and so i just find this a real problem
and she had a
and when she went back in six weeks she was ahead
so what does that tell you
oh my gosh
oh my gosh
and they could be using this time better
well for example in my son's kindergarten they're really finished at lunch time
after lunch they have some uh
and then they have naps or rest period
and uh i think either send them home or do something a little more interesting
but i think that working parents have kind of demanded this
you know because they don't they don't want to send them to daycare
uh do you have the before school care
we have them at one school like
that's uh that was a really good movie
and uh i thought the story was pretty good too
i i think kevin costner did a really good job with it
um i've visited the wyoming area
i n- i haven't been to south dakota
have have you been up to that
well i lived in omaha for five
and that rolling kind of uh
is is fairly famili-
uh and i had been told you know you wouldn't notice that it was three hours long and all this
um i i noticed yesterday in the paper something said that it
and and all the critics initially said that you know it wouldn't go anywhere that it was just going to be a dud
so it it has surprised everybody
well the interesting thing was is i had heard that
and i i i tend to i think overreact occasionally when somebody tells me it's that great
and and it was the thing is it was it was a good story
and and and i guess that's what i really like
i've heard i've heard that's really great though
y- you have to go see that one
and how about silence of the lamb
i i uh
well isn't isn't sleeping with the enemy isn't that a
i- is it is it a terror movie
or is it just suspenseful
i mean there's not really any uh blood and guts in it or anything like that
it's it's more suspense
um the other one silence of the lambs is kind of a a gory movie if if somebody's not into that kind of stuff
it's it's pretty graphic at points
but uh i think they're both excellent movies
do you do you listen to gary cogill
he's a the movie critic
um oh you've oh
and he does uh he has a talk show on the k l i f
and and and people call in
and it's if you keep up with movies it's kind of interesting
they've got uh they've got a couple of kids ten or twelve years old
and they call in
and they review movies
but it's uh he anyway he
and then you you go watch the movie
in fact they had people had just seen
but anyway it was uh the
it it's interesting though
the the difficulty with with dancing with wolves is that when you make a movie like that and you produce it and then you star in it uh the question is did he did he really know it was going to be good
or did he just do it
i think that i think he really
but i i don't think he really knew it was going to be as big as it was
he wanted to to star in it
you know he he enjoyed the story line
and i think he just really w- he really wanted it
and whether it whether it won all kinds of awards or whether it just was okay at the box office i think he would have been happy
because i think that i think he did a good job
and and the self-satisfaction he got out of it is much greater than any awards that they can give him
do you know who the guy was that was playing the uh the the wagon driver
you know the guy when he first headed out from the army post
he he plays
oh he does
he's he's eldon her housepainter
now see i'd i'd a never put those two together
but i thought it it
it was him but with a you know with the beard and all that stuff
i mean it's uh
and it wa- it was really funny it's uh that that he winds up
but i thought it's good that you know
but we're at about five minutes
i mean i haven't been watching my watch
well i don't know
it used to it used to just automatically cut off
but it says when the conversation is over just say your good-byes and hang up
i i guess so
uh well how is it appropriate to be talking about exercise attitudes
well uh my my husband is right now teaching an aerobics class
he's an aerobics instructor and um is going to be uh entering
how i met him was through uh the aerobics class that he used to teach
i'm i'm an avid aerobics
enjoying a th- you know uh anything dealing with sports
so and how do you feel about it
uh i'm i am a person who wishes i had more time to exercise
i i don't feel like i
and i try to do things that involve exercise
but i very rarely do things like um
this is my exercise time but i do lots of outdoor sports and things bicycling uh you know mountaineering a little mountaineering this and that
and i spend a lot of time
and i probably get more exercise than your average person
but it's not a a structured sort of thing
and i have to admit i have a certain resistance to the idea of exercising for exercising's sake
and perhaps it's because somehow that implies to me it's not fun or something like that
well i i've
she feels like if it's something that you have to do you know
then it becomes it becomes a chore
and and she doesn't enjoy it when it's a chore
so um and i feel that way too as far as you know just sitting and doing you know to the idea of doing fifty sit-ups or something you know
you're a calcu- you know
and do your calisthenics
you know three times a week
or but but i do try and um i do try and regulate how much exercise i get a week
is that why you like aerobics classes because you're not sort of someone else is doing the counting for you so
and it's got
and i've always enjoyed dance
so it involves you know
i i can't get out to dance all the time
i mean you're you're using different parts of the body
so it it is like dance
an- and it's structured like that
but you have the music and someone like you said someone else is counting
so it makes it easier for me
and someone else is telling me okay you know let's move this way let's move that way
and all you do is follow along and enjoy yourself
but i'm like you
i also um like to participate in uh things like
well we just went to the uh myererson symphony run this past weekend
and and that was a lot of fun
and you get to meet different people
and um just get out you know
and it's it it's something you can all
it was it was quite a lot of fun
and i i i love to swim
so i love it when you know it's swimming weather
well you're talking to someone from california where it's often swimming weather
well i'm in texas
i i just assumed that i had
and i didn't realize that they ha- were going to reach out to people from
so it's the it's it's the the act- well it's actually
it's interesting because there are re- real regional differences
um in california there's uh almost an assumption
um unless you're sort of clearly of an older generation or something you know in your sixties or something like that
i'm i'm i'm not uh
there's an assumption that you do something for your physical fitness and and at least in urban california
and maybe not
but in urban california it's just you know
but they you know the craze really picked up big here
and before that there was the running craze
california gets you know tends to be a bit faddish
so there must be something to some of them
well i think people are are more inc- um um
people from california seem to be more health motivated all around i mean as far as the diet and everything uh the diet and uh just your health consciousness
and i mean it just
seems like uh a lot of those ideas generate out of california
health health related ideas
well there's a sense of it being a package
i think there there is a sense of you know whole
there's a lot of you know
and uh oh the the the uni- university of california at berkeley puts out the wellness letter which is uh turned into a fairly well subscribed to uh newsletter
and and it doesn't deal with just exercise or just stress management or just diet or anything
it it's on fairly so- solid scientific ground
uh it's just dispensed with these distinctions
it says ever- all sorts of factors go into health and there's no reason to talk about one rather than another so that they they combined them all together
and uh so it's had that orientation for quite some time
um there's been some progressive medical schools out here
now do you think that's because they've realized that for whole health that the you know you have to have that combination or that people are motivated that way so that they've incorporated that into their program
i i can say there's a correlation but i couldn't say which which caused the other
they sort of dev- you know each developed a little bit and then would feed off one another and develop a little bit more and a little bit more
and cause i
and somebody's got to be willing to pay for it and believe in it
and part of it is california
you know in back in the sixties had a lot of alternative movements
and some of them fizzled out
and some of them were disastrous
and others of them um had an impact on the society around here
and one of the ones that had an impact was uh people becoming interested in alternate practices
i'm not sure if it was a meditation practice or if it was you know which is similar to a stress management practice or alternates to uh a m a approved medicine
uh you have you know major um acupuncture schools and things out here
and and you could have them around long enough
and more and more people start believing them or wondering how to combine them with other things
and before long you you get this this whole kind of gestalt this whole package of of health of health care and options and uh and exercise is is strongly considered one of them
the irony is is its people in the cities in my experience that are most oriented towards doing the exercise
and i guess because they spend all day in back of their desks
the average person out on the farm at least traditionally now they drive fancy tractors as much as anything but at least traditionally the laborers
well don't you think they tend to be older in the rural ar-
i i sometimes think that it's almost frantic effort on the part of the people in the city
oh like everything else
you know i see that
it's yeah it's it's like it's frantic to you know to uh achieve something that that a person in a rural area uh almost doesn't worry about it to such a degree but stays you know almost healthier you know
well i i think so
i mean you you've
if you look at cert- if you look at other cultures
like i know a little bit about people who were considered very healthy in china
and they don't do very much vigorous exercise at all
but they do a lot of low keyed low impact low stress exercise
and they combine it with a you know meditation or whatever some sort of relaxation and they seem pretty you know
and an awful lot of exercise is sort of image conscious
but they you know they live to a hundred and ten some
and that that's
well don't you think a lot of that is diet too
and a lot of that is diet
i mean they eat they eat a lot of carbohydrates and not much fat
um for economical reasons not for preference
and as we can see
well i'm a i'm a practicing vegetarian
so uh i've read a lot of information knowing that to be true
i as am i
oh are you also
is that is that um pretty predominant as far as california do- doe-
most for example most restaurants in an urban area will have a little vegetarian section now
oh that's wonderful
well most most mo- sort of modern looking restaurants will
i mean we uh
it's such a chor- it's such a trouble here
i mean you just have to eat at home basically
because i was actually applying for a job in texas
and and and uh
well of course in the cities
well in the cities
so uh which you know
you get uh an influx of a lot of people from all over the country
you're going to have a lot of di- more choices
but but in urban areas it's you know steak places
an and it's not a you know
it's uh it's definitely
it it's it's changing to a degree
but um it's very frustrating
and even even with health food stores and stores where you can buy natural products or uh organic you know materials
i mean you would think
uh i'll just hand it off to you
and hobbies in our spare time is what we've been selected to discuss today
well uh the hobbies that i pursue in my spare time are crafts
and uh i've been involved in making uh hat stands and uh rag dolls and uh different type hats with uh flowers and roses you know and uh that kind of thing straw hats and
and i enjoy it
and you kind of get absorbed in it
so the time goes by you know before you realize anything is going on
and i play the organ sometimes uh just for my own satisfaction
because i'm not that good at it
but i like to bang on the keyboards once in a while
well oh hobbies gee whiz
so i never have time to deal with them
uh i used to do that a lot
and then i like um
so i'll take a lot of pictures of her
oh that's great
you know and spoil them
and um i really love that
if i could have if i could make it on the road i'd like to play on like a bluegrass band or something
oh that sounds nice
i've done it before and when i was in hi- in high school and college
and it's really a a blast
but that's the way life is i guess
she's uh into aerobics
oh that's good too
and we did aerobics together for about a month and a half
and that went over real well
but uh that's about it there
oh it's good
and it's healthy too
we have a uh a treadmill and uh a bicycle and that kind of stuff
we try to get twenty minutes like at least three for four times a week you know
oh that's great
and we like movies
we have uh
so we've been out twice in o- in this year so far
so it's kind of uh become an issue you could say
i like messing around in your house building things and you know
those kind of things um
we built put a kitchen in and um that kind of stuff and painting and some wallpapering
i like things that you know two people can do
but i like the quiet of doing things away you know
and that's what i find in making the dolls and things that it gives me something that i can create
and i like to crochet and knit
well we're all skinny farts
so when it comes to
to have mai- mainly i guess i get to
um um but it just
well uh uh smoking and all that stuff
i i lived in abilene for a little while
and uh worked in the abilene plant
and we used to go to joe allen's barbecue
and uh oh that was great
it's uh it's uh it's uh
there's uh there's pluses to everything
but you know seems like there's just so many things to do down here
we did i did horseback riding too
and uh that was kind of for them
but they weren't as interested in it as we were you know
so uh that was a real
i'd say probably for maybe fifteen years we dabbled in that you know
and i really enjoyed that
and i was disappointed when i went to texas
you have to look real hard to see a lot of things besides concrete uh
and that's about it down here
but uh that's great
well sounds like you have a lot of nice hobbies there
well look uh
well the thing is is that i um
since i'm in school i don't like basically have a monthly budget because i'm living off my dad
but he controls that part
but then whenever you know
and the only thing that i i basically spend my money on is just food
and um so
well the thing is is that i live in a dorm
so uh what happens is you pay six hundred dollars at the beginning or even before school starts
and then the tuition is also the same thing
so the thing is is basically that i spend like maybe thirty-five forty dollars every two weeks on on groceries
and that's about it
but the thing uh also is that you know like if you want to go out like if you want to go to a restaurant or something then i have to moderate that because it's like i can't go eat out at a nice restaurant and spend twenty dollars um you know three times a week
so i mean it's
for for us you know it's like i i can spend i can spend that money
but it's not it's not what i want to spend it on you know
are are you working anywhere while you are going to school
because um they don't allow me to work since uh i'm a foreign student
and so they the government doesn't allow me to work
so all the money comes from home
so you got to make uh
so how do you keep track of where you are in in your monthly spending
well the thing is is that um i ba- i basically know how much i have right
and so the thing is is that i i can tell like uh
i i get all my money out of the teller
and besides see one of my biggest expenses is telephone calls since i have to call you know international
and so the bas-
they they want me to call down there every so often
i mean i told my dad li- dad listen if you want to save money i won't call so often you know
so i doesn't matter about the money because we need to hear from you
so you call him collect
any any um
and um because it's considered a luxury in other countries
so you just call him direct
since it's his money anyway you know
and he gets the and you get the bill and send it to him
um i got money to pay that too
so it's basically you know
it's like it's not too much money
and it's not too little money
so i won't have to you know rush a letter to him or something
because um he really wants me to concentrate on my studies
what are you what are you studying
and what do you think you'll do with that
well i can i can work up um here up to a year
or what's the specialty that your looking for
um computer communications and data transmissions
so you want to find a uh data transmissions
you're looking for uh um long distance type stuff
you know anywhere from um local area networks metropolitan area networks you know all that
and so well you have a family right
and does does your wife work
she does uh
well it's kind of hard to say now days um other than taking care of the house she does a lot of sewing herself
and she gets paid for that
so she brings some money in
she is trying to start he- her own business where she does that full time
and uh do that on a on a full time basis here in town
and so and you have a monthly budget
well s- sort of
we're probably like most am- american families i guess that we sort of have a budget in that we know how much we've got at the end of the month
and we know what bills have to be paid
and uh we pay as many of those bills that can be paid with with the monthly budget
so you don't have any problem in um overcharging on your credit card and stuff like that
we're like everybody else you know
we've got a several credit cards that sometimes um instead of paying them all off every month maybe you have to slip some and you pay part of it this month and part of it next month especially around christmas time
you know that's when everybody goes crazy on charging stuff
well then uh see uh that's that's one of the points which i don't see
like i i don't give a lot of gifts during christmas
and i you know i don't wa- i don't like to give any at all because the thing is is that you know it's like if i want something i'll i'll ask somebody you know
like like uh for chr- uh for christmas my roommate goes what do you want
and i said i want a backpack
you kno- no
i told him yo- if you want to give me a present for christmas give me a backpack
because i i needed a backpack
so he gave me a backpack
and i i knew he needed an alarm clock
so i bought him an alarm clock
the thing was that that
but um the thing is especially remember when i was down in argentina it was to me it was ridiculous
because you know you have to
and you spend all this money on all these people
and some you don't care about you know
and so but the thing is is that um
well especially being a college student yo- your
i don't know that you need to be involved in a lot of frivolous gift giving you know
that effects the budget especially around uh christmas time
what about when you have breaks like um christmas or between sessions
well for example we had spring break now
and i went skiing
and i spent around like maybe two hundred dollars
so uh but you know its like um
because it's like you know say you know it's like we were saying let's go eat out before spring break
and if i felt like i spent way to much then um i won't go out you know
and so like my roommate went home
i went skiing in over the carolina mountains which aren't anything
but um but it was you know it was i guess it was worth it
any time you can get away and and
you know it was a nice place
get away from from the daily grind
so oh well let's see how long have we been talking here
well nice talking to you
i like well i like to cook foods i like to eat
and i find that i that's pretty easy to cook because a lot of it is one dish meals type things and
that would be good for a dinner party that you know to cook that because you don't have to deal with eight different things
um i usually have parties that are smaller groups
i don't have i've never had a real big dinner party except at traditional holidays like thanksgiving and such
and so um yeah
i like to cook um heavy sauces and um
what do you like to to cook
it's funny that um we're talking about this
and we had um
and i catered to their diet is the only thing though
so it wasn't something i really wanted to make
i really wanted to make red beans and rice and with
you know sausage
because i'm from new orleans originally
and um i was going to make that red beans and rice with the those cajun sausage and french bread with garlic butter and stuff
and uh well there's salad
and then for desert i would i really wanted to make um just brownies
or french donuts would have been good
but it's real hard to make them
um that's what i want
but instead i catered to their diet
so i made baked chicken in the crock pot
and um it was good and everything
but it seemed kind of boring compared
it kind of uh kind of down played compared to what you would like huh
do you find yourself um with all the um cholesterol and and high fiber changing the way that you fi- that you entertain
because i guess i guess i feel like if they're on a diet like that i'm going to you know honor that
but if it's just
another couple came um over a couple weeks later
and i made
and i made um uh
anyway but i asked
when ricky and carrie came over we made um a pot roast with rice and gravy and salad and the whole bit
and normally i don't eat we don't eat like that during the week because of the you know the calories and the fat in it
but you know when we're having guests we just kind of say oh just do it
and i made blueberry cobbler
and we had extra crust with it
but i don't think we gained any weight from it
well every once in a while i i think i feel the same way
like a lot of women will turn down dessert if it's too rich simply because they don't want the extra calories
so i think dessert is the only thing that i kind of down play sometimes
and she didn't eat it
but i did bake apples so that it would be not brownies you know
so um i've read a good brownie recipe
oh that's good
but uh anyway so i guess that's about what i did when i entertained
so do you have anything else you want to say about it
um nothing comes to mind right off
so i guess not
well it was nice talking to you
all right uh
i i would like to talk about just briefly
i think it's uh refreshing to see the uh the support that the president got from the american people
it we i i read an interesting article in the paper that discussed uh that uh
seemed that every other time a president tried to get support for an action like uh uh president carter and his thing with the the hostage crisis
and he always did it through rhetoric
and this time president bush did it through action
and he he drove policy by the course he took and almost forced public support
or uh i mean he left almost no alternative
and and it was very interesting how he did it
and uh i mean i'm i'm an air force officer
so it uh
it was interesting for me uh you know
i'd certainly uh
i i mean i think it's great that all the support
i have uh friends of mine from the air
i'm i'm an engineer and work in the rolm laboratory
but other engi- guys here on base
and they're getting a tremendous amount of support out of it
that's great um
if if you remember the vote in the congress to authorize war if necessary was actually pretty close
and if if my memory serves me right i believe a majority of democrats may even have opposed it
it it was
i'm i don't know the exact figure
but i i would imagine that because of the how close the the vote was i'm uh i mean almost certainly would have to be
just based on the sheer numbers of uh the disparity of
and uh i i
gosh this uh this whole thing now with all the uh all the political cartoons on the democrats and how they're uh uh
they're in in a sad way for ninety-two now in terms of the presidential election anyway
i mean how many years are we going to wait
and and what what do you do with the people that are over there in the mean time
all those factors played a part in you know uh the
everyone was discussing whether we should uh wait longer
but i i i know that there's a lot of reasons to wait longer
but i think we were genuinely concerned about how their military capability
and we uh i think we over estimated it
and that we were worried that they were getting dug in
well they were and in fact they were so well dug in that uh when we sent our tanks around behind them they couldn't get turned around in time
they couldn't yeah they couldn't
saddam thought he had the whole thing uh figured out to to which way we were coming and which what what our doctrine was that uh
well had had we done a frontal assault it probably would have worked more to his favor
i think uh this political situation over there now is uh uh
it'll be interesting to see what comes out of it whether the this opposition will uh uh
today the turks uh agreed to support the kurds which is something they've never done before
and uh this
and the israelis uh and not the israelis but the arabs all of a sudden are uh are cheering for baker on his drive for to reconcile relations with the israelis
so it's like
well baker is really not very much pro israel
and did you know john sununu is uh half arab
i i think i did hear that at one time a long time ago
because i used to live in uh massachusetts
in in fact when he was governor of new hampshire i believe
oh my gosh
and uh now he is a conservative
but he is not a conservative that favors israel
and that that concerns me greatly
well i don't
i'd certainly uh support israel in in their their policy that in defending themselves and in uh in their handling of their foreign policy
i think i think the stand they have or or the way the command respect i i support that
i think that is a a positive thing for them after um uh thousands of years
they have to uh they ha-
when they be- became a country they more than or more or less decided they weren't going to take it anymore
well they didn't have much choice
and uh um so gee
but uh um so okay
so i can't say whether that that i'm pro israel or anti israel
i mean i'd like to see them resolve something in that situation and get some stability in the region
and looks uh that the joining of forces for this uh uh desert shield and desert storm thing ended up being a positive thing
it is a positive thing um
however uh every time an organization such as the p l o says well we'll see if we can work with israel then uh they get embarrassed some every few months by documents that reveal that their ultimate purpose is to totally eliminate them
and so you you basically have uh mutually exclusive interests
or the arabs are going to occupy the area
and i'm just not sure that that there's going to be any easy permanent solution
and i think that's the problem the p l o has is that when they whenever one group of them decides that they're going to negotiate or they're going to do something they're going to try to make some peace but uh the end result is that they there so many factions of them and uh some more violent than others some with a certain agenda different than the others or they split
they end up being becoming divisive themselves
i i'm i'm looking forward to seeing what happens over there in the next couple of months
but uh that's
i i commend israel for their restraint in not responding to the scud attacks
that that is almost i mean that's absolutely unprecedented
an an incredible foreign policy coup on the part of the president and the state department
and that i mean that's never happened before
and i don't know if it will ever happen again
well it's been fun i enjo- enjoyed talking with you
i guess uh well maybe the computer will pair us up together another time
oh you're from north carolina
well my name's mary
so um do you well
uh i was visiting my son down in dallas
but his wife has a contract with t i
and that's how we learned about it
because i'm down at n c state
and so i took a class
and he said sign up and get some money and just talk for five minutes
so uh what do you think that uh
what do what do what do you think we can do to solve the crime in america
oh if i knew that i'd be a very wealthy person
but what what what are the steps
well you have to see
i the way i look at it you have to think first of all why
or ha- has crime increased
and if so why has crime increased
well see the problem is is that um
because in the country people still respect uh the property of other people
and so as as
and the people in the country don't want as much as the people in the city
now what happens is all those that don't have any money in the country move to the cities
and they rush to get the same thing
and the thing that we can do is we need money for drugs
and what we have to do is we have to go uh get some stuff steal it and then you know just resell it
and that certainly is one reason why crime here has increased
that's uh that's uh the main reason i think uh everywhere
because uh you have deaths
i mean i mean you have murders
and you have you know people stealing other people's stuff
i mean the thing is is that you know it's like you might be standing somewhere right
and like let's say you you're you're you know you're driving out
and you're driving back home
and it's late at night
and you stop by one of these you know twenty-four hour you know gas stations joints
and uh somebody walks in there with a gun
i mean they're going to want the money
and you can tell by the people who are always caught that these people are there to get money for drugs
i mean they don't want the money so uh so they can do something else with it
well but you know the the strange thing uh perhaps not strange but something that many people don't realize is that you can go back as far as nineteen fifty-one and fifty-two and find that there were drug dealers at that time trying to influence the high school kids
because uh i'm a retired educator
and in fifty-one and fifty-two the police came to the high school where i was and were telling us how to recognize when kids were on drugs how to recognize the pushers outside the one entrance that they were giving their drugs away in order to get the kids started and so on and so on
so it's a problem that's been around for over forty years
and we're just really uh uh now trying to uh figure out how to cope with the problem because it has grown so huge
there's a there's a uh a song that i know which says you know tha-
it's like in uh nineteen eighty-eight nineteen eighty-nine the local state and federal governments spent the least amount of money on crime in america
and uh their figures i think are too so
i mean it's like compared to you know compared to weapons or stuff like that i mean you're spending nothing on on crime in the country itself
what you're doing is you you know
it's like you have other things you know
we're going to solve try to solve the aids problem while while you know some people are getting killed here and there
and another one of the problems is that the people who are the dealers the big dealers in drugs
may be may be part of the power structure that's keeping us from spending the money in that direction
but those people never get caught
the people that that that i
see their theory is that if i'm surrounded and i'm going to be caught i'm going to try to find my way through
and they're not going to take me alive
but i have such a big army outside of my place that nobody can touch me
you know it's like
of course i mean i might be you know the the leading drug dealer here
but you won't find me dealing in drugs
i mean there's no connection between me and the people that were caught you know
but the guy at the very top the one who's who's really making the millions and the millions is the one who also many times is part of the power structure uh the uh and had the political uh pull to keep things from uh keep the interest or the emphasis in some other direction other than on the drug dealing
because it sure is monstrous in this country
i was i was at a at a party on saturday
and this guy comes over
and this guy was from jamaica right
and he's got his little brother selling drugs
you know and he goes yeah i just came up here to work
and i go oh you did you make very good money up here
he goes you know
and uh in the movie good fellows
and within uh two months he has all his house payments gone everything paid you know
and he had enough money to you know
it's like those guys at one point you know they had so much money that they didn't know what to do with it
really you know
even in our prison systems they're finding that they're they're having drugs smuggled into them
that's that that was also in the movie
so hello mary
oh that is a wonderful movie
oh goodness no
you don't even you don't even realize it you know
well we all heard different opinions about it
one that you know
and they thought that you know at certain points that it was going to end
and it didn't
and it kept going on
oh i thought it was great
now i've seen you know some different clips of it um
and it it looks good
and i heard a story about there's a there's a certain scene in the movie where there's um where they're they're on a buffalo hunt
and they have a particular child actor uh who's who's being supposedly run down by a buffalo
and when they were trying to film that the buffalo that they used for that scene was neil young's buffalo
but he has a fetish for oreo cookies
now i've seen another clip of um the guy that plays in murphy brown
but he played the uh the the character in it that was very like gross i mean very dirty
oh i saw the one clip of him
i guess he was taking kevin costner to like the site where he was going to be or whatever
that was rather um gross
the wagon the wagon driver
but other than that i've heard the the you know the um
and uh the costuming
the only thing about the costuming my husband remarked that it didn't that that um the indians all appeared to be wearing new things
and they should have taken them out and rolled them in the dirt a little more probably to age to age the material
so they they did very authentic reproductions of the of the actual stuff
but they didn't they didn't age it quite enough it seemed
but it was a very good movie
well i guess i will have to see it then
um actually have been to the movies um
oh i didn't see that
oh very suspenseful
i don't i don't like stephen king
but i went with someone
and once i was there i couldn't believe
i mean it's an excellent movie
because uh just generally you know that kind of scary stuff i i just don't want to have anything to do with it
it's not necessarily it's not necessarily scary as it is suspenseful
i mean it's not
i think i heard somebody talking about that she cuts his foot off or something you know
in in the book apparently she cuts his feet off
but in the movie she she disables him but not by cutting his feet
um she she breaks both of his ankles
and that i couldn't watch
and but you know you could tell when it was coming
so yeah um
i mean you wouldn't like to see anybo- anything happen to anybody
but it was just how she got so caught up
her emotions and you know and and she feel madly in love with this writer
and there was this
but she was a killer
and the the character was you know prior to that had had been someone that had killed other people but no one knew that
and we went to see not without my daughter
but mostly we wait until they come out on video tape
and then we rent them
oh yeah that looks really good too
and there were a couple others that i just haven't had the time
now see i
i'm i'm intrigued by it
but i'm not sure i want to go see it yet
i think uh
well now we had some friends that went to see it
and they said it was okay
so it might not be as
i think they may be playing up um some aspects of the movie that aren't the main aspects
now we went to see the jagged edge
oh i liked that movie
so it's it seems like you know that kind of the thriller suspense and not not real um strange in other ways
well i guess that's about it
i think uh
i think uh that's the way everybody has done it so far
but anyway i think that um we are paying a lot in taxes
but i think that we have a government and we have a lot of freedoms and we have a lot of things that the governments do with our money
um we're probably one of the the only countries in the world that has all the things that we have
the you know
as far as the quality of the streets the school systems um the hospital stuff that the government gives money to um the you know all the things that the government does like that i uh i think they need to manage it a little bit better
but i don't think uh anybody is just going to come in and fix it in a couple of weeks because they've been messing it up for many years now
and you're right
we i mean we you know we do have a good government
we do have a lot of things that you know that you know the taxes are there to support
but i do think they're mismanaged
and i think that sometimes it's too easy of a i don't know to easy of an answer
it seems to say i'll tax them if you can't get enough money instead of trying to figure out how to cut budgets or cut spending or or you know get all of the waste out of the spending
uh i don't know what y'all are paying in dallas
but you know it seems like we pay the state
you know there's a
the taxes set by you know the state and the city can add theirs
and the county adds theirs
and you know we're paying almost eight percent sales tax right now which seems to me nuts
and you know when i left there we paid six cents on the dollar
and that was like one of the highest in the nation
i'm thinking you know everybody is sitting here screaming about we don't want a state income tax
but yet they allow the sales tax to go up and up and up and up
and they don't do anything about it
we're still we're still one of few that don't have the uh state tax
and i did pay state tax in california
but my goodness
the what did you call it the sales tax is just getting outrageous to pay
where do you do you come from originally
i've lived in in the dallas area here since i was like four
so uh it's i don't know an urban area i guess
you just you just managed to escape the real texan accent
but i don't know
where what did they say to uh
so you know even even in the story where they had to pay the taxes the disciples
and uh jesus said the money in the fishes mouth or in the fisher inside the fish
and uh i thought of those two things when i was i was holding for a long time
oh were you really
well you know um back then what they tried to do you know
and so that's what they were trying to do with the tax situation
and of course that's when he said well you render unto caesar's what is caesar's
and uh you know of course there
but but i believe in paying taxes
and i mean yeah
you know i don't want to pay more than i have to
and i get outraged when i feel like they go up for useless reasons
but i believe that they're necessary
so i really do
do you do you deal with taxes much in what you do when you work
i've i spends a lot of time with our income tax though this especially this year and last year
um i have been married for just a few years
so i've had to really switch around from the e z form to the uh
i i saw that too
and that was one of the main pluses that we have about buying a house
and it will help tremendously
and at the end of the year you've paid all interest and no principles
so that will definitely help in taxes and what you will get back
well i get twenty six paychecks
so if you pay your rent or your house payment every two weeks
instead of once a month you'll come out paying a uh one month extra every year
and it will if have you a thirty year note it will take like seven or plus years off of your note
my parents uh bought a home in san diego about four or five years ago
and they did that
and that's exactly right
and that's going on the principle
and when we bought this house we looked at doing a fifteen year note because it added more to the payment
but not significant amounts you know
but we're taking our time
well that's good though
well we just started two or three weeks ago
and we're not going to just kill ourselves
well that's good though
well that's good
but anyway well um i can't think of a whole lot more to say
well i can't either
my wife uh she went to uh the school out there in lubbock
so she was at school out here
well what was her name
well good luck in your house hunting
you y'all work at t i
and i used to work
i i did all of their capital and financial planning for about eight years
and then i have been in human resources for the last two years
and i work with those same people all those nine years
i'm uh turning in a capital request right now
so you work in back grind
i'm i'm sort of an acting process engineer
but that's pretty much what i do
that's what you do uh
and do you
well good deal
uh oh i like him
but we needed that
well that's good
he was very good for lubbock when he came to you know
that's that's what he said here
he's broadened our um the devices that we're making too
well that's good
anyway well it was nice to talk to you
well you too
well i know they will
and besides my daughter wants me to put her to bed
well have a good day
why do you think it uh sounds
i i i think the country is is uh too ingrained in the inches and and just the general uh background
and i don't think there's a big advantage in going to the metric system
it it's going to disorient and confuse a lot of people for years and years
and there are going to be people who die because of it because they don't understand uh you know simple things from the amount of medicine they should take to how fast they can drive and you know how far away something is
and it's it's not in our national consciousness to do it
i i agree with you
i don't think the benefits of the metric system outweigh the the disadvantages that would happen to the people in america and also the uh
it seems almost like there's this it's a peer pressure thing is why we keep wanting to do it is so we'll look good to the other nations
because i think they that's an area that the other nations especially europe look down on us like oh we're just backward wayward children who still use this backward system who haven't really attained it yet
and i feel it's just pride of why they keep trying to push it on us
and it's like hey we're content with this
probably you know intellectually doesn't
it's not as sound intellectually but like you said i mean come on
and i don't know the metric system and i don't care to learn it and i'm not some kind of an idiot
and it's easy to trans-
and if it's necessary to translate back and forth between them it can be done because i'm a mechanical engineer
and i've had to work when i was designing packages for people
i mean i had to to work both systems back and forth
and it was not hard
and you get you can get a cat cam system that can take any design you want
and you can push a button
and it'll convert every
like you're educated
but i mean a lot of people are flat not educated
and if i have a hard time you know putting that into my life can we put that off on the other eighty percent of the population that doesn't have any college
or i don't know how much of the you know
but a large percentage probably over half of the rest of the population they don't have any college probably much at all
and if we can't take it and use it easily well how can you put that on like elderly people and you know just people that maybe just aren't blessed with as as much sharpness and ment- mental acuity
or or even have had the ability you know the chance to to go to college or to to to learn about
and they do
and and that's acceptable
because like what you said of just you know hey this is ridiculous
i mean if you look at the average family it's like man they barely have time to stop and get gas much less to try and figure out how much gas they're really getting and do all this
it's like i mean come on let's take the pressure
you know you need twenty gallons but do you need how many liters
and it's just like another thing the american family doesn't need any more pressure
and leave them alone
and it it just doesn't it just doesn't make that much difference in the average life
and the scientific community and places where it's needed you know that's fine
and the rest of the world i mean we are
but i mean let them come to us
and and if they don't like the way we do it just get off our don't worry about it and i think
it it's kind of like expecting everyone to suddenly speak german
it is because it is another language
and and instead of saying the world speak german we found out that we can translate
and that's what i think we ought to do with the metric system
well that's good
and we'll end up one man was telling me about his grandfather in lithuania
and we were talking about something tot- income tax or something
and i just
well good talking to you
well like i told you before
and you're talking about
i mean i had a delightful evening one night cutting a bunch of those suckers up
um i wish i had
well you should try it
i had a uh i had a business going
but uh i had a coin shop
and everything was going great while gold and silver was up
and it started falling
so i started paying expenses and stuff on my credit cards
and things got worse and worse
and finally boom
i ended up going into bank- you know
oh it'll get better next week you know
and so there i was in old bankruptcy court
well you weren't charging gold and silver were you
oh you can
and uh you know they take payment any way they can get it
oh that's a nightmare
course on on stuff that i was on merchandise that i was buying on cards it was i was getting the money back
because i was selling it
i wasn't buying you know just to hold onto it
uh but it was things like you know rent and phone bills and advertising and all that other good stuff that ate them all up
well i remember before i got married
you know when you graduate from college they'll send you all those credit card applications you know
and uh i had stuff for like sanger harris
and you know it got up like to couple of hundred dollars
and i thought well that's okay cause all they wanted was ten dollars a month
and every time they had a sale there i was
because you know got get such good bargains
and i don't know
well just today in the mail i got uh i got got my guaranteed acceptance by uh american express
and they started sending those things to me again
and uh course i guess i guess i've been purged from their records
uh back when i had my business i got one
and they they goofed up bad on my fir- on my very first bill
because i was using the american express strictly for the travel expenses
and the bill would come in
and i'd pay it
and the very first bill
and then i got this nasty letter from them saying you're overdue pay
so i said well it just crossed in the mail
so i didn't do anything about it
and said we're going to turn this over to our attorneys if you don't pay
and i looked at that
and i said uh-huh
so by this time my checks had come back from the bank
so i made a copy of the check that they had cashed attached it to their letter and sent them a nasty letter with the card cut in little bitty pieces saying thanks but no thanks
so what is it now
or i'm sorry no
but then what's the interest
well now that's the card see
and interest is like eighteen or something
well of course on the green card you have to pay it when the bill comes in so there isn't any
but on the optima card it's
um let's see right now it's running at about
it's actually it's about sixteen and a half percent which is pretty good
well credit cards
well they're dangerous
you know my parents don't hardly use them
my mom has a uh has a mastercard and a visa card
and that's it
now i i do use gas cards
now impact is kind of bad too though
you know especially if you get forget to record those little suckers
i mean that's the that's the whole problem with it
well and you're tempted if you've got cash a little bit of cash and you don't have enough for the purchase right
oh my husband says i might buy it
but i i don't really usually consider that an option
having having been out of the credit game for some years now i've gotten used to either paying in cash or not getting it
but it's hard isn't it
well it is
but i i i'm kind of uh grateful for the experience because it's taught me a lot of restraint
well it makes you feel good when you whip out the cash instead of your plastic
i i uh i just went out and got a new v c r yesterday with cash
and it it's
but there's always a sale
circuit circuit world or something
they they're not their prices aren't that terrific
they they used to be
but they've gotten they've got to pay for all that national advertising now
oh it's national
they're they're all over the country now
well what else
they they used to be good
i don't know if you have a place there called uh
or you probably have something similar
and uh circuit city came along
and that was the place to go to get your t v and washer and dryers and refrigerators and all that
and then after the years went by they just sort of kept creeping up on price
and actually service merchandise is cheaper than them now
uh north carolina state
so you're on spring break
ours don't ours doesn't start until uh next week
so where are you
so what are you getting your degree in
and what do you do with it
well what is it
it's well it's more psychology and engineering
my my master's is in industrial engineering
so you're working on your doctorate
oh that will that will sound wonderful won't it
i b m uh
i mean uh a lot of people use human factors
but i b m is what i'm looking at right now
aren't aren't they laying off several thousand people
but not at not at the human factors level
well i heard it on the news today
as a matter of fact the i b m right here or in carey which is a little suburb of raleigh just just hired one more human factors person
i'm i'm i'm going into thes- or going into the uh dissertation this summer
and get that done this summer
uh i'm going to start this summer
i probably won't finish it until the end of the year but uh i'm i'm trying to get a uh intern position with i b m right now so that i can find an area to do my dissertation in
that and and it's it's limited application in some respects
um conside- in the area that we're in here there's a lot of places that use human factors people
as a matter of fact this past weekend since we had a long weekend i uh took on a painting project in my bathroom
and i had wallpaper up
and it took me all weekend
because uh the wallpaper getting it off i had to wet the walls down
and that had to dry
and then the spackling had to dry a day
and then the painting took another day
you didn't try re- rewallpapering
you just uh
i i just painted
so i just used a like a semigloss
well did you get good results
it it looks so
i need to uh either paper back over it or do something
but it just didn't it didn't it didn't cover it
but it didn't excuse me it didn't uh uh it just didn't look as smooth as i wanted it to
we moved oh last august
and we're getting a house
and we decided
and they just said oh you can get by
and i forgotten what it was you put down and then you can just paint right over the dark
well more or less
after about uh half dozen coats it looks reasonable
but it kept
the the dark
it was uh just a real dark uh wood grain type paneling and it was smooth
and uh and we would we put this stuff on
and and it supposedly textured it or did something to it
and but because of the b- dark behind it it was really hard to cover
it was something like that although we sort of when we got through i wished we hadn't done it
because we were you know we were trying to make the house look nice to sell it
and we were painting it and trying to do uh you know make it
and it it really was you know
the advice they give you is uh
uh particularly when you try to
i was talking to somebody else who who had a lot of wood panelling
and uh they had gotten somebody to come in with an estimate
and it seemed like there was it was a good sized den with a lot panelling
and the people quoted thirty thousand dollars to paint it or something
oh my goodness
have you have you tried getting outside estimates to see what it costs to have something painted
now uh when we bought the house that we live in right now we had a company that came out and painted it
that was one of the requirements from you know f h a that the house be painted before we bought it
and it was fairly reasonable
but all the trim around the house was uh
oh that's quite reasonable
so that wasn't too bad
um problem i-
have you have you tried matching paint lately
we we built a shed over the long way
but i did finish it
but my wife went to the uh home depot i think it was and and took a uh a copy took a piece of brick and she wanted to paint the shed
it's it's a wooden shed uh
and she took it
and they've got this machine that matches the color of paint
and uh they got
and uh and in fact she put some right ba-
they mixed uh a gallon of it
and uh it's just remarkable how close it will match the paint uh
and it does it uh oh electronically some something
you know they
but it's electronic
uh you put your sample under this thing
and it looks at it in- and uh and determines the
and it it's really remarkable
uh the problem they had
and then they wanted some gray to do the to do the trim
and uh but they didn't didn't occur to them that um that they could have taken a sample um from
but anyway it's it's remarkable
that's one of the problems though when you start painting to try to get the you know
you want this you want this to look like this
and you want that to look like that
but when you start getting into colors
as a matter of fact uh what we've got ours painted now is kind of a light creamy color and a uh a blue
and the blue even so many years two years later or so it doesn't match
so what's your
oh i have no idea
well at least you'll get very good at it right
you could go back and and paint
that's uh this is an interesting topic that they would bring up painting
because it uh it seems like everybody has a you know to go in and do
although the uh
it's uh it
we painted the house to uh
we painted we painted the whole inside
and it had all this dark trim
we thought uh you know
i think i think we left most of it because it gets to be uh
oh good luck
actually i i don't know whether it made
it's interesting that the white um makes the rooms look bigger
in our down stairs in our dining room we have a formal dining room it has molding uh like picture frames i don't know what you call that that actually that are along the walls you know up a couple of feet
and my wife
oh i see
and uh it makes the room look remarkably smaller
huh she painted the insides dark blue and then the trim
the the molding but by
and she did that all the way around the room which makes it look very attractive
but it makes the room look smaller which is uh uh which is
it explains why they why they have everything white
but i you wouldn't think that i
well maybe maybe that understands colors would know all of that stuff
well uh what about the lighting
uh not particularly
because the house has so many windows uh it has
the the the living room has four uh good size windows
and uh well of course at night
but with the
and the lights shine right at our house
so that uh
the color doesn't really matter for because you have that light
and well it it it um well it's just uh i think it's just the the the dark blue to about three feet
so anyway it didn't it didn't change
but the the interesting thing is that paint we wound up having to go back and scrape some of that away
it kind of bled under the masking tape which i guess is probably the topic we're we're really on to that that the masking is
and it takes a long time
well i'm sorry to hear your color didn't come out so good over the weekend
well i've got to go to a meeting
well i wondered if i was going to get to talk to a male or a female on this type
this is this is probably more interesting if it had been a male and a female
well uh i guess uh there have been certainly a lot of changes in the last couple of generations
for uh the roles of women
and uh i guess the most significant probably is that so many are working now
and trying to juggle job and home and family and all sorts of other possibilities you know
they may be going to school or may have elderly parents or you know all sorts of other things
it it seems too me like though that women's roles are changing faster than the men and therefore the women are spreading themselves thinner
oh i think so
i i i think it's extremely difficult to keep up with all that we have to these days
so they are not quite as much of a responsibility
but they are still there you know
and and i you know i still provide most of the things that go on around the house
so uh yeah
and for a while i was going to school too
and tha- it was tough
i uh i think that while it's a good change for i think women to be able to fulfill their potential in whatever they feel you know
uh i think sometimes other things suffer and tha-
but in some ways i think we are expected to do it all
and that's where the problem is really
and i decided that it was very important to me to stay home
uh and when i i i happen to you know be
i'm very active with uh people other people with children my age
and most of us do tend to stay home
but when i run into people that you know just have recently had babies or have very young children and are working full time i there's almost a uh friction between us
not people that are you know necessarily good friends
even though that has happened too uh
and if you don't then sometimes you feel like you're looked down upon by people that go back to work and so you're just wasting your time
i mean i've done some of both
i when my kids were real little i was at home for a couple of different periods of time
oh i think the longest was less than a year
but still at least i was able to to spend you know those first months with them
but uh i mostly went back to work because i was tired of doing without things
but uh even now i would i would like to not have to work in some ways
it it's kind of pull and tug
on the other hand i can't imagine just being at home uh although i have a lot of interests and a lot of things i would like to pursue
uh still uh there's there's sort of a feeling of accomplishment with having you know a job and all that goes with that
that that's definitely true
in fact i i work out of my home
um i'm an accountant
and i do taxes and bookkeeping
and i uh
and i mean i still unfortunately have to be very disciplined
but uh but it it's worked out for for my family
i mean do you think things are going to change
or are we going to keep having to try to juggle all of this
well i i hope that they will change uh
but but i'm
uh i i feel as though a lot of people are going back to just having a one wage earner
i mean i'm just thinking of my circle of people that i know
i know quite a few people who have decided to not have both both both uh couples you know both uh of the parents work
and yet uh i i we-
i hope to see employer based you know helping out
you know child uh care centers at the place of employment and and things like that that will help out
i well i see i think some people wanting to stay home more and take care of the children
uh and even those who may not do it seem to be spending more time with their kids and really trying harder at making all of the the family things work
uh but i don't know if they're going to ever give up their careers you know
but it would be nice if there could be an in-between a middle ground somewhere
i think it's hard though when you talk about about families and and raising children
because ch- i think children have a hard time understanding a middle ground
i think they uh they need security
and yet they
from speaking from my children the- they aren't real flexible
they uh they want to know things are going to be a certain way
i think they they like a routine of sorts
well we will see
i i'm hoping to see more female leadership in our society
i i like the fact that you know gradually you're beginning to see women in public office and executive positions
but it's still a long way from being what it ought to be
the the numbers are still very skewed to say the least
well i enjoyed talking to you
well uh i am basically retired now
so basically i wore dresses
and uh heels
and i was never one uh because my work often took me into court uh never was one that got uh accustomed to wearing pants suits and pants to work
but that was just me
i know many people are co- very comfortable in the classroom and what have you wearing pants
i guess i was just old enough not to uh be very comfortable in it
well i work at t i
and they don't really have uh dress code so to speak there
it's pretty lax about um you know
we- you can pretty much wear whatever you want to
and i wear anything from jeans when i'm feeling really casual to uh suits and dresses when i'm meeting with a customer
or i i teach training classes
and so when i'm teaching a class obviously i wear a suit or dress
it it uh definitely fluctuates mainly with what i'm going to be doing that day and kind of what my mood is
and when it's raining
and and when it's really cold i'm more likely to wear jeans or pants or sweaters or that type of thing
um but it just really depends on the weather and my mood
and then you know obviously when i'm doing anything that i'm in front of people or or making presentations teaching whatever
and i think that does make a difference
because when you do have to be in front of people
uh i think you the the tendency there is to wear dresses and suits and and uh more classical style of clothing
um i've never worn
i mean even to
well jeans aren't exactly professional
but for some reason a mini skirt is to me a little more unprofessional to wear to work than jeans
just because it's maybe it's just because of the sexist views and everything
but you just feel like you're you're being showing too much le-
but they they weren't overly shor-
and they weren't overly revealing
for me i just i just cou- wouldn't want to do that
well there are mini skirts and there are mini skirts
and then there are some that may be will come like four inches or five inches above the knee
and again it depends upon the size the shape of the person
now i also uh
even though i retired from education i uh i do modeling
and i teach at a modeling agency here
and uh so when we are doing wardrobing and we have uh two two hour classes in wardrobe we do discuss a great deal the mini skirt and the types of clothes to wear on the job
uh even though i may have them from sixth grade on up through uh grandmothers
and uh whe- i always try to emphasize the clothes that you wear should not necessarily be the greatest fad
because maybe they those are not the clothes that are the most uh appealing to you or the most uh complimentary to you
but uh the mini skirt many times will evoke comments you don't really want
and and then uh then you're in the situation where you're very unhappy
well i feel like too on the job when you know there's men around and some of the managers are men you just you know you don't want them looking at your legs
and uh to me i just wouldn't feel comfortable in that at work
well i i uh i have to uh agree with that even when they was very very popular in the early sixties
uh i uh uh
uh we had no regulation against it
and a lot of the kids did of course
and it could be very embarrassing for the men teachers
because they were not that careful in how they handled themselves in those mini skirts
and so i think uh uh of course now i go the other extreme i do not like to see in the corporate areas uh all the women dressed like men
with the suits and uh white shirts and ties and what have you so that they all look exactly the same
uh i don't like that
even with the very tailored look of a suit sometimes i like to have someth- a lit- just a little something that's feminine
not you know
but i can be professional too
well i and i don't think that you have to be manish and extremely tailored to to look professional
i think that you you make of that what you wish
and you can go the opposite direction and uh over do all the frills and laces and flounces and what have you which don't belong in the in at least in my opinion in the work place
uh but that that
you can have a classical look without a lot of a great deal of adornment and what have you and still be very feminine
because that was one thing i always fought against
so i was always fighting against the idea of looking tailored or manish
uh and people would never ever guess that i was phys ed
and um and that pleased me
uh and so then i of course just continued what i considered the best style of clothing for me at work
and uh and i find even even at home here now i i will wear blue jeans or i'll wear shorts and what have you uh and be very comfortable
but when i go out somewhere then uh unless i have a pair of dress slacks i don't usually wear a lot of blue jeans
and so uh uh i just feel that uh you know each person has to dress to their own liking and for their own comfort
but uh there are certain norms that companies should be able to uh put out as guidelines for their employees
that's what i one thing i like about t i is that they aren't overly strict about what you wear
and they don't you know your boss doesn't come up to you and say now remember tomorrow you have a meeting so you'd better wear a suit
i mean they they leave it up to you and your judgment to to use good judgment and dress tastefully and dress for whatever occasion you may have
the only real restrictions they have are uh no halter tops and no shorts even the long walking short of the squirts the the split skirts
anything that that could be considered shorts they don't allow
and they don't allow uh any sweat any sweat shirts or t shirts that might have vulgar or you know anything like that on it
other than that it's pretty pretty lax
and i think that's good because it does allow people to be individual
and it allows you to kind of dress the way you feel that day
or you know if you want to be comfortable and casual you can
and sometimes i think you may be more productive if you're comfortable with what your wearing and can be be feel more relaxed
whereas uh sometimes when your in the suit and feel kind of almost stiff and you're not you know maybe you don't uh can't get as comfortable to sit down
and you know like when i'm writing training material i prefer to be more comfortable unless i know i have to meet with a customer later during the day
so that's i think that is good that they're like that
and they must wear blue or gray or black and a white shirt and
you know no variation
and i don't i don't quite agree with that
but uh i i uh did have a group come over from one of the banks over the children's hospital where i was volunteering
and uh they were doing a presentation
and every one of the young execs coming up were dressed exactly a like men and women
they all had on the gray jackets and the gray trousers or sla- or skirts and the white blouses and the same color tie
i mean you could hardly tell the women from the men except for the lengths of the pants
and one was a skirt and one was a pant
and uh and i think that's sad because that doesn't allow for any individuality
that 's uh can stifle creativity
well it's been nice talking with you
i wanted i want to go see that
and i just went because we couldn't we could never get to go see it together because it's so long
so i finally just went to see it
and i just thought it was fantastic
i i i watched uh costner
uh but he he he did pretty good on that one
i'd i bet
i mean it just blew me away
uh dances uh silence of the lambs
uh i'm i'm afraid to go see that one
well you know they they that's what they said about the exorcist you know
you'll have nightmares you know
we we laughed about it
and i thought oh man
well i guess i i guess it was because i'd read the book before i saw the movie
and the book to me was far more frightening than the movie was
and he had a way of putting you in that scene you know
and of course i was i was living alone at the time
and it was late at night and scary and you know
you start hearing noises you know
and there's rats in the attic you know
uh let's see
and i can't remember
with that new uh michael j fox movie the hard way
where he plays a a actor that's uh like th- huh
i i didn't i didn't even like the previews on that
oh i know
well i ended up at the theater
and there was didn't seem to be anything else on
so i'll try that
but it wasn't worth anything
i i don't much care for michael j fox anyway
well the last two i saw him in one of those back to the future part three deals
and that was crummy also
and then i i know
i mean i think i think the only i've ever seen a sequel was two thousand and one
uh two thousand and ten was far better
well i hadn't read it
and i couldn't figure what was going on half the time
i mean the the book was so much uh
you know a lot of that stuff that was going on in the film you co- say what is this
you know what's the significance of the apes you know
oh the book is really good
i mean i i keep a little library of books that i just like to read over and over again
and that's one of them
it's it's so well written
huh well i have one i bet you haven't seen if you don't have kids otis and milo
oh you're right
it has w- to see it on the big screen because it's just the most gorgeous nature scenes you've ever seen in your life
and it's all this
and it's not
it's just uh it's just so realistic everything they do
and it was
huh oh those a real dog and cat
and all the other animals
and then the cat gets um on this treacherous journey
and he winds up all over creation
but uh it's just really an incredible thing
so- sounds sort of like the incredible journey
and of course the only sound is dudley moore narrates it
but there's no you know nothing else
but it really keeps keeps me going
i i've seen it twice now
th- that sounds a lot like a walt disney film
i mean i i i was raised on walt disney films you know
old yeller uh big red
all those old good ones that you you know wish they had on more now
and it was so good that i had forgotten that it was christmas eve
i mean that's something for a kid
and that was something for greedy old me at christmas time i'll tell you
oh i just saw one on the video
oh um have you seen the gods must be crazy part two
but the second one
but that's my sense of humor
well i i'll have to go get that one i guess
and i'm just i guess i'm just middle america or something
and and not really interested in some of the like the terminator or some of the schwarzenegger
i get so tired of you know these you know sequels
yeah you know
yeah you know
freddy eats a nuclear warhead you know
i i'm just
i i haven't seen a one
and i i was afraid that rambo was going to do the same thing that rocky was going to do you know
and i just
i don't even rent them you know
i i figure if i find a movie i like i'll buy it
so he he once he has one he likes he likes to watch it over and over
my my very favorite one that the top of the tick for me is uh excalibur
i i loved that film um
and i lived over in england for four years
and it was just gosh
it was it was filmed in ireland
and they got pretty scenery in ireland
and i i've been down to the south of england where supposedly king arthur's castle was
so that really has a lot of meaning for you to see that
it was yeah it was unimpressive to look at
i mean the whole thing was about the size of a a medium house
well when i was in england years ago
and i went to to like shakespeare's and you know stratford-on-avon and all that
and it was like you couldn't stand up inside of it
because it was so short
i i spent four years traveling around and didn't see you know hardly anything
stonehenge of course you know
every everybody makes the obligatory trip to stonehenge
and that was a riot to see that
i come to think of it i don't think i went to the movies one time
where i lived uh it was a little town called newmarket
and there was another town called barry saint edmunds about twenty miles away from us
and they had a little uh theater company there
and we use to go go out to that about once a week
you know amateurs but really quite good
uh but that was interesting
uh but other than that i just didn't have time to go to the movies you know
never sho- any anyway anything that i ever wanted
cause the closest movie theater was barry saint edmunds
and who wants who wants to drive twenty miles to go to the movies
a lot of a lot of people did
but it would have to be a good show
i i us-
they they they have all these neat phrases
you know you know you know like critically acclaimed
oh i see
you know they can't
it's kind of like waterfront property or something if you're you know if you're two miles away from water
waterfront property here at love canal you know
but you know critically acclaimed
oh good grief
i mean there's a lot of reasons why i don't go to movies
and primarily i mean i now i'm probably going to going to upset you
but people who bring kids irritates the heck out of me
uh the guy called me
i'm in the middle of um going out for bids to have my house painted
uh painting is not hard to do uh
as long as it's not in not to the point of where it 's uh needs to be scraped and bl- peeling
and our house is not
but it's starting to bleed through and burn through because the paint's real cheap
and it's just a hassle to go through it
so i'm looking for the easy way out
uh i know
is easy to find pa- uh painters to do this for you
but you have to be you have to be aware of what uh how messy they can get and are they going to put on a good a good two coats and are they
uh interior's not so bad because it's more fun
well when we've painted um
so there isn't as much wood that has to be painted
um but i- it
the problem is that it hits the sun hits it
so preparing is a real problem
or else it will flake
so they put up uh a quarter inch masonite basically
and they painted it kind of like a spun of a sorts
so it's real cheap
and uh uh i've had thirteen hundred dollar bid and i as low as five hundred and forty dollars
oh there one guy brags about his piece of equipment he's using and the drop cloths and all that kind crap
and i'm so much worried about that as what
which might be a bigger problem than it would be uh
so y'all you haven't had any any jobs painted in your house or recently
we 've have uh done a little painting ourselves um
we painted the bedroom uh well within the last t- couple of months
and we have we have some more that need to be done
but the the problem that we've we've owned this house almost five years now
and um when we bought it the um it had been vacant for a while because the family will retired
but the daughter was a real estate agent
and she was selling it
and it's been lived in briefly by her before she bought her town house
so she told us that the house had been uh professionally painted recently
and it looked pretty good you know the uh the interior walls all basically white
but they obviously had been done without to much uh wear afterward
the only problem was when we started having the movers move the furniture in we identified various rooms by pieces of masking tape on the wood- uh the door frames
uh that's not very
so what had happened is that professional painters had not prepared the surface properly
and some of still has to be redone
oh they just painted over varnished wood
actually it had been uh it would have been it had been a repaint job
but they had not
or they hadn't really roughed it up or whatever they
because it was woodwork
so it looked as if it had been painted
correctly with you know uh an enamel or something
but um it had not
and it was greasy or something
it comes off in strips i mean not even little bit
so we still have some of that trim work to do because we put it off
because you almost have to strip the whole thing
so who is your favorite football team
well i would say the saints after
and i want to tell you something
and uh they
well i'm a i'm a buffalo bills fan
from a from a long time ago
so it's good to it's good to see the bills doing so well now
but um of course i watch every saints game that i can watch
but i think they're going to i think they're really going to do good because it seems like they're finally all
the the n f l draft really seems to be doing its job
because got teams like like buffalo who weren't certainly weren't a powerhouse uh ten years ago
and uh a few years ago denver was a powerhouse
and then they uh
and now the uh other team
and uh you see how
they're uh they're hurting
but they got so much bad publicity too
and i think that hurt a lot of you know
w- w- well yeah
uh firing tom landry and hiring jimmy johnson
what what kind of uh uh
any t- any team that tha- where the owner would fire tom landry you know is like one of the greatest coaches of all time
and just because they had had a couple of bad seasons
and you can't even attribute those bad seasons to bad coaching
because all the problems
i mean if you think about those years that we had the losing season of how bad
i mean his players were constantly getting kicked off the team because of drugs because of
uh you know messing with young children
and i mean it was just one thing it seemed like right after the other
and he alway-
and uh had a lot of trouble with injuries too
you know he'd uh never seem to be able to keep his guys healthy
and then even like uh what is it eric dickerson left
the team you know
you know like people were jumping ship right and left
and i don't know
but then the team was sold
but uh that jimmy johnson came in too though
and he just you know
when he bought the team and all and it just seemed like he just decided you know this is the way it's going to be
and it was bad
i mean it really was
because e- everything i mean anything that tom landry wanted or had he was going to change it
tha- i mean you know that's the way i felt about it
because look how good we did without a quarterback this year
see i can't even think of who the new orleans quarterback
had quite a few quarterbacks if you think about it uh
and then um i can't remember that guy's name the one that held out for the money
and he was across the river
uh i can't think of the i can't think of his name now
but really we didn't have a quarterback
and we had one guy that couldn't run
and it was it was just bedlam
it was uh defense w- w- won all the games
did they were they able to draft anybody this year
because you know they gave away a lot of their drafts
you know other places
so i don't know
i hadn't heard you know whether they have a new one or not
well when is the
hasn't has the n f l draft even gone yet
but i mean i don't know whether they have one of the first you know
i mean ye-
but i don't know whether they'll be far enough up where they can do any good
or even making the playoffs
so that doesn't doesn't help you in the draft
really i mean really and truly we just don't have a quarterback
but the players and stuff they finally quit giving away the really good players and started keeping them too
because we had some
well he was good
but we every time we'd get a real good player they'd treat him bad
and of course we had a different coach then too
but they'd treat him bad
and then he'd leave
or either they'd trade him off to somebody else for two of these nobodies
and it was weird
it was like they were trying if you were good boy let's don't have you on our team you know
but um this year they had all good players except for the quarterback
i think they played uh
but all of them were bad
i mean they were terrible
you know they couldn't even take handoffs
oh that's one it's one thing
i mean our defense was unbelievable
lucky though to have uh jim kelly than
and uh then with uh uh the defense with bruce smi- bruce smith there at linebacker there they've got a very well rounded team
and it seems that they've gotten over their bickering and their fighting as they problems they had in the past
and now they're uh really playing as a good together as a team
um do you watch it every sunday
i'm a i'm a musician
and uh the band i play in uh i
and uh the band i play in we tend to rehearse quite a bit on sundays
so i missed a lot of sundays during this
did you ever get to watch any of the uh new orleans games
i i'd have to confess i don't really scope out the new orleans games per se
but i don't like the broncos
and i lived in uh outside of boston for five years
and then my family lives in philadelphia now
and uh so i tend to look for uh uh
and i lived in detroit too
so i like uh
and then i'll uh normally check out the eagles or the patriots
and patriots were so depressing this last year that yeah that uh
but uh first and foremost the bills
i went to got to go to a bills game this year which was fun
it was the the bills eagles game which appropriately enough fortunately the bills won
and it was good weather
we beat buffalo in in uh was it third of december
oh my goodness
so we couldn't a done much better than that in buffalo
because usually it's snowing
but i tell you what
now i don't know how it will be this year you know
but i mean these games
it was like i was sitting on the edge of my chair you know going oh no no
and one uh
it was about uh
so we're watching the game
and we had like no we got the ball back
and they had to kick and uh to know whether we were going to win the game or lose a game because they got one point ahead of us
so we had to sit there you know
and they cut the show off and shorin- started showing us another football game
oh my gosh
i mean here everybody is sitting on the edge of their chair
and then they changed the game
and they changed it and gave us another game in the middle of another you know one that was going on
the station finally you know how they'll put the little message down at the bottom
an- because it was funny
i mean everybody was furious
we would be ahead you know
and it'd come right down to the end
and either we made it or we didn't
oh and it was it was something else
and the quarterbacks just didn't do anything
well that's the that's the guy that counts
but maybe we maybe we'll get your guy
oh i i don't think jim kelly is about to be swayed away from the bills any time
well do you think uh
i mean i wonder
the assumption is that it is a problem uh
and i've never actually had too many people explain to me why it's a problem though i have the same instinctual feeling that it's a problem
and uh but it's not clear to me that it is
um it's a problem if those voting don't represent the population demographically or in terms of their opinions
but if those who don't vote if you made them vote
and it those who don't vote would have voted exactly the same way you know in other words if forty percent had voted for that person and sixty percent for the other just like everyone who did vote it's not clear to me that it is really a problem um
um that's that's interesting
because i had thought
i ha- feel that it's a problem also
but i see your point on that
i mean i i assume that those who don't vote
i mean if you look at the break down of those who don't vote they tend to be you know
and i assume that they would vote differently if they were voting than your average voter
but i don't know if that's the case
uh i guess not
i'm i i vote religiously
um i guess i guess i'm a fan of democracy
that's right um
but it's funny because here in california things are getting uh increasingly democratically oriented in in the sense of people being able to vote for things
i mean we have these initiatives state initiatives now
the first really popular you know wide spread one was uh proposition thirteen which was a uh tax revolt
uh and you know now we're
and that was whatever ten years ago
and now we're up to proposition a hundred and fifty or something like that
i mean we've just
there were apparently voters who just threw up their hands after the last voters pamphlet because they were asked being asked to make decisions on topics that would have three different competing proposals
and you had to vote for you know yes or no on each of them
and no one could make heads or tails out of some of them
and it was incredibly complicated and difficult
and a lot of people revolted against that
you know that's that's that's why we hire people who uh you know to to make these decisions for us
i i kind of feel the opposite though
but they're not speaking for me
i wouldn't mind having oh more votes than i get to have frankly
maybe not in a in a deep philosophical sense but in a selfish sense it probably would
it's interesting uh some countries voting is obligatory
uh it is in australia for example
but i don't
well australia considers itself every bit as much a democracy as the united states
and it's not for me to say that they're not
um they they feel
i mean here you have the right to vote
and they simply define it as a duty there
you know we have just as we have a r- a duty to pay taxes you know
i mean we don't have the right to pay taxes in this country
and in that country it's a duty to pay taxes
and it's a duty to vote on how those taxes are spent
and it's not clear to me that that's so much less democratic
but part of me rebels against that
but then i'm an american
i it's that's it's complex question when you start thinking about it isn't it
and some people don't vote
i mean there is
and i think they're el- eligible for a fine
i don't know if they actually are fined or or what happens
but you're eligible for some sort of fine if you don't vote
and i think
i mean if yo- if you vote and your guy looses well you leas- you least tried
and you can say something
but if you don't vote i sort of feel like part of me and it's kind of a nasty part of me feels like well if you didn't vote you get what's coming to you you know
and certainly that's true in the overall
i mean no one individual that's true for but for the population as a whole
i sort of feel that way when they especially when someone they
and you know i say well you know voting for the lesser of two evils is still important
i mean you i mean it's it's funny because technically you do
i mean you have the right to do a write in candidate
but of course that's that's not really a vote
it rea- really doesn't
and so it's it's a complicated situation
but i would like to see
i i i'm i'm thinking of actually moving to australia
and and perha- perhaps i'll call you back and let you know what how the australian system works
i mean not because of the vo- i mean i'm not thinking of moving there because of the voting
oh i see
and uh i
i'm inte- are you a t i employee i'm interested
and uh so i'm i'm really quite quite curious how that would work to have both i mean you know
and i believe in the in a certain uh
soviet bloc countries you are are obliged to vote too
and that's what i think of when i think of you're obliged to vote
but when you actually really are given as much choice as you are in this country with its two party system um
and part of me likes the idea of having it be more of a duty um
well uh maybe they should
and perhaps they would be indoctrinated that this is their duty
well that's a thought
or certain privileges come from voting which aren't that important but are nice to have
that's see that's an example of a right not a not a
but technically people most people
but most people think of it as a right
i mean in other words if the government denies you driving denies you a drivers license people get very upset
but actually it's a privilege
and fortunately voting isn't that
maybe it should maybe it should be
except well except if you're a felon
i mean they will take away your right to vote under certain circumstances
um so gosh
so we don't have a great solution yet do we
um oh hamilt- i think it was hamilton who wrote number ten or something where he was arguing for a republican not in the sense of the republican party now
versus a democratic uh government and arguing successfully why the united states should be a republic not a democracy which indeed it really is a republic not a democracy
where he defines dep- democracy as everyone votes for the issues and republic is people who vote for someone who then in turn votes for the issues
and the whole idea was um presumably those who get voted in would be wiser than the average person and and a specialist and able to make more informed decisions and can protect against the tyranny of democracy
because just as you can have a tyranny of a single um you know bad ruler or something you can have a tyranny of the majority
and uh he makes a very uh passionate good argument for why you don't want some things decided by democratic process
because anytime you have a majority um they can change the law in a democ- a fully democratic process
and there are cases when you don't want that to be the case um
if there's some minority that people don't like because of you know racial hatred or something like that the majority can just simply vote again- vote against them
and cases like that he argues need to be constrained
and and actually i agree except that i don't trust the people who are appointed to vote
well i i mean i feel that i feel that wa-
well their job is to be reelected by in large
and so they work on that job
and there's also an antigovernment mood in the country you know where government is misspending your dollars
and and they're all fools
and you know throw throw the bastards out
and there's a notion that somehow if someone isn't as much as a government person they're less corrupt and they're more likely to be good which is really strange
because i mean if i'm hiring a plumber i want a real plumber
oh it's uh scaled back considerably
uh right now my exercise is pretty much limited to uh softball league and occasional ride on the bike
but uh i uh i was just recently well recently nine months ago got married and bought a house
so my outside activities have been curtailed a lot
that that's true
it's there's always something to do
and uh and and uh it keeps me going
well you're you are so far ahead of me
i used to uh i used to walk two miles a day
and i really enjoyed it
because the two miles went fairly quickly
and that's not stopping and talking to everyone along the way
but it's a lot you know
and i could sort all kinds of things out and make plans and everything
but i don't know what i did to my knee
and i mashed it wrong or i did something
and the doctor has had me on medication
and she doesn't want me to walk
she said that's you know while it's healing you're going to mess it up
so i can't walk
and uh she said you know the most conservative approach you do the medicine you do the medicine again and again before you think of surgery
and i don't want her to think of surgery on my knee
that that's a tough situation
that's that microscopic stuff you know
so i'm i'm being very good
but i miss it
it's so aggravating to uh to have an injury like that
my wife uh runs or likes to run
but uh she's
well we moved we moved down to the north end of oak cliff in the castle park area
and she started running down there and all the hills
and she lasted about two weeks
and her ankles couldn't take it anymore
she was used to running you know flat tracks and whatnot
and uh ever since that it's just been real difficult
and her ankles will start hurting again and stuff even if she does get on flat ground
so she's kind of in the same mode
she was all ready to get back into it and start running uh five k's and ten k's and stuff this spring
and she just hasn't been able to stick with the training schedule long enough to really get back in shape
and when you want to do it it's really really aggravating
you know it it's one thing to get motivated to start doing the exercise
and it's another thing to to already be past that and then not be able to because of your health
uh i don't really want to
and if i do it okay
but i will do it
uh it's not anything i would want to
but i can really tell the difference since i have not been able to walk
and you know you you don't spi- well
and uh it's really it's harder to get out of bed in the morning and all kinds of stuff
it your body just gets used to it
i i don't particularly enjoy it
well i i used to lift weights an awful lot and stuff like that
but as far as the working out and lifting and things like that uh i i can't say i really enjoyed it all that much
but once i got used to it it was habit forming
my body was was was uh tuned into that that mode
and if i if i skipped it then it kind of threw the the whole the whole system out of whack
hopefully my my knee is a hundred percent better
you're in you're living in the castle park area
uh just close to methodist hospital
oh in fact i lived there oh until nineteen late nineteen fifties
and that area is it changing back again
uh we're on we're on a little street called bison trail
but it's it's over on the other end
it it's over by the far edge of uh stephen's park golf course
oh i know exactly where that is
it's it's uh
uh our street is uh an awful lot of retired people
but the other half
and three sold the summer before
and everybody in their late twenties to mid-thirties are buying and and starting to rebuild and fix things up again
and everybody is real excited
oh that's that's wonderful
oh it's it's a lot of fun
and uh we have well we've got four regular parties every year
and we do a neighborhood recycling program and all that kind of stuff
so it's a lot of fun
and it is it's a really beautiful area
and some some of the people uh some of the higher dollars lawyers and stuff downtown too are picking up some of those great big houses
and they're they're getting them at a real bargain
they're they're getting four thousand square feet for a hundred fifty a hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars
and uh and they're just going to town with them
they're people are putting in pools and and completely redoing the outside restoring to the original you know nineteen thirty nineteen forties look
and it it's it's really coming around
it's it's worth the trip
oh i'm sure it must be
it was like a two story
well story and a half really because we had a basement
and the guy that built it was weird
and i just loved the neighborhood
and i mean everyone everyone had houses like that
and so neat
ours is kind of a little ranch style with a great big oh i guess it's twenty-eight by fifteen front porch
and and the guy moved in and completely redid
it's got oh it's got a rounded front on it
and he's he's landscaped his yard
and he's about ready to put in a pool and things like that
now why couldn't your wife run around the golf course
oh she could a little bit
and they have a quarter mile track there
so she has started doing that rather than uh rather than take off
and for her she can't run in the morning
and you know you don't want to
and there's somebody in the building watching her and all that
so there's a lot of consideration
i i really hear that you know
i think you know you're in oak cliff
but i'm in plano
and we live on one of those blocks that it's a neighborhood watch block
and the street doesn't go anywhere
and still i want to get up early in the morning and walk
and my husband had a lot of heartburn with that
i mean it looked darker to him because he he was in the house with the lights on
and even he was real concerned about that
so it's not just because you are in oak cliff
there's only one crazy out there you know to make any difference
you know it goes all over
well you got the
uh i want to talk about um our family budget
and you can help me out a little
well at the my-
i introduced you a little bit to it a few minutes ago when i said that we are uh we're on the east coast now
well we both decided we wanted to move to north carolina
and so naturally we put ourselves
and so what we did was draw up a budget that we thought uh was realistic
and uh so we had to make some adjustments
because we really are kind of looking for something that we want to do and he wants to do that's satisfactory
and we've been here seven months
and he's still hasn't hit up on anything permanently
so you see
well we actually planned for about one year
uh that god because
it never occurred to
and uh what we did was just uh decide wh- how we had been spending our money before
and then we put that on the computer
and then we took about three months and uh and adjusted
and we really uh lessened it uh our living expenses uh more than what we thought we would
or was this just your own design of
oh just our own design
so but we've had budgets that didn't work when our uh you know
so so tell me about
do you all uh have a budget
well we've been married for five and a half years
and we started out without kids of course and found it much easier to save and used to do a lot
but uh the
wh- wh- wh- wh- when we first got married we were in graduate school
and we were just you know dirt poor
so we virtually did that for about two years
and moved to texas bought a house immediately you know which of course is now devalued with the housing market
so i don't know if we
but at least we've got a place to live
um so now since uh we have a three year old and a two year old now um
that's that's that threw our budget really
an we um have been just forced to budget much more because i quit working to be home with the kids
and um we just really have uh
we we've tried different times
we've done like a survey of like taking you know the past three months of where all the money went
and we really don't spend on anything much of a luxury or anything at all
but it seems like there's um times when we just have to get out where we'll go and like get a baby-sitter and we'll go and we'll blow you know fifty sixty dollars in one night going out to eat going to a show or doing something you know
well i think that's important for your budget to be realis-
and then it's not really that realistic
because we do find that we want to go and do something or splurge for you know birthday for somebody
or you know even we we even do things real frugally for the kids
we get a lot of toys and clothes and stuff at garage sales or from friends because they don't know the difference at this age you know whether they're jordache new or whether they're
you know something
and they're both boys
so they just one year after the other in each other's clothes
so but um that's the hardest part for us is that it's really um you know budgeting and some extra things you know for- that are more you know nonessential items
well i found uh that in the place that it was harder for me to stick to a budget was not where we were concerned
uh we we tended to want to keep on giving lavish
and i really believe that if you're going to cut down on yourself you need to cut down somewhat on your
well we have so many unexpected things come up so often it seems with
and something will come up and wind up having to spend a thousand dollars you know on the car in two months or something
and you know a lot of things like that that really ar- are hard to plan for
well i really do
and uh that really should be in your bu-
but if you don't spend it it should be in your bank account at the end of the month
now i forget which way we do it
and then we get more money back you know at the end of the year
so that's not a good way to
so this last year he changed it of course
we didn't get hardly and then nearly as much back
and it was like oh no
well uh but i do realize that that is realistic for some people
and it was for us many years
uh and if and if that's the only way that will it will make you save and have a little nest egg at the end of the the year then doggone it that's what you should do
because we don't miss it
so but we're trying to put a little money away for the kids because we can en- envision the uh expenses for college already you know
well i was just reading an article in uh a north carolina pap- paper today where a high school student obtained over two hundred thousand dollars worth of scholarships for herself by sitting up at night and typing at uh letters of applications to universities
she was o- she was third out of a class of two hundred and twenty
so it can be done
where there's a will where there's a will there's a way right
well i have enjoyed talking to you
well i enjoyed talking to you too
and don't spend any money this weekend
oh i know
oh i like all kinds of books
mostly uh something i like like true life
not uh you know documentaries or real stories about real people and that kind of stuff or dramas in real life
and uh i also like romantic novels
i like uh i like readers digest believe it or not
you know that kind of a thing
uh as far as like real novels i haven't gotten into shakespeare or any of that type of thing
i wish i had in in some senses
but i don't have time really as much as i would like to to get into that kind of thing
um well i like like you said real life um
like especially like athletes
for some reason it seems to interest me like people that make a big comeback or
you know orel hershiser things like that
and um i like to read books on improve like family marriage you know things that are written by like christian authors or um doctors about family and you know how to improve your home and all that kind of thing
um i like to re-
but they usually have some good articles in it
but uh i don't know
i i'm more true you know
fi- uh nonfiction
i haven't found a lot of uh fiction books that i really like
but uh not to say i wouldn't
eventually i mean
uh i think it was a romantic novel by danielle steel or one of those
um i don't do as much reading like i say as i would like to
and then of course
so it's you know
you know that type of thing
i i set a goal for myself to read a book a month this year which is like about eleven more books than i would have read last year
but so far i've only read like two books
and so i'm not doing very well
but see i do crafts too
so it's hard
i if i have a minute that's what i i do
i let papers newspapers stack up and magazines stack up if i don't really set aside a time to look or read them
and and that's like myself
i've i've i miss it because i really find it a very relaxing hobby too
and um i don't know
it seems like you can get lost in a book you know
it it it's like an escape for me
if i'm really interested in what i'm reading i mean hours can go by
and i i look up at the clock and say oh my word you know
oh i would too
but i think you get out of the habit like you say
you have to like kind of set yourself
have you ever read uh or heard of the book this present darkness
and it's really fast paced and intense
it was a nonfiction book or is a fiction book
but it was ar-
i mean it was real good
and it was um it was one of the few books that
like it you know
just hurry up and go through without putting down you know
see that's the other problem i have
i'll stay up until two or three o'clock in the morning you know because i'm so engrossed in it
and then before you know it it's time to get up and go to work
i i don't know
i'm i'm kind of a nut when it comes to stuff like that
even if i'm uh doing something like an afghan if i'm close to the end sometimes i'll
i i really like books that that you can get into
and that's that
i have a lot of craft books that i have too and uh magazines
i like people you know those things that are about real people
and um i i like to uh read about people who have been a successful you know who who made a success of their lives
which what book have you read that is along those lines
to to give you specific titles i i can't
well how about who
like i say haven't done it in in such a long time
um well i went to uh seminar on uh
it was for by american business
and some of the people uh
he's one of the uh
and um it was more like oh
how he started out as just a salesman and now he's you know multimillionaire and that type of thing
and how you have to uh be aggressive and you know really want something for yourself and that type of stuff
it's like up to you in other words whatever happens in your life
and i find that fascinating that people you know can do that kind of thing just make up their minds that that's it you know have this one direction
and then do it
i i'm off in all directions
um and i'm not uh uh a planner which i wish i was
you know kind of off the wall
if someone says do you want to do this tonight uh and i got a mountain of things to do it's okay you know we do it
huh well that's all right
but i wish i was more the other way
you're more fun though see
see i like it that way though
i i i would i don't want to change that part of me
e- even though i admire someone who isn't
like i am you know and and i wish i could be more that way
uh about twenty
oh that's not bad
oh that's oh that's important
and um most of my family's in indiana
so i've only been in texas three years
i i loved i loved abilene too
boy they they have storms here
and it it it's so surprising how it just happens you know
oh i've been up here about three
uh we were down there uh from eighty-six to eighty-five to eighty-six
well part of eighty-four to eighty-six i should say
boy i had thirty-three hundred dollars damage done on my car
and he was telling me about it
oh well that's good
and well you know with the other part of this thing was how do you feel that this influences family
that that books influence
i i feel like it's important for young children to read too
when my children wer- were younger of course
and i have grandchildren now
they were uh
and uh i think they've all developed kind of an interest in reading also
but they do read uh where a lot of people don't have any interest in it at all
and i think it's important
because uh even today where people are so illiterate and they go off to school and really nothing happens i mean they don't learn anything
and that i work with
and people i mean
and things are misspelled
oh it's be- unbelievable
it's really it's pretty sad
a lot of people that work for me that can't even spell or read you know
and i think that that's why reading is so important
because uh i think even mentally when you can do some
guess we got our first uh credit card oh back in the seventies early seventies when
was a visa card uh issued out of a liberty bank in oklahoma city
because my sister worked at the uh the visa some bank americard center there
so we were still in college
and had she not worked there i'm not sure that i would have qualified
uh and they have become or also a a real bother sometimes
oh tell me about it
especially you know if you catch yourself short on cash or if you're on vacation
and uh i find if you're not careful you wind up uh a month or so staring those bills in the face
and you go i don't remember doing all that stuff
and it adds up
so sometimes uh especially traveling with t i
you know everything goes on american express
and it makes it a whole lot easier for bookkeeping
but uh as far as personal life goes i guess i really try to use them as little as possible uh
i kind of like having them for uh gasoline purchases
we like to keep one on hand just for emergencies you know
but other than that uh i i guess over the years tried to avoid the national credit card syndrome
and then then you really get socked to it if you don't watch it
how how do you look at counting credit cards
we just uh quit using them
and they got us in trouble
we keep them uh we keep uh one gas card and uh and uh visa just you know in case there's an emergency or
but other than that we don't use them anymore
well that's kind of the way we were doing
i guess for that very reason that that uh if you're not real conscious of what you're doing
well if you got a bunch of cards
and for some strange reason those people think they need to get paid
and i give them
maybe not maybe they're not really concerned about getting paid
and then some of them add late fees on it
i guess that's one of the motivations behind the the uh
the uh american express card with t i
there's no um late fee
there's no uh interest rate
you ei- you either pay the thing off
or they come get it
and it's turned into personnel
and they come get you
so they've got quite a bit more motivation i think to get paid then
but that's the one that your call center manager sees every month
so you're a little bit more careful about what you put on that
oh you can
oh i see huh
but it you know you kind of you know that somebody every month
and who knows how many people
are looking at those uh bills that come in and those statements
so yo- uh you want to make sure that uh is that okay
is that o- okay that those people see what it is that you are buying
and most of the time it is
but most of the others i've sent back i mean all you get is card offers
uh from gas companies and uh visa gold and uh some
and i usually just throw them away because i
oh i do too
you know you carry around a wallet full of credit cards
and uh one of these days it's going to all be full
she found an ad for one in like a good hou- housekeeping magazine for eleven percent
oh that's not bad
years ago well th- i had my visa card through this bank in oklahoma city for
oh probably fifteen years
and then they started charging uh annual membership fees
and i said adios i'm you know i'm not paying you
i mean they've been
i mean i mean they get enough you know on the interest
and they i guess they figure they've got enough people out there with cards
they're going to get cards at the
uh so then a couple years ago i found uh a bank here in plano that if you kept a minimum balance in any kind of account whether it was a savings account or what it was you can get a visa card through them and no annual membership
so i went over and just stuck three hundred dollars in my son's savings account in his name and got my visa card
i it would be okay
but i can't see paying someone to use their card
well i guess that's it
i say agree with you a hundred percent there
and and well it's gotten to a point where the schools are expected to take care of everything
if uh you've some kid who doesn't have uh who's from a broken family the schools are supposed to fill that void
it's gotten way beyond teaching
uh you know teaching classes and maybe providing extracurricular sports activities or something like oh were kind of traditionally the school's roles
because uh we're just having conversation on this uh with a couple of people yesterday
and i was expressing my frustrations that uh some of the so many problems i work in a high school are that kids don't have a a degree of self-discipline which may be reflected in society at large
uh and you can't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract uh sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home
um and it's seen more so because when you call parents up many parents won't even recognize that there is a problem
and and you wonder don't these parents know that teachers talk
and you know we do check with other teachers
and other teachers find the same things in this child
and you know how do you tell your parent's the parent hey wake up and smell the coffee
but um it it is a problem
and i'm not sure
whether maybe through a commitment of the p t a uh and the parents being informed better that in fact that the problems that are nationwide are problems um of society and that that the school can only do so much on it
well then then again when you have uh a society where a certain percentage of the parents are uh doing drugs in the home uh either unemployed and don't care about a uh just a have their own problems how how do you expect the school to um or how do you expect the
you can't really expect that parent who's quite frankly a loser in life as it is to to care about the the situation with their child
these are children that are born with low deficit attention deficit and gosh what's going to happen when these kids start coming into the school system
but there are i think there are a couple of areas where the school system can improve
and this is something that i see
and in fact they're not
and so they get put in in in our school system in a class that's limited for skills children that have really have to master skills
and that's not their problem
um at the same time i've seen we we have a an international population
so the school systems can improve both in standing up for splitting classes you know having learning dis- learning slow slow children in slow classes but not mixing them with behavior problems
and then you know the case where they put the behavior problems in the average classes
and then you throw in kids that are not motivated maybe bright but they're discipline problems
and you sometimes
you know the gifted and talented are fast classes
well i i've seen more uh incredibly intelligent underachievers than than uh
i personally i will i would take a person who's motivated and a little uh less intelligent than the person who uh is one of these very intelligent people who just kind of isn't motivated to do anything
well i not to toot my own horn here or anything but i i was graduated from my high school
and i know that there were a lot of kids that were an awful lot smarter than me
and they proved out late when it came time to take the s a t
but they weren't great
and uh when i got into college i struggled i struggled just to uh get my degree in the in the field that i was in
but they got motivated in college
and they did a lot better than i did
and when it
and you know as a teacher you you try to make be understanding that you know there are different ages
or is he a problem child
but teachers are asked to diagnose so much
um there i mean i mean we're have to be
we're alerted there's all sorts of systems where suicide uh predisposition
i mean we're alerted to what the moment we see something
if we see a child that we have any reason that's on drugs such as if he's got a beeper or if they're if they're flashing lots of money around we've there are certain things to do
i mean so tea- the school system's asked to do so much
but you can't operate in a vacuum
you actually have students with with beepers
this is a we're in a rather wealthy suburb of washington
and a student with a beeper immediately gets sent down to the uh principal
i mean where
i mean how
you know it's it's amazing
but uh you get all sorts you get all all sorts of things uh in the schools uh uh
and you know as a teacher you're alert you're alert for the kid who's very drowsy
you're alert to the kid who suddenly has a um behavioral change
and you refer them to the nurse
and so i mean you have to find out whether there's a legitimate reason
can you how can you
and parents frequently resent when you ask them is there a problem that we should be aware of
i i i was uh sitting in the barber shop
and i was having my hair cut and the barber got a call while i was there uh from his son's school
and his son was failing gym and uh and having trouble
but you know it's like uh this guy was like why now there's no problem with my kid
and basically he his answer was oh i gave him permission to to miss
and so many parents are facilitators
i mean they're manipulated by their children
i have uh a son who's a sophomore in college up in massachusetts at uh amherst
and my other son is a senior in high school
and he's going on to williams
and i mean they're really super
and where we've been very fortunate
but you know they had to be held accountable too
i mean you know at some point a parent does help their kid but in in some ways
but but you have to say at what point isn't the help becoming negative
and i think this is where the school system at is suffering and not through any fault of the effort of the school system
but gee it was good talking with you
so there are people throughout the country that feel the same ways that you do and and are connected with the schools
i've had interesting conversations on several subjects not uh not just this but different the different things
it's amazing how the you know people you talk to have some interesting conversations
and uh it's too bad that all this stuff is just being thrown into a data base and that none of the ideas or thoughts are being used at all
well we are though
well what movies do you like
we i think the last one we saw was uh teenage mutant ninja turtles part two
oh now i lo- i like the turtles
and he loves them
well we don't have any kids
but we like them anyway
um we're late twenties
oh and you just don't have any yet
well i've got two
and my little boy just turned four
but he's a turtle fanatic
but i've been wanting to see turtle two
we were just when when the topic came up we i was asking my husband right quick what's the last movies we saw
he said well ghost and turtles
but that wasn't too bad on tearjerker
it was oh it was good movie
because that was just so good
and i like demi moore
but i've been hearing a lot about it
i don- we don't get to the video store very often
and we don't have cable
well we don't really want cable
it's just you know glued to the t v all the time anyway
so we get two channels down here
and we used to get five channels without cable
you know forty
well i don't think you all have the same channels
but here in texas we only get two channels
and that's um
uh once in a while when i'm home
well we get the channel with young and the restless on it
and then uh i think general hospital
and that comes on different channel
but that's all we get
and that's no cartoons for my little boy
but we've got a v c r and a lot of tapes
and uh my husband is a movie fanatic
it was it was really a
oh what about total recall
i i was disappointed in it just because of how violent it was
my little boy oh he loves robo cop
and that movie i have to i'll fast forward it every time they come to the part where there is
that oh that's horrible
and their their the language on that's filthy
i mean i mean n- everybody knows that it that the the language is there so they could just ignore it and you know
but i i think lately pretty woman's been my favorite
um my husband bought me like um uh
uh he bought me pretty in pink
now you're glad you ain't got a four year old
it this is the first time he's interrupted my phone calls
now now i haven't seen pretty in pink
that had um does that have
but it wasn't
i like the um sixteen candles or sixteenth birthday or
i think i think sixteen candles was the name of it
oh that was so good
and i loved it
oh well if you like love stories it's sweet
oh it's sweet
and that's a tearjerker
i mean it makes you feel really sorry for her
but it's hilarious too especially with that uh little guy in it
oh he looks like little i don't know he looks like a little boy next door
but he's sixteen
oh it's a cute movie
huh i don't know
i was just thinking another good one i saw not too long ago was um sleeping with the enemy
but i can't remember it
that that's that's julia roberts' new movie
and and this one was a lot more dramatic
like sort of
it was like uh it was a it was a mystery
she disappeared from her hu- uh husband who was abusing her
the yeah that's the one i wanted to see where he was on she was on a carnival at a carnival on a ferris wheel or something
well did that come on t v
or did it come out in the
and i think you know around here it's all ready quit playing
but i don't i don't know if it's still playing any where else
well i i think
but it was it was it was one of those that kept you on the edge of your seat
i seen the uh previews for it on t v down here
but it's just been down here a couple weeks i think
because we saw it probably
well i know it hasn't been that long since i've seen the previews for it
he's uh he was a real psycho in the movie
it was it was scary
oh i'd like to see that
what about oh
boy i i didn't like it
well the only reason i know why it ended is on arsenio hall one night christopher reeves told
that you know
or or who was it
might have been michael douglas oh that starred in it
well arsenio hall is the one that jumped up and said that i can't believe they killed them
and christopher reeve or mike douglas went after his throat you dummy
so i know that they die
but i haven't told my husband
it was i i it was it was weird
and they marked off routes that they could go or something
but well i- mi-
and one bathroom is at the end of one side
and one's in the middle of the other
so we could do it
and he could climb out the window
and we our whole house has you know
so we can you know yeah
i know it's going to be on on the on c b s tuesday night
an and that's kind of what in a way you know how it kind of bothered you the way it ended and stuff
parts of parts of war of the roses was funny
but then other times it was like it was just deadly serious
and it just left you with this kind of uneasy feeling you know
or i want to see it though
i'd like to see that and uh the never ending story came out on disney this month i think
i i've heard about that
but i don't know what it's about
but oh it's good
i mean they're some of the best of that are made
and uh well it's about this little boy who uh
and he got scared
but he starts dreaming
and then uh he's saving the land of uh oh
all i know all's i can really remember is him flying this great big dog this great big huge sheep dog sort of looking thing
and he's trying to save the land from some ooze
but it's really good
i mean it sounds ki-
it it had uh fred savage in it
with uh oh
he had uh uh
oh it was the princess bride
that was real that was a good one
i i like i like slapstick comedy
and a lot of times we'll go to rent a movie or something
and and you're not sure whether it will be any good or not
well i heard
and she said that was hilarious
now we saw that
and i- and they're coming out with a sequel to it
and said it was real good
and and working girl is really good
now i seen that
that that just reminded me of that
well we try
i mean it's a big mortgage in the sky
and someday maybe we might even own it
but um for all practical purposes i guess we hold the mortgage
so that implies ownership
well we have we have had this one for five years now
before that we lived in garland uh probably about you know four blocks away
it's a uh
but it is a residential homeowners
so there's a lot of you know activities a lot of pluses and common land
but uh we thought we were buying at the bottom of the market you know
and so we were wrong
oh five years ago
it bottom out about a ye- year later
i mean just recently i would say i would give it two years back when it was i think bottomed out
oddly enough two years you know
i uh i think that
but maybe not in your area
see it was just different areas
not in in uh this area
cause this is about like the
besides it's you know
it's it's richardson
and hold on a second
well i hate to say how long that will last too
this area up here is uh all custom homes
and we were not the first people the first owners
so they just watched the water pour in on the carpet
but the houses here in in this class of housing never dropped below two hundred
and i think somebody told me it's also on a creek side lot
and the guy around the corner is being transferred
so he said uh well he did comparables that it's about
so i think the high end is definitely
well try and think if it was a hundred dollars a square foot
because this house has around thirty four hundred square feet
and it would never sell for three hundred forty thousand dollars
now maybe you know that's pretty close to what it would have sold for uh brand new
or that's pretty much what it was built for
but you know i don't think i think it's going to be a long time if ever when nice things and really quality construction and all the other additional amenities
it's seems like people go for square footage only now and uh
i just see him as trying to squish as much space you know as much house into the space as possible
they are you know
i was i was in one today
well see that's
because there's just the two of us
and the two cats um can yell at each other from one end to the other and be heard
and we thought that was important instead of getting
see when you have kids you like to be able to
but i have been watching these houses go up
and i i don't well
and i i don't think they exceed more than twelve nails per house
and it takes them something like thirty days to complete a house
oh that's amazing
and these guys are phenomenal
they just they they are doing such a terrific job back there
i mean you know you pay for it too
but it's it's like really worth it
and it's just they are doing such a fine fine job
and uh the house is built around the trees
and with these decking that a corporation and a large area for the trees to come up
so it's real real shady
but what i was going to tell you these perry homes back there
and they are you know they are used to the virginia area metropolitan d c
my god they come down here and those houses that that look the colonial look what the
and uh the idea of ever owning anything that has four thousand square feet in it for less than two hundred twenty thousand dollars
because those things are selling like hot cakes
but one of the people that was living back there was telling me that there is his air conditioning bill per month last summer was in excess of five hundred dollars a month
and i thought
and he was talking about how you keep up with the utilities here
and i was thinking well you know i know why your god damn bill is so high
it's because there's not a there's no insulation
what a trap huh
any yet you know
they they show very well un- they show very well unless you have you know lived in a lot of houses around the area
and i think that makes a big difference
but i like i like this area
and everything that i have been saying
oh i do too
but still um it's worth it for the area and for the school and things like that
you're in you're in the
i i think that plano has really done a fantastic job
i mean at least their plans have are good
um how- however i was
maybe you saw in the paper this morning that um they've had some problems with
well i just i thought it was sad that they it
and i and that concerned me that people were using it as a way to get rid of things they just didn't want to set at the curb or take to the dump
and and uh
i it's too bad that people have to ruin
well i was thinking about the other day um when i when dick and i were oh many many years ago when we were first married and he was in graduate school in
i was probably this was probably
see it have been like nineteen sixty-seven or sixty-eight um
we i went to a meeting
and uh one of the the speakers at the meeting was a woman who was recycling
and she had this fantastic um family effort in in recycling
and she was dividing her colored glass and her plastics
and i thought wow i mean how one person is doing that you know
but my my thought was it's a shame
i mean it's wonderful that she's doing it and it
but wouldn't it be mu- much nicer if we all did it
because her effort would have really um really uh been a good example for all of us
and yet you know and we were just sort of talking about it at the time
and here we are you know
city wide basis in in communities
so it's wonderful that we've come that far i think
if if she
or was she doing it on her own
uh things herself uh
and so it wasn't you know something that was being picked up
or um and i think she was encouraging other people to do it if they would
but i remember her saying yes i have a trash can for this and a trash can for that and a trash can for the other thing
you you have to really want to do it though
even even what you recycle
because we we do the the plastics and the and the aluminum
and um and of course then you know you try to buy right too
um a lot of our neighbors say well what you have to rinse out this and you have to make sure it's that
it's uh we we had neighbors that complained when we got the new garbage cans
and i thought what are you complaining about
well you know
when you're only going to get picked up once a month you know
i under- i know what you're saying
well it's for everybody's benefit
well sure it is
i mean it's it's not
so maybe we don't realize it in our lifetime
but we you have to think grandchildren
and and the and i have a real concern about that
because wh- while
and and gene's family wasn't big
but they weren't rich
and they had to to recycle
and and you know the fu-
well they didn't
well i know um
because she was always
and she is to this day
and you know i mean she'll even
um if she
for instance she she would take the waxed paper out of a cereal box and use that for you know when she made cookies
if she needed to wrap something for needed uh sandwich paper or something she'd use that
she just she recycles everything
and i have done the same thing
i recycle like zip lock bags and
i mean they i think they give me a hard time
but i think they know that that's it's the right way
well they do
and when they actually get out away from the home
and they appreciate how much it costs to do that
th- and then they say well hey you know mom used to do this and dad used to do that
and pretty soon they're they're figuring out that's not such a bad way
well i don't know you know
i i wonder how how you instill in people the necessity for doing just a little bit extra to to make this whole thing work i mean the extra like washing out bottles and jars or the extra of actually uh making sure that uh you take stuff over to you know
some people are compl- now are complaining because the stuff isn't picked up at the curbside you know
and i think golly moses you just do your part
you know people are not
you you you can't be waited on all your life and expect things to always ha- work ou- out
well see this this is what concerns me
you you've got to be in a country
even in in mexico
i mean what we throw away is is a ransom a king's
and even to people in our country
and and and i i think you have to get into a period of need
this is uh i this is why i thought jimmy carter was never very po- very pos-
you know people didn't like him
because he tried to say
and and uh
the pe- i nobody wanted to hear it
it's i you know
or you have to grow up with it being im- important in your life
um oh oh um before the message really takes hold sometimes
and um i don't know
i mean like i i'd go to the um to the u t d um cafeteria for lunch sometimes and they use styrofoam plates when they wouldn't
you know and i think to myself that's that's crazy
i wonder if you know maybe i need to bring that to someone's attention you know
and and uh i'm seeing more and more of that
and and i think it's uh just mcdonald's effort to reduce the number of of styrofoam uh boxes that they use
i think is a good good example you know that even
i i think the big question too we're looking at is would you be willing to pay more for a product
well i think that may that's kind of what it's coming to i'm sure
that's that's right
and and uh do we have to wait until all the landfills
or and i don't
that isn't that isn't harmful
that doesn't wouldn't surprise me
or they will go dump it out in the middle of some ocean
and it's sad
well hal what's uh what's crime like in dallas
well it depends where in dallas you are
because it's the situation
it is very location dependent and there are parts of town here where when they talk about the nightly gunfire
uh i live on the outskirts of baltimore
and uh we live right outside the city
and our neighborhood is pretty much working class people though i'm in graduate school uh
but you know we have uh
it it's really funny
the only crime we really see is uh just the kids being malicious
you know and i think most of that is because their parents aren't around
that uh the what they call the latchkey children
no one's you know
or or fathers are just missing you know
so there's no uh no consistency there in the home or whatever
there's no one to tell them what's right and what's wrong you know
the sort of on my end is more of the upper middle class
so i think our uh
not that we don't have a certain amount of local problems but on the other hand uh we get the uh affect of the uh the city
and uh the main crimes within the suburb here are the the theft crimes
uh well if we have one murder a year that's probably as many
but then you know you go into dallas and they are unfortunately uh having murders at a rate greater than one a day
i think that's we're about the same in baltimore
though uh washington i think is uh close by
and you know they experience a lot more
i think they definitely have more problems that uh in in the area
what what do you think can prevent crime
well the thing is i don't
it's one of those things where if you're a grad student you can appreciate the statistics on unfortunately there are often these correlations that are inverse of what they should be like uh wherever there are more uh criminals there are more policemen but that's which came first
but on the other side of it is
it's it's basically the the problem is within the in the society and the society's views
and well uh since now i'm in my mid-forties when i was in grad school or when i was an undergraduate growing up in a more rural area i thought you know crime was was reasonably unknown and just the situation that's developed with the the drug
aspect of uh uh the pushers the dealers and the addicts uh
i i i think i agree with you there
because it just was not uh something back in the sixties that uh i even had to worry about
but i think you know that there is a lot in the society where things have changed
uh so it's effected all of us
i think they the drug culture definitely has uh is one of the main problems
our uh our mayor in uh
he gets on national television and and says that you know
so it's uh
and he was a d- d- a district attorney before and a prosecutor before becoming becoming mayor
so that's a really stran-
you know it's a different viewpoint
you know in a sense i don't i'm n- i have real mixed feelings on that because it comes a bit from the angle that the uh uh
it would certainly be an interesting test but the other side of it to me
well the other side is that unfortunately some of the down side
and i think if i look back fifty or a hundred years i'd say you know back then there were the opium dens but the thing is if somebody ruined their life uh society didn't try to then save themselves from it
they let this person who had ruined it uh become well die or whatever
i mean they probably became weakened physically and other things to the point that their life expectancy was real short
but now we tend to believe somewhere in the health care system otherwise
we need to take care of people even if they have you know physically ruined themselves
yeah and so to me that's
i uh i would certainly like to see a real test of of making drugs real cheap to see if when you make them available people then don't use them
well i think you know they did that in alaska that that actually alaska just recently legalized marijuana
but i never i never heard results or anything like that
so i never you know
plus that's such a that's not a true uh
you know so that but that was interesting you know
i i don't
crime is one of those things that's uh
i i don't know you know
the uh the uh you know
i i see it with the kids in the neighborhood just stealing things not thinking anything wrong with it
well th- some of that
and of course i'm a baby of the old school but it it bothers me from the fifties on
but but basically we have so much more of the something for nothing mentality
and so they in the
but nowadays there's so much on tv where where people seem to have the idea they can get something for nothing
of course uh i work for lawyers a lot
and i see unfortunately we have this whole mentality that somehow there are these pots of money out there that you can sue somebody and you know there's a million dollars you can have uh for mental duress or whatever
but you know the other thing that bothers me in the crime is the uh
and drunk driving is a good one
in this country and for example with alcohol or with drugs is we don't seem to understand how to handle it as a society to say okay it is okay under these circumstances but if you step outside these bounds the punishment is extreme
that i think that uh the drunk driving has just actually just caught on
a- and i i i really uh
my father was hit by a drunk driver when i was in high school and uh that was a very uh that that was an awful three years afterwards you know of recovery and the difficulties and uh everything we did
and you know the guy went free because this was twelve years ago thirteen years ago
his father was even the uh police chief of the town
so there was no repercussion at all you know other than insurance
but he was uninsured
so uh our insurance paid for everything
but it was a very difficult time
and and then later this was actually funny my brother and i were picked up by the police for questioning because this fellow had bought a a new car
and somebody had taken like a baseball bat to it and broke all his windows and his lights and his dented it everywhere
and they came and questioned us
you know and
but that kind of shows how our attitude toward drinking and driving was uh misplaced for years that you know it was an acceptable social behavior
that those are some important points
that's those are
what are what does your city have for gun control if anything
well see maryland is one of the most
we just voted in uh gun control strong gun control here in the state of maryland
i i think
well the weather has been certainly has been hot
and it's been humid
i don't remember a year in a long time that the humidity has stayed up this high for uh this late into uh
well it's not really late into the summer
but the the humidity has hung around all of june
but i've been i've been in texas for fifteen years
so uh but you know i know the summers get hot
but it certainly uh
it seemed like well you know last year was so strange having all those heavy heavy rains in april
and this year we really didn't have heavy rains until may
and now it's kind of lingering with kind of still a bit of humidity
and it just tried to rain
i mean i was coming in from my car just a few minutes ago
and it was trying to rain which seems strange to have it raining in july
normally we don't have too much uh humidity or or uh rainy time when it's past june
oh that's right
you get those great big cracks in the ground where it's been so dry and it just gets so dry
and the earth opens up
i can remember the first year i moved here and it didn't rain
i moved here like in late august
and it didn't rain from august until december
i mean it was great after growing up in michigan and not and al- you know every day was cloudy
and i you sort of forget how much it did rain
and coming here and then it didn't rain
see i i lived in uh ohio mainly
i lived in uh pontiac just a little while before i came down here
and you know so many times when you were trying to schedule outdoor activities you just never knew if it was going to be a go or not because of the weather
you know and here it was like pretty much you could schedule some activity outside anytime
and you really didn't have too much of a chance of it getting rained out
oh i grew up in dearborn which is a suburb of of detroit
oh a teaching job
so you teach in plano schools
i did i did for a while
so i'm home with home with two children
new career new career
but uh anyway
so that kind of uh
well i had been down here to visit
so i school and said hey let's you know find a place that has a nice job
and uh that's how it worked out
i think a lot of people were uh leaving michigan all about the time i came here in the early eighties
and it seemed like it was almost a mass exodus
you know the the little joke about will the last person leaving michigan just turn out the light
oh well it's a nice place you know
i mean it's it's a nice that's a nice place though
well you know i i said i lived in uh the pontiac
uh i forget the the county
but you know where all the lakes are around there
it was only like four miles to work
and it was wonderful being on the lake like that
you know in the summer you feel like you're you know on a vacation all the time because you're right on a lake
and everybody's you know out enjoying the water and such
and uh in the winter time the lakes froze over
but i thought it was just really neat to be out there on all those lakes
you know like maybe a mile two long
that's enough to uh do some boating and it was lots of fun
lake i think lake whitmore is the only one i have real memories of
well i think it's i think it's toward ann arbor
so it's probably out in that direction
but that's the only one i probably could name after all these years
so but uh
but it was yeah just lots of little lakes
and of course it was you know a little more expensive to live on the lake
but i just thought that was grand
and i think a lot of people didn't really know that there were all those lakes out there unless you were from that area and kind of spotted them
but there was quite a few lakes all around there
it seemed like it was almost like you were living on an island
i was way out to the west maybe four or five miles from from the city limits
and it was really nice out there
we had uh pine knob you know to go skiing and stuff
so there were things around there
and d- isn't that where they have a summer music festival there too
and in the winter time they make snow and have a ski slope
we we didn't do a lot of it
but we did we did
so those are always fun
and alpine was it alpine was another ski slope that we went to
my dad would kind of bank up the snow in the backyard and turn the hose on you know make a pond in the backyard for us
so but uh you know we probably did some ice skating on it
but then it chipped chipped
and you know it would melt or whatever and get pretty uneven
christmas time uh some of our relatives would come up from alabama
and i think most times we would have snow around christmas
and the kids when they were young would just go nuts
you know because they were from alabama where it never snowed and they just had a grand time watching the snow and getting out there and playing in it you know eternally
i i came down in uh early eighty-two
and there was just a freak snowfall early one morning in december be- couple days before christmas
like by noon it was gone
and i remember getting up and somebody telling me hey better wait to go to work because the roads are all you know snow
and i was laughing going yeah right that's a good practical joke
and there was but a very short time
and the weather got warm so quick it just melted it all away
course when we get an ice storm that's not too much fun
so uh i i just as soon have all the slushy snow on the streets than have the ice on the streets
so but uh well we have
so uh we get the sled out
and uh the kids go down the hi- the hill on the sleds when it's icy
i mean they just go down the ice
i mean sometimes the ice is pretty bad
but if you get on the the uh grassy kind of part you get a little bit of traction you know not slip and fall
i mean first
well i don't feel very good about it
but i think that at some times it can be the right thing to do
and so as
because he was either in a nursing home or a hospital or something else that he would have been spending most of his time in those days
and what type of recommendations did you have when you decided where to place him
um well the see uh well
we he wanted to get into a mennonite nursing home which is very popular and hard to get into and had like a ten year waiting list right
we wound up just choosing a another mennonite nursing home that was easier to get into
or but naturally
i'm sorry it was actually not a particularly great nursing home
so the convenience
uh what do you think
my grandmother lived with us um until august um
and we made the decision to put her in a nursing home
she has leukemia and her the rest of her family and her regular doctors and everybody she trusted and knew was in dayton and were several thousand miles away so i made the decision to put her in a nursing home
and my sister being on the other end found one that she could have what was called an independent living facility
she had her own little room and didn't have to share it with anyone and could bring in her own chair and t v set so
and that the other major factor is that she needs blood transfusions every week to ten days and would have to be hospitalized a day or two
so in this facility they can do it right there from her own room so she didn't have to be transported back and forth
so she's been there since august the thirteenth and seems to have adjusted pretty well
but when it got to the point i was spending more time at the hospital with her
right so that
and i've got little children here who needed me here she needed somebody to watch her twenty-four hours a day
and that becomes difficult then
and you know all kinds of physical problems
so it just became too much for me to handle
but he was essentially too proud and too independent so that even though his heart was getting incredibly weak and his knees were going bad he lived in his own house as long as he could but he was living alone had an upstairs apartment could barely make it up the steps to the top without a great deal of pain
eventually things just went too far and he allowed himself to be put into a nursing home
well i think sometimes when people get to be a certain age other people have to kind of help them make decisions
but she's accepted it real well now so
right well that's yeah that's right that the children have some responsibility too to their parents and such to help decide what's the right thing
well we enjoyed having her here
but we feel she's much safer where she is now
but when she does there a nurse is right there to help her and i know she's eating the right things
and her doctor's right there where he can come in and check on her
so it became dangerous for us to keep transporting her back and forth in the car because she was so wobbly and needed a walker or a wheel chair so i think she'll adjust
while i was waiting for you to connect i i thought of a couple of menus
so i decided it had to be in it informal or not
you know if it's informal i'd probably choose something i mean just like hamburgers or steaks out on the grill
um if it was formal i'd probably go with something like a chicken breast or lasagna or something
but i'd probably go with lasagna a green salad and garlic bread
so what do you use for cookbooks
but it's kind of the bible of cooking for me
then i have some from like church that are more family recipes that are more useful
you know budget cookbooks
but and of course you get a lot from when you're growing up
um i cook a lot the same as as my mom did
but what you serve or what would you
well i i i think we come from from different backgrounds uh
well that's good
i i i
so it diff- you know
i find the joy of cooking to be a remarkably useful book to to fall back on
because it has almost everything in it
but on the other hand it's not very inspiring uh
i think that's the title by marion burroughs uh which has recipes which allegedly can all be prepared in thirty minutes you know the whole meal and so she's yeah
now now i i find that the cutting up of the food and all that really makes it take a little longer than thirty minutes
but they're but they're but they're interesting they're interesting menus um combinations that you wouldn't have nobody thought of
the one i had most recently was was one that was ha-
she she describes as jim beard's favorite um summer menu or something
and it consisted of of grilled kielbasa sausage uh a potato salad with olive oil and uh some tomatoes that had been chopped up with onions and curry powder and probably some yogurt was in there
uh and that and that was you know that's that that's certain you can do in thirty minutes
but there are a whole lot of you know
i mean i i would recommend you look at that book if you're a busy person
i find a lot of the cookbooks that i don't know that you buy over the counter ask for really strange ingredients or things i don't keep on hand all the time and i have young children
and our budget's set you know at this time
but i want to use simple recipes that i have things on hand
that's why sometimes i shy away from uh more of a traditional cookbook but
well you had said dinner you know you know
we we had some friends over as recently as saturday night and and um put here here
the inspiration was a combination of julia child for the dessert you know a chocolate mousse recipe and a sort of cookbook which has a recipe for a thing called chicken marabella um which is this wonderful thing you can do um
basically you're baking baking chicken in a in an open pan um having marinated it first
and my wife did this part so i don't remember all the details marinated in olive oil and some seasoning um and cooked with some olives and some and some prunes uh
and it bakes up
and it's a delicious thing
and it's easy comparatively
um i'm sorry
well maybe a little more leisure time to do it
yes that's probably that's true
and we and they won't eat you know too many different foods right now
well there again sometimes it was easy
they'd you know
well nice talking to you cheryl
uh we have two sons
uh one's a freshman in college
and one's a sophomore in high school
and i spend most of my time carpooling
and my son plays football
we 've spend a lo- spend a n- did spend a lot of time uh
it really helped when the uh older one was old enough to get his license and could uh drive around by himself although that brought in a whole n- other set of problems
but uh i uh fo-
we uh we do
but our two had had uh totally different interests of
but the- there was not much uh overlap as such
the the older one is not was not at all into uh sports for the most part
uh he participated
band and and uh scouts were his two big things
and uh and the yeah younger one is uh uh the sports one
and the whatever season it is he's he's playing
so uh yeah
we spend a lot of time uh uh carpooling and uh you know and then trying to be uh up as much as possible with anything that they that they do
but then uh we also didn't do spend uh
uh you know just family time
and and uh uh but we didn't uh do it as much or as often as uh i would have liked to
i would like to do that as a as a family and and some t v watching
i've i've heard of that
i've never actually never actually played it
well it's really fun
um one of my neighbors moved here from memphis
and a lot of them played it
and she started a group going in the neighborhood
and my kids wanted to learn how to play it
and it's more fun with four people
and it's a game that none of their friends know how to play
and they both enjoy it
so if they want to play they have to play with mom and dad
so uh we play that a lot of them
and uh we like to go miniature golfing and to movies
so we go visit both sets of grandparents and and take car trips
and my husband and son go camping with scouts mostly
my daughter and and i hate camping so we go shopping
so that just kind of works out real well
and um i'm a writer by profession
and my daughter enjoys writing too
so a lot of times she and i will travel to writers conferences together
oh now that's neat
so that gives us special time together too
and she's on the yearbook staff and things like that
so i can help her with that
and she gives me ideas for my writing too
oh well good
well i you know in terms of in terms of any sorts of trends i you know
obv- obviously things are different from for me than and my children than when i was growing up
i i i grew up on a farm uh in iowa
and uh you know the whole family was around the the whole time
and then what my father did was was uh in- you know obvious to me
and i i helped out with it
but uh although i have brought my boys into
and it's it's certainly not at all common
and they they just don't really have that same idea
so th- they uh
it's a it's a whole different uh kind of thing there then uh
and we still don't know what he does
so that kind of covers it
well that makes it hard though for in terms of you know family time with with him
i've been lucky in that respect that i don't uh don't travel too much
so those are the real killers
and that's that's mild compare to the big ones
so we just you know i just do the carpooling and and handle whatever needs to be done
and something major
so you just have to to handle it until he gets home
and hopefully he won't have too many surprises when he gets home
well let's see
so what so what gets you
well the thing i think that annoys me the most is i have i have young children a baby in the house
and and inevitably as soon as they're asleep someone calls on the phone trying to sell me something
and i think that that is probably the most aggravating
uh you know it invades my time
uh if i want to buy something i'll take the initiative and and go find it you know
and that just really does
uh what do you think
well i mean i
and just as we're preparing dinner or eating dinner the phone rings
and it's one solicitation call after another
and you know
your time is is valuable
it's it's like you say very annoying
and uh why why do we let this happen
that's that's interesting
the the market seems to just be growing too
i i guess enough people are not speaking out
would would you
i mean if you could legislate something what would you legislate
i'm i'm not into
i just i do particularly find it annoying
i haven't given that a lot of thought if if it should should go you know
it it seems it seems to me that we should have the ability to designate with the phone company that we don't want to receive calls like that
well that yeah that might
and the people making these calls would be obliged to c- compare the their lists that they're going to call against this list of people who don't want to be called
well that would be a good an interesting way
and that that way those who want it can have it
and those who don't want it don't have to have it
oh is that right
oh that's interesting
and they just get everybody
well i i do wish that it would stop on my end because it it seems to happen at the worst possible moments
and i i guess the next one is is door-to-door solicitors
and you know that's just kind
but when it's adults selling a variety of things and especially when men arrive at about ten o'clock in the morning uh that really it makes you not feel particularly safe and it's annoying as well
and these and these people may in fact be just looking to s- find an unoccupied house to rob
you just you really don't know
so i i find myself being a l- a bit abrupt and a little bit ruder than
what about these telephone callers sometimes they're door-to-door but usually they're telephone callers who who want you to basically help them fill out a questionnaire
well i think these people were hired by from from different sources
uh with you know
and so therefore there's no one answer
but but yeah
sometimes it's a market sur- basically it's a market survey but they never say who who they're really working for or what
there have been a couple of times when the the uh whatever the subject was i guess caught my interest and i went along with it
and then there have been several times when i just said well i just really don't have the time you know to deal with it at that moment
but uh i don't get too many of those
uh generally someone's trying to sell me something
well and sometimes that's this is just the lead in to a sales pitch too
but but a dollar isn't it
you know it's
uh and i also sort of worry that you know that sometimes people giveaway personal information
and so i start answering
and then you you know you go down a path uh and you don't know where it's going to end
in fact you don't even know what you've eventually you know the totality of what you've revealed
and you know
this isn't you know prob- most likely not to going to be used against you
but it could
and and that seems to be something that should should really be outlawed
asking for information is is
i think they ought to if if nothing else they ought to spend money for a postage stamp
and you know when it arrives at your house oh i
well uh we live in a a brick home in far north dallas
and it's uh four bedrooms and three and a half baths and swimming pool in the back
well it sounds like ours are pretty similar
and mine's about twenty-seven hundred square foot
but the four bedrooms
and all the rest of it sounds just about
so you've been there longer
we built this one about uh
and we subcontracted it out ourselves
we bought the lot and uh had an architect draw the plans based on our specifications and then we subbed it out
well i bet you
so we've been here a little over six years now and uh have really enjoyed it because we built what we wanted to have to live in
he ha- we have a three car garage that he has a big work area in and he likes to rebuild cars and redo engines
and so he has all the work space he needs
well that sounds interesting
i bet he's enjoyed having it that way because some-
kind of hard to find one prebuilt that 's kind of fits those specifications
and that's why we decided to build
we looked at things that were already uh built
and the garages were always if the house w- was large it seemed like the garages were small even if they were three car garages which is what we have
well then most of them don't have a three car garage
so we put a three car garage in
but even if they had three car garages they didn't have a work space
and so he has a big
my we've just got a two car garage
but my husband's got a big space in between the where the cars are and the house where he has a big work shop you know workbench and everything
well sounds like our husbands have similar interests
now mine does not work on cars
oh i see
but he likes to have a spot to keep all of his his piddling things
well that's nice that it's not in your house
because you know they have a lot of things of their own
and i you know i wouldn't mind having
and i at one time was going to fix up when one of my daughters left a bedroom to where i had a room to just put all of my craft stuff and sewing machine and all that kind of stuff
but i someone
so i didn't end up with my vacant room like i had thought i would
well we still have a a son and daughter in college that come home
and the other room we use as a guest bedroom because my husband's family
and also the kids have friends who come and stay
and so it seems like it's always used as a bedroom
well i still
and some of them coming back home and things you know
oh i understand
and we've got grandchildren now
so when they come they have to have a place
and you don't want them to not be able to come because there's no room
i c- i haven't reached that point yet
but uh my middle son is engaged
so he could afford to get married but is not engaged yet
and my daughter's been going with the same boy for a while
but she's still in college
and we're just as happy for her to finish her education first
well i don't blame you for that
so i hope so
well i have the three girls
and then we ended up with four grandsons
and little boys are around the house a whole lot more than girls
and uh i enjoy them coming but for short doses
but they're fun
so you're all back to the safety catches and the whole nine yards or either watching them every minute
well i just watch them
i d- i never did put things up when my kids were little
and i haven't with them
well that's the same thing that i did
so it's worked pretty well
but all in all they mind pretty well
but i guess most of the hou-
well we have
so i guess that's all i have to do right
and i push in pushed in my number
they kept saying you have the invalid code and then i found out that my new phone wasn't working right
oh so this is the first time i've even done it
i mean this whole thing like for two months or something
oh i don't know
well back to crime
well i think at this point i for one am worried about every aspect
especially uh you since you're in the same metroplex
you know there's so much going on here
i think the drive by shootings are getting to be so common that's really a something you got to protect yourself from
well that and in the schools too starting to put metal detectors in
i just heard you know
well we had a vice principal shot at here last year on the you know on the school grounds after school
and the one boy killed himself a few years ago in the in a grade school
so you know these kids don't have any trouble getting a hold of guns in any in any neighborhood doesn't seem like
and you wonder if he's going to get shot
i mean we didn't have to
it's it's it's getting
and it just continues to get worse
and you know we can't really depend on the police to solve all this
and uh and how we going to bring that back together
i think that's where it stems from is that and um you know you've got a lot of a lot more women that are working nowadays that aren't home with the children and that may impact it as well
and and then there's a drop in uh the training of morals really you know
these some of these young kids you read about just doesn't bother them to kill someone at all i think i think years past maybe our criminals had a little more
either that or i don't know if it happened and it wasn't as highly publicized as it is now or what the what the
my mother well she's like seventy-four now
she when she was a young girl she had a beautiful beautiful cousin that lived in california
and she was dating this millionaire's son
and he wanted to marry her
and she wouldn't marry him
and so he drove out in the country one day and shot them both
oh i know
but the point of the story is that that was so unbelievable a thing in those days that it was in all the papers all over the country for weeks but now you know you wouldn't probably read about it here in texas it's just you know another killing
well they were
and they were talking about uh mass murderers and they brought up what happened in killeen here recently
and they were saying you know that these guys want attention and that when it happens they're glorified because all the newspaper it's on all the newspapers and t v and everything
and then you get to their life story
oh they came from a broken family oh this person had mental problems oh duh duh duh you know
i know how we and straighten up all these twisted people before they do something terrible
so uh that story i just told you about my mother's beautiful cousin well the same thing happened here in arlington when was it i think it was oh it was almost a year ago in december to a girl that my daughter had graduated from high school with
she was a real attractive blond girl in in her freshman year of college and some boy she tried to get rid of he was like in his twenties
uh i remember seeing that
that's just uh
he um had her in the car in front of a taco or something and he just shot them himself and her
yeah uh uh
and uh the police are not going to do anything until they they've committed some sort of a crime
you know he was just begging her on the phone
and there are times i think gee i should give my kids gu-
well i do love to fish
well i don't know how much you can learn
but i do enjoy doing it
well it is fun what little i do
of course i don't you know
i told my husband last night when i had called and they had told me that this was a topic i said well i can tell them how to fish with a minnow or how to fish with a worm
well i hope it is
i because i get seasick
but we have a lot of lakes here in this area and i do a lot of fishing for uh bass
we have a lot of uh uh couple of lakes in our area that are fil- just filled with good sized bass
and then when i get tired of them outwitting me i fish for catfish and we use worms and shiners which is pretty much like minnows a little bit bigger than minnows
and then i also use spinner baits and plastic worms
well it sounds like you do quite a bit of it
uh there's a lake like maybe two or three miles from here
and it's very convenient on afternoons when i want to just get away and sit and think
and i have a lot of friends who like to go fishing
i have a friend who has a little infla- inflatable raft
and we use that sometimes
but i don't
the ones around here are so big that you can fish off the dock but unless you have a boat you can't really get into the where they call the good fishing holes you know
my in-laws live on a lake uh a little bit east of dallas kind of in the piney woods
and the lake is beautiful
and i like to go out and stand at the end of the dock and fish
but actually catching fish to eat per se you don't really do much of that right there
i catch a lot of little old uh i think they call them perch and then the the uh turtles try to eat up all my bait
so it's it's so close to the dock that i think all i do is feed them a little bit but it's kind of fun
we don't have we don't have a big problem with turtles
but we do have a awful lot of snakes in our lakes
um i would be afraid of that
and i well i can't think of a time that i've been fishing that i haven't run into one or two of them
occasionally i'll catch an eel on a on a hook but never the snakes
uh we have a lot of cotton mouth
they are definitely and they live in little shallow little coves that i like to fish in
so i seem them swimming by every once in a while
they can they're they're certainly ugly
we uh saw a large snake right off the dock there at my in-laws' place last year
it was probably four inches in diameter or something like that you know
and it of course it scared the women to death you know
but the men come out and said oh well that's only a a king snake it won't really hurt you you know
but it looked so bad and it was so big that it might not would have hurt us
but we sure felt like it was hurting us just being there you know
but they're scary looking
i think that uh probably around here people fish for bass and crappie and catfish more than anything else
well that's pretty much the same way here
now they have a lot of bass tournaments
well we have those
i don't i inevitably if i enter one of those i never catch a thing
well that's kind of
but i see a lot of people
you know early in the morning there'll be all the boats going out
and they'll say well there's a big bass tournament this weekend
and all those people are here for the tournament you know
so i think there's a lot of people that have you know really i guess that you'd call it really sport fishing
but it is it's very a very relaxing sport to be able to just be out on the water and looking around
well what did you have for lunch
oh it was uh
and we went to the officers' club for a little mexican food
well that's interesting
so our topic is is food today
if you're having a dinner party what what would you serve
if i was having a dinner party i would probably um have some um some uh um some fruit to start with with some apples sliced up and maybe some cheddar cheese and crackers and grapes and um probably serve maybe some wine and beer and maybe have some uh uh salsa and chips around and peanuts
and then i would have um let's see i usually have like a little theme when i have a dinner party
um i would have maybe um say if it was like greek night or something
um maybe um
and um mushrooms and tomatoes and onions
and then we'd have um
and um let's see what else
um maybe some rolls and um i guess some uh some rice or something like that
well well when is the party here
being a being the bachelor here that i am i i don't think i'd i'd be a- b-
i mean it it's not a question of capability here to do something like that
it's just there's there's no motivation
you know i want to i want to throw some charcoal on the grill and and throw a steak on there and some baked potatoes and stuff like that
well that sounds good too
i have um i have three kids so um when we have friends over i have my oldest kind of baby-sit for the little two younger ones upstairs
and um usually we just have very plain kind of you know interesting not very interesting meals
so once in a while when we do something like that it's kind of fun
but it's not a not a regular thing
now are we supposed to talk for about five minutes
that's what they they are shooting for here
um let's see now
so you would have a barbecue wouldn-
well i live on a i live on a lake here
and uh so it
and then during the summertime it's real nice to be able to entertain outdoors
like that's a little more a casual thing
but in mine the wintertime it's not bad too because then i've got a a fireplace and a nice nice house and all that
oh that sounds wonderful
i just haven't uh really tried a whole lot
but uh i don't know
i have had well one time i did have a dinner party
i served a uh uh
and kind of southern uh southern food even though i'm up here in new york
oh you are in new york right now
i'm i'm in texas
i didn't know this was all from all over the whole country
oh i see
and i'm fr- originally from long island
oh no kidding
and now where are you in new york
is that where you you are originally from around there
well i was born in buffalo
and uh been all over the place
um well i like to have um sometimes when i have a dinner party i'll have um everybody bring something
and that's real interesting because then you get different um different kinds of foods and new recipes
and um uh sometimes somebody will be bring something that you really like
and get the recipe from them or whatever
and we are just getting interested in in mexican food
because here in texas they have lots of
um we're we're just getting into the fajitas and all that stuff that you could
and uh had uh the pleasure of their good mexican
and i um
and you boil them maybe like four chicken breasts
and you boil them until they are cooked
and then you debone them and and kind of shred them up into the meat that has gotten cooled
and you take um s- little bit maybe two tablespoons of butter and a fr- in a big frying pan and chop up some onion and put in oregano and salt
uh i guess i've always kind of liked golf
i i worked on a golf course at at one time
and that's how i picked up golf
and uh i don't know
it's just a kind of a challenging game
uh so uh i got to start all over again
well i'm one of those rare left-handed golfers
and i do enjoy playing
uh i was down at about four or five quite awhile ago
it's probably up there to twenty now if i to start again
well if you play with some consistency though you can get it right back down
i i know with our our long winters i i enjoy watching it
i don't know if it's just because i like the game or i just like to to see the warm weather
uh well we can usually play here year around
but there is usually two or three days in the week that you can get out there and play
and i'm pretty much addicted to golf
so i get out there one way or the other
and the reason i like it so much is because i'm essentially playing against myself
i i play in in lo- a lot of groups
and but i they keep score and between themselves
but i really don't care
um i go out
and each shot i say well this is what i'm going to try to do and then i see how close i can come to that
and i- inevitably one facet of my game isn't working at one time or another
or i'm not hitting long irons very well
or i'm not putting well
or but sometimes it all comes together
i when i used to golf out there i'd putt well but i i wouldn't uh chip well
one of the two uh
or something would go wrong
but i always managed to to get near par anyway
well we just had the tour championship here in pine hurst
and i went to that
but we uh
we have a lot of uh
and we still have the greensboro open here every year
do you have uh long waits uh to get on the course
it it uh it's only been that way in the last five years
but now you uh
most of the courses have a uh two day advance tee time you have to call
so i'm going to try and get into one of the golf courses here
was from the uh
well i wish that's all we had
but uh last week we were in the seventies
so it's like in the low forties right now
but uh it's supposed to leave early in the week and then be back in the sixties
but we don't get any snow anymore
i don't i don't know what changed that pattern
well at least it that doesn't uh get in the way of golfing
but i have played golf in the snow before
but if you got
so what do you uh think is the uh the worst culprit for air pollution
well i think it's it's probably a combination of things
um factories that that burn coal as a an energy source with sulfur and nitrogen contaminants you know
and you get sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides
uh those are the ones i think primarily contribute to acid rain
and i think that's that's probably hurting us a little bit
it's hurting you know it's hurting germany for example too and some other parts of europe where they where they have high industry
so we're not the lone ranger here
i uh i
it's hard to put the finger on uh what's worse you know the acid rain situation or the ozone depletion um with uh your hydrocarbons uh causing the damage in which
but i know we haven't cured it yet by a long shot
well i notice on one of these uh home shopping networks they were selling these uh halogen uh fire extinguishers and the halogen is uh an ozone depleter
and it got hydrocarbons in there
it's a very clean uh fire extinguisher
but it's you know really bad on the environment
and you know how how we are with our love affair with the auto kind of hard to do anything about that i guess
uh in the twin cities area
but they had a new policy where in order to get your uh your license uh your car license uh renewed you had to meet the pollution standards and uh
but it's part of the inspection sticker you know
and and the computer reads whatever the ionization is coming out
and so that's you know that's the way they're dealing with it here
and as far as where i live i don't have to do that
but i have an old car which i doubt would uh would uh pass the inspection a seventy-six
and uh you know there's no way i would put in a lot of money to to repair it to meet standards
so although i do what i can to to cut down pollution
i was just reading an article in uh mother earth news mother earth news magazine and uh they've got a new uh
you know a lot of places are burning wood a lot a lot of people are burning wood
i've got a place in the country you know and uh they've had catalytic con- you know catalytic converters on those on
uh i think they're required in california and oregon and and washington
but they've had up those for quite a while
and somebody's come up with a new one that uh sort of
it's a it's a catalytic converter
it's it's a plate that fits in you know into the smoke pipe and uh apparently it sort of feeds itself
the more smoke is produced you know
and it sounds real neat
but that that sounds like that might help solve that problem even on you know old old uh older stoves that don't have any kind of e p a requirements on them
now sometimes we get a kind of a
especially in in uh autumn it seem like we get kind of a brown haze sitting on us
but most of the time it's blowing out pretty well
well well around here i we get uh
well it depends you know
either in the in the winter time it it blows it your way
and in the summer time
i really think uh you know we're doing some some important things
uh i know school kids
and uh you know this is one of the big things with kids
kids are writing letters to the newspapers about you know telling adults to clean up their act
and it's uh you know
we're we're uh we're having all kinds of recycling
well it uh th- that's a big thing too
but i kind of look at the way people treat our
but i don't get anybody at five thirty don't get anybody at nine at night
oh well i'm at
and i just happened to walk back into my office
well i go to school
so i'm home certain days
and uh i really haven't been making any s- phone calls have you
i don't i haven't ever made any
have you have you received many
it's it's uh
well the first time we were on this it came just about every day
w- well anyway i guess we're supposed to discuss this uh subject
well i never gave it any thought myself
well i don't have any objection to people doing that
but as a mother of two daughters i might be afraid of where they were sent
i'm just concerned about their safety mor-
because if they do good work in america they'll probably be sent to a ghetto
and if they were sent to a third world country i couldn't help but wait worried you know
i think maybe it's it should stay on a voluntary basis
i i think it would be good for uh everyone to do something like that
but i i guess i don't feel like it should be something forced upon you
well it it probably won't
i don't i don't even know how we'd pay for it anyway
we can't uh seem to pay for all the little things we have going now
but uh i don't know
som- some kids are so spoiled nowadays
it might be a real eye opener you know
i mean sometimes my kids are on the other side of town here
and they just see some really tiny modest wood frame homes
and then they think
they're just kind of shocked at that side of town you know
well that would be an eye opener wouldn't it
i mean right next to us is such a pitiful country
but what do i know right
i'm just sitting at home and and uh doing laundry today and certainly not up
oh but uh anyway how did you get on this program
oh you do work at t i
oh you're in lewisville
it looked like a pretty little a sight
but how did you get on it
well my husband works at t i over on central
uh why we're living in arlington i'm not so sure
and uh so i'm just my daughter and i are registered this time
but like i said i hardly ever get any calls this time
and i can never find anybody
and but now it just seems like it's in the dallas fort worth area that i get calls from
i don't know uh
there's just there's so many with this one town you know
e- even in some families some people talk a little bit different
and one of his sisters does things that really sound funny to me
and he doesn't pronounce them at all that way
and that's one family right
you know how that goes
well i'm surprised she hasn't told us to cut it off yet
or or switc- or overloads
so please end your conversation
well do you have any more words of wisdom about the subject
well uh i don't know if mine would want to go live in the ghetto
well one of them is real idealistic
uh well we i guess we have to talk about magazines
and uh what what
what what kind do you subscribe to or do you
well i subscribe to p- well i did subscribe to people for a long time
i do you know
and now i'm uh
i uh take a computer magazine
and uh also uh better homes and gardens
are you interested in in computers
and my pet peeve with magazines is all the little cards inside
well that that would be one of my peeves
i mean it's it's really geared to
i just don't you know
too many recipes too many uh can this marriage with saved nonsense
i you know i like to read articles about things that matter
well of course people magazine is not you know one of your uh
but it's nice light reading
you know if i want something intellectual i usually read a book
well that's true
i uh i like it
like redbook used to always have a good short story in it
well that's true
and i haven't bought a redbook in a while
so i guess
i i really very rarely ever pick up a magazine anymore
well is redbook still in existence
well i'll tell you the only reason i bought the uh i subscribe to the journal is because of
they told me you know if i didn't subscribe they were going to take me off their their winning you know their list
my last right my last chance to win ten million dollars
so i figured hey look
for twelve dollars you know
well i i i went ahead and sent in my subscription because of that uh to uh entertainment
and i was real disappointed with it
i i don't know
and that's one thing i don't like about people
uh it 's just you know doesn't seem to have enough story to it
well i don't know
i just think uh you know it's it's light reading
you know you don't have well you don't have to concentrate you know
it's entertaining you know
and uh that's
i just i enjoy it
i you know i uh
well that entertainment is is very
wasn't that similar or isn't it similar to to the tv guide
i mean not the one i take now
it's a it's a magazine
and it goes into all the movies previewing the movies that are going to be released or behind the scenes
oh i see
and uh i'm a real movie buff
so that's why i thought i might be interested in it
but it just hasn't been what i thought it would be
and uh my mother has subscribed to is the reason i get uh the
otherwise if if i really want to take the time to read a magazine and i see one on the grocery shelf i'll pick it up then
rather than having them delivered and think oh i really need to read this
well i'll tell you since i've been getting the journal like maybe maybe i'll read two maybe three
if i read three articles in in you know one of the journals i figure you know i did really well
because there's just nothing in there that interests me
i don't you know i don't i'm not into you know recipes
well i i do like recipes and crafts
see now and i'm not into crafts
so you know that that eliminates like three quarters of the magazine
well i just got the new issue
so that should be one article that i'll read anyway
do you uh
so how is the weather out there
uh it's really cold
and it's supposedly for this time of the year it's unseasonably cold
and they've gotten more snow than they've ever had
um uh it's just it's a it's about same
so nice for skiing and all that kind of stuff
well the weather let's see well the snow here is different from utah's
because i have lived in utah for like ten years
and uh the snow is like really cold
i mean it's like really humid
so it seems wetter or something like that
and it seems like when the winds blow it's really it goes right through you
but i think iowa is a lot colder
see that's how it is in texas too
because when it's cold it's really cold
so the humidity is i think what does it
because i i noticed when i got here too
because like i'd
when it would snow in texas uh i would just i mean we'd be f- really cold
and we'd have to get really warm
and here you can almost not even wear a coat outside when it's snowing
and you don't you don't feel super cold
but so how long ago
or did you
uh i graduated in nineteen eighty-seven
and so he just graduated this past year
so you just barely moved away
we really miss
well we really miss utah
because it's like really flat here
well not flat but hilly
so you just moved away a year ago
uh in august
but uh see see what else can i say about the weather
it was like forty-five
so what's the temperature up today over there
it's got to be like it's probably fifty fifty-five maybe
probably about uh
it's not it's not that cold really
and whenever i remembered the weather reports in utah i never really remember them talking too much about wind chill
but they talk about wind chill here all the time
they said it could be like six degrees out and like negative forty-one wind chill
so that's what we're not used to
that makes a big difference huh
so oh i
so did you used to ski when you were out here
oh i've only i've only skied in utah once
but do you do a lot of skiing there
uh not tons
but i like to when i get a chance
so is this your first year in utah
and you're going to school there
so but i'll be here a long time
uh it was nursing
but i'm in the process of changing it right now
because it's really really competitive at b y u
you have to have like a
so i think i better get into something that i can enjoy the process of going to school
that's that's a good idea
uh elementary and special ed
but she got her doc-
well i can't
oh have they
because they since uh stopped that program i mean where you can where you can get it double pretty easily
i mean it's it's really
oh i guess the first thing has been the uh for the right for women to vote
i think that has been a major change and also the fact that uh there are so mu- many more women in the work force nowadays than there were
and that's probably going to increase
well and i think women have kind of had uh in the past the real subservient role
well we do to some degree but uh uh i think it's not as much as it was
i i agree
i and especially i think with women increasingly working they're going to have to demand more
because there is just i- impossible to keep up on everything else
well you know they've been talking about
and i don't know uh what the status is on it
but you know women get maternity leave and stuff like that
and i know that they've there has been discussion about men also getting maternity leave to help out
but you know i haven't really heard much about that recently
well you know there is a lot of companies that won't give mat- women maternity leave for that very reason
uh in fact i know the school districts down here you they don't have maternity leave
oh is that right
uh you simply have to take accumulate your sick leave
and i don't know uh if bigger company companies do
but when i was employed with the school district i didn't have maternity leave either
and that was the reason
because they thought was showing prejisim to women and not to men
huh that's interesting
but so uh
you have to save all of your uh vacation time
and that's usually how it's uh happened
what do you see uh changing in the future
and we'll prob-
and and top level
and probably uh we'll see more females in political roles
more governors and i think you know roles like that
well we've got in texas we have a female governor
and we had a female mayor here in dallas
and she just her term just ended
and uh so i think we're probably going to see more of that in the future
and uh maybe not so much that we sit on the back burners
right you know
i mean and that's fine with me but sometimes
i mean i'm not a women's libber by any means
but i do
there are issues that you know as far as like equal pay for men and women and that kind of stuff i totally am for
but i don't get into the uh the real
and uh i'm not capable of lifting what uh a man can lift and you know that type of that type of thing
but uh one of the big changes uh they're doing in salt lake is uh
and they're probably
i'm sure in dallas since you're big places a lot more women are uh working right out of their home with their p c's or with their lap computers or whatever
i i've heard of that
uh i haven't really talked to anybody that's you know too involved with that
but i mean i think that is a
is is that what you're talking about women working out of their homes
uh i think it's wonderful
oh i kn-
course they're talking about uh that we're going to be able to do our grocery shopping and
so uh it would be kind of exciting in some ways to to see a little bit more of that
and some ways it might be kind of
but then you know there is the process of selection
you know when you shop you usually compare the prices
and would be nice though
that a little town or or a bigger city
um it's not one of the bigger ones it's probably um i compare it to the size of plano maybe a little smaller
oh well anyway we're supposed to talk about education
because they really teach you about forty percent less than they used to
and it shows up
um i don't know
i'm pretty i think i'm pretty satisfied with um
i gre- i grew up in plano and and my dad is actually on the school board there
so i kind of kept up with a lot of things that went on
plano uh improved greatly in the last twenty twenty-five years that's for sure
and arlington is excellent now
but i'm just speaking overall across the country
and uh one thing they don't spend as much time just teaching reading and writing
so a lot of kids are just being promoted from year to year
and they truly can't read so i don't know how they expect them to uh pass history when they can't read anything you know even read a word problem in math
so um that's definitely a problem
so do you what do you think is good about the schools
well it depends on where you are
there's no national curriculum you know
i mean what they'd be teaching in an arlington school they may not be teaching in a plano school and in the same school district you may even in an arlington seventh grade for instance you may have an english class
so that's kind of o- you know that's kind of odd to me
it depends on uh what school you're in and who your teacher is actually or is how you end up
so i guess we lucked out when we moved here
of course we have a slight problem in that uh the number of the illiterate in america is mushrooming at this point
and uh you know where our kids might be in a great school we're still paying an awful lot of taxes for people who are on welfare and unemployment because they can't read you know
but do you think that there should be um nationwide um curriculum
and i had never even thought of it
because sometimes like a third grade teacher will get kids from second grade that didn't even learn what uh
they should to do the work that she is supposed to teach you know
so i guess if there was a national curriculum we'd at least have a certain amount that all kids would learn
but uh we actually rank forty-ninth in the world as far as just plain literacy goes you know
that's that's pretty low that there's forty-eight countries ahead of us that have more peop- more citizens percentage wise that can read and write
so um unless we want to keep paying paying for these people that can't make it in society we're going to have to do something
so i probably can't
but i do think that we have to cut out some of this folderol stuff and go back in the first five six grades and just keep going over and over and over until most of those that are capable can at least learn to read and write because they can't even get the menial job without being able to read something nowadays you know
uh you can't you can't even work an answering machine if you're at work and had to get a message or something
so uh i think that's that's a start at least going back to the basics in the early grades and um they say that the average english student nowadays does at least fifty percent less reading and writing than they did twenty years ago
and that's a big jump
up up there maybe maybe you guys don't have as uh big a problem with air pollution as many do you
we we we have a terrible air pollution problem
our summers are extremely uh hazardous and during uh certain wind directions because we get the uh gary indiana chicago pollution and we can look out on the lake and just see the brown haze uh coming up along the lake
and they do post uh uh warnings for people who have uh heart diseases or respiratory problems during that summer season
but uh if the wind comes basically from the south it can be really bad
uh the state of wisconsin as a matter of fact uh started some litigation against illinois because of the air pollution we were getting
uh i don't think it's going to go very far
but it it was uh a way of uh triggering uh awareness
so what's the conditions like in dallas
well uh in dallas i i haven't seen air pollution quite on a quite on a level that we had in denver
and and i've lived there most of my life
and we used to have those uh you know the posted warning days
uh however in colorado now they have the emissions control law which has really cut down
probably only once every couple of years do we ever have pollution so bad that they have to po- post warnings now you know as far as health concerns
uh due to that emi- the the emissions uh
wisconsin has a a law in which we need to take our cars in every year when we apply for a new license tag and they are tested for uh their pollution control equipment
and if they don't qualify then they have to take it to a mechanic and have it gone over and then verify that it it is drivable
so they've they've tried to do a lot of that and i thi-
you know there seem to be at least in certain little pockets
and we were talking earlier about madison madison has one of the nicest uh bike uh road uh sharing programs of of any city in wisconsin and all wisconsin has probably the most extensive number of uh bike trails for recreational use of any of the states
and there is a a real promotion of of biking but um there are still a lot of people who insist on on driving their own automobiles uh to go everywhere
it it becomes uh
maybe to you and i who have grown up in some in uh uh some more beautiful parts of the country uh i think that that uh we become a little more aware uh rather quickly of of what's happening with air pollution and how uh how horrible it really is
um i i notice people in in dallas seem to say well sure there's air pollution but you know really how bad is how bad could this problem really be
send send them to wisconsin
and we'll let them try to drink out of some of the lakes and try to fish in some of the lakes that have been suffering from uh the uh acid rain and they'll they'll they may wake up you know
it's uh really a serious issue for those of us up in this uh sector up up here
do you find that um or or do you hypothesize that that most of the uh smog or or air pollution comes from vehicles
or does it come mostly from industry up there
but i do know that uh it is a problem
i i grew up uh i was born in uh muncie indiana and and grew up a little bit in terre haute
and i had asked them before uh
and i asked them
i'm sorry um hobbies
takes a lot of time huh
i like uh most sports
oh little bit of embroidery work once in a while
um i try to do some painting although i'm not very good at it
well i'm sure you probably are
i i have you know i inherited the genes that make me think i'm creative
so i always try
i i do some sewing mostly out of necessity
um i'm making drapes for my house just because i'm
oh boy that's hard sewing
well it isn't and it is
it is you know
well if it it depends on how elaborate you get it
but usually have to do the pleats by hand
so that at least i can do you know watching t v or whatever
and i've i've gone and you know put the needle through my thumb a few times
so that's not really my favorite thing to do or anything but i i need to do it
i have let's see i have a dog and a lot of fish
well they're probably easier than keeping dogs though aren't they
um yes and no
and you probably have to clean out the tank too
you don't have to do as much as as i thought
and they always died immediately
and what i'm what i think now is the reason is i kept the tank too clean because you have
oh you're kidding because they need to have a little bit of the
and then it keeps all the chemicals in balance
and i would just take everything out and just like you know wash it with scalding hot water and it would kill all the bacteria
and that would screw up all the chemical cycles again so
and so you'd have to start all over to build that up probably
so now only i only clean things to make things look more aesthetically pleasing and i don't try and sterilize things
and they kind of need a little bit of that
so you've had fish for a long time
well i've had them
i guess it's been two years now i've had a a tank here
and then back at home i used to have a small you know five gallon tank
but that never worked well
oh that's a good size
have you ever had it uh crack or break or leak
but you know
i just have you know what they call community fish guppies and platies and and basic things
well they're probably hardy harder to take care of
and you know when you die it's like when they die it's more like an investment
do you have problems with them uh the fish eating each other
you get a well no
it's a little plastic things that sort of floats and you put the mother fish in there
and then it's got like a trough underneath her so as the babies come out they fall down in the trough
and there's a hole in the middle so they fall into the bottom part of the chamber so the mother can't get to them either
and that's you know
but it's also got slots in it so the water can circulate and on occasion if you get a real small one
so but you know it works i guess
they don't uh want the mothers to be with the little fish either
oh they'll eat them
it and it's funny because the one i have every single month without fail she has babies
and um i
and she's supposed to
and i've seen her do it
and that just makes you sick almost doesn't it
oh it's ter-
well it makes you understand that you know things are different
things are different in the animal kingdom huh
we might right we might decide what's proper and what isn't
but you know that's the way it is for them
because if the baby is strong enough it can swim away fast enough and go hide
well and then you think well how did they do it out in the real world anyway when these fish are in the tropicals or wherever they are kind of trying to keep up with that
but if you're like me you never have enough time for the hobbies
i i try
i also i play a couple of instruments
uh well uh the cowboys are my favorite team
but they had a big win today
uh did you get to watch it
i uh have been at my computer all day
well i used to be a real big cowboy fan
and and uh i'm not a jimmy johnson fan
it's it's kind of hard not to be a cowboy fan though
they've always been you know my favorite
but uh and and i guess i still have a soft spot
so now have they
like just you know two years ago they were one and fifteen
they won like just one game
and so pretty fast turnaround
but this year they made it to playoffs
and today was the first game
and they beat the chicago bears
so everybody's really going crazy you know down here
so so they turned it around
but you know they have a lot of young exciting players now uh
i mean everybody was real upset you know when they fired tom landry
but you know now it's like you know they're doing good so everybody's forgotten
uh football fans are probably the most fickle people in the world
and it's you know the coach's fault
let's let's dump him
but they dallas has always been good ahead you know heading good players and both running running backs and and defense
uh you know they have a young team
it's you know a lot different than the teams they used to have where it's the same old you know players every year and you know same coach same everything
so now it's you know like a taste of something different
they're all not you know mister nice guys like they used to be
now it's like you know tough and dirty team
so everybody is really excited
well it's supposed to be the redskins but you know we beat them already
we beat them this year in in washington
so you know so everybody has the feeling like we can go all the way to the super bowl
but you know it's just that we have to play every game away you know
but but every-
the competition is are teams that they've already beat this year
so i mean atlanta they're in it too
and we beat them
and uh see detroit we play them next week
but you know we should beat them
so it's so everything's uh looking real good
course i think you know you can't really go by what happened earlier in the season because teams jell together or they've had injuries that heal
and you know it can be a tot- or injuries that uh have newly happened and it could be almost a totally new team out there than the one we played
well the cowboys are on a roll
they've won like i think six or seven in a row now
so they're supposed to be the hottest team in the in the league going into the playoffs
but but since you have an o u drop out
so he transferred to u c l a
well well he he really didn't feel like he'd be able to do a lot of passing at o u
but they're doing some stomping on
oh i tell you
they've they've not had much of a team this year bless their little hearts
well they're doing good tonight
yeah they're winning they're winning forty-one to seven
well good for us
and uh that's right
then he went out to s to southern cal
uh u c l a
but the cowboys did good today
i mean i was proud
i thought i thought they would get beat today because i mean they're so young you know
uh my wife and i have a dog that soon be eight years old
and we have a a cat which is uh i guess about five years old
oh my goodness
and two bi-
en- enjoy them
oh have a ball with them
so in order to have the birds not stuffed i have to keep them in their cages
you know this is like a cruelty joke
and i apologize if you're a bird lover
but uh we had a parakeet
well we had that happen once um
because it's his bir- well the first one that we had was his bird
and i had a ceiling fan put up
and it the bird got away from him one afternoon
and i mean that sucker hit that fan and went flying up against the wall
i thought oh so much for the bird
well it killed ours
but it threw him up against the wall you know
and he slid
well speaking of pets i'll tell you my my kids are older now
my both of them are either in or out of college
but but we had for years about five years i guess had a my son had a burmese boa constrictor
and that thing grew to be seven and a half feet in in length
and finally my wife wife bless her heart got rid of it because i didn't really like it
oh i hate them
one year down in florida on a vacation for father's day my kids years ago maybe uh ten years ago go bought me a skunk from a exotic pet shop
oh my goodness
it'd be like it'd been like deactivated as far as s- s- smell and everything
and we had that darn pet skunk for about five years
and and my son left went to school
but my son needed some money
and we we sold it for about two hundred and fifty dollars
so when the guy came over he was infatuated by that skunk
so i made him a deal
and he said i'll sell that snake to you for two fifty
so he took the skunk too
and the skunk was a good a decent pet
but you know does his little jobbies in the litter box
and is is
oh well that's pretty good
and it was sort of a neat
but they just stink too much
that was sort of fun you know
oh you're kidding
and this snake honestly would be stretched across the top of her body and with his with his head right on her neck and the skunk would be sitting at her feet
but the cat would be on the back of the sofa
and a dog would be running around crazy
oh my gosh
i just i don't
in fact my brother has a uh a exotic pet shop out in california
and he keeps threatening to send a snake through the mail you know
oh my son bought this snake uh
and it was just a small thing then
but it got to be pretty big
and you know you'd feed it you'd feed it you put feed him small mice to big rats and things like that it's just uh too much
oh my gosh
i says you know your friend's going to get our cat one of these days
oh me neither
oh i just can't do those and the lizards and the all those those things
and that's the way it should be
uh customer of mine has a parrot
and uh gosh sticks in my mind he paid eighteen hundred dollars for a parrot
and that was just mind boggling
well my son was just dying for a bird
and i'm really allergic to them
so i try to stay away from them except i've gotten real attached to this one
and and uh we went down to canton one time oh gosh two or three years ago now
and he'd saved up his allowance you know and picked him out a bird in a bird cage
and and that stinking bird when i brought it home tried to take it out of the little box that they give you clamped onto my finger and would not
i mean i had to literally shake him off to get him in the cage
and he has tried to bite me for two years
and all of a sudden this bird and i have become wonderful friends
he talks now and it's just hysterical
and i'm a substitute teacher
and one of my fifth graders last year came up to me and said
so now we have two parakeets
so you enjoy camping
i uh like you i haven't done any in quite some time except for what i call living now
you know i uh camped in the boy scouts
and you know my dad and i went out sometimes
but uh even my first uh eight or nine years of working i camped almost all of the time because i was in construction
and it is cheaper to pitch a tent and cook your meals out by the fire than it is to rent an apartment add to stress
i mean when you have to have it you have got to have it
and you know in those those kinds of situations uh room rent which is outrageous
so my buddy and i we just camped
and we figured what the hell
and we loved it
when when i was in high school
and uh he graduated and went off to college
and uh during the summer we would camp out at the lake
but it wasn't very much like camping because we had a refrigerator and a stove
you know i had a little boat house and floated it out on lake grapevine
and uh well it was fantastic
we would get up in the morning go skiing uh
and uh in the afternoon you know it is still four o'clock
and uh it was great
but uh you know now all my life is more like camping than not camping really
well actually as a matter of fact they just ran the phone three years ago
and uh we are on the we are third from the end on the electric string
so we are at the end of the mail route
i guess so huh
but uh you know right now uh what we did my wife and i is we got a mobile home
and uh swapped them a cadillac for it and put it out here on the land figuring i would build a house some day you know
and uh you know i just had this place you know to shower up while i was you know out here you know putting up fence and building a driveway and drilling a well and all that stuff you have to do before you can even put a house in you know
and uh i came home from work one friday afternoon
and our truck was back
and my wife said uh we're moving
and i said where
and she said out to the trailer
and i said oh
and i said okay
so we have been roughing it out here for about three years
but it is not bad
i we have color t v microwave you know it is not horrible
but it's it's a lot like camping
well i grew up in california in southe- in central california right in the valley
so it is a forty-five minute drive to the mountains
and uh so my dad loved fishing and camping
so we would go up
first we went up just to uh with a toyota pick up truck and laid out our sleeping bags under the stars and you know cooked our uh hot dogs by the fire or whatever
but then later my mom and dad got a camper
so uh we have kind of moved up
my mom goes camping you know
she takes her uh motor home
you know she's got one of these huge winnebago's with a refrigerator and air-conditioning color t v microwave oven
but you know she has a lot of fun
and mostly it is just a way to
she she goes to dog shows
see she shows dogs
and uh you can sneak a dog into a motel but you can't sneak ten dogs into a motel
so she uh you know takes the motor home
and she made a deal with my dad that she would take all the dogs with her when she went dog showing
so he did
but as far as camping my wife and i have plans to uh not really camp per se but to drive up the uh you know highway one there in california uh as soon as we get this house finished
oh that's uh
well what kind of vacations do you like to take
well we've uh we've been fortunate enough to take a couple of trips over to europe
so i i guess those are the types i like
we've gone to um germany switzerland austria ireland and england
but um i guess my favorite is probably switzerland and ireland
well i've been over there too
let's see um
oh how neat
so i was able
but i once when i had a chance in france to go on vacation instead of travelling around france i went to germany because uh i've got relatives there
oh that's neat
and i just like it there
so but um austria i found really pretty and switzerland
and i i lived in the alps in france
oh how neat
so i anything in the mountains over there i just love
then i finally made it to england too uh on my way home um
and on my way home from there
oh my goodness
so um and you always have to go out fly through or unless you fly from nairobi you have to fly through um uh europe on your way home
so i went to england
and i really liked it there too
it just it's it's
but it's so darn expensive to go over
actually now you can get some really good deals flying over
but it's once you're there you still have to spend money
oh i know
unless you know people you know
you know there's a lot of places in the states that we haven't even gone
you know i'd like to go to hawaii some time
and and uh we made it
we've we've at least gone to the grand canyon and niagara falls
i've been i've
most of my vacationing in the u s has been on the west coast or this summer i went to colorado and uh i'd love to go to the east coast during the fall
the oh the
and and it looks gorgeous
we um we made a trip up the east coast
it was uh in the summer and it really is pretty
both coasts are really pretty but um i love the carolinas
i haven't been there anywhere on the east coast
well you'll just have to plan a vacation some time and and go over there
but there's you know there's a lot to see here but i just love going over to europe because it's so their way of life is just so different than ours
you know we're so fast paced here
and over there you know every time we'd go and and eat dinner or lunch or whatever we'd always have to ask for the check you know
so the type of vacation you'd like um
like would you go over and spend a lot of time in one place or travel to whole bunch of different places in one week
well usually a bunch of different places
main- mainly probably because you want to see everything
well i liked it
i was working in cameroon africa and it's not a
i mean they're not used to having tourists there
but um i liked it
the people there are just very very friendly
um i was working with an organization that does bible translation
so i was doing linguistic work actually travelling around finding out about languages and uh what they call survey work
so i travelled a lot around the country and met a lot of people
i've i've always um i've talked to people who have been to africa
and then of course when that movie out of africa came out
um but i've always thought it would be neat to go on a safari over there
and she came to cameroon
and then she went over to nairobi and took a safari around you know close to nairobi in kenya
oh how neat
so she'd always dreamed of doing that too
so is there any place you would try to talk me into going to
well uh i don't know
and especially in this election year i think that uh there ought to be so- at least some conversation about what we are supposed to do about this
it kind of seems to me that everyone's offering you know their token little tax cut program you know when it's when it's just such a bad time for it
and uh well as you said mostly they are token cuts
uh especially what for instance george bush is offering
that's really not going to do a lot of good it doesn't seem to me to your average middle income person you know
i mean mostly it's it's not actually a a a cut
it's just a cut in the withhold in the amount withheld you know
uh i i haven't really heard much of what the other people other candidates have said that have made a lot of sense to me either
especially the democratic candidates don't seem to be coming up with much that really sparks my interest as far as yeah maybe that could do something to affect our budget at this point
i mean you know in retrospect um was it was it mondale or dukakis that said you know i'll i'll tell you right now i'm going to raise taxes
i believe it was dukakis but i i can't
i mean that's better than george bush who came out and said no
and then you know ten months later he said well sorry you know i i can't follow through on this
but it seems to me that uh that the budget is so out of hand
and especially now that they say okay the cold war is over
and we're supposed to be getting a peace dividend of you know of x number of billion trillion dollars a year
well i'd really like to know where that money is actually going to go
because in my opinion i don't think i'm ever going to see any of this peace so-called peace dividend
i mean if they could actually put something together and make
but with this peace dividend it seems like you could set up some kind of like public works projects like they had in the thirties or whatever
i uh i i think that would be a great idea you know like the conservation corps you know where
it wou- it wou- it would help unemployment greatly
ex- exactly and in that way we could really focus on building the infra structure of the country
infra structure is in is in
i mean we we we have hurt ourselves incredibly last fifty years in the cold war
and and there's no way that we can ever really recover from from the state that we're in right now unless at least i feel unless we focus on the infra structure
and i surely don't hear anybody saying that right now
i i agree totally
um i mean this this it just seems so you know so ridiculous that it was allowed to happen
um i i'm in college right now
uh i u
i go to georgia tech um
i had pol- you know the required political science class a couple of years ago
and one of the things we discussed was you know where our where the budget situate- how the budget situation just got so out of hand
and essentially what happened was
i think it was like in the um tax year of eighty-one um
ronald reagan basically said you know i'm going to give this much of a tax cut to the tax payers and and created this this ludicrous budget that he knew that that um that the congress would not in their right mind pass and con- congress realizing that they were going to lose a the democratic congress realized that they were going to lose a propaganda war you know bye-bye you know bye-bye removing the tax cut further cut the taxes and created you know that that that you know created the huge deficit that year which moved us into the trillion dollar deficit
and you just
you you just have to wonder what they're thinking in washington
i mean it's just like they're playing chicken with a loaded gun
uh well it's it's more than a loaded
i mean they've got trillions of dollars to spend every year
and they in my opinion don't do a very responsible job of spending that money
um what really bothers me is it just seems like if if anyone were to say you know well i'm going to raise taxes and cut the budget and we're we're going to have to do some unpopular things i mean he wouldn't have a chance of getting elected
i mean it's kind of like rome and the bread and circuses thing you know where people just want want to have you know whatever will make them feel good right now you know
for for the moment
and that's what really is getting me about what george bush's stand on the budget is right now is that he is saying i am going to give you this ludicrous little tax cut so that you'll be happy come november and you'll elect me again and then i'm going to go on and just forget everything that i said or you know it doesn't seem that it's going to make much of a difference
i mean i don't know
i i i actually i live in the city and uh i guess it is a concern of mine uh you know for my own safety
i mean do you do you find crime in atlanta really
well that's right
uh i think it is bad in certain areas
however i think the area that i live in it's not uh the crime level is not as high as it is in other areas of the of the city
i think it seems that there's certain areas where uh the crime is focused uh
well what do you think can be done about the crime in the city
well i think it's what's been happening over the last several years it seems they've been beefing up the police patrols trying to put put more guys more cops higher visibility
and uh they've had some impact but not a tremendous amount
and probably um they need to try to increase community involvement that sort of thing i think
you know particularly in some of the housing projects uh you know that's that tends to be where a lot of that crime is focused and they've got to do more than just having having cops there
um so um well do you think atlanta's as bad as most other cities
um well i've been to
i'd say it's it's probably in the top top ten in terms of crime
um it's nowhere near as bad as new york city for example
probably not not as bad as detroit
we i don't think we have as much of the gang problem as a lot of the other cities have
if you've ever been to like new york city
and you can just you can just as you walk through the street on a given evening you can see crimes being committed
i came to the conclusion also that you know just if you are walking in a downtown area you know where there's a lot of crime a lot of that's going to just just keeping your senses about you and and trying not to look like a victim you know
you know walk bi- you know walk with you know with
and you know don't don't be looking around like you've never been there before and you have no idea where you are
don't don't walk down a an alley
or don't get just try to keep yourself out of a bad situation but yeah
there are times when you can't avoid all that and and then you're kind of on your own
have you have you ever have you ever been mugged in atlanta
the only thing i've ever had was i've had my wallet lifted but that was in a more of a a setting where there was a number of people around
and i kind of got
i was much younger at the time and kind of a couple of people they just took it from me without me knowing really and kind of passed it off so i didn't know who had it
but that's that's about it
i think i've only actually seen like one you know one actual robbery with a gun and that's been about the only you know real violent crime where you know potentially violent crime that i've seen in atlanta
well i've had my
and that was just a guy running out of a store that he just robbed
so maybe that counts
oh where was where where was that
that was in the northern p- um up near cumberland mall area
but it is atlanta and uh there's a lot of car thefts in that area
i've actually i've known known some people that have had their cars stolen
uh and uh and you know about half the time they seem to the a p d seems to recover them you know in various states of disrepair
and when he when he got it back his um dashboard was sitting in the front seat
mine was just it had been wrecked and some superficial type damage
but they didn't they didn't strip it so i got it back
well you're probably luckier than
um so like does insurance pay for the body damage
or was that all there was body
you got to you crack the steering column
and you pull the
there's a pin in there that you can pull on these g m cars and you can start it up basically pretty easily
so how do you know this much about um stealing cars
so how you like new jersey
uh it's pretty good you know
you get uh closer to the uh coast here
and you do get a good bit of uh smog and stuff especially from all the uh fuel cracking towers and chemical plants
i guess uh i don't know what part of new jersey you're in but i guess it's uh fairly industrial
when you get further east towards new york city it gets very industrial but i'm i'm about uh thirty miles west of there
so you have uh actually green trees and such that you don't notice that that other part of new jersey exists
y- you know you go even a few wi- miles out and you got uh farms and everything
well i don't know about you
but i've always considered automobiles to be probably the the prime contributor
i mean there's a lot of contributors
but it seems that automobiles would probably do more than their fair share of that
oh d- definitely
it's uh you know there are a large number of them on the road
they're all you know going
and a lot of them are in relatively poor repair
that's yeah that's that's a big issue is you know
a lot of states don't have a uh inspection law
so you get you get a lot of people out there without e t r emission control systems on their cars and things like that
oh e- even where you do have the inspections you know the inspection is once a year
and it's like
and muffler falls off or something and guy keeps driving along for long period of time after that
i guess from what i hear though uh next year ford is coming out with their electric cars
and i think also some of the uh car companies are coming out with uh gas powered fleets so you
natural gas powered rather than uh gasoline
i hope i i'm hoping that comes along quick
uh i was reading a an article in time the other day about the ozone layer and how fast that's going
and i guess it's it's really disappearing a lot quicker than people realize
and i know that's not due to uh it's not due to to gasoline or to you know carbon monoxide so much as the c f c
it it is coming from cars though
i think that's a that's a contributor definitely
i mean the uh car air conditioners is one of the major leaking sources of uh the uh freon
which is one of the major flor- chlorofar- fluorocarbons
i guess right now what they're what they're primarily worried about is third world countries because i guess united states and and russia have kind of taken the lead in terms of eliminating c f c production
well it it
it's it's the type of thing there that uh you know
and they want to become industrial so they're on the different part of the cycle of the u s
the u s used you know all the air pollution stuff and air polluting technologies to get where it is today
and that's one of the arguments that the third world countries have been using is that basically they don't want to have to pay for our mistakes
uh in terms of
or or they want the right to make the same mistakes themselves to bootstrap them up to the way where we got to
uh those of kind of yeah those are joining arguments
but uh i don't know
that's that's kind of an interesting situation there
uh what they don't realize those third world countries what they don't realize is how quickly the ozone is depleting
and it's it's increasing even as far near the equator as like florida and cuba and those places
so it's kind of an interesting situation
well you also have the very close related thing of the uh rain forest destruction which is the main source of what's clearing out the atmosphere and replacing some of the pollutants
you don't get that that source of cleansing anymore
are have you been in big cities a long time
mostly i've mostly been in the east coast
so that's going between atlanta washing- d c area
so you've got
well not not as hard as some places out west because you don't get the uh major pollution sources as you do out in denver with the inversion and los angeles and a- rest of california which is just terrible it sounds
denver's that that real good e- that real good uh example of sitting in a valley kind of like mexico city does i guess
mexico city is historically been one of the worst in the in the world for that
but i've been pretty lucky
i've lived in cities that really haven't had that much of a problem although uh i'm really kind of based in orlando florida
and there you can tell that it's getting worse
i mean it it definitely it's not at a level comparable to los angeles or denver
but you can
there it's almost all automobiles because there's not that much in the way of heavy industry you know that would be causing it
and there's not that much in terms of of public transportation down there
but it's kind of it's
wh- what's your uh
oh god no
well that that's all right
uh now that randall's coming back next season i hope they'll be do a little bit better
but i hope they can do better
well i don't know
i kind of go back and forth uh depending on whose really hot and whose not
but uh i guess if i have uh my druthers
they're not they're not my favorite totally
but i do like them
but you know he
to be honest with you i i probably watch uh college a little bit more than i do pro
that's kind of that's kind of strange
it's too much running for me in in college football
i like i like the pros
they do you know
more you know players are apt to act a little bit different when they when their jobs and their when it's a job and not just you know when you're getting paid millions to do it you ac- i think they take it to another level
but i can see it's more you know grunted out run the ball type
who- whose that
that that that's boring for me
i i'll take the passing teams any day
well i can see i can see definitely how you get into that
i to be honest with you i find th- that too much running gets pretty boring as well
it's just it's four yards three yards eight yards tackle
that's you know it gets kind of monotonous
after awhile i i prefer forty a nice forty yard flea flicker every now and then just just to juice it up a little bit
well i think they're starting to realize that
a lot of the like the big eight teams that used to run so much i think they're starting to realize that they just can't compete anymore
you know it's all it's all money now
so uh what's d-
uh that's getting ready to start up right
uh not really
i i don't think anything will ever take over the n f l
i think it's basically you know it's it's an institution
it's just i just you know
i mean it it it can be it can take over part of it
but it's never going to be the next
but nothing really
but it's not going to be wide spread super bowl and every sunday afternoon or anything you know
it's just it's never going to reach that that standard
it's it's kind of interesting to see uh to see their claim of you know like world football
but when in reality it's really americans playing somewhere else
it's kind of it's kind of strange
uh i guess we're the only ones
actually uh i kind of like soccer
but uh i like the idea
it's it's an interesting game to watch
that's that's worse than football as far as violence i think
there's an element there's definitely an element of stupidity in there somewhere
that's why it's a go- a big college thing
because it's something a bunch of fraternity guys can get together and get a good beer buzz going and do
but it's it's pretty it's fun to play
but you know i don't think rugby will ever be professional
no i doubt it you know
but it it's it's
not at least not in this country anyway
but uh i don't know
the the seahawks are an up and down
my my it's kind of odd my roommate that i live with here he's uh he's lived in pennock minnesota
it it's a small town
it's in like central minnesota
it's a couple of hours uh west of minneapolis
i'm i'm up here for a year on an internship
but i i actually live in florida
well you know i
and i you know i i still like
i mean who who who the heck is going to root for tampa bay right
i mean i guess i could go for miami
but i don't know
so i'm i don't have a real love for miami
but i don't know
i i guess i get into pretty much
well uh i can't be terribly authoritative on what life was like thirty years ago uh
but go ahead
i mean obviously you look at at technologic- the technological aspect of of social change
i mean you didn't have uh you didn't have video games
i mean uh you you try to
you go into a a business today
and you you try to imagine the whole thing except running off of carbon paper
and it's almost inconceivable now because the xerox machines and and everything have become such you know su- such a a par- a part of the way we live
a business associate of mine was was talking about how it used to be where you would send things through the mail
and you had to do something
and so if they had business to do they had to finish it you know three days in advance so they could get it through the mail
and now it's the kind of thing where you can work up until the last minute
because you can get it there you know
in in a matter of minutes you know through a fax machine
and because of that these quote unquote convenience type items have made work that much more intense and that much harder
because you're expected to work on stuff up until the last minute
and i recently read an article on just this that said stress today is so much worse
and our grandmothers had to bake brownies
and we can throw them in a microwave for
but the more conveniences we have the more that's expected of us and we have no down time
like we don't stop and wait for things to happen because we don't have to
so we keep moving
so we have no
so that's good
but i just think our our family lives have changed
and i think that's ju-
i mean our kids where would they be without nintendo and you know their t v shows
but we have all single families
uh a lot of working
so there's a whole big effect on our kids
and not very many of my daughter's friends really are on their original mother and father
you know i'm wondering what this is going to do in ten and twenty years
well there's that
and there's the fact that you know nowadays fewer and fewer couples are deciding to have kids which generally tends to happen
i mean the u s would be actually declining in population slightly if it weren't for the fact that we
and i'm an o b nurse
and that's never really occurred to me but that's that's interesting
i saw that the numbers on that awhile back
and i was like uh-huh
in terms of the long term effect effect on on america in terms of the culture and everything i don't know
most of the of the next generation is going to be in or or an ex- ex- extremely large par- part of the next generation is going to be you know second generation f- uh from immigrant parents
and they're going to be really struggling
and i don't think that america is currently the type of environment where struggling up from the bottom is necessarily considered to be good
i mean it's no longer the the uh the accomplishment that it that it once was
and not that many people are really trying i don't think
huh well that's true
it's just very very different
and i guess every ten years it's just been very different
so and i don't know what's going to happen
uh i know what i'm seeing here at m- my job
and they've got their homes
and they've got
okay randall uh uh
do you have any special interest in uh space flight
ever since i was a young and uh used to watch the old uh apollo missions going off in uh classroom t v
uh i suspect a lot of people uh uh got uh turned on by watching watching those go off
uh very exciting
the uh uh
i've al- i've always uh w- wanted very much uh to uh be somehow involved in all that
and uh to uh meet and and to see see it actually happen
but uh that seems rather unlikely at this point unfortunately
uh computer programmer
to bad huh
made the wrong wrong career choice to get up into space
the uh uh
i used to think when i was when i was younger that uh by this time we'd have lots more in stuff in space than we do now
uh frustrating at times
well uh yo- i uh i'm kind of young
and so uh
there's a lot that's happened in my lifetime as far as uh you know with the space shuttle and all although plans to uh go to other planets have somewhat been thwarted in comparison to uh the sixties
uh although i have a
i i kind of wonder
it would be great if we could find some way to to uh use that to boost the economy
well the uh uh
i've always uh felt that uh uh one of the long-term solutions that at least a few of our problems would be to have uh some sort of uh solar power satellites up
uh because that's a uh you know in singularly renewable resource that doesn't do it that doesn't require uh uh any particularly nasty environment impact
and you can just get as much power as you need up there
uh and of course the side effects of this is that you have to have uh lunar mining bases and space stations and easy transport into space and no things that i think we should be doing
so the side effects of doing that which i think would be good you know very very good for al- for everyone in the long run is uh is it some of the other things i'd like to see happen would happen also
it seems like uh there's
so you're talking about positive side effects then
the only problem is of course that uh that requires significant commitment from people to actually decide they want to put things like that up there
and uh they're all
the only commitments that they're interested in making or even talking about are ones for flash value like uh the trip to mars
which is would would produce some useful scientific research and so forth
but the same money could probably be far better spent on uh uh lunar bases and solar power satellite research and you know so forth
it it would de- it would be being done for the uh glitz and show factor to get politician votes instead of instead of for you know
we should eventually send someone people to mars but not just because it's glitzy to do so
we should do it because for for the return we get for it
and uh unfortunately that's not what i thinks happened
i i would settle for the gli- for the glitz if the side effects were useful like the uh
but uh the downside of that is you after you do one of those people say well we did it
now let's now we're done
no need to use this anymo- to play around with this space stuff anymore
but uh i'd give almost anything to get into space
i'd i'd uh
was it john denver that that tried to buy his way on to the space shuttle
uh u- th- uh th- the only thing that annoys me is when uh people call and they uh you have solicitation calls
uh you know i would
there there's a lot of times though uh you get those calls and you know when you're sitting at home wanting to relax or or whatnot
and you know next thing you know uh someone calls and wants to sell you this or that
and it's real hard to to tell them you know that you're not interested
or you do tell them you're not interested
and they still keep asking you you know and keep badgering you about it
and that aggravates me
but i don't know that you could call that invading of invading my privacy
but but that doesn't work
because they a lot of times they dial sequentially
they get your name from uh if you enter any type of contest or anything
uh you know you enter a sweepstake in the local department store for a shopping spree or something
uh or you uh
or or like the newspapers they just dial randomly or s- and stuff
they even call the newspapers here even call people who already subscribe
and uh while i was subscribing to the paper i got so upset at them that they you call me one more time i'm going to stop subscribing
and the lo- local local papers ask them to remove your na- number from their list
and uh yeah
you call up their regular during regular hours
their uh they have a special department
uh but the uh orlando paper uh yeah they they refused to take it off of the lists
and they call every month
and when you have more than one phone number you get a call on each number you have
well let me ask you about this
here's something that uh has been kind of concerning me lately
my fiance received a bill from a a lord and taylor company
uh you know they're a they're a department store
she received a bill from them uh that she had visited some sto-
and and i think it was there in florida
that uh she had visited a store there
and uh they had this bill uh that she had bought such and such amount of merchandise uh over two hundred dollars worth of merchandise
uh and the date that that she supposedly made this purchase she was in denver with me for thanksgiving
uh and apparently what had happened is someone used her social security number
uh and and i've i've heard recently that uh uh that this is a common occurrence where people are using s- you know
they use joe blow's so- uh social security number uh and can uh potentially ruin someone's credit
if you know a person's social security number and their mailing address i- and their mother's maiden name
uh you can basically become that uh person
uh if the purchase was made mail order they should have a record of where it was shipped to and since it wasn't shipped to her address she could prove you know that it wasn't her
uh if it was some you know coming into the store and stuff then she would ha- whoever made the purchase would have had find some kind of uh you know document and uh wh-
the signature uh
and if they can't provide a signature you know they'll have to eat the charge
but if the pers- has you know their social s- her social security number i'd be real concerned that they uh that she's not uh blacklist on uh tel- what is it it's telecredit or something
uh because she won't be able to cash checks because most places verify through there
she probably won't be ab- able to open a checking account or anything without a lot of hassle
well we got it cleared up eventually
what happened uh
and their either offering a service
or they're introducing some new product in the area
and normally when they call you're either in the shower
or you're in the middle of cooking something
and you have to stop everything to run to the phone
is is that one that you're talking about
and invariably just about the time i'm going to sleep the phone tears off the wall
and you are trying to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone
you either hear the cli- as soon as you say hello you hear the click of the recording coming on
or you hear somebody all ready starting reading off a list of stuff that they've read probably a thousand times that day already
or the ones that are are generated by a computer
the they're voice activated
and you've got to say hello twice before they'll do anything
sometimes i i get them on my uh answering machine at home
so and i hate that when i've got a whole bunch of messages
and i go through them
and most of them aren't from anybody at all
and i think a law should be passed to where any of these people
i think it's great that you know freedom of speech in this country and everything
but if they're going to offer these services or these recorded message everything they ought to be stuck working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them
see i have an unlisted telephone number
but i still get all of those calls
and then some of them are speaking in a foreign language that i don't even understand
i really feel that's uh an invasion of my privacy
or i would have called for their salesman to come out
living in an apartment complex though you know you can't um you can't really stop those people from coming around even though they put up signs out front that says no solicitations uh
but they still come up to the front door and uh you know walk around
so usually what i do is i'll call the apartment manager and tell them hey there's people coming around you know
and they're trying to sell something
or or they're from a religious organization
and i really hate that
and uh gosh it was about nine o'clock at night too
it wasn't even what i would consider you know family hours
time to you know start going to bed
and uh and it was somebody from um oh what was it the uh jesus christ of latter day saints
and uh i've read a lot about uh that particular sect
and i don't particularly care for it
so i especially don't like for them to come up to my door and and try and talk to me
now i agree with their right to uh
but i think they should also respect the sanctity of the american home whether it be in a house or in an apartment
i i agree with you there
if they want to choose that particular religion that's fine with me too you know as long as they don't try and pull me in and drag me in
and and i don't like the way that they do it either
and and it's their mission that they do it
and they go out into the public
and they actually have the uh teenagers serving two years like you would say like in an army and two years in going around and doing missionary type work
and uh i don't know
i just um don't particularly care for that at all
and that that's one thing that i feel really strongly about though is uh you know people coming up to my door and especially religious organizations and wanting to uh you know to try and get me to join or you know become interested in their religion
because i have my own
now the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that says no soliciting
and i've put in
i should have i guess i should make another one that says religious or otherwise cause i still get
i don't uh i don't have i didn't go that far
but uh yeah
i probably could do the same thing uh you know
but i'm sure i could rig up something
but you know i don't think that that would stop people
i it's like they see that word
and it says go
and then reverse it
well that would be technically illegal
but i consider an invasion of my privacy
that's true um
well what else
but i remember you you talked about something
well let me think
and i thought yeah
that that kind of touched a nerve right there
but we got uh we got to talking about the uh uh people coming to you at the front door
uh pretty close to it
well i've enjoyed talking with you
well it was nice talking to you too jim
and take it easy now
so we've got to talk about music
and um do you like classic rock or modern rock or which kind
oh i guess the stuff
well no that's really when i grew up
so that's really what i like better
more like uh rock um you know like led zepplin type
so so they can get like the doors and led zepplin
and how about the rolling stones
oh that's when that's when they took toured
how about um pink floyd
so so then we got we got some same things
well i just didn't know that much about music
and i wasn't sure what kind of music
because see well i mean in the whole spectrum i'd rather listen you know
what what kind of heavy metal are we talking about
we're talking about what they what they call hard rock
like give me some examples
like for example let's see uh bad company
oh well bad cam- company's not bad
well they're like for example a c d c
and stuff like that
that's that's that's not really hard rock
i mean i i think when you say heavy metal i'm i'm thinking about like cinderella you know
well cinderella is is hard rock heavy metal
well see i don't really care for cinderella
but i like a c d c's okay
but see for example they have see what
but other bands consider it like really hard rock
it's like brash metal which all they do is like they have this guitar and they just bang at the guitar
and the guitar is set like really low
and what happens is like oh everybody gets like totally into the music
and then they start dancing around
and they just bump into each other
like like they hit each other with their shoulders
and then you knock people down
and what you do is you also try to get up on stage and jump down on top of all these other people
but that's that's what they do
that's that's what some people call like really heavy metal
and see the difference i guess between hard rock and heavy metal is that the lyrics also
like really like heavy metal wo- is considered like the words heavy metal
and like you always thought about like suicide and killing people and stuff like that
and just hard rock has
they they don't talk about that
they just talk about like life in general
que- you you're talking queen
oh oh oh okay
but but oh but you got to like queen also
because queen was real popular when i was growing up
especially uh oh god what is it a night at the opera
let's see the one that they have the the whole opera singing in the background
bo bo bohemian rhapsody
that that was great
and i pumped it up
because i mean i just love that song
that that was a real good one
but they had
that that whole record was pretty good
but then they started going downhill like everybody else
well that's true
they're they're still around
they've got a ne- new c d out
but i i wouldn't buy it
because see what happens is the old see whe-
i like i like the old rolling stones
the the new stuff's kind of more like today's rock and roll which i
well for example i used to like old phil collins
and and then what happened was that phil collins said hey i can make money a lot of money doing this
and then he came out with uh see for example his his record like no jacket required
but it was on his way of going downhill
because he said i can make a lot of money just singing alone
and then he came out with the invisible touch with uh genesis
and that really
like now i hate phil collins
because i look at him
and i say you know you were singing at this time and with these people
and you were great
and now you're singing all this stuff that doesn't matter what you what you sing or what you record
and so that's that's what gets me mad
but did did you go see that new doors movie
i guess i've been con- kind of considering it
well it it's you know it's like i was watching siskel and ebert
you know like those guys that criticize movies
and they both loved the movie right
and then one of them said well everything is great
but i'm going to give it thumbs down
and they go
because it's like the end is like really depressing
but it but it's like the movie is so well made
and the music that goes with it just picks you up see
i was never i was born in nineteen hundred sixty-nine
so i mean so for me
so you didn't really grow up with that kind of music then
but you learn to
i mean it's just that like the the sixties music's got a lot to say
i i never found out what a lot of the seventies music had too
you know i was like
now well seventies music i mean i'm like i said yo- disco i don't like disco
but i bet you were out there with your bell bottomed pants
but i was more in the late seven-
well i shou-
like mid to late seventies like between seventy-five and and seventy-nine was more my era
did did you go to college
oh that's cool
but uh no
but see i graduated high school in seventy-eight
so you know in seventy-eight you know rock was starting to get really heavy you know
and real um
so so that's what i mean
well they always say that the seventies was the lowest point in in progression ever in history
so it's like nothing happened during the seventies
the seventies i don't know what they're called you know
it's like like
the the eighties are called like the progressive years or the or you know like the technology years
but the seventies got nothing
i mean nobody cared to name it
well from now on we're going to go from the from nineteen sixty-nine when they took the first step on the moon to nineteen eighties
you're not you're not missing anything you know
well except for vietnam
and that's that's why i guess everybody
so they just don't name it
i mean it was it was i guess it was pretty bad times
well that's very true
oh well let's see
so um i'm going to leave you alone
uh what what are you doing
we're kind of i was kind of in the middle of supper
but it's not a big deal
oh i'm sorry
because see i didn't see
but i didn't have my number yet
and so you know it's okay
i i told them i'd be available during this time
so then uh have fun doing this
um what kind of hobbies do you have
um i do a lot of cross-stitching and painting when i do have spare time
oh i love it
and there's just no time
oh several years
he likes to help me design um you know projects that are
mine sort of he looks at the pattern
and he says how do you get that from there to the material
oh it's not
and once you get started on it it's just oh i just i love it
in fact i did one bill the cat you know from glenn county that uh was a real good one to do
but uh yeah
or is this mainly cross-stitching
um i do mostly that um
but now i don't know
and uh i think i have what was it two hundred
and i got to thinking the money that i've got invested in this
it yeah it can add up quick
i just i just keep an inventory of what i currently have
and then when i start a new project i go through and see if i if i you know
well now can i improvise with adding and using another color instead you know what comes close
but the colors
but you don't have much spare time either
well not lately
and that does take some time
and if we're trying to get acclimated with the uh with having a baby
and just into everything
so there's not a spare moment
oh but i wouldn't trade it for the world
and uh work on his christmas stocking
so hopefully this year he'll have one
well last year he was a little bit young for having one
oh well that's neat that you like cross-stitching also
that's that's kind of strange
oh i'm sorry
i just started about well five years ago i think
but it is peaceful
i mean it is relaxing to do once you find the time to do it
and i got one done
and i think the other one is going the child is going to be in high school before i get finished
i just i bought the cloth and the pattern for it
i didn't um i didn't buy the uh i didn't buy a kit
well i've seen the afghans in the stores that are designed for cross-stitching
it's an- cloth i think
and it has the borders and everything already
and the lady said she couldn't believe that they know that i had done it in the colors that they had decorated the nursery
and i didn't even know it
oh that's a
and she said how did you know those are the colors we used
uh that uh
lilly lilly she said she said it's for your daughter to use
my uh grandmother um made us a couple of quilts for the baby
and i was like oh i don't want to mess those up
uh there just too nice
i mean you don't get many hand made quilts anymore
well i've enjoyed this
but uh well keep up the good um
and they're none of them are recent right
so i like gordon lightfoot
and i like to listen to piano music a whole lot
and willie nelson
so you like a a variety
but not all country
i i like some of his songs though
they're they're not so they're not so sad country all the time
you know i mean they're not the the typical country where they're just you know my wife left me my dog left me you know
and my house just burned down you know
there there's a guy
but he plays wonderfully
are d- are you do you play the piano
or you just like it
and uh vowed that someone in the family was going to learn
so we all had to take lessons
and i was the one that did the least poorly
so she gave it to me
and it's sitting here mostly taking up space
but sometimes it makes you feel good to sit down and play it
and you know if you can play tunes that people can sing along to it'd be it'd be kind of fun i think
and not many things you can play that'll you know people will sit there and sing along to
and you can't sing along either
so but uh i like a lot uh
when i i don't play
oh so do i
i like a lot like
i like uh is it the new age music like with uh uh the
and you know how you put the headphones on and listen to it and i just i heard a piece
and it was just so wonderful
and then even my eleven year old boy loves to listen to it
i mean it's nice when you have a piece that that is so so peaceful
that everybody likes you know
and uh it it it it you know it has pieces that are uplifting
but it it's mostly relaxing
and you don't because it doesn't have words you know you don't feel like there's anything you have to remember you know as far as singing a song or something like that or interpreting what they mean
or but uh
i mean you can just sit
you know those little booklets that come along with it and you can just see the things that they're trying to show with music
my my little boy has gotten so into it that
he's identified the the people that have written certain songs
you know on it
oh i see what you're saying
i mean i don't even know who did which ones
but he does
i i can't identify them either
i could i know which ones come next
but i don't even know their names
but i i can identify them
but i like that
and i like uh course i i like classical music
yeah and i was in like chamber music groups and stuff
so i'm used to pieces
and and i played classical flute
i didn't play play jazz flute or anything like that
so i c- i can relate to it i suppose
but uh and i like i'm like you
because i like chicago and i like
i like uh hebert uh oh
but hebert laws a flute player
and i like uh uh chuck mangione
trying to think of all uh oh
i i like mostly the older groups i think
but we do have
and uh i like breeze
i think just because they all sort of sound they sound l- a lot like r- uh simply red
if i'm going to listen to that kind of music nowadays that's it's easy listening
so what type simply red
it's it's got people singing
but it's it's got people singing
but it's got a like a whole bunch of people singing
i i don't remember how many people
but it's it's got men and women
and it's not it's it's nice
i mean it's pleasant you know music
it's not where it's it hurts your ears to hear it
but it's not as it's not like uh chicago where it's got that much instrument to it
you know it doesn't have like all the brass and everything
well my husband is telling me we have to hit the road
oh you must live in this area
so we're in garland
well they're having a lot of recruiting this week in all the different areas
well they're not c-
you know their fall semester
and they're they've been doing a lot of that in the area
no more huh
what what do you do
well right now i'm just a homemaker
but i'm going to school uh for legal assistant
and that's what i know
so and uh just nothing basically
but i'm really interested in legal you know in the legal environment
but i don't want to be a lawyer
so i said well i think i'll go back to school and see about being a legal assistant
and it was for a murder trial
this guy had supposedly uh strangled this woman and stuffed cotton toweling down her throat and up her nose
and they had us fill out a long questionnaire
and they're going to call the ones that they're interested in from the questionnaire two to three at a time
and the trial won't take place until june
and they say it's going to last about two to three weeks
and this guy in front of me said i can't believe i was summonsed
and i was tailing the woman that was killed
well then i have a friend at school that has a boyfriend that's a lawyer
and he said that this woman
and the one that's accused was the one that actually did it
and she has since taken off with another lawyer who had been uh getting cocaine from his client and then selling it
and he had skipped bail
and they finally extradited him
and he's going to testify for the state against her so he'll have his sentence reduced
and this is the man that was in front of you
oh well they'll
the the investigator
he he got off right away
and i wrote that down on my questionnaire that he'd told me that
so i figure that that will make me biased
and i won't be chosen
but there's probably something else that might make you
because you could know about you could know about the crime but not necessarily be taken off the jury you know not be accepted for j- the jury
i mean pretty much a lot of people would know about it you know and and know some of the different things about it
but uh they they might weed you out some other way
you know if you if you don't believe like if this was a capital crime and and you don't believe in if you don't believe in death penalty you're not going to be picked at all
i said that i could believe in it in certain instances but i would be i'd find it hard to levy that against somebody
there there they would have a doubt about you
that you know
because if that's what if that's what the punishment is in that in that instance then you're always going to say you know not gui-
you're you're not going to want to have him have that cri- uh that punishment
but then when you're when you're picked
see i was picked for another murder trial before oh gosh and it's so hard because you know everybody is wanting to go on and get the sentence done
and if you're trying to hold out you know there's so much pressure on you
and you've got to come up with a decision
well especially with something where you have to f- you have to find it beyond a reasonable doubt
and it's like do you really feel that sure about
well personally i don't have any children
and i'm doing my master's at n c state so uh uh children wouldn't be very convenient for me right now
so what what how do you spend the time with your children
well both of mine are boys
they're eight and eleven and they're into sports i mean as a matter of fact that's what we're doing tonight
what what are you doing
do do they play like uh like does the eight year old play baseball
oh oh yes
we start here at uh five
and and in in his league do they have like a pitcher
or do they have a standing ball or a machine or what
so he's going to be with uh regular pitching and my eleven year old of course you know is pitching
i i used to play soccer when i was that age up in new york
and it seems like soon as that over with we get into basketball
so there's always something
and how about how about like on the weekends
or do you go out
do you go how about like for uh do you go for long vacations like a week or something when they have school off
and where do you go
have have you been out of the country
well first they always say get to know your country first before you leave
i i lived in places like
when i lived in washington uh washington d c i never went to the washington memorial
and then when i went back to visit i went to the washington memorial
you know i've heard we have a couple of friends that goes to washington quite often
and that must be the thing
they went to the memorial you know
well it's it's a beautiful city
oh i bet it is too
but the problem is like first time i went out of here and they took me to las vegas and that was the most boring place on earth
oh now my husband and i we go different places
but our child- but when we go with our children we usually kind of stay close
did uh did like did you go to disneyland
so but um now i don't know
but um but let's see
that that was fun that was
and uh then after that i
so when i was like fourteen fifteen i went i went to turkey
and this christmas i went to turkey
but basically it's a
since my parents are are well
and my parents live down there
so all the traveling i do is alone
and uh we were never much of
uh a very uh family thing you know made like go skiing in vermont or something
that was uh that was a lot of fun
but what happens is we used to fight a lot
so there's never much of a family
you know one of those hell family vacations
but we try you know i try
my husband also we're involved in everything our kids does because uh my dad died you know when i was less than a year old so i always just had a mother
so i always thought when i have kids you know i really want to be involved with them
well my dad all he all he wanted to do was get money for us
so he could buy us material things
and and to me you know it's like now i'm twenty-two
but i still feel you know
it's like yeah we never threw a football or something and the way i was brought up
and he wants me now
he like he you know like he wants to be best friends now and it's very hard for me
because you know it's like you grow up to be twenty years old
and it's always the same man and then suddenly he sees that he's getting old
and he wants to be best friends but uh you know it's like i can only express myself so much
because you know um everything that he taught me you know that my family taught me which is very hard to change that all of a sudden from one year to the next and say i'm sorry you know
it's like you know i love you
and let's go out and do things together when i don't feel like it you know and so that's that whole thing that he'll say when like like
i've seen my uncle and his family you know does everything together
and you know his kids are you know
when his little girl was five years old and everything they uh they would go to the beach
and she could go to sleep at two in the morning you know and uh i was brought up the same way
just so long as you can get up to go to class the next morning you can stay up you know
but his what he does is when he gets home he separates his work from his house
you have to i mean you honestly do
but and they have children
but their children does anything
we have to take them and you know to do it
and that really gets kind of aggravating after a while
because you're saying well i work full time too you know
but uh it's just it's just something that you know
my theory is you know when when you have kids and all you you want to do well
what i'll do is you know like
i mean you might have problems
but it's not your kids' problems you know
and you got to try to be with them as much as you can
and to you know like
thing is is that you know like if if they would ever happen to have a drug problem suppose that they could feel comfortable coming to me and saying i got a problem you know
and uh and that would make any parent feel good and bad at the same time you know
and let's see how we can get rid of the problem you know
and that's uh that's very that's very hard to do
because once you're best friends with your parents then i think everything go a lot better
and we knew time wise or and money wise too would it would not have been a good idea to had them then
my my father was raising four ki- oh well three kids before he had me
so it was uh you know
you're trying to support uh four kids
and it's pretty hard you know
and i i told him listen you could have had a lot of money if you would have only had two kids
but then i wouldn't have you
but then you would have a lot of money
but you can't take this money with us though that's how i keep looking at it
but you know like four i mean fou- four children is expensive especially when you consider like especially for me which i'm paying out of state tuition
i'm paying you know three thousand
and you know people say you know it's expensive to think it's college
but if if everybody would be a little bit responsible you know
what does it what does it cost
and they live at home you know
and well it costs two hundred dollars for books
but you know seven hundred dollars a semester
if you cou- if you can
a lot of people can spare that if they planned ahead you know like i mean it's like if you plan a year ahead you can probably save up seven hundred dollars you know one thousand four hundred dollars to send your child to college you know
oh oh excuse me
what degree i mean what are you wanting to do after you get out of college
well i i'm doing computer science computer engineering
my husband's into uh computers
and and now i'm looking for a job before they have to send me back home because since i'm an international student they want to send me back to argentina
well my dad wants me to go back
and you don't want to
because if you go back there then you can never get out
like you don't have any money to to get out
so uh and uh i was thinking you know like oh my god you know i go back there
and then and i get married there
and now i have kids there
and then i'll never leave the place you know
and that's that's what happened to my brother
and then when he went down there
he was just so bad off you know from not being able to stay up here that his life just went down the drain
well maybe something will open up for you
well at least for a year and a half i can work
well i've enjoyed talking to you
well on this subject i really hadn't had to deal with putting someone in there yet
but my mother's always been administrator of a nursing home so i've always been involved you know in one
how do you feel about them i mean since you've kind of been close to that
uh nursing homes to me
i would personally be the last resort you know i rea- you know if i had to put someone in there
well i've had a touch of experience
my um dad had emphysema and got to the point where mother couldn't take care of him
and uh she put him in
but he wasn't there very long before he died but um i guess um the one time that i saw him there you know as far as the surroundings that seemed okay
but um we kind of thought that maybe they just wanted to give him some medication to sort of you know keep him real out of it all the time and that's always kind of bothered me
well i kind of think that's true too i guess because it's so under staffed you know
but i've never actually been there and i know that she's the kind of person who wouldn't allow you know a lot of the horror things to take place that you hear about
but still i'm sure there are you know aspects to it that aren't really desirable
well my sister's involved in one also
and i really think they really do a wonderful job
but still there's those little things that happens you know there really is which
i think it's a wonderful place you know if it comes to that you know if you just can't take care of them any more
well sometimes you don't have any other alternative family and friends are usually well family's tied up with their own lives and things and usually working
and it's hard to
yeah but i think when the time comes i i hope to have the time to really look around you know and pick one that i really think my mother would be happy at
outside's awful deceiving sometimes you know
but in order to get in you have to be able to um walk in on your own
in other words you can't be in you know too bad a shape to start out with
but then if you deteriorate um they have a separate section for those who need care you know all the time
but it's always well
and they have a long waiting list too
so there's always this feeling of well golly gee you know you've got to be able to walk in the door
so you can't wait until you're too bad off but then you don't want to go do that when you don't have to because like uh you have to give up your automobile or whatever
and everything you worked so hard for all your life yeah
yeah and if you're still capable of driving and doing those things then you feel like well gee i'm you know i'm isolating myself here for no reason at the moment
so it's kind of a that's a hard one
but it is a very nice nursing home
there's also you know some private ones you know but of course i would never be able to afford to put my parents in something like that you know
and uh what i another thing i hate to see is when someone has a small amount of money and they go into one of these places and they just eat it all up immediately
but those who don't have money can go in and get the same care
so i don't like that aspect
but i there's i think there's ways around it though that you know
like they could put it in one of their children's names or something you know
but still a lot of them doesn't feel comfortable doing that
you know it's their money
you know that's how i feel about it anyway
and i i said i want you to have control of your own business
but you know what if
so naturally she's retired
but she's still on her own i mean
my mother's uh seventy-five and still has her own home and everything
and then on the other hand i've seen some people go into the nursing home and just so happy you know
some of those places have wonderful activities and things you know lots of stuff going on
and they'll take them places so i don't know
it's not all bad but i guess once you get ill then you know you really have some problems if you can't get around and do things
but i really don't know what the other solution would be you know
when the time comes i'm really hopefully we'll really look around before i decide on one for my parents really do
because i have been raised in one you know
so there's lot of things i know to look for
and i don't think they'd want to go where they used to work either you know
that might be kind of tough huh
and like i said my sister's still in it
and i really don't think my mother'd want to be there either
well it's been nice talking to you
well you too
and i guess we'd better get back to work huh
well in the norman- in a normal route of way we do things how about the ladies go first
um well i uh have a four year old who will just be entering public school next year
so i'm really just starting to get involved in uh in what's out there and how they do things
um as far as the system as a whole i really don't see a problem with it
i do see a problem with graduating people that that can't read and are not you know productive in society or productive to themselves
and uh i think that's the main problem at this point
i 'm live in plano texas
uh today we're not even suppose to be in school because the uh the way the taxation and all that crap is there really legally isn't any funding for the school systems in texas today
so uh i mean when you when you take uh uh professionals and put them in situations they have to make decisions based on money to fund public education
and they can't get their finger out of their ear long enough to to get that major subject in line
so i think here in texas mainly that the the they're not serious
they're more serious about what the salary should be for senators than they are for what how the level of education should be for children
so i'm not i'm more opinionated about the observations than than the true facts
it's just a shame to me that that the our firemen our policemen and school teachers are the three least paid utilities um that have the biggest impact to our well-being
i have i have a real issue with that
um i think that if from every year when they when they pull in the the the uh test that the last three years you know ten eleven twelve year uh graders take
and and then you see that their education is below the norm throughout of all fifty states
i have a real concern about that um
uh verses having her go down here and not learn anything
and then uh so i'm my opinion i think there's a big concern
hope hopefully the new uh education secretary of education will do something to fix the problem
but uh i don't know
they've got to quit worrying about uh the uh religious uh overtones in our textbooks and get on with teaching the product
i think they get bogged down in a lot of small issues that people you know special interest groups can blow up
and uh and not really get down to teaching what's important
teaching these kids you know how really the basics is what it comes down to
i was astonished to find out that that across the united states in all public schools it is not mandatory for them to take phys ed
ha- they don't even a lot of the school systems don't even uh the kids nowadays don't even know what what the president's fitness education program is all about
and uh i talked to a thirteen year old last night who 's uh goes to uh one of the plano high schools or junior highs i guess
and she said that she had a choice
so she choice to take weight lifting
i mean give me a break
i mean the kids sit there
and they and they drink cokes and eat popcorn for for lunch
it's just a real i have a real problem with the whole system
they need to put some sternness back into the into the teachers and let them be able to uh get the old whip out and get some discipline
then it comes down to what you said before though about them being some of the lowest paid public you know public service
and yet they're so important
i used to i used to date a girl who taught english at ninth grade level
i mean i was absolutely flabbergasted at what they wo- what she was paid
she was young you know
but still it's the principle
well you know it's hard though because then you start talking taxes
oh taxes lord forbi- lord forbid taxes
goodness gracious if we would uh plan our expressways a little better that ten dollars for the bridges and the roads we'd cut that in half and get some teachers we might have us a problem
maybe i should run for office huh
run on that then no income taxes in texas huh
well that's about all i have here
well me too
i uh i think we both agree there's some problems there
so do you have any hobbies
well right at the present time nothing real special
and i'm kind of into camping and you know vacationing that sort of thing
i'm an avid gardener oh
um i consider that a hobby
they were like suggesting like handcraft things which
i guess that's a really true true hobby
but i i think anything that you enjoy
um it doesn't really have to matter
i mean it could be working on cars could be your hobby really
i i guess if you make money at it it becomes a vocation
well i don't know
because it always seems it goes wrong when you try to do something
um well right now we um start our seeds inside
well we usually start them right in the house
and and the wi- and a wind storm come and knock it down
but she's had really good luck
i mean i- ca-
well actually it if you if you start it in a couple weeks and you can get your plants outside pretty much the end of may
you might put them in the ground just the first week of june but we can put potatoes in the ground in the middle of may
i've i've lived in in texas and new mexico most of my life
but i did once
and i i remember that it was on into may before it really started warming up
well well we live we live really close to lake champlain which is in the champlain valley
so we're a little we're about two weeks ahead of everyone else out on the outskirts
because that kind of moderates the weather a little bit
and he gets frost
you're right across the uh lake from what plattsburgh
i had i had a cousin that was stationed there plattsburgh for a while
he he remembers lots of snow
it's uh it's uh depressed economically
oh really oh
when you go across the lake um
and they've never had well they've had layoffs recently
but when we got hired here no no never any layoffs never never
and now we're looking at serious
i i mean i'm a technician
well i'm i'm working for t i texas instruments down here
well i interviewed with them
but i didn't want to go to texas
even though my um mother's people are from georgia
well i guess we have to get back to hobbies since
well interesting thing that i do is with gardening uh
and you can make fl- uh dried flower arrangements
and you can get real handy with the hot glue gun
and we made some really nice christmas wreaths with uh dried red flowers and dried white flowers and uh eucalyptus
yo- you know what eucalyptus is
the they s- uh it's sold in the hobby stores and nurseries
at first i'm like oh how why do people like this
but it it is kind of a nice smell after a while
and i'd wonder what is that
and then one day i i realized that it was eucalyptus
it's it's it's uh like a fad thing
i i don't know
it's i've never heard of it
it it looks really po- potent stuff
but uh it's yeah i think it's the greatest stuff in the world though
they i make all kinds of things with it
i i almost want to start a business doing it
but i don't i i'm so uh timid when it comes to starting a business
that's that's a big step
especially with the being in on the creative a- aspect and the crafty end
you know after a while you make some stuff
go boy this this is kind of ugly
but i know someone who does a lot of woodworking for a hobby
um he does it believe it or not i wouldn't imagine why but to get out of the house away from his wife
because he's a seasonal worker
and up here it's almost a pattern
and you see your fathers do it
and uh this guy was going nuts
and his uh son built him a garage and got him some uh oh i don't know what the equipment's called but planers and things and s- set him up
and h- he makes
all kinds of furniture for um his kids
and he makes uh uh like little kids' furniture
there was a program on t v down here on the educational channel here a while back about a lot of little little companies of one and two guys you know up there
espec- this particular one i think was in maine and new hampshire where out in the just kind of out in these little towns they'd be in
you know they've they've got twelve weeks to do something
and they they're making furniture and just you know things like that during the winter
and then they go off and do other things during the summer
it's a it's a really
and plus it's keeping his marriage
so and and plus he's getting on in his years now
he's he's not that old
but he's getting to the point where he needed an extra boost
to to do something like that
and uh it's really it's it's uh hard work
i couldn't imagine taking lumber raw lumber and trying to make something out of it
that would be really t- you know
like say the
he d- he dowels everything
and it's all got to line up
and uh i don't think he goofs too much
i don't to see too much scrap around
that's that's something
now our temperatures down here we're starting to get pretty consistently in the seventies and eighties and uh so and uh so as far as you know planting outdoor stuff matter of fact tonight i just got through i was planting some some trees out back tonight
and uh this is uh it's really nice
almost hated to come you know
is it going to be is it going to be really dry
uh are you pl- are you
these were uh
so the the cold weather can kill them but i guess
trees that that wintered
i do- don't know where they came from
and they come down here
and they'll sit in the nurseries here
and they'll go ahead and and uh leaf out
so what i'm planting or actually transplanting is a tree that's or trees that are already leafed out
oh that's good
i guess they they say you can plant them in the spring or the fall all
let them winter you know through the fall
but uh down here well it's done both ways
it it just kind of depends on what you're what you're planting
but uh all the shrubs and
my sister does uh flower gardens
and i guess a lot of people do do do that
she's got like just a small patch of lawn and just flowers and mulch ba- tree bark all over her lawn
flowers during the summer down here the the normal kind of flowers there's very few of them that will really do well
everything does real well here in the spring until about oh first part of june
and then the re- the heat sets in
and june july august are you know
most of the those kind of plants just are just barely staying alive let alone make flowers
or is it
uh we're in a relatively new area
we're kind of out of uh the natural tree area
so you don't have a lot of tree coverage
we're kind of up on a on a higher on a slope
so we don't have
because goi- going to make
this was this was this was pasture land
but down the down the hill here a little ways there are parks that are look like jungles you know
see um uh where my uh well my grandmother passed away but where aunts are they have these huge pecan trees
and they just shade everything
uh it's in georgia
it's yeah it's right outside of macon
and and it's just a
i like the way that i like the way that idea of the south is
but when i think of texas i think of nothing but no trees and just grass
well i tell you what
now see east texas
the two cities are very very identical
so if you were familiar with atlanta uh
so it's that dry heat
uh well no
it's it's uh not dry at all
it it's humid
well where is it
is it hous- wasn't it houston's humid
hu- houston is awful
well ironically enough i'm sitting here with a cast on my leg because i resumed an aerobics class the night before last
that's what the nurses kept saying as they laughed all the way you know down the hallway
well off and on
but i've been going over to the fitness center
i my husband's a t i in the unit here
well i try to go over there at least three times a week
and i try to walk um at least five times a week
and if this is getting to
but i'm just curious
when you go over there does it bother you in terms of how things are arranged either at the dallas location or the spring creek in terms of there's so much it's so much of a weight orientation weight lifting et cetera
uh well i've been going to spring creek
i haven't been to the dallas one now in oh a couple of years
so i don't really
it- well it's not that great
and i go to the spring creek one on and off
but my husband's working over there
and he just goes to the dallas one
but i just don't
i mean it's just so much weight lifting
or is that what your into
well i've used the nautilus equipment
and the pool when it gets warmer
and the pool
well what i did was i went to a jazzercise class in a new location in richardson near where we live in north dallas
and long story short i hadn't
but they have like the gymnasium flooring
and then like they had about three feet of linoleum around the perimeter in the back where i usually stand in any class like that i go to
instead of having that level you know they had a chrome strip that wasn't level
and it was about four inches deep and then about oh a seventy degree angle
oh my goodness
and as we were jumping around or doing something i just jumped up and came right down on it
the orthopedist called it a uh basketball injury where the ankle just rolls under you and it snapped
we went to well whatever in plano
and the emergency room was like a bad comedy show
and the doctor said you didn't do anything
and wednesday night the radiologist called me at work
and uh i was on crutches
and he said i think you better call an orthopedist
so we went to one
and he just put a big old cast on it
well i like aerobics
but i'm not so sure that
well not that much though
but i've never i'd you know i was pretty much in shape walking
and and you know this is one of those things
like this orthopedist said he said you'd be surprised how many basket- how many people come in here with things like that because they are active
you know i was real embarrassed
but i felt kind of stupid
i mean i guess i'm glad you know that um nobody really noticed
because i got up and started jumping on it again
and i do it because i like it
i mean i like the music and that kind of stuff
but i've been unable to do that because i hurt my foot about five years ago
actually i was up on a ladder and uh fell off
and when i came down i hit with my full weight on my foot but on concrete
they had well they had to go in and do surgery
oh so the aerobics the impact would not be good
as i permanently damaged the the cushion under my heel the normal cushion that you have there
oh that makes sense
so i mean are you in terms of other things like like not running but playing a little bit of tennis or can you not do stuff like that at all
uh well i haven't tried that
it's been i bet it's been thirty years since i played tennis
because i notice in aerobics a lot of the women that don't look like they shouldn't be doing certain things i'm always afraid they're going to fall over and have a coro coronary
and there was my ego when i went ahead
and i went oh i can do that
and half the time though i don't jump half as much as
i mean like i'm real tall
and you know i'm not heavy
but when you go easy a hundred seventy at my height um i'm five eleven you need just take it easy
um but when i see some wo-
i mean and i just don't think it's healthy
it isn't really it's not really good for your knees
and i don't know
because i wasn't familiar with the
well the floor was uneven
oh it was completely
i mean it literally
the two dissimilar floor lev- floor coverings were not level
and at first after it happened i thought maybe that's a handicap access
and then i said no
and my husband being a t i engineer
one thing that i like like swimming you like that a lot
i like i liked it because i want to
and it's real funny because if you you know
but it's the other way around
and i need all the help i can get
he says he said uh you're at thirty something
but you're on the upper side
he says even if you weren't doing anything your body would start that would start to happen to you
because i was saying to him i said i'm not that heavy
i'm not heavy you know
i said uh why do i feel like i need to start pushing myself more
and he goes human nature
and then you know you see these little girls in these little bitty things
and they're all like twenty-one years of age
but luckily at there's a little more diverse clientele
but you know sometime when i ask i just feel like boy am i stupid or what
well that's one thing i like about the spring creek place
at least the fellow that's there one of the fellows that's there at night and on weekends is real helpful
and his name is b j
i don't think i've ever i think i've
i've been there like maybe a dozen times
but i actually like that site better than the other one just because of the type people that go to
um sometimes i feel like i'm in a singles bar
and i haven't noticed that up at spring creek
and i just uh
and i'm glad they did that
um you're not missing anything at the dallas renovated site
but if you don't live near there that's not worth
but it's about half way between the spring creek and the the dallas site
but it's all the same to me
and as we were doing it too everybody noticed that there were all these big guys of assorted nationalities
oh great i have purple tights on you know
and they're going yes
but in general i like to exer- i i like dance a lot
so i mean aerobics is something i'd hate to give up
but he he kind of said something to me about probably not as bad as your foot
but he just said to me maybe you ought to try bicycling
not anything you know
but that's just
but i just
i couldn't you know adjust that
you know more about this stuff than i do obviously then
well you're walking okay now obviously
and you can
but it matches one if i have one on the other side
well anything else about exercise we can talk about
well other than i need to go
i don't know um
well my husband and i haven't done a whole lot of camping
we but we bought a van last year
and we were hoping uh to do some camping in the van um
we did go camping in arkans- not arkansas oklahoma
uh last year in we camped in a tent
and uh there were two other couples with us
and there was uh state park
and it was really nice
um up here some of the state parks are really nice
and some of them aren't
they they just have like outhouses
they don't have like a shower room or anything
but some of them are really nice
um but i don't know
i i've been camping a couple times
but i'm not a real avid camper uh
but um i don't i don't
i i don't like really camping in the rough
i like the the the little necessities like having electricity available and running water and showers and things like that
we went we went once to a lean-to
and it um
i mean there wasn't any electricity on the camp site
but it was all right
i wouldn't want to go for like a week
that would that would be much
um especially there was a little store close by
so it was pretty nice
and there's a lot of boating out there
and we we went up there to hopefully be able to get on the water a little bit
but it was still uh it was still too cold
it it was pretty early in the year
up here you got to wait until aug- august until the water warms up
well it's not that bad
but it's still pretty chilly
um i don't know
i was i have a tent
and i fluff out in it in the backyard and stuff
but this thing about camping that bothers me is you've got to pack everything
and another thing is the thing seems to get
so you can't keep the dirt out of the tent
like stay out
we we have we have a dog
and that's just about as bad as a kid
and use it as a play uh
i don't know how you can really keep uh the inside of a tent clean
other than you know taking your shoes off right before you walk in or something and and sweeping it out everyday it's really hard to to keep the sand and dirt out of it
well what we were doing we were just going to say we're just going to sleep in the tent and hang out at night so you know no going in and out and or what he wants to do
plus you get it all wet
um did you have another a big tent like uh um like a looks like a sitting area type you know like a two room type
but you know i was just thinking of getting one those for the yard because they are really nice
and um up here we have uh we have quite a few mosquitoes at nighttime
we don't really have a problem with that um in these areas um
and even even when in oklahoma when we camped i really didn't notice a problem with bugs
and i noticed that
i've i've lived back east before um they
uh but there's this one campsite that it
but there is one that's out in this big lake
and it's it's it's mosquitoes are terrible
and then there's this there's this other one that's more up in the mountains
but it surrounds a man-made reservoir
and there's no bugs
that's the whole thing that everyone told me oh
i'm i was going to go to lit- little river state park
because uh we were having a really big problem up here in certain areas
we were really affected bad by it but really got it um
almost destroyed the ch- the tourism in one town because of the mosquitoes
that was it's a really nice area
i i couldn't imagine ge- living just sixty miles north of them
but they were plagued they were plagued with them with mosquitoes
and you can go out outside in the daytime all right
but the minute the sun went down um that's when it's usually the minute the sun sets the mosquitoes come out
i mean just the very second
they uh they must uh work on that you know
the i- it gets cooler when the sun sets
and then they all come out
well have you ever have you ever taken any of those um what do they call this lights
but um because that wasn't really
i really didn't get to use them like oh there's mosquitoes let's turn them
and um we weren't bothered that much by mosquitoes
so we didn't really contribute it to that
but um i think in an area that's really thick with mosquitoes
i can't see all this little uh smoke buckets i call them
but they're suppose to work really well
oh i'm in my paperwork here
but i don't know i don't know if i'm going to go
and i could really talk about like gardening or something
but um i do want to go again
we just moved to a new hou- into a house
so i don't think camping
but i don't see going on a camping trip probably until next summer
i'd i'd like to go camping cross-country um
so we don't have any any children yet um
so it's easy for you to go
so easy to pick up and go and s-
and we can just throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back of it
um oh god
so it's not really i guess camping the way peop- most people picture camping in the tent
but that sounds that my my kind of camping it really does
okay um well um
that is is to have a a nice vehicle where you can have everything in it plus your tent
or or get
and he just he just tows it behind his truck
and he he's got three kids
so his kids will sleep in the truck in the in the back of the bed
um and they sleep in the pop-up
well those they're kind of nice
but they're also um flimsy when you really look at them
but when you get inside they're really nice you know
but then when you look underneath them it's just got these little wheels and this little axle
it's like oh my
and then a big windstorm it would pick you up
he did have a problem uh when he went camping last year in beavers bend ok- oklahoma um
a a storm came in
and it started raining really heavy
and they were all everybody was trying to flee the campsite
what do you what do you do when you get a i mean like a really violent storm like a tornado
i mean i wouldn't stay in the um
well theirs was so bad
and they were so close to the water that the water was coming up
and they had to get out of there
so then were they successful
they yeah they were
but it took them a little while
so did they get stuck
they ended up helping several other people though that were that were stuck
well so they evacuated it
they the whole the whole campsite was evacuated
i mean some i think some people that had fairly sturdy um vehicles or whatever if they had like a winnebago or something and they were farther in away from the water i think they stayed
but everybody that was real close to the water ended up
i know i always i like to get right on the water
like i say they're kind of just kind of more sturdy than anything you know
they're they're lean-tos
yeah they're pretty nice
they're they're uh it's like a little house except the whole face is open
and the one time that we went we got one
but it was a big embankment
and it was really it was neat sitting there watching it
i mean it was raining
when we called home everybody said oh we were worried about you in that storm
well i have a lot of different teams that i like to to keep in touch with
i mean uh you know you can't live in dallas without you know
well uh i originally came from saint louis
so uh the saint louis cardinals are one uh
see i have i have a tendency to a adopt teams when i wen- go to a tea- uh go to a town
well it's helpful
so uh i lived in kansas city for a couple years
and i adopted the royals
so i adopted the uh uh the houston astros
so i mean you know i've got quite a few
well do you keep up with the statistical stuff
i don't i don't get into that too much
eve- every once in a while i will keep in in touch with maybe like who's in the top five of hitting or something like that
but i don't get into you know how many errors somebody has or things like that
well there's there's a guy on that was on show that i listen to going to work in the morning who does uh uh
it's essentially trivial statistics but they've got a st-
and apparently the rangers last year won a lot of one run games
well i didn't know that
that's supposed to be a real good statistic uh
well it it it is
but it's the it's it's a reverse indicator
well that's true
they don't have the offense to uh to get out or to have the the more runs
well what the what the argument is
and it it it it's one of these statistical
but they find that tha- tha- there's a connection between that and how they do in spring training the following year
and uh it's strangely enough it's almost like the law of averages catches you on the following year
which means that if you have a good year winning one ru- one run games that the following year you'll have a bad year
and they they've got um they've looked at i think twenty-three teams uh
and and the uh statistics are something like twenty-one out of twenty-three
well i mean and it's uh uh
what do you what do you think of incaviglia's loss
i kind of think it was necessary
i mean i i- i- i don't i'm not a a big um pure power hitter anyway
i mean i don't like these guys that get up there and swing for the downs every time
i mean uh i think that uh that a player ought to hit a home run if he's got the pitch to do it
but when you get two strikes on you you have a tend- you know you should you know shorten your swing a little bit you know
but i mean you know the strike outs were a big problem for him
and uh plus supposedly what i heard he was not much of a team player anyway
well it it's an interesting concept though when you look at uh of of how baseball how apparently
and uh and the point of of i guess
i don't understand the the strategy of how baseball works
but it seems that you know they can sign him tomorrow
and he could go in the team the next day
and and and they put him in the lineup
and he hits a home run
and all of a sudden he becomes a hero
well that's true
and and all he has to do is hit the ball
i mean you're not a-
and all he has to do is one you know hit it once
he can he can stri- he can swing a couple times
it's an interesting uh an interesting concept of of how they do it
but i agree with you
i think that i think that's part of what uh baseball needs more of
i uh i i guess what bothers me is is that when you go um you wait and wait and wait
and finally a guy gets up there and blasts a home run
and that's all the game is
well there's there's another point to that too
they said the that um that he was horrible at uh at batting with with men on base
now having somebody get up and hit a solo home run does you you know gives you run obviously
but i mean if you can't do it with men on base there's something definitely wrong um you know
you you've got to be able to get the two and three run home runs you know to to be able to uh score enough runs to be able to win in these uh in this day and age
they have they have several pitchers that had badly years last year
and they are they're these uh cycle pitchers
they they pitch one year bad one year good one beer bad one year good
saberhagen has won uh supposedly the cy
i think he won cy year uh two out of three years
and uh you know so he's very much due for a good year
well are they going to beat are they going to beat oakland
well now see that's a good question
i that's i don't know how oakland's going to react to being uh swept in the world series last year
they could very easily uh take that as a challenge which is the way most teams nat- you know naturally do
uh and and just go out and not give anybody a chance to beat them
well i go to saint louis from time to time
and i watch i i watch their sports up there
and they're uh they're certainly intense about the cardinals they
baseball is there is there life up there like football is down here i think
y- did you actually live in saint louis
ye- everybody does right
i had a friend from college that lives in uh
it's well i should say on the west side
i mean everything's on the west side
uh out that way
and i went and visited him
but anyway it is interesting
well how are the cardinals
i i definitely do
um from what i hear from everybody up there they're not going to have a good year because they let too many people go
but i've been following spring training
and they're like one of the best teams in spring training so far
well is that a good indicator
that well it can be
it it really kind of depends on on um what they were you know what they were looking for
in other words if if in spring cra- training they were looking at all their kids like a lot of them do um then it really doesn't give you any indication
but if they were uh playing the people that they're going to play then that might be pretty good indication
so you know it's it's not a great indication because there have been teams that have just you know come out and just won all kinds of games in spring crani- training and then gone on a you know fourteen game losing streak in the first of the season
you know what i think is remarkable is uh
it seems that what you really need to do to win though is to have a team that has reasonable talent and has some people that have have have real breakthrough years
and and the question is how do you forecast that
if you had to if you had to bet on who would be in the world series i mean it would be really tough
th- i think the best thing that you can do is go with um the players that are that have the talent to do the best years and um that they hadn't had these uh gigantic uh career years yet and and just kind of assume that you know so- one of them is going to break through eventually
so and i i think they said the reds um
you know and and so they may be even be- better this year
well well when are the rangers going to come through th-
uh that's a good question
the rangers have a have a pitching problem
and whether or not they can fix that or not is going to be an interesting question
they're doing the right thing though uh
they're letting their farm system uh build up and stuff like that
well is there enough money
i don't know if you read skip bayless but
a a local commentary
his argument is that uh the ownership is not inclined to lose big money long enough to to bring in the big dollars
um that's probably true
would you would you agree with that
well considering what i've seen in the last uh you know two seasons i'm beginning to agree with that
but i mean you don't have to spend the big money as far as i'm concerned to uh to win
and i think that's really what's been hurting uh the uh rangers
they they spent more money
well didn't kansas city put up quite a bit of money for their pitching staff
last year than any other team in the in the league
and they were you know toward the bottom of the league
uh so it's like i said spending money doesn't guarantee you uh winning a pennant
well and that i think that's maybe part of it that that the um
and it you know
but the question of losing big big money that what did did did steinbrenner actually make money on the
uh you got me
i you know i think that there's coming to a point real soon when ticket prices are going to be to the point where the average fan can't go
and once you do that you lose everything
well it's it it yeah it's a little bit like any other sport you know
when it starts costing you fifty or a hundred dollars to go to a game and uh you know i mean i i guess as we get older i- you're probably going
if if you if you compare to go to a a sport a a
say you go to a rock concert
or or even a performance a an opera or the symphony or something uh
if you know i-
but how how often do you do that
i i i would i would think baseball probably feeds on a number of people that can go out there you know several times a
that that's the whole point
there are so many games in in a year that they've got to have repeat customers
and you know that's one of the things that i think saint louis has done um
their you know their ticket prices are you know kin- i guess as high as anybody else's
but what somehow or another they attract uh so many people from som-
i mean they're a it's a small market
and yet they attract as many if not more than most uh uh most other cities
but don't you think there's a there there are older fans there
i i don't mean older um you know
the fact that that it's it's a better established and that the the city is is is more of a
well i'm only a little bit familiar with the red sox because i lived up in boston for a while
and um and that's
oh now come on
but um i understand a little bit about the texas rangers
and that um
i heard a joke on the radio yesterday that in regard that he didn't design the patriot missile system
and uh the radio's kind of cruel
i mean think the he this chain that must have been on president bush to bounce the first pitch off the ground
i mean goll- how humiliating for a man to do that any man
but at the same time i don't know it's pretty far to throw that far
but he's a man
but um i never
a major owner of our t- of the team here
he's like i thought he was the owner
but it turns out my mom said that he's part owner
but he must own the biggest chunk
because that's all you hear about is if you know about neal bush i think is his name
see i even know his name because he's on the news a lot
and i never had to watch the news not you know not like some people hour and a half a day or anything
and i've been watching uh
and so if i've been watching the french news
speaking of bush we're going to get a little off topic but speaking of bush they that had a story where he went to visit some little uh elementary school students and stuff
oh i saw that
did you see that where he the guy asked him for proof of who he was
and see a credit card
i i i don't
and he said
but i didn't see it
that's about my extent of um about baseball
well i can tell you
because my brother was supposed to go to the opening game
and i couldn't tell you who pitched
but they won
and then somebody else lost
but i don't even know if they're still new york yankees
well but it
the- then they can have them play against each other
i think it's still the new york yankees you know
the texas rangers they they lost i think
but i know that last year
we got free tickets because someone at our church one of the deacons at church um parks cars at the mansion at turtle creek which is like one of the uh the places and stuff
and he's their head chauffeur
you'd be sh- i was shocked
but anyway someone gave an iranian a tip of four rangers tickets last year
and then the iranian couldn't
so he gave them to alan
and alan and his dad had plans that night
so they gave them to us
so he decided that some wealthy man tipped this iranian
and we ended up with them right
and so we were
and i looked at my husband
and i said you know what kyle this is the mansion at turtle creek a tip
and so we ended up on first base right down there on the floor
we they called us at five
and the game started at seven
so we just threw everything together ran over and got the tickets and walked
and so we took two kids with us
and nobody brings two children in these seats you know because
and you just sit down
and all the girls were all dressed up you know
i just was there you know
i'm here you know
and uh it was just kind of funny
because you know but we got to sit by first base
if they did hit a ball i would have been afraid it would have knocked my face in you know
but we went last year
because my brother my brother is impossible
when um he does football leagues and baseball leagues and all kinds of stuff
and if there's a game on he's watching it
i mean that's all there is to it
and he's like glued at the t v
oh i'm glad my husband's not like that either
and um see he goes to a lot of games
but he tries to go
so my brother's wife and my husband and i went
you know being a non-american you want to see what a baseball game is like
and he describes it as you sit there in a crowd
but you sit there in a crowd
and you're waiting and waiting and waiting
and you eat these lousy the hot dogs
because we made him try a hot dog you know
and um so you sit there
and you wait for the longest time really bored
and then all of a sudden something happens
but you happen to look the other way during the time
and so you're basically you sit there and wait for something exciting to happen
and when it happened he missed it
um he grew up out well he grew up in
i have a i had a friend in college from strasbourg
and my cousin lives in paris
and she's lived there for like oh off and on for twenty years
oh is she still there
that's one of the um entrances to the periphery to get in and out of the city
and it it it it sits right at the limit
but um we met in paris
and they have twelve children
oh my god the poor woman
and she just liked having kids
and she's thin
and i mean
i mean i'm not kidding you
and um and they're all eight and under
but they're not condemning you
we only have one child you know
they don't say they don't put on bad or anything which is good because it would be easy i'm sure for them to do that
and you think everyone should have it
and so i'm real proud of them because they're aren't really they don't do that at all
and there's ten tooth brushes in there
and i always give her a hard time who's toothbrush did you really use this morning
but how do they afford to even have the kids uh
and they tithe
and so they
i think that's the key in he like his sales last year
but last year he made
i mean it was the biggest thing that any one in this company had ever done
and he got to do it
and so god just really blesses him in ways like that
and and some people you know we think of blessings as nice furniture and things like that
but kids are just as much of a blessing inside these material things
but it's a different kind
and a lot times people think oh well i'm not blessed
but you've got five kids you know
and he's you know
and the kids at bible talk about anything
but training and training is different than anything else
in in psychology doesn't address it
a lot of the psychology stuff the good stuff that's in psychology it just comes out of the bible
and they don't quote you the proverb out of it
but the things that work in psychology other the years that they've proven to work they just come out of the bible
and so this book it just really all these things and how to train the child
so they're not going to be a curse to you when they're thirteen
what i mean how to train them so they're going to be a blessing
and so you know they do that
and they they just live lean pretty much
they don't she doesn't shop at foley's you know and stuff like that
but a lot women die or shop at foley's
i i don't know what foley's is
and everything's pretty expensive
and you know you just can't do that
and you don't go to baseball games as much
or you get pictures like we did
you know what i mean
you do these fun things you know in other kinds of ways
and i know manhattan's real expensive
but um it's kind of a different situation because you're probably living in an apartment right
well that makes a really big difference
but but still it's just as hard as having that
but your cousin could have a baseball team with twelve kids
and right now we don't have a girls' league because i'm the one that's supposed to start one
and i just haven't gotten around to doing it
but everybody wants to do it
but you know god's sitting on my heart
and i just hadn't gotten around to doing it
but anyway so they could really only have four members on the team
but um then you didn't believe me about her kids
are the they are so good
but she does work with them
and it's a commitment
and that that's what they're called to do
i admire someone that can do that you know
i most of my friends have three or four kids
and they feel like you know that's really why god
and some of the people in our church use birth control
and some of them don't
well this is a good subject isn't it
um i don't know what we're going to do about it
but but it's certainly something that has a lot of things to talk about
um you know when they say the middle east
and there's so many different problems there
uh what do you want to concentrate on
well uh i'll tell you something
um i i have a sister-in-law from israel
and and they're really quite uh arrogant about it all
they they believe that they they belong there
and they've belonged there forever
and the palestinians and the arabs are uh more or less
they they consider them second class
so they're really quite arrogant about it
i don't uh i don't know if that contributes to the problem
well how did they feel about the uh the united states interven- intervening
did did they
oh uh i'm i'm sure this is the one time that the israelis are really happy to have their big brothers the americans
but i didn't really talk about that with her
she um um my sister-in-law now lives in um switzerland
but um when they were living in israel it was it was the the palestinians they they come in an
and they're they're nothing but really servants for them
and they really treat them like second class citizens
they they don't really want them around
but they like them around because they do all the menial labor and such
but they they really do
and i don't know being
i i live in uh vermont
and being up here we pretty much treat everybody you know as someone that has merit even if they're poor or if they're hispanic or if they're black
we give everybody pretty much the benefit of a doubt because we don't see all the crime and all the hurt in the big cities you know
i- if i lived in washington d c i think i'd have a different attitude about black people
because i've heard that it it the they're terrible you know
and here you know all all my black friends are professionals
and they're they don't you know they don't go out and abuse drugs
and they they send their kids to school
and they they they uh you know really encourage them to go to college and stuff
so it's just a different world
well i live in san antonio
and fifty percent of the population is minority
oh um i talked to someone about san antonio
and um they said that they they have you have quite the problem with uh the ghettos
but i- it's it's i don't think it's any different of a problem than any other major city
but i heard that sa- san antonio unlike like like a city like san diego it se- it just has a really bad problem
and i don't think uh as far as gang violence and things i don't think it's any worse here than in houston
like say houston
now i would now me not even knowing anything about houston i would think that it's a pretty calm city
oh my um
like i wer- we're so protected up here
it's it's really strange
i mean our red light district i mean uh you could go walking around down there and pretty much not fear for your life you know
and we're just so protected
but it's it's over in the mid east especially israel it's just like israelis have a like a totalitarian system when it comes to the palestinians
you know the israelis can do anything they want
but when it comes to palestinians if they're out in the street at night it's it's really looked on as odd
um usually they're they're bussed in to the the um jewish neighborhoods and the jewish cities
and then at night they're bussed out to the occupied territories
so they don't have that
but uh what do you think about the mess that's we've created in iraq
i think it's unfortunate uh as far as the kurds are concerned
but you don't want to get so directly involved that you're occupying the the country
we can't get involved in their civil war um unfortunately
but we've kind of driven these people out
but you see president bush is telling them rebel you know uh uprise
and that's what they did
and now they're like asking him for help
and he's like no we can't get involved
he uh agreed with um the general schwartzkopf
he said um he should have let bush should have let him finish his job
he should he should have let them um corner the republican guards
well i think the war ended too soon
e- everyone i talk to they says you know
we we didn't damage enough of their arsenal
but we we should have gotten made sure we got everything
i don't think the higher ups were thinking about wh- what this guy's going to do with the rest of his war machine
they're going oh well it's not going to hurt us
so we're just going to let them go
but really we didn't think about the people that he was going tr-
and i mean he he's just
unfortunately though the the original goal of the mission was to drive them out of kuwait
and once that was accomplished
they yeah they they did they stuck right to their goals
and the american people when this first started they were even reluctant to let them do that
so they were they were playing it very safe
but you know it an ounce what do they say an ounce of hind sight is worth whatever
th- they i don't know they it schwartz- schwartzkopf knew what had to be done
and it's too bad that he just didn't have the ability just to do it to you know the uh the go ahead to do it
because he had the fu-
because i didn't realize that um
i mean i feel really sorry for these people
and you knew this
and if you were in your house they were going to take you and beat you
of course you're going just going pick everything up that you can carry
and you're going to run
and it it's just too bad that we couldn't see that
i just have a feeling that the military involvement isn't over yet that i i still feel like there's more to come
well you know what i was hoping
i was hoping iran was going to take a very um dramatic stand and invade you know
and then like iran's the big bad guy you know
but really if if they were going to save people's lives
but i i you know i almost swear i'm kind of disappointed with the iranians
i mean i don't know if the kurdish
but i don't know
i think they have a bond with the the kurds
i i think they should have just done more uh
and maybe if the world could have given them some type of aid
it's it's just so complicated
i was real surprised that israel stayed out of it as as much as they did
knowing them they're very um oh
i'm going to protect my family you know
so i i was amazed too
i was really i was really um proud of them though that they stayed out of it
it and from from what i can tell if they had gotten into it it would have started a whole new war
i was i
that that um the egyptians would pull out
and i just saw atomic bomb
uh i have uh i guess a lot of thoughts about the vietnam war um
i i guess i feel like i was pretty young while it was going on
and so there's probably a lot of things i remember and a lot of things that i really didn't have a clue as to what was happening
um looking back like maybe some of the things that i know now i i'm not sure i do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives
because i because we never went to war
and i i feel like it went on and on
and i i guess i see such a contrast like as opposed to the middle east war we just had where president bush went out and got worldwide support for for what was happening
you know i just feel like maybe we went in to be policeman
and i'm not sure that's our role
i i agree with that
i was i was fairly young at the time too
i i really don't have very many memories about it at all in fact
and uh my husband is a vietnam veteran
and i- you know he in looking at the persian gulf war that just went on he
i- it frustrates him because of the support that they have and the support that the vietnam vets did not have from the people or the administration either one
i mean i do think that i- i- it's been too long in coming
but i feel like maybe the american people and and the government are aware of the things that we did wrong that we didn't support that
and those guys were there doing their duty
i mean they weren't there by choice
and i i think that we learned from that
and i think it it's one of those things that you learn the hard way
the way that they have been treated over the years and i believe that's just now turning around just now you know trying to be rectified
and i'm and i'm not sure you can undo the damage that was done emotionally
and i i agree with you that i i think that the the time difference between the two wars has allowed a lot of people to see the mistakes that were made in in in every aspect of it
and i i agree with you also that i feel like it was not worth the money spent or the lives lost to fight that war
i mean they're still not settled over there
and i have a feeling that the persian gulf crisis is going to be the same way
i think we're going to end up back there in a few years or if if not sooner
well i i appreciate the fa-
i feel like president bush is in a hard spot
and then he has backed out
and i realize they're still saying well here you're encouraging us to get rid of saddam hussein
so why aren't you helping us
and you see i think him going in and doing that would be putting us in another vietnam situation
and i don't think the u s will stand for it
uh i think we learned too much of the effects
uh you know whether it was justified or not i know that they probably felt like we were going in for a good cause
i i feel like maybe they felt like we were doing the right thing to try and help maintain the democracy over there and and beat the communism
but but i think somewhere that got lost
you know in the long term effects of the of the war
we- you have to i- you know you have to give bush a lot of credit for he he said that's what we were going there to do
and he did what what he said
and he did pull out before it got any further than that where where it would have turned into more of a police action uh or more of a political action i guess you getting into their governmental affairs which you really can't do as as another country
i mean th- my my biggest problem with all of these wars is we spend all of that money on all these other countries
and we have so many problems here at home that we don't address
and and tha- that's what frustrates me more than anything
and i i believe that we have to have a military
and i believe that we have to have a defense to keep anybody else from walking in and doing it to us
but i also believe that we need to turn so much of that inward
and and they don't i- if they could just cut out all the fat and and get it lean and start addressing some of the other issues
you know who just end up using things against us later on anyway
i do think that in the middle east war um
i think that maybe a lot of the arab countries that were so hateful towards the united states have come away with uh kind of a different attitude
uh i think that maybe we're not their big bad enemy any more
an uh and i think that's good you know
and i think i guess in in uh ironic way a lot of good came from the vietnam war toward this war
because like we we said earlier that you know the a lot of eyes were opened after years and years of of that war
and perhaps the reason that good came out of the mid east war is because we had the experience of vietnam
so i i i do think that we've learned from it
you know i i i wish there weren't war
but uh i do think we learned
and i just i just hate the emotional price a lot of the vietnam people paid
for you know er- nothing
i mean it was they're they still don't know what they were there for
but what did we do
and and what were we trying to do
and i i think you're right
uh i think you're right there
um i do remember when it was over
uh but i remember the feeling back then you know
like i feel like right now i feel like this country has been behind this war
but i believe that the way that it was done and the way that was handled were right
and it's sad
and we shouldn't be fighting a war
but there was no let's support them you know
when this war broke out it frustrated me all thi- the antiwar people and you know
their all the demonstrations that were going on
because those kind of people i mean
and and i you know nobody says because you're supporting the troops that you're you're supporting the war
yo- you have to support the people that are there
and som- for some reason those people don't see that
and you know they're just real shallow people
i i agree
um and i and i recall when president bush said that you know
i you know i'm sorry that you're opposed to the war
but uh you're not helping the people that are over there by what you're doing
and i remember a lot of it kind of stopped after that
i mean they're not helping anybody
that's the that's the whole point
and i don't even know what they're doing for themselves
but well i just i i'm glad we've learned
and uh and i'm i'm i'm especially sorry for the people that are you know have spent all these years trying to deal with it emotionally
because you know until the la- past four or five years nobody ever really worried about that
and and i think that's where we as american people really failed you know failed them
so i don't know
well do you have anything else you want to say on this
but this is something to me that's sad
so well have a good day
and i appreciate the conversation
so the general topic is hobbies
well let's see
i guess uh i it's more not so much a hobby but things i enjoy doing
i enjoy playing basketball and and basically all kinds of sports
not not really um
well i uh you know around with my hands and things like that
so um i think i'm in handicraft
i i hate to think about it
and and i'm getting rather good at reading want ads
wh- what kind of time frame is it uh looking for the uh different shifts up there
is it uh
of of oh
i'm sure the numbers s- somewhere classified
but some of the internal news and the news services
so it's approximately six fifty
so ten percent of six fifty is sixty-five
and twenty percent would be one thirty
well that's uh that's unfortunate
is it uh many other corporations in the area
uh i saw seven eleven that was hiring
i i think it went to lockheed didn't it
that uh i hear they're hiring all over the place for that
and and that has some opportunities
and uh and
and uh and uh m c i coming if if telemarketing is your bag
well you in the uh computer operations or in the actual uh manufacturing
uh i'm a defense worker
i took a leave of of t i back in november
it uh unfortunately i guess for myself it wasn't uh it was purely by my own choice
it wasn't uh there was no incentive for myself to leave
but it was just an opportunity arose
and decided to take it
oh so you didn't even get the severance package
i should have taken the the the you know uh option when that was there
but it was just i missed it by a couple months
but you know what can one do
so are you happy with what you are doing now
but you know as you get to know more of the people that work there and more of what's going on with the system
so i was in the computer operations
it's uh you know it all starts to become similar
there's you know there's benefits
and there's things that weren't as good
but as an overall package i'd say i'm pretty happy so far with the way it's turned out
well it hasn't been a long time t i
or i i'm significantly shaken by the situation
well the one thing i guess at least in your favor is the the fact that that is more in the support of the manufacturing
and there's lots and lots of companies that have maybe not in the de- the defense area but manufacturing in general
to tell you the truth i'm i'm i'm not really worried
and and i seem rather happy about it most of the time
just just to know what's possibilities are
you know what might happen
but still in all
i know a number of people who are uh surplused
and they're just
so despite the fact that i should be tying flies or fly fishing or or going for walks in the mountains
well i'm sure it's just with the the the the way that things are so topsy-turvy right now as soon as you dec- decide on a pass
i've i doubt i'll be here in six months
well would you like to be there
but or or even somewhere better
but god this is much better than west texas
well just take the day
but then they they tell me hell is much better than west texas
i my little brother lives in austin right now
oh that's a beautiful place
and then once you pick that spot out pick out what you want to do
and now i feel lost
it it takes a bit of a shift doesn't it
oh i had job offers
well the best thing about it is that you can uh try something
oh so had you been with t i long when you changed
huh well there's a noticeable difference there
i can imagine you know the longer and longer it goes
and oh yeah
momentum is uh driving force in our lives
i'm looking as as a opportunity
well that's good
and and i'm looking at it as a change
and i'm looking at it as as an adventure
and maybe i'll wet a fly line this year and do some camping if i don't get laid off between now and then
ha how about we end this
what's the uh
in texas law has a uh
they just uh started it again too just late or within the past few years
you know for quite some time just about every one of the states had given up the death penalty
but now it's coming back into favor
well they find it is more deterrent
well my sociology class at s m u's taught us that it was not a deterrent
uh but now that's just what they said
uh i don't know maybe maybe if i went back and took a sociology class now they'd say it is a deterrent
well uh if you
you know compare the figures i think that's where they're uh they're coming from
because that was back in the seventies
oh there yes they are
that was before the uh uh they adopted the death law again
but uh i i myself am in favor of it uh particularly for uh well i think texas has a good good law uh crimes murders related with uh drugs or killing a policemen
but i think it ought to be expanded to include children
i i think they're they have they're working on uh something in austin now
and i'm not sure what it is
i just remember seeing a uh kind of a synopsis of it
well why stop at children
well uh i'm i'm personally very in favor of it
uh why should we let them set in prison and work on their college degrees after they've mowed down a class yard full of kids or t- or tried to or done their very you know given their best effort at doing that
i i don't care to support them
well i don't either
but uh uh but there is something to be said about
or uh uh j- just for the sake of argument i'm taking the a con
i'm i'm against it
uh you know yourself how many times have you heard where uh uh a citizen was wrongfully arrested
and served time at a penitentiary uh
just recently this uh black man served nine years was it
there was the black woman that uh robbed and shot the furrier
and she was set free too just in two examples in texas recently
and then then they decided it was a case of mistaken identity or something
i didn't i don't
but i know what you're
and that's not one of those things that you can turn the wheel back and reverse everything
well right now our laws are so liberal that uh even with the death penalty in effect i don't think that uh
put them all give them all a shot get rid of them
why should they be sit- sitting in uh prison getting their college degree
well i guess though where i would have a problem with it if i were on the jury that that put that handed down the death sentence because it was my judgement the person's guilty
and everyone agree that yeah the death penalty's the way to go
but to be the actual one of the ones that decide that would be tougher for me
i uh i agree with you there
but we could never say what we would do if we're not in the circumstance
it that's that's that's a real easy thing to say that oh sure i would
but i don't know
well i myself wouldn't want to be on the jury like that
uh i it it's uh that's an awful lot to uh to expect of a person to uh to kill somebody is what it amounts to
but you know that's what they did
but they they did it because they have a warped mind for some reason
or rather than have a warped mind it was just the only way to get whatever they wanted
and they they wanted something worse than they more than they respect the human life
well anyhow i guess we both agree that that it is it should be in effect
also i agree there should be a lot of care in the enforcement uh
so i guess i would say i want it to be in effect
but i want
well i'd i now i have a problem with this too
oh that's true
well now any uh just believe in just about any state in the union uh uh a death uh or uh yeah death verdict is an automatic uh appeal
and uh uh yes
now there's some
and maybe now
um um well n- not just for dealing in drugs
is it what is what's the ru-
and i don't remember what they are
it's something of the dis- they're on the distribution end
and they they are in effect killing people
oh oh yes
i i believe it's any capital crime related to drugs
but i i
or p- or is it proposed
or is it passed
uh i wouldn't swear to it myself
but i thought it i thought it was in effect
and i have to agree with that
i i think it certainly should be one of the options
uh i've been fortunate with my children and grandchildren so far that i know
because you never know
but to the best of my knowledge we haven't had a major problem yet
but it just touches so many young people
oh it does
uh i have four sons myself
and the youngest is twenty-eight
so they are all pretty well grown up
and they all went through it you know going through high school and everything
and knock wood that uh they have not
well i won't say they didn't try it uh
but uh they
i doubt very much that they're they're using it now
well my children are about in the same age bracket
and the youngest is probably twenty-seven twenty-eight
so it's the same age bracket
and there's four two girls and two boys
and i think one of each experimented very slightly with pot
and i think that was the extent of it to the best of my knowledge
it it's just uh try it out with their peers
and none of them even smoke
they don't uh
strangely enough uh their mother and i both smoked when they were growing up
now my my my wife my ex-wife she quit uh
and she never started up again
and i just quit oh about fourteen months and two weeks ago
and it seems to be getting tougher as time goes by
and he knows he has to
and he knows he should
and he knows
and he knows
but he hasn't
he he's very conscious of of passive smoking
and he's concerned about it but
well when i was still smoking i i felt that way
if i was in a public restaurant seated at table with uh non smokers i would try to pick a s- a a my seat where the smoke would blow away from them
or i'd hold the cigarette under the table
and uh but uh now i'm on the shoe's on the other foot
uh i'm aware of other people smoking now
well charles will actually charles will not smoke in anyone else's house except our own
and he'll go outside you know
and he he's
so when we're invited to people's house he will not smoke in their house which i think is good because there's a lot of people that are very
but uh and he's you know he tries his best
but the actual quitting he hasn't done
he will not smoke in a comfortable position you know
oh how neat
and every time i wanted one i have to go outside and just take one one at a time
and uh that that 's gets to be uh a deterrent
and i can very clearly remember ten years ago i was just beginning to explore computerizing my office and and trying to find out what kinds of computers might be useful
and we did end up with uh i b m p c which i now would not have chosen
but that was before the macintosh
and twenty years ago i was uh in graduate school pecking out a dissertation on a manual typewriter
oh i know it
so i would say that's one of the largest changes in at least in my life
i i've seen that just in the last uh even five years how much they've in- uh increased in use or probably eight years
when i was a freshman in college uh my degree was in computer uh technology originally
and it seemed like it would
they were just getting out with the you know the disks and all that getting away with the cards
you know doing away with the the programming cards and uh
thirty years ago i i had a college job uh working as a programmer
and we had to write code in binary
and uh have it punched in on those little cardboard cards
uh i think t v has a lot to do with the changes too don't you in like people's attitudes
well very possibly
uh i'm not sure in the last ten years it's been very different from before
uh certainly in the last thirty i would say there have been significant changes even even the change from black and white to color television
but i sure didn't have access to one
and uh but twenty years ago practically everybody had a color t v
and now i think they're as almost as many well
so it's close to getting uh one t v per person they say
and now everybody uh has v c r and two or three v c r and that kind of thing
certainly ten years ago uh v c r were just coming on the market
so that's made a significant difference in the way i watch television for instance
because uh now i almost never watch a t v program when it's on
and that way i don't have to worry about being interrupted
and you can you can flip through the commercials
so you don't have to watch the commercials
that's always h- convenient
so what was our question about decline in socio-
i think they just said the changes in uh social social changes in the united states
well i can't really remember back that far
car phones is a good point and uh cellular phones of all types and beepers
and i had to carry a beeper around
and they were kind of bulky
and all they did was just uh make a beep noise
and then you had to go find a telephone and call in to find out what they wanted you for and who you were supposed to call
and they fit in your shirt pocket
and they have a little display screen that shows you a message and either tells you a person or a a phone number to respond to
and they have the kind that just vibrates so you can shut them off
and you can still get your messages
but let's see social changes uh uh
where do you think it's where do you think it's going to go in twenty years
i was just thinking though about a a huge social change in the last ten years is aids
i i know that because i was writing a paper about it
i was writing a a journal article
uh and they still didn't even know what caused it or anything
and uh there was a suspicion
but nobody had identified it
and they were really just going on epidemiological uh
uh guesswork uh because the way it was transmitted made it look an awful lot like uh hepatitis
from from the spread pattern of hepatitis they could work backwards to the transmission by uh blood and semen
and then i
i'm curious what was your uh graduate study in
well i i was in english as a matter of fact and medieval studies
uh but i went to work as an editor and writer
so uh uh the ten years ago i was working in the medical center uh publishing a journal and writing about medical topics
and let's see twenty years ago i guess we 're were just beginning to get into what they were calling the uh the sex revolution where uh after the pill
and uh uh freed people up from worries about uh illegitimate pregnancy
and i guess in the seventies is the the time when that was supposed to have exploded
you think that's caused a lot of pressure on like younger kids today
i have uh
and i know that the expectation for them was uh to have sex and much earlier
but they certainly didn't expect everybody to
and it was really only uh acceptable if you were engaged and planning to get married in in the relatively near future
and i certainly know from talking to my stepdaughter that girls in high school were under a whole lot more pressure nowadays
it's kind of scary when i think of what will happen in twenty years you know when i have kids and they're grown and
and i guess the answer
is is stay flexible because nobody can predict what's going to happen in twenty years
i certainly wouldn't have been able to twenty years ago tell you what uh my kids were likely to be like
course one of them was just a a a brand new baby twenty years ago
and some of the other ones weren't born
so sounds like america's going to become even more communication society with faxes and cellular phones and worldwide communication
and that's made a difference in the way i do my job because it's so much easier to get hold of people and get quick answers to things
even you know
but it was used as kind of an extreme emergency and nowadays people use fed ex all the time
sure do huh
uh i was almost thirty before i got off this continent
and uh both my kids had been abroad when they were still in high school
i know that's what uh what my family was talking when i picked up and moved to texas from indiana
and they were like well you know twen- thirty years ago we wouldn't have done that you know
and uh especially come home every couple months
you know and
what do you think are some current trends in uh the way families spend time together based on what you've seen
um i i think that it's getting to where they're not spending time together
um i think uh like in my situation today on a weekend when couples are supposed to spend time together my husband's been off doing his thing all day today
and i've been off doing my thing all day
and i haven't seen him since eight o'clock this morning
um two years
same same situation here i've been married about ten months
i can i can i know what you mean
it's it's really hard hard to find time to spend together when you both work full time and uh you both have hobbies that are different
you know if you have hobbies that are the same then you know you can enjoy your hobby together
but my husband and i have different hobbies
um so he was off today uh looking at at records
so uh and i was off you know doing you know hou- household type things
you know laundry
and um did some shopping and stuff
um from the people i've talked to i don't know if i should bring this into it
but um a lot of the dads said that they would probably choose careers that are more um where they could manage their own schedule
uh they could spend more time with their kids
because they look back
and you know they're all like um kind of regretful i think
i i think i think that would be the ideal situation
like in my case i i do shift work
i don't i don't have that choice
um i have to be at work at at x hour you know at just at at a certain hour
and i can't it's not flexible
um it it would be nice to be able to have flexible hours
and and maybe after we decide to have kids i i might find a job that has flexible hours
i woul- i hope so anyway
um but i would i don't know
some of the people that i work with they like when i worked on second shift um their paren- their kids go to school during the day
and then they wouldn't see them at night
because they would be in you know at work and the kids are all ready in bed
and so it was kind of like they see their kids for fifteen minutes and the same with their spouses
this relative may work even a weirder shift like weekends or something you know
so it was really sad jus- you know that a lot of families um have to well you know have to have dual income
but uh you know then the kids kind of suffer
i ideally it wo- it would be nice to be able to just have like back in the old days
you know back like whe- when i grew up
the the mom stayed home you know and raised the kids
um so she was there pretty much all my you know formative years
and that was nice
and i liked that
and i would hope that i would be able to give that to my kids
but i think with the way the future is um economy wise
um do you think s- the the parents spend quality time with their kids
are do you think it's more like watching t v and stuff like that not really uh
i yeah i i think that i think very few spend quality time
i think most of the time the kids are usually off watching cartoons or playing video games or stuff stuff like that
i think that um uh most most kids that i see don't really they don't really value quality time
until until they're older
and then they look back
it's true um
what's what are some other questions they have
and and they spent a lot of time like outside with us and stuff
but you know my dad had his own business
and it was easier for them to do that
but i i don't know
it was i guess i didn't realize what a luxury it was at the time
i i think kids now a days are raised on t v
i mean that's that's almost like a surog- t v a surrogate parent
and not a and not a very good one at that
if i had kids well if you had kids what kind of things do you hope to do
um i i hope to of course be able to teach them right from wrong
i hope i hope to be able to spend um their growing up years being in the home you know not having to work
um and being able to do
i i i know a lot of people wh- who um um
um and they they do a lot of volunteer work
and they're real active in the community
and um they do a lot of things with their kids that they wouldn't ordinarily be able to do if they were working
and i'd i'd like to be able to do that
but i think that's for the the few and far between
i think that uh probably ninety percent of the of the um parents out there are are probably working parents
and i i don't i don't really see that that trend changing much
there's going to be fewer and fewer uh single income families
and what's sad about that is day cares end up instilling values in your kids
see i i never i don't even know what day care is really all about because i i never went to a day care center
i never i never had that kind of experience
huh i well i don't even think we had
i i see it seems like that's that's a big trend you know in the last ten years
day cares have have have popped up and become a lot more um a lot bigger part of of the kids' lives
sure is um
i i think yeah i think this is a good closing point
well it was really nice talking to you
well see that's me
oh you haven't
but now i really
because i get so angry about what goes on
and then i feel like i can't really complain too much unless
but the problem is that i am very liberal politically
and so i hardly ever have anybody that wins that i vote for
by what do you mean by liberal um
i'm you know like pretty left wing demo- democrat
well see i don't know anything about politics
oh you don't
uh what's the main what's the main difference between republicans and democrats
but democrats are on a lot of issues are more liberal than republicans
and well it used to be
but um i think back in the ei- times when uh my political opinions were being formed like in viet- during the vietnam war and stuff
the republicans were more you know what they called hawks which is more like aggressive in war and more pro war
and um the democrats were the doves
and i'm not sure how much that holds true anymore
i think you know the issues are
and you vote for the democrats
and democrats usually are su- more supportive of public assistance programs
and and programs to um
the big republican thing is that they don't they vote for less government
and so they're more less apt to vote in you know more aid to people
or more uh they're less apt to vote in programs that involve the government running things
so have you ever voted at all
i know i sho- i
well i don't know mu- that much about it
and i don't feel like i ha- have enough knowledge on it to even you know
so that's what they need well
it uh they said something to improve voting
like uh like to me i don't i didn't know what would have been wrong with
i think it was uh that woman
or wasn't or was that reagan
well that's what i mean
like i didn't know what the difference between dukakis and bush was
you know i didn't know anything about bush or dukakis
so what do you think about uh what do you think about what you see on t v about them like in the news or on the ads
but well they're all saying that they're going to do you know whatever is best for their campaign anyway
like you know in school they didn't teach you about demo- uh the government
because before they used to have um a lot of
it seems like the stuff that they put out now it i mean i doesn't just seem like it
i know for a fact that the any kind of stuff that if you wrote and asked for material
well what do you believe in
they kind of say well what do you want me to believe
or they word it so that it's really hard to tell where they're standing on certain issues
well i'm not sure they're
like i- with the abortion issues and stuff
so that's kind of how i judge
or let me see
i try to look at what
but newspaper articles can show wha- how they voted in the past
and but you get you know
and like i said most of the poli- the politicians i'm
and everybody's got you know stuff they don't want known
i didn't i didn't have much knowledge
well that's okay
do you think do you think um
i mean what would it take
like god this is really good actually tha- for to talk to somebody who hasn't voted
i mean what kind of
how would it how what kind of stuff would they would you like them to do so that that you would know more about it
now i'm sure they've got it at the library
i mean if i get to the library
oh do you
but i i don't know
or do you just not do you feel like it's not really going to make that much difference if you don't vote
oh i know if enough people think like that it you know would make a difference
um well a lot of people they'll vote the way their family votes you know
if since you're what democrat
then like your kids or whatever will follow you and just vote democrat
well not in my family
we're kind of
but a lot of families do that
and that kind of keeps from getting a lot of issues resolved
i lie huh
but like i said if i voted for bush
or like when uh gary hart was running
and then i didn't think that was right because he may have been a good president or whatever
but because it
and it just threw him out of the whole running
and a lot of people go by their uh personal life when they vote
you know and i
i i think that doesn't really have that much to do with um unless they've done something really horrible you know
well criminal or something like that's different
i mean what is what effect does that have on him running for president
see we really don't see the the true person anyway
i think that's that's having a big effect on how poorly that the country is being run is that um the the election the people that want to get elected are turning it into a popularity contest by advertising the things that
but see they're trying to find an excuse not to deal with what you know the issues that people really want to know about because on those issues you have to say yes or no
and if they don't say yes or no then
so they just try and make it a personal thing
i mean if you remember any of the t v commercials from the last presidential campaign
and even from reagan it was all just like looks like a mcdonald's commercial you know
well what did you think of reagan as a president
he they just kind of sat him up there like a puppet
and the people that were
i think there's a lot of thin- the economic problems that the country was having at the time and the the recession and stuff
but he actually
and that was
and i i just couldn't get over the fact that reagan beat him
i you know that i just couldn't believe that he got voted out
but i think i wasn't
well let's see
so i was only fifteen or sixteen
but i remember carter
and i liked him
well he is just he is really active still politically
did you like do you use credit cards
uh not very often
i usually uh
the ones we use is like visa
and we always try to pay it back at the end of the month
i have uh uh
so it doesn't get uh uh the credit uh
otherwise you end up paying so much more for your merchandise that it's hardly uh it's not a very good idea
well i have a lot of them
but i don't use them very much though
the other thing i i think if you do get overextended a little bit you need to be sure and pay it off uh more than one at a time because i think you could run forever paying what they require
i think a lot of people go in debt because they think oh you know i can just charge it
but really i mean if they don't have the money then they aren't going to have it in a month
they uh make the mistake of
when it's when it's very useful
like uh emergency trip
sometimes when you when you
but it's you know not immediately handy
i think uh they're very helpful plus the fact that it's helpful not to have to carry a lot of money sometimes
but uh i you really do need to be very um oh responsible about it
or you end up in deep trouble
and that's kind of like
so af- after that i decided well i'm not going to use them at all and just try to pay cash for everything
and that worked for a while
and then we got married
so we decided to you know if we used them we would pay them off as we go
the other thing about them is too if you really don't you really need to get some and use them because if you have never used them and developed and haven't developed a credit thing it stops you from doing a lot of things
if you if you pay for everything by cash uh there is a lot of things that a lot of people who will not give you credit when you need something like a house or
so so they they have become a very vital part of our of our monetary system
but uh it's true
you have to be very careful or you end up uh going in the deep end
and uh and an awful lot of people are in trouble
we have a boy living with us who works for a credit card uh company that
and he makes calls to people who have problems you know credit problems
so it's it's uh it's uh it's a really big problem i think and um takes mature people to to treat it uh
so that it's so that it's a real advantage to you instead of a disadvantage
i think um the way the tax system was they encouraged people to use credit cards you know with a big write off at the end of the year
but now it's like it's punch money because
even before it probably wasn't though because you didn't get anywhere near as much as what it you didn't get to claim anywhere near what you ended up paying
so well i'm not
do you rec- exercise regularly
uh i ride a bicycle quite a bit and uh work out with free weights
so i used to i try to ride about ten to twenty miles a day
oh that's good
but i haven't been doing so well this year
i went an last year i went an was exercising on a bike for a while
and i when i'd gotten back i had gotten some sun that day
oh that's weird
but i exercise i don't exercise now
but i exercised real good for a couple of years
and it was running three nights a week
so what's your motivation
what what's my motivation
and she would push you know
and you know she wouldn't take no for an answer
oh i ju- i just wanted to look good
because i'm not i'm not big or anything
but i'm not in great shape
so but when i worked out i got in pretty good shape
so what was what was the other question
or do you enjoy enjoy working out
i think i uh i enjoy it sometimes
and there's other times when i just get tired of it
and and i feel like i'm obligated to do it because i've been doing it
so i should keep up
and there's some days it's just like it's the hardest thing in the world to to get started
well how old are you
i'm uh twenty-seven
so you're still young
well if you keep working out when you're young though when you get older you know your body's not going to look as bad
and she looked so good
i mean she was standing just as straight and tall
and she had a small waist
and she didn't have you know like
a- she didn't have that at all
she her lips were a little bit wide
but a lot of
back in her time they liked women with big hips anyway so she may be keeping that on purpose
i notice if you uh if you stay in shape you don't age as bad
i was i go to school too at night
and last semester i had stopped working out 'cause i hurt myself and started smoking a lot
and you just
well smoking ages you quick
an you can't
and then you know it just kind of feeds itself
and then you don't work out because you
oh i smoke a pack a day
i finally quit because like i just all i was doing was going down hill fast
i was telling a friend of mine that i'd be almo- almost as bad as being an alcoholic
but you know as soon as i had them right back to it
it was like you know
and i don't want to quit smoking
but uh did you ever go to like one of those health clubs or anything
and now i work out at home because i don't really my schedule with school and work i don't have time to get down to one
but uh i actually prefer to work out alone
i i need competition is what i need
or i don't want to do anything
i wouldn't mind having you know working out with a friend and and stuff
but when you get into some of these some of health clubs where you just stand around and wait
you know i like to start get it done and get out of there
well get your girlfriend to work out with you
and he works as a laborer on the railroad
so you know he's building his muscles up all day
and he don't you know he don't gain it like i do
uh especially having a kid i guess tends to just gain weight because you have to to to uh
well you can gain too much weight
but i looked
i got i got about fifty pounds overweight with him
and i didn't loose it until two years ago
and then i got pregnant and you know ruined that
well actually like i say it ain't as bad this time because i was in shape when i got pregnant
i wasn't out of sha- i wasn't overweight when i got pregnant with him
i just wasn't in in shape
you know i
working out and fitness you know
i like to to work out to look good and stay in shape
and you know i know it's good for me
but people that live for it and you know eat a bunch of different pills and
well that's what my friend did
well she was she was with the wheat germ and all the vitamins and everything else
and really we was you know
even with her taking all those e- expensive vitamins and stuff
you know developing and everything
you can take those uh
i was goin- i was trying to say hemorrhoids
i was trying to say hem- hormones
but i stay from that crap
oh i wouldn't
and as soon as he stopped working out he just ballooned out
and he just
i- it just that's how it affected him
and he i don't know just
but i've been wanting to get me a bicycle or a bike
and i just it i like to move a little faster and cover more ground
it's probably i would think it would be hard on your your legs and your joints and stuff
and it's hard on women
and it it just makes stuff move down
and uh but i i i like jogging
uh i can't
but in the rain oh i love to run in the rain
just you know be careful not to slide
but you can't ride your bike at all in the rain can you
oh i when i did ride my friends bike that one time i had uh i don't know what i was trying to do
and i never could make a u turn in a bike
but i tried to do it on that ten speed and wrecked
and i told her a dog was chasing me
but i wrecked it into the curb
i scratched it on the the oh
but oh well
anyway it's been nice talking to you
well good luck with the the new kid
she's it she's good
anyway have fun exercising
um we've got quite a few actually
um we've actually had some warnings in uh raleigh uh on air pollution
oh you mean for like smog and stuff
and we have a belt line alo- around raleigh where we're trying to divert traffic
and um you know i- it's still it's just surrounding the city
and you can actually see it
there's a couple of uh tall buildings in raleigh
and and you can actually you know
and what it is is the pollution
what do you think of that uh the greenhouse effect that's going on
well i guess that's fluoro- the fluorocarbons and uh
i mean we can we're even feeling the effects of the weather from uh uh the shift in the jet stream
it it is scary though isn't it
i mean uh the last two uh years our winters have been absolutely nothing
i mean maybe one snow
well all right
uh north carolina is all the way on the east coast
it's uh right below virginia
well kentucky's next to virginia i'm pretty sure
well i'm from kentucky
but kentucky we use to have severe i mean just real cold cold winters and we'd have three and four feet of snow
so i mean amarillo
well that's close to here
um i've been out of texas about ten years
well how old are you
oh twenty uh seven
well we're the same age
so that's okay
it's i think it's just something that goes with the territory
but to me texas see and kentucky we had to have ice on the ground for them to close school
in texas i'm serious if it gets cold and it looks like it's going to rain i i swear they close everything down
i mean i do
they get i mean
and traffic slows down to nothing
actually they've been doing the same thing here
it's you know it's kind of funny
they um i guess northerners are different
but even uh north carolinians they don't know how to handle cold weather
oh well no northe-
that's why i said we in kentucky we
and of course the people down in south they don- they're not used to cold weather and stuff
every time they have a every time they have snow
and you know you can have snow on the ground and not be slick on the road
i mean not to see it
now of course there's you know t i is here oscar mayer and there is a few factories
but i don't see much pollution going on
well you know what irks me is these cars that are driving down the road
and you have that black smoke coming from their tail pipe
well see they have that um what is it a test or something like that they call it
but i'll tell you what
and even these buses oh lord it real bad these buses in raleigh
i mean school buses are notorious
well they're burning that diesel fuel is what it is
and uh it it gets bad
well you know what they've started doing is is instead of the tail pipes being at the bottom of those buses they've started putting them up at the top
well that's a good idea
and that way it gets above um other cars on the road and uh it really does make a difference although it it settles you know
and and you know if you're going to be jogging on the side of the road that's that's even more miserable
i would i'd have to go out to the country to jog
well uh the you know pregnant women aren't supposed to walk along a highway because of that smoke fumes
because back then because i was walking back and forth toc-
well not back and forth
i was walking home from uh the college i was going to in kentucky
and i was having to walk along the highway
but it was in
i i have no sense of smell
so i couldn't smell this
but it would make me sick
and i'd be real tired anyway just from walking along the highway
golly that's that's bad
all the exhaust uh
well that was four years ago too
oh i'm sure
well they um you can really feel it you know in your breathing even normal people
and if you're older um i mean you can really deplete your oxygen
and it'll you know pass out
and it's you know it's killed several people
do you uh smoke
um actually i'm a very i just smoke one in the evening if that
so i'm a very very light smoker
they were doing some uh ozone testing and uh th- the e p a
and they were just screening some candidates
and i don't think i'd ever you know do that
but they uh asked me if i was a smoker
and i didn't fit into the smoker's category
and i didn't fit into the nonsmoker's category um
it was you know i was just one of those yeah
so that kind of threw them off
but they're doing a lot of research here uh the e p a
for ozone and oh yeah all that
they're they're real big into it
and they're you know they're just doing a lot of uh lot of stuff
course texas we don't have a bunch of c- pollution
but too we've got that air coming in off the coast
and you know it'd blow it up north
so maybe that's part of the reason it's not so bad down here
it would seem like it would be the same way in on the california coastline wouldn't it
oh gosh i think i would hate to live in california the smog there
i mean i can't believe they have warnings here which it it's mainly just when it gets real real hot
but they usually have that everywhere because of the humidity especially
w- well that's kind of good to know
because i thought lord i thought i lived in a halfway decent area
i- especially it's usually for the young children and the older the old people older old people
well you ought to come to north carolina
and here they've got the mountains the beach the trees you know
it's they've got streams rivers ponds
oh well this is pretty wooded area down here
l- in a lot of parts
but they've got you know down by the denison dam there's a lot of uh
you go where uh
well down by lake texoma there's a bunch of wooded area
but but kentucky's beautiful
and trees are supposed to you know purify
well i'm going to have to get some
my husband bought it for me when my daughter was born three months four months ago
did you smoke when you when you were pregnant
i mean i can understand that actually
i got i i've got one vice
and smoke is smoking is it
i don't i don't drink
and i try not to cuss
and i do i do very little
and smoking i just i got in the habit of it when i was about thirteen
well one thing i miss is uh is the people from texas are are you know
uh i wasn't saved until i got down here
and people down here are just
and it's so different from kentucky
um i worked at t i for a while
but then my brother-in-law works there
and he got me into it
oh i see
um i i was taking a voice i o class and um and actually doing some research
and so they told me about this project
well it's fun
and i half the time well a couple of times i've been interrupted by my little girl
but i enjoy it
i talked to people from well c- what carolina now up in uh boston and new york
well boston is new york isn't it
but i've talked to people in new york
but i've talked to a lot of people in texas
because i guess it's because t i down here
i had one call f- actually from charlotte north carolina and virginia and um
i love the boston acc- accent
so we went from kentucky to louisiana down here to texas
and his family's down here
oh i bet you're glad
he got out of it his unit right after panama
we went to pana- he went to panama when noriega was doing all that
and uh he
well uh it seems to me that uh that
i do not know whether the jury system uh
i i should not say i do not know
i do not feel very uh stronger that the jury system should be changed
it seems to have worked uh time immemorial
and when uh difficult decisions uh are made uh uh uh they generally prove out to be right by things that occur later on
uh i know in some cases now in some states depending on the criminal code uh a unanimous verdict is not required
and indeed some juries are no longer twelve people
they are down to as little as small as six people in i think in petty in in uh in uh in minor felonies and uh and misdemeanor trials
uh i think that the judges should be left to do most of the sentencing simply because uh there is always uh there is there is always a jury that might be
on the other hand uh attorney uh uh justices are more apt to uh understand you know the cr- the prison crowding problems and things like that
but i mean is not that uh is that a reflection then of what is really happening in the real world
if if if they keep giving everybody hundred year sentences and the people in various states it does not seem that people want to be taxed to build more prisons or even in for that matter uh repair the uh the lack of judges and and and other uh
i think uh the judges are trying to save the people from having to
you know that might be it
i mean they they certainly
oh well you know
the the people cannot afford it
i do not i don't know how it is in virginia
but in florida now uh uh uh at eighteen years someone was just sentenced to eighteen years i heard it on today uh without any specific recommendation for uh uh uh uh uh uh waving the normal uh procedures
and the eighteen years will uh translate into something like uh four point seven if every if the if the prisoner is a model prisoner
and indeed the present overcrowding conditions uh prevail
plus i guess there was some credit for time this guy had already spent in jail waiting for trial
so uh yeah
i i i do not know
it just seems to me that only about uh from what i read only about ninety percent of the ca- only about ten percent of the pa- cases come for trial anyway
and uh only about uh f- four or five percent of uh
in the in the very end
or less than less than half the trials that go to uh less than half the cases that go to trial uh end up w- with uh with the jury actually making the verdict
that most of it is plea bargained uh half way through
or or most of the cases are plea bargained anyway
but uh uh how do you feel about the uh about the jury system itself
do you do you think that should be changed
or do you do you know in virginia whether it is if they have smaller juries
uh i do not know exactly what the size of the juries
i know one of my friends was uh uh brought up for jury duty
and he only heard very you know piddly type cases
most of it was uh robberies or things like that you know
so apparently even for the smallest crimes they give the person the you know any felony anyways
well i guess we
th- they give the person the option for a jury
i guess we always focus on criminal trials with th- with the jury
but i know you have a right to ask for a jury in in any sort of a case that even where damages are are are uh are the result of some sort of a uh an action that you are bringing against someone else you can ask for that to be heard before a jury
i i i do not know uh
i should imagine virginia from what i read uh uh is like every other state
it it is faced with uh uh enormous costs to maintain the jury system and the prison system and the entire trial system
because i guess
but there is no budget for them i guess
or and the courthouse that goes with them and the bailiffs and the clerk uh
so it seems uh
i i i do not think i would change it
the more i verbalize it i i do not think i would want to change the system
uh i do not think i would either
it uh does seem like the the the the purpose of getting people in jail so that you know the the
anyway the deterrent
for people to to commit the cri- uh to not to commit the crime is sort of gone away
you know people that
uh and yet there are there are so many there are so many people in prison
i mean the prison population uh as far as i i uh you know
my impression of it is that it has that it has doubled in the last ten years and tripled in the last twenty
so has our i guess our population has grown some too
but there there definitely is uh uh you know to me the one of the worst things that could ever happen uh from what i read and see and understand
i mean i do no think i could handle prison
i mean it would be very difficult
well i would be interested in finding out what the uh percentage of drug related type things are
well there must be a
but but there again i i do not know if the the jury system itself uh comes in to play there
of course th- it is a constitutional right that the press must have here is th- the interviewing of jurors after the trial
i mean that it seems to me that that that when a jury makes a decision they should not be asked uh before television cameras and newspaper reporters how they reached that decision
i mean i do not
i imagine there is a certain certain right of the press to have the ability to ask that
but i i would think i if i did anything i would protect the juror from from any sort of an inquisition after
well i know uh
on the other hand though when uh- after the barry trial
up here you know the big local trial as well as national
i was there during the during the trial actually
and the opposite was true of me
uh after the case was over i was like somebody get ahold of these people and find out why in the world did they vote the way they did
it was like well a picture is not good enough
i mean just because you feel like he was being kicked on which he certainly was you know
i think i
oh i felt that way
i felt i felt
but it does not matter
i always balanced in the in the situation
i remember the jurors uh
i thought to myself how did how did
one one count
they only i think they only uh found him guilty on one count which was uh not even which was a class something felony which was not even punishable
uh uh to the degree that they thought it
but i do not know
maybe when you are there in the r- in the courtroom yourself and you are sitting there and you have got to make a judgment on somebody
i mean i i am not making excuses for
well it has been nice talking to you
well the topic today was gardening
we are about to hit it in ten few minutes
and that is all we have been doing all weekend
we bought a a large house that was completely unlandscaped
and we hired a professional landscaper to do it
and i have since then probably ripped out half of what he has done because it has always been incorrectly planted
or the plants do not make the winter time
and so i am kind of at this point getting a little bit broke and deciding that what we are going to do is we are just going to struggle through the rest of this year
probably through the fall too and uh
rip up rip out all the rest of these junipers or anything that requires uh more care than i am willing to give the kids and replace it with hollies
uh how many kids do you have
but they are just eighteen months apart so it seems like a lot more
what year i mean how old are they
i have got a four year uh a four year old and a four month old and an eight year old stepdaughter
oh well i have a twenty six year old stepson
and i do not know if that counts
well you do not have to tend to him
well i did for many years
oh you did
uh back to gardening
are you one of these uh howard garrett organic enthusiasts or a
it is like oh i will get out there and pull my weeds
but i do have half of it is a flower bed
because the porch is pretty big
but just pulling all the weeds out of that just drives me nuts
and i just went out this weekend
and i just plowed through the whole nine yards
the lea- when the blooms died the leaves were just horrible looking
so i just broke all them off
oh they are
but the leaves i do not like them
you know once
now are you sure they are hyacinths
because that is a bulb
well you should of just ripped the whole thing out
because i do like the i like the plant in the spring
so i just cut the leaves off and transplant and put some other plants down because i want them to come back up next year
well let me tell you they do not come back very well at all
maybe they will if up further north
and you are not that much further north
oh of everything
i have probably have done hyacinths
but i have just learned from doing hyacinths that if you really like them what you do is you dig the bulbs up and then you throw them away after they are done blooming because they do not take the heat here
and if they do come back next year they are going to look real puny
oh they will
about the only bloom bulb that repeats well in my area is the uh uh daffodil and some of the narcissus bulb
now i have got some daffodils
and we- everybody down here calls these flags uh the irises i guess uh
they get uh just one bloom on the plant
i do not i am not sure what they are called
but i do not much
when does it wh- when does it bloom
well i think they are stopped blooming now in the spring
and what color
oh they come in all different colors
and you only get one of them
well i mean per bulb
well i do not know what i have called them
but when i come down here everybody told me they are flags
you know what i bet you they are
and i am a pretty i am a pretty good gardener
because i have killed a lot of things here
and and i have planted a lot of them
and and i work on a uh landscape committee for our neighborhood
and our neighborhood is a planned development with i think it is seven hundred and fifty-five families
but we have about sixty acres that we have to plant
and i will get uh
what color is is yours blooming
i have got some in the backyard that bloomed blue which i would not would have liked those in the front because they match my porch and stuff better and then some on the side of the house with the dusty purple color with little purple spots that it it will fade into a solid purple
and what does the foliage look like
now it looks almost like a hyacinth only a a lot higher
and it is a bulb
oh i bet you those are i bet you what those things are uh is a dutch iris
does it does it on its little on its on the flower does it have a beard on it at all any kind of fuzzies
you know i i really do not know
they are they have they're died down i am sorry they are dead now
well i was just going to correct myself
because they would have bloomed pretty early
i would took i took and just mowed over them last year
and uh we have been
i i do not much care for them
and to me it just looks like a bunch of leaves
but i took them out of my front yard
and i just threw them on the side intending to transplant them or throw them away or something
well i went out there this spring
and they had took root right where they were on top of each other
and they told me that they are the hardest things to you know
but they are real easy to grow
well then it is not it is not a dutch iris then
i do not i am not sure what it is
but they call them flags up here or down here down here
well i am not so sure that texans know what what they have got
i am i am not on i am just getting into gardening this year
uh we moved here a year ago
we moved in here may this house may of last year
so it was really too late to do much
um who who who who
because i have got a flower i have got i have probably got do do do do i do not know how many square feet it is a big circular driveway
the whole uh perimeter bordering the house is all in texas wildflower beds
and i am into that
and it and it looks quite formal
i mean it really does
well that is
but it has been about three or four years of uh uh playing around with flowers to de- decide which ones actually grow here
well what kind of blue
i am wanting bl- i want blue and purple and you know just different shades of that because my my house is gray
and blue looks so pretty against it
ooh blue is hard you know
well i would like to have one that would bloom next year too
now it is going to grow about um the plant itself will grow about eighteen inches tall
and it will send out a flower spike
but you can get them in the nursery
well that is where i went this year
because i waited too late to really plant stuff
but i did not know that these hyacinths
i did not know the hya- hyacinths were going to die
well the you know e- nursery men will se- will sell you things here
and they are they are kind of in a labor of love
the other thing to do if you re- really like the hyacinths and i do is that before you plant those bulbs stick them in the refrigerator for five weeks or so to cool them
i had bought these uh colossians
and they will not grow down here
and now that will bloom all summer long
and it will it but it insists on full sun
i bought me oh i guess i just went and bought me just about nineteen dollars worth of little bu- buds planted uh already grown
and it looks pretty good out there
i- i- it it is dark purply kind of a purply blue red
now it's not
but it will take the heat down here
its p- p- proper name is gomphrena
and is sold as purple buddy or sometimes sold as straw flower
and they make uh oh about a foot high plant
and they send out this this spike that has this purple ball on the top of it
but that purple ball
well wayne i uh feel very strongly about parents doing things with their children and making time available even sometimes when time isn't available
i've uh two kids right now one is two and a half
and one's nine months
and uh that age of course everything you do they're trying to learn to do
and so uh it's important for you to spend time doing the things that you want them to learn you know that that they need to learn at the age you know reading and uh reading and playing nice with others and that sort of thing
and i've always tried to do things with them uh like when you're at the little league helping out even though i'm not a good athlete myself
i was able to help the coach in in just controlling the kids if nothing else
and we've always uh oh tried to take our children and no- now at this age our grandchildren to see and do things that otherwise they might not be able to
and so it's uh
we have uh lived several places around the u s
and we have where we've lived we've taken them to see and do things of interest and of historical significance in the area
like when we lived in tennessee we we took them to washington d c to see all the capitol and and things like that when they were small
and it's just uh it's helps i think the children to when they're learning in school to say well i've been there and i've seen that
so uh that's the type
it certainly does because uh you know the things in the books seem so dead to the kids you know unless they've actually been there or whatever
because i remember our family well we we we went everywhere
and uh seeing new england and uh being on plymouth rock and stuff like that was really made the whole thing more uh visual
and we could uh read the things in the history books and understand what they said when it was like we need food we need to raise food quickly because this place gets very cold very soon
and so i made a special effort with my children to do things like that
and even now with my grandchildren i feel it's a very important thing to be done
because if uh kids don't look up to you or or ca- can't feel they can spend time with you they're going to find someone else and uh you know nowadays there's a lot of people out there that you don't want your kid to emulating or whatever
well i can remember one of the things i'm most proud of is uh when my son was
they had to write a a little brief autobiography of themselves and about what they had done and what they wanted to do
and i was very proud when my son wrote that he wanted to uh have a family and be able to help coach little league and do things like his dad had done with him
excuse me it sounds like we both have colds
well it's um well it's uh ten o'clock here in falls church virginia
so that the only reason i'm home is because i'm home with a cold
oh well we're
and the wife says well you need something to do
well i'm sitting here on the ninth floor of an office building on the north side of dallas texas
so we're kind of far apart here
this is a very interesting program i i heard about here on this
and when i signed up for it it uh looked like it could be make a real contribution in participating
i'm an electrical engineer by trade uh here in virginia
likewise we uh we do some projects every now and then
we like to get support from uh other other companies as well
so trying to work myself out of a job
but it's been an interesting uh roughly oh nine months here
and uh again this is our home area
and it's uh
and we've lived up north for a while in chicago and over in tennessee
so wound up back about two hundred miles aware away from where we started out
well uh that's about all i can think to talk about right now
so uh you live in dallas
now i understand that um the the real estate market out there has really gone crazy up and down up and down
i think right now it's it's kind of bad
are are you in a house
well i guess the best i can do is is uh compare apartments
with the one that i had the last time the one that i have now uh has a lot more amenities i guess is the right word than the one that i moved out of
uh this one you know gave us free cable and uh ceiling fans
and uh it was practically new when i moved in here
and the carpet was new
it's just a a two story building
uh but there's you know there there are a lot of buildings
but it's just two stories
uh on the second floor they have they don't have a patio
but they have a sunroom instead of the patio
on the first floor um where i am there's a patio
so so you just you have one floor all to yourself
and let's see i have i have two bedrooms
oh that's nice
well i i i have a washer and dryer area
and i i did buy the washer and dryer
but they didn't provide it
the one that i moved from didn't didn't have a place to put them
and that's one of the reasons that i did move
so tell me ab-
i've always uh been pretty lucky
it uh the the prices of well the prices came down last year
we've we had sort of like a dallas syndrome
the past uh uh year and a half prices have gone down which is totally new for northern virginia
it just it's a real good
so it's really surprising everybody
we're uh we actually have our house on the market because we have two kids and we have a three bedroom house
and it's pretty much filled up right now
oh so you want a bigger one
right now it's just a a single level rambler
one thing about the houses in uh in dallas they don't uh utilize basements the way they did in new york
my parents in new york had uh a uh three family house
two family house where the the um the downstairs and the second floor they had
and then they rented the third floor with the whole apartment you know
and uh they had a basement
and they you know they finished the basement
and they were able to rent that out also
but uh in dallas i i just i just haven't seen basements in houses
and i've looked at a lot of them
and that's what he said was that you know it just wasn't something that people had down there
but uh no basements
i haven't i haven't i have yet to see a basement in a house
you know i don't see that kind of sand here um
there are some areas though where where they have a problem with uh the houses kind of sinking a little bit into the to the uh
or the foundation is sinking or something you know just a little just a little bit some more than others
but you you have to know the right spot
to to pick where that doesn't happen
well out here we um we live in what used to be uh like a prairie or whatever a natural you know natural grasslands
and uh they
and you get to sands- well fourteen inches you get to sandstone
and so any place where they put a basement in they had to blast
anywhere near uh virginia beach
my uh my folks used to live there
well different areas in dallas have different kind
in uh in texas i'll say
because down in east texas there's a lot of red clay
and uh in the in the dallas you know fort worth city areas you don't see that
well uh texas is a big state
so i imagine the the type of houses and uh things like that are truly different from area to area
because um well we for example and we live fifteen miles from the beltway that surrounds washington and anything instead that beltway the highway the real estate's forty thousand dollars more expensive
so you know you really can't afford i i i could never afford a house inside the beltway
this is called the the the country you know with only you know maybe twenty miles total from d c twenty-five from the city
but um it's considered the country since it's uh you know that far out
but um yeah
and you know it's it's still pretty rural
uh not too much of northern virginia is like that anymore
so is your house in an area by itself
there's another one half an acre away or a quarter acre away rather
but it's not they're not connected are they
you have to uh stay in one single family home
uh my folks um had an apartment for a while when we were kids
but um for the most part i- they they always had you know
and pennsylvania always had a single family home
you know as soon as we could we we got a single family home
and that's all i ever knew growing up
so i stayed in a townhouse for uh two years and then uh saved up enough money to to get a
and i'm in richardson texas
and i'm in plano
well here we go
i guess we're going to have a lot of parades this weekend in honor of these guys that are that did some stuff over in the gulf um
now did you push one
but i think it's
so i don't know too much about it
um you know i i just wanted to see if you know you had an opinion about this
or you know
um so if that's okay with you then i'll just press one
good morning um
i think i mean if if i start this i just wanted to say that um one of the things that i don't think we really understood about the the middle eastern situation is that they're a totally different type of people than we are
and i mean they think differently
and their idea of what is justice is totally different from ours
and and right now i i think that that's been proven in the fact that um they have just
well anyway i just think that you know the united states policy over there
i really do in in a major way because they just um that whole region over there i think needs to settle it's own differences within itself
and that's the way the course that they should go
i mean you know we can maybe help them a little bit prompt them
but i don't think this intervention at such high levels should be going on
the the thing with israel and palestine i believe that should be settled between them
and also um you know the other thing is their idea or our ide- idea of democracy has nothing to do with them
i mean tha- i mean i'm talking about the whole middle ea-
and and maybe this is too general
but i just believe that um they do not look at democracy the same way we do
and so you know trying to put like a square peg in a round hole is just you know
i- i don't think that that's the way to go in this
and um you know it it oh well that's that's a couple thoughts on it
i i guess you know i'd like you to maybe express something here
well i i i think overall that's right
and that's i- you know
you know an an i i think that um
true we do have completely different ways of looking at things at a lot of things
but uh at the same time i think there are a lot of there is a lot of good that the united states and other countries can do as far as example
and and uh
um i i guess we could be a catalyst for their change
and i don't think we'd be talking about this you know the israeli situation palestinian situation um sort of came to a head um unless there had been a war
i mean that was one thing
i i don't judge any war as good or bad
and i don't see any winners or losers
i'm sorry you know
but um i- i i just think you know you're right
and i think maybe it's at a whole different level of them trying to cooperate and get along
it's not going to be that we're going to uh you know sort of tell them to go to their room
and that's going to solve the whole problem
but that's the type of thing they understand
and you know
and so at that at that you have to work at their level
that that's true too
they wouldn't have understood anything else than what we did in the war
oh well yeah
they they understand violence
they love violent leaders to you know
i mean look at you know the leader they had
they they just adored him
and you know for a while there he had them be-
well it has a lot to do with their religion
that over there um
and i know this only because from personal experience that i'm speaking of this
because i i've you know traveled around town with different cab drivers in a situation where i've done that
and one one of the kindest people i've ever met in my whole life um is from that area of the country
and i mean he is just overly he he is abounding in kindness let's say
and his wife is so godly i mean every thought
you know and when you add the um commercialization of the western world it sort of screws everything up for them
and they have very basic life um
well it's just a very basic life
and they just really believe in allah or god or whatever
and it's you know everything is to the glory of allah
and and you know and it it's almost like
see using that
and they abuse that
and it's always been military
and it's always been
and that's that's always been the way of the world don't you think
which i think that that's not the the way the majority of the people over there really are
so it's really hard when you see the leaders compared to the people
but i think in a in a way the war uh i think in a way all the involvement over there too though has shown a lot of people that there are a lot of people that don't follow what those few are doing
and there are a lot of people who are good people
you know there's
and i i think we may not have ever have seen that without some of these uh newspeople being in there in the broadcasts and the the uh soldiers leaving um you know surrendering and
and and the you know
it just really comes down to people are people you know
doesn't matter where the boundaries are um you know
and those are man made boundaries
but you know for heaven sakes that's something that's been going on for ages
and i i think so much of it is what you're taught
you know they teach their children uh in such a way that
i guess uh i'll just start by saying that we entertain with uh a gourmet club here um which means that we have like eight eight people four couples
and most of the husbands
i mean the wives during the day you know get i guess so burned out on cooking whatever they have to cook every day
um you know they don't really care about gourmet stuff
but it was the guys that got together and did all this
oh that's nice
and um like my husband just he really really likes to cook in terms of um oh barbecue
and i mean all guys i think like to barbecue
but um he really does cook
and it's a good thing because you know you can't you can't knock that
but all these other guys do too
and so we've gotten together
and we just do these really elaborate gourmet meals
and it's really really kind of a neat thing to do
well we try
i mean because you know everybody is so active with their kids and all that
it's like you know if we can do it once every six months we're doing well
so i mean we originally started out you know when we were younger
then we would we tried to do it every other month
but lately it's just been once every six months
well that's much more reasonable
i was involved in a a club like that for um that you know where we tried to really do gourmet uh meals
and uh we we were a little bit too frequent i think
or anyway it was it was difficult
by the time we went around it was uh four couples
so uh by the time we got around uh to each of us and it was time again we were almost tired you know
um partly because um wh- gourmet cooking is not particularly conducive for regular dining
oh it is absolutely
and so i- we found that while we enjoyed the evening we regretted it the next day
um so uh we we kind of
and then one of the couples uh moved
and so we sort of didn't didn't continue it
but um and i must admit that as you say when your children start taking up your time then you you don't have as much time for uh regular entertaining
but um uh uh when when we entertain i usually try to find something that will be
and that's that sometimes means you can't do gourmet
and we have a gourmet friend that can't stand fish
so i mean he can get within
well one of my friends doesn't eat any cheese at all
uh so that's a real problem because so many dishes require cheese
uh well i take that back
uh she can't eat some cream cheese
but that that really limits
it makes you uh keep looking for recipes every time you have an eye out
so we we try to keep all that in mind
but otherwise um i guess you know entertaining um
i i guess i have recipes
but that's that's basically what we do is the gourmet
so you know they would be pretty elaborate
um but it's fun
i mean it took us four days to cook a stock and three days to make this stuff
you know you get all prepared
but you're right
and i'm glad
because it is it's a quite a treat
but so you like food
and i just love the the community of food
oh sure i do too
i just love sharing meals and and whatever you can do you know to do that
i don't think you have to be you know more than hamburgers and hot dogs out
in the backyard and the and the coleslaw and potato salad
well my um
and so we're having
a uh few people in sunday afternoon
and i did a cop out on to it
well i have to
and i have to make hors d'oeuvres
and i have to make dessert
uh so oh i'm buying the little tiny rolls and so on
but i can't do it you know working full-time
and it's just too much
we're all not built like uh what what
martha stewart you know
we all aren't martha stewart and have our coordinated glasses and tablecloths and and time to you know sh- t-
but it's it's really kind of a neat thing
i i really do
i mean i love to make things from scratch you know
and and you know people really pretty much appreciate it
oh they do
i- it's very difficult to purchase um
oh i think so
um in spite of uh
or if you if you do buy it it's extremely expensive
in fact uh i just got back from a shopping trip to purch- purchase the cold cuts
and i i bought turkey and pastrami and and barbecued ham at a an amish market near here
and i've never been there before
and found that there's uh individual vendors
and the foods are wonderful
and one of the uh the um
and it's like thirteen fifty for a whole strawberry cheesecake um which is really not such a bad price
i decided i i just couldn't quite make myself um buy it because i do make cheesecake
and somehow i didn't want to do that because it
but i was very tempted because it looked wonderful
and the- they had black forest cherry cake and all those things
that ar- but those are homemade
they are not um commercial bakery made
and in that they are made in their homes um
so it it's kind of interesting uh
oh it is
i mean we have bakeries around here that you know you you just gain weight going by the door
you know just like that
but i don't know
i guess some of the best things i've ever had um i some of them were just hors d'oeuvres you know
doing little hors d'oeuvre things that i have a kick making that i mean you know
but um gee we have so much going on here because
you know chips and picante sauce and anything hot
you know you can always make it hotter
and and lots of stuff like that you know
so that's um a really good party time
and and they just love it you know down here
it just just you know
oh i'm not
and how i got
of virginia i'm
did um do you have a favorite hors d'oeuvre recipe that's easy
or is it always complicat-
in fact it just came to mind um
what was one of the latest ones that you've seen actually
oh i gue- i think we rented pretty woman a couple weeks months ago
uh become available to come and go more often
so i said hey it's worth it
and i can see what i please
see i went about two or three weeks ago and saw f x two
and that is a really good movie if you like special effects
kind of gory and lots of you know action
uh and he was
the guy the guy that played in it he was not the star but the one that played in it that i liked best was the one who was in uh
i don't i don't know what his name is
uh i think i know who you are talking about though
and that one was just a very poignant story
it it it had people
it was it was
but it was
and there was it was like uh uh steel magnolias
and there was humor involved
but the story was a very dramatic story
and i enjoyed it very much
oh i'm trying to think uh
but then when it started i just couldn't you know read
and you know the second time you see it you understand more subtleties in it
there's quite a few uh movies out now that i would like to go see
and i guess more than anything that is why we don't go
plus by the time you get a baby-sitter and then pay to go to the movies it just gets pretty expensive
well you are going to have to find a mother's day out and have him call in sick one day
and the price is as reasonable as renting a video
and that's the way i do it
and i go quite frequently
now i was warlock too which is supposed to be the story of a uh witch hunt that is you know magically shot into the present time
and the first five minutes or ten minutes of the movie was i was very well persuaded to walk out very well persuaded
but as the movie settles down to a comfortable action uh i can't really that it would have gotten more than a star and a half from me either
uh the action was comfortable
and of course i enjoyed those good guy bad guy type conflicts things
so i enjoyed that movie after the first few minutes of gore
and there were some others
but they were done a little more tastefully
but uh in the first scene the warlock chopped off a guy's finger because he wanted the ring and then bit his tongue out and spit it off in the omelet
and i could not handle that
then uh i saw awakening
i uh i uh
and he has done a really good job of characterizing the uh disabled person
and of course robin williams always just has a an air about him that you can't help but enjoy what he is doing
even when he's sad you know you great faith that he will get happy again
and then oh let's see there's a couple or three that i would like to go see before they go into videos
and they will be videos
they say if you really want to be uh you really want some suspense that's the one to see
and i understand that's a sequel to an earlier movie that showed about two weeks ago on television uh
well you know i think i read about that too
and i'm going to try to get in dances with wolves
oh you haven't
but i it's just that they are both very long uh movies
and the matinee starts before i can get away from work
and after after that i get involved in other things and don't want to don't want to go back
we uh we uh rented the other one
i was trying to think of the other one that we had rented lately uh was presumed innocent with uh
and i thought that was really good
you know i saw that
and i really
uh not defense
and there was a murder of one of the women that was in the the d a office
and then he ended up being accused of it
oh that's right
so i mean it really kind of had a turn at the end when you found out who it was
well i've had a hard time enjoying harrison ford in anything since the indiana jones movies
but i don't want to see him in other things
but uh i tell you sean connery in the hunt for red october
i i never did care for him as in the james bond movies
but he was always slick and greasy and seemed to be conceited and had more women than he needed
but he has really developed into a marvelous character actor as he has come older
and there is just a there's a
i don't know uh
and he he has that merry look about his eyes that looks like he stays in mischief all time
and i enjoy those
and i enjoy some of the michael j fox movies
uh the last
like back to the future then was the last one
it was called uh
i've actually i am reading a couple of different books
one wa- is uh a story
well it is not a story
it is a collection of uh of memos supposedly written by howard hughes uh
that was uh that was
and i have just now gotten around to reading it
but uh jus- jus-
oh i do not remember the man's name
he was used to be a reporter for uh i think the new york times or the washington post one of the two
and he supposedly got this this s- story uh i mean this uh was contacted by this guy who had these these memos he wanted to sell
and they were they were ones that had supposedly been stolen from the uh corporate headquarters in uh in los angeles
or i guess they still do uh
had a uh uh big warehouse kind of thing which had offices
and it was sort of nondescript for a uh you know for the size of the company which inside was basically a store house of a bunch of stuff he collected
he he was uh a great collector of everything
he he he did not he did not throw anything away
and uh supposedly this guy had had been breaking there for awhi-
he was a like you know burglar had been breaking there awhile and uh
and they uh they broke in one one night and found a bunch of memos that were uh supposedly from from hughes to uh to his main uh main a- assistant back uh in the fifties and si- well i guess in the sixties
well that is interesting
so it's pretty interesting work
it's a it's a little it's a little hard
and you know it does not have a real story or any plot
and they have not made a movie of the week of it yet
but it's but it is it is real interesting
uh i also reading uh the uh thi-
it's a an old another old book that i happen to have
it's uh a book about uh the bermuda triangle
but it's uh it's about it's a real good book that a guy uh wrote who was uh a research librarian
he wrote uh sort of
he he was thinking many many of the
and you know uh and the rea- reason i was picked it back up was in light of all the uh well when they found the uh the airplanes on the in the atlantic thinking they were flight nineteen
and i don't know if you are familiar with that at all
but it's uh
flight nineteen was one of the uh
and they were
and so and in the book you know even
and even and even then he
and uh because he he mentions he he goes through and brings out points from the navy's findings and so forth
and uh it's probably you know real close to what you know everyone is thinking now that
on that same topic have you ever read anything about you know the amelia earhart story whatever happened with her
i i think that would be
i am sure there is something out there uh
i would i would like to too
because it's a lot of things coming up here lately about her you know possibilities of he- of where she
well whatever this is one aspect of it
of course you know it is so weird
cause no one will ever really know
it's it tha-
so but it's entertaining
and it makes you think about things
so that is pretty much for right now
and uh i like to read a novel every now and then
but uh i am trying to get away from just reading novels all the time
well i i guess i just have not read anyth-
i mean usually i just if i find a good book i will sit you know for two days until it is finished if it's that good
and i think the last one i read like that was scott thurow's
and that was presumed innocent
and i just really really liked the way he writes
i got it uh right
my uh you know
he was an an assistant district attorney in chicago at uh and while he was writing the book
and uh my sister-in-law lives in chicago
and she had before it actually got big she sent me this book saying you might like this
this guy is you know
and uh i read it and really liked it
and then about
and uh so i
and and the other book i am trying to think you know like was in the last year
and i think i did read tom wolfe and vanity uh
oh the movie was a joke
i mean because tom wolfe is so perceptive
when it comes to you know pinpointing uh so- so- society's ills and
and and so it was it was a much more intense book than the sort of flimflam that they cast off in the movie
and anyway we are not talking about that
but uh gee i just i like to read gardening books and things like that just to tell me what
i have a lot of uh uh computer books that
i am i do computer work
and so i have a lot of those
so i spend a lot of time looking through those not necessarily reading them but
but i i'm interested in a lot of that
but uh i have got a lot of books that i i intend to read
but i have not been able to yet you know for one reason or another
like what is a book on your list
you know i have a list too
and i have never gotten to it
cause i just kind of uh i just have all the books out you know
and i have them all out
and usually when i am through with one i will go in
i have one now and i i can not remember the name of it that i that i got is
the sister-in-law in chicago usually sends me for my birthday or or christmas or something will send me another another good book
and i can not remember the name of it uh
and that was detroit
well it wasn't really
it was um uh to see an old relative
and it was uh just to uh
so you probably wouldn't recommend that as a big tourist spot
the only thing that i i visited that you know is quite a tourist spot is cancun mexico
ooh that would be nice
and that was real nice uh
ooh that would be nice
oh that would be enjoyable
um usually when we go we go to colorado to estes park area
and uh stay in the mountains up there do a little hiking and resting get away from the texas heat that kind of thing
oh that's always refreshing to get away from
so it's a lot of fun
so i guess it was kind of like a vacation the
oh well that's nice
and so i got to
so that's probably my favorite place when i have to go somewhere on a vacation
well my uh my middle daughter and her husband have just taken up a new activity
and that's canoeing
and uh they've been to the guadalupe river
and they also uh uh have been to uh i guess colorado
and they've really enjoyed it
and that's the best place that i've ever canoed
and they had
and he would give a little talk about
you know i think he wasn't a real mountain man
but we were pretty convinced he was a full
and we would have to we'd
and he'd make sassafras tea out of sassafras roots that he'd found
oh that's neat
and then the river was really nice because it wasn't too frightening
but it wasn't
you know too easy either
well you learn a lot of um skills too
and i think you're more receptive when you're younger than when you're older to learn new skills
and i think they really
so you have kind of a relaxed mode of learning
and you're more receptive
well that's good
well we um let's see
the only other place i've ever vacationed we'd you know go on camping trips up to texoma and things like that
oh that's exciting
and then i went to england a few years ago
student there and spent um a semester studying abroad in london
and that was a great time because it's so that's such a neat place
and it's there's not a language barrier
so you don't
i mean there
and a lot of people have trouble wrestling with their accents
i i i really enjoyed that
well i had a friend that uh visited england not well i think it's been probably two years now
but that's her next goal and she can do it is go back to england
because she really has a great desire to do that
because the love that she um has for it now after visiting it
it it's really nice
i would i would spend all my time in london
because i don't get much into urban you know really urban areas a lot and it was it's really it's sort of a weird little anonymous feeling where no one knows who you are
and you can spend a whole day without talking to anyone which i thought i would just hate
but it ended up being kind of nice
you could just kind of
and i had a great time doing that
i haven't i haven't been anywhere else outside the united states
well i lived across the street almost from canada
so that was that that's a nice place
then i i'd love to go somewhere in asia
but i'd have to have a
that's why that's why england was nice
and that was even nice because there wasn't uh the
most the places we went we went to germany and switzerland and
well you've been quite a few places there
we we did we whirlwinded through
and you slept on the train at night
oh that's great
but there wasn't a
and everyone in switzerland
and then no one knew english in there
and we were just
but it was
oh i had fondue
and that was
we were able to have that pretty pretty effortlessly
it was it was a pleasant time
i'd i'd love to go back there
i guess that's why we need to plan for retirement so when we do have the free time we'll have the the means to uh pursue our dreams
well it was nice talking with you too craig
well and have a good afternoon
well do you uh keep a family budget
or do you have some
and i probably re- rebelled against it
well uh we sort of started doing it years and years ago
and my husband started graduate school when we were first married
and i sort of just got in the habit i guess and you know never have gotten out of it
it's more just a a pretty uh a fairly uh accurate uh recording of what i spend
and i have recently uh
and i will probably ke- start keeping a little better
i just uh spent whatever came in and and uh didn- never knew what came in and what went out
but uh just you know like about like the government runs
so i think it is probably better to have some sort of a a at least a record
but my dad was so precise
that i mean if it said to spend eleven percent on something that's what it was spent
and that was put over there
and i mean of course he is from the depression
so uh you know it's his life
but uh i would i think it would be smart if somebody would keep uh some sort of a plan that works for them
i think you are right um uh
well i- it must have been sort of interesting to us
is to uh it's because since i have pretty much kept my record books for the last fifteen years i guess i can go back and look
and it's real fun to just see how things have changed over the years uh
and my father had kept them i think since nineteen twenty-seven
but he burned the ones from twenty-seven to fi-
but then so i took the ones from fifty-two on to the present
but to look to have looked back into the twenties thirties and forties it would have been fantastic
well as a matter of fact uh my mother was going through some things not lon- not long ago i guess it has been a couple of years ago
and she came upon a a budget book that she had back in the thirties uh
it was the late well
i guess it would have been i will take that back it must have been in the forties because they had been married uh probably fifteen years at the time
i mean it was it was just almost laughable in some instances that you know
but uh never the less it was fun to see those figures next to you know
for a pr- pair of shoes was like five dollars
well even in nineteen sixty-three
i found a record that i had uh i travel in europe a lot and i what i had paid for hotels
and a similar hotel in paris is two hundred dollars a night now
and i paid uh oh between four and five dollars
oh isn't that
and that's really crazy
cause that's about thirty years ago
oh that is that is really really something
oh but of course it's just what the market will bear
that's that's right
that's exa- that's just good old economics working
but our two children are just uh as um unlike as night and day
and our daughter watches her pennies so closely
i mean she has everything planned so closely
well then you never know how they will
get to be uh ol- we- older
and she may marry somebody
and of course it would be good because it you marry somebody a little loose then she will have that stability of watching uh
you should have one in the in the in the house
and i think
because i think my husband was not quite as uh good at saving and so on before we got married
and i was
i was putting money aside and when before i was married you know when i was working out of college
uh that really paid off
because when time came for him to go back to graduate school we were in in fairly good shape financially as far as not having any major debts
so but what does you husband do now
uh he is an engineer
he is uh
an electrical engineer and in fact went through uh many years of graduate school and got his p h d
had a lot of lot of years of budgeting
and you know
and it uh
and i have got
well i'm working i'm working on my masters degree now
so in fact this last year we had three
and our daughter graduated this year
and i'm just about ready to finish my masters degree
so we have had uh once again you know some really a real lean year for us
oh i i know
so that was four
so we were both in the same
you know exactly what it what it's like then
and it's uh
i guess you figure that that is an investment that is uh really a in- invaluable
so it's it's one that you can live through
think that that's the way that we looked at it in our beginnings when my husband was in graduate school that there was a light at the end of that tunnel you know
that that it was worth it to save and to not have uh something and uh in return know that something better was going to be at the end of it
so uh it really makes it easier
and i i wish i could hear more about your historian part of your life because that sounds really fascinating to me
well if i had your address i would send you
and i can take some real great tours to europe
well my my husband
um actually we did not take a tour
we we were in england and and uh went to ireland and scotland and just rented cars and
but uh um i
so i i'm jerry hammond
and i'm out at brookhaven college
so you could just holler at me there
oh you are kidding
well i'm going to be teaching at brookhaven in the fall
and i will be
in the communications department teaching uh english one oh one to
oh well i know zack miller real well
well it's been good ta- it's been a good type conversation
well uh ho- how do you view this whole subject
are you uh one who feels like you have have benefited from the change in in roles in women
or or what do you think
are you uh are you someone who works outside your home
or have you
well uh have there been significant changes uh do you think in the employment place ex- especially
have has anything in particular changed that you have noticed
uh i guess there's more women in uh what would be classified as a man's job
what what kind of work do you do
but we have got more women in it now
in years past i know in fact even even the word drafter has changed
because it used to be they were draftsman
we have some engineers that still on their uh
and i want to scratch it out and
but i thought well i am
maybe not huh
well uh i when i was in college
and i was a math major which was a real rarity
so i was in a lot of classes where uh there i was either the only girl or you know one of just a very
so that was a change
and uh even uh i did not uh use my math uh in my work
i i became a technical writer
but uh even so there were very very few women in technical writing
but that has changed a lot
in recent years it has just really really changed a lot
and and i think that uh you know the one thing that i have seen is that more and more women are getting into management
but i think they have got a long way to go
there was something on t v the other day that said that fewer than one or two percent of the heads of uh chairmen of the board chair- chair persons uh if you sa- if you will
and i thought that you know that's pretty si- a pretty significantly small number
so there are some some strides to be made there
but uh i do not know
i i think we have come a long way
when i think about you know when things were like even when i you know just when i was in high school
that men that women were not able to succeed
so anyway do you have children
in fact i have a daughter who is in a a who just graduated in civil engineering from college
so she is pretty much although there were some other women in her class
she was you know uh one of the minorities
uh females in the class
so she definitely entering into uh a male profession
but you know for instance there are there is the organization women the society of women engineers
so that is recognized
as uh you know a place where women should be
i you see it in uh also in uh like in church uh where more and more women are becoming ministers
in uh you know in protestant congregations
and uh it will be interesting to see if if roman catholicism ever uh recognizes women in in the role of priest
i do- i do not know if you are roman catholic or
you know what you know about that
but uh that is one area where it
so uh uh how about what in particular would you think that uh women still other than the work place where women still are being uh oh you know found wanting you know or not re- as highly regarded as men would be uh
oh i know something
what do you think that what do you think tell me what you think about this
because i know that there now there they want the armed forces to recognize that women can serve in combat roles
and the only uh branch in the armed fo- services that seems willing to do that is the air force
uh i spoke because women were filing flying missions into you know for whatever reason into uh in the persian gulf war
and so but i know some of the other services do not think that women are capable of doing the job
they were i was listening to some of the comments on ra- television the other day
uh about it
i do not know if he was a general or you know what his rank was very high
i mean i can not be real you know i can not tell you why i feel this way
but i just would rather have uh a man doing some of these jobs than a woman
i thought well at least he was honest
but that does not sit very well with a lot of folks i am sure
you know neil well neil as far as i am concerned and i could be wrong about this but the only one area where a woman could not do it is if she just physically did not have the strength
uh because i would think i think you know mentally uh and emotionally i think women can handle a job and
oh i do too
so anyway it's still
and you know if she wanted to go to combat
but i am sure that there are women who would would relish that
you know kind of job
uh i guess that should be taken into consideration
so well this is an interesting topic
um i have you know i have
having a daughter who has gone into this into engineering
so that's that's progress i guess
well same here
uh have you talked with a lot of people in this project
but at home uh the recorder gets my calls
but i probably talked to seven or eight people
because uh i i guess i placed all but one or two of my calls
and uh only because i going to make some money
see we our choir is doing this as a money ma- raising project
we we got the connection through a t i
and uh uh so we are doing it to raise money for uh a large project at church
and uh so i feel like this is one way i can contribute that's
so uh i thought well i will just get on the stick and do it
well i will say good-bye to you
but i have enjoyed the conversation
well thanks for calling
one of the interesting things that i have considered about the role change for women is that women of my age my generation were trained and taught and brought up to be the leave it to beaver housewives
but we are not living in that world
and it makes you really concerned
you know let the world train them what to do
but characteristically you know the women are trained or have been in the past trained in the home
and i really would be at a loss to to raise and train a girl
well even even raising boys today is different though because
you know used to be they would just go off to work and come home
and you know everything was done
and it it's a different world
some good some bad uh
i i have chosen to stay at home
and i have a ten year old and a twelve year old
and i was a single parent for awhile and worked
and that was great
i was able to and i was able to provide for my children
and and you know
but i i thank god everyday now
and and uh i volunteer a whole lot
and uh that's my job right now
and i i love it
and that will come
and i am looking forward to that too
but that's a different phase in my life
and i am i am glad that i am able to do what i want to do right now
well you know there's a lot of things that have happened actually
and and it's it's like the it's like oil on top of water
but it's never different in a lot of ways
then as times changed uh as it is today we do not do a lot of physical labor
even in hous- even in housekeeping
you are not right
and in that respect we have to make ourselves become involved in physical exertion
or we really do develop some health problems
so in in that in that respect i am not so sure that the hard work of years past was not better for us than we are willing to admit
but don't you think it's that way with men too
i mean you know men are sitting behind desks a whole lot more
oh absolutely true
it's that's true with society
but specifically the woman's role
and you know medical reports tell us that women are developing diseases now that used to be predominately male diseases
and i think that that's a that's a symptom of our society
it's a symptom that there's there's a general illness that needs to be healed
i am not i am not god
but i i do know that in raising my boys i really did meet a lot of pressures saying you know you need to get them into music lessons
and i fought all of those things
and they will say mom this is important to me
you know it's funny
and that's the way it is with a woman too
i was rea- i was really looking forward to summer thinking oh we are going to have some time off
and it's been real busy
and actually today is really the first as far as i am concerned the first day of summer
and uh you are right
uh well that's how society has changed uh
you know uh
we you know we find ourselves doing things that
you know i do not remember
it's it's different
it's it's just very different
well i just am very much a believer in quiet personal time
and i guarded my children's rights for that
and i think that that's one of the things that women are sacrificing that they should not do
but is not that difficult to do when you are working full time and have to come home and prepare a meal and
well i think
and you know where do you find the time
um well in the first place it's not your homework
and i was always very careful to be there only when they came to me and asked me for help
and that's all
and that is accepting responsibility for things that really are other people's responsibilities
and then that way we have not changed in
but i do not know
and that's never changed
that's that's very true
i as a matter of fact i was talking to a friend yesterday who said she has a new policy in her home
and when her her family comes to her and says fix this you know
you know another member of the family
and i say no
you know you work it out for yourself
and she said it's amazing she said
and they dra- suck me into these arguments and
and i ha- i am supposed to be
and she said i am not doing it anymore
i i just
you know i think that's one of the things that we have today that is very useful
and i think every woman ought to deal with it or ought to at least be exposed to it
and that is mediation training
uh we are not talking about strikes or things
uh you know boss and employee those kinds of things interpersonal mediation
because the mediator is an unbiased bystander who
and i've been raised around prison prisons all my life
and i believe if you don't have a punishment befitting the crime there's not any deterrent
and so many of those kind of people they got they have a better life in prison than they have on the street anyway
so you know unless they really make it rough on them that's not a going to prison for a little while is not much of a deterrent i don't think
well i don't know what oklahoma's laws are
but texas's i don't know are
it's it's no ones f-
i mean it's not the judges fault i don't think
man our cr- our uh prisons are so crowded that uh they can commit some pretty serious crimes and be set free within a year to two
well see we were under uh the states prisons were under a mandate to uh
and the federal came in and said hey you know you have either got to build more prisons or let people go
well that's what ours did same thing
and finally our governor at the time which who is not in office now came in and said okay where we draw the line is no sex offenders will be let loose
under early bail you know or early uh get out
but uh we have
but there have been w-
and you know i
maybe it should be uh well it should be given you know i i won't say sparingly
but i do believe it should be befitting the crime
and and you know but the way the courts are set up they've they've got so many chances for appeal
but i think th- i think it needs to be expedited
you know if they've been convicted and given an appeal and they're still convicted of of a crime that's deserving of of a lethal injection let's do it and not waste so many years to do it
of course you know they're they're entitled to a speedy trial
but then they're they're also entitled to drag it through the courts for years and years and years on appeals
so somehow you know it doesn't really balance out too much
and it seems even though you know that they got
you know i'm tired of fighting it
and at that point you know i i really think there needs to be maybe a shorter appeal process
and i don't see why it couldn't be shortened considerably
but you know
well part of that is the overcrowding of the court system
it is overcrowded because there's so much drug uh problem with the people on drugs
because that ha-
they with the drugs they're they're robbing and killing
and uh that's why it's filled the prisons up so much i think
uh it doesn't it doesn't help them any at all and of course your court system when you get into the appeals
and the whole judicial system is backed up with a lot of junk that shouldn't be in there
we've gotten into a very litigious uh type of life
but anyway i'm glad to hear that you agree with me on the
well i just
i'm i'm very muchly for it
and if if you don't have the punishment you double your crime
and the you know that is just personal feeling
it it's it's supported with facts though
um tell me some about your camping experiences carolyn
well um i have gone to girls camp a few times as a you know a chaperon or a leader whatever and uh i enjoy camping
we ha- we have a tent
and we've gone even with our family a few times out camping and have a camp stove um
i guess our our my biggest memory is when we froze to death
wh- where do you go camping at around here
uh we went camping at uh lake bonham which is is pretty close here um
and and it got really cold at night
and of course we were close enough that we could go back and get some more blankets and things in the morning
uh what uh what activities do you do when you're camping
oh we take little nature hikes
and and uh we take along games that we can play with the with the kids and just that kind of stuff
usually try to have a uh occasionally a camp fire at night you know and roast the marshmallows and what all
well that sounds like fun
i uh i grew up in south dakota up in the black hills and so we used to go camping
there was there was four of us kids
we'd he'd take us
and we'd all go camping my dad and my mom and and the kids
and it was always fun uh
because what i always remember is my dad would let us pick our camp spot
and uh he'd always tell us you know okay look for you know a nice flat little area where we can pitch our tents
and it always had to be somewhere near a a river so we could go fishing
and hopefully we'd catch our supper
but we never did but it was it was always fun
and she'd bring along you know something because
so we always had
but then we'd roast roast marshmallows
and it it was always an enjoyable experience
uh about nineteen eighty-two i moved from rapid city in the black hills
i crossed the state to to aberdeen
and uh there's no hills
and then i was in high school
and uh couple of friends couple of my high school friends and i we'd go camping out by a river of course and and go fishing
but by then of course i was able to catch uh catch some things
but it it was always fun
it was a different experience camping in the hills versus camping just by a river you know in the hills we we would do like you di- you folks did you folks did would take the nature hikes and you know and look for animals
and we always you know
we used to live in utah and uh of course there's lots of mountains around there to camp in and and streams and stuff
that's that's a great place to go camping
and the hiking is just really great
you know hike up those mountains is just really fantastic um
now is there anything uh are there any mountains or big rocks a person could hike around this area
i'm not acquainted with any you know
there's woods and things out in east texas tyler area you know
there's a tyler state park that's uh really a nice camping area
but it it's just a lot of trees
i don't know of any place in texas that has uh really big you know what i call mountains
the rocky mountains are so much uh
bigger than anything that they've they've got down here that
is the one in tyler has it been pretty commercialized i suppose
it's not well it's not too bad
they have um screened in areas you know
i guess they could call them that but they're they're more just a screened in uh camping area whatever
they're they're not bad
helps helps keep the the pests out i suppose
well that sounds
but you know it sure beats driving a thousand miles to
i i take it you haven't done a whole lot of camping in this area
we just moved down in in june
oh i see
well you're still uh get- you're just trying to get over the culture shock still
i if i can get on central from anywhere i'm happy
well really the ideal times to camp in this area are early spring and in in the fall
i mean there's there's a lot
um huh well i don't like it when uh people listen to my phone conversations like if they're outside my door while i'm talking in my room
or when people like look through my things in my bedroom
i i find it very annoying when i've worked all day to come in and my phone to ring constantly the solicitors and the carpet cleaning companies and
and i am trying to get a few things done
and i can't do anything but answer the telephone
but i wish i could put a stop to it
but i don't know what to do to stop it
even uh we used to have a sign on our door that said no soliciting
and they would still come to our door and knock and
are you stil- do you live at home with your parents
so your privacy is invaded probably by other members of the family
now what can you do to stop that
oh i don't know
well i am used to it now
and maybe they will respect yours
well i don't know
but they don't live at home
and they nearly drove me crazy listening to telephone conversations
oh i used to do that though
and then they would go get on the other extension and i could hear them
but i couldn't get them to hang up you know
but i stopped doing that a long time ago
and they still do it to me
oh like s-
and she'll just sit there and listen
and she just started
and she is nice
but you know
well occasionally we'll have a person here or there but not not as many as the phone calls
and i guess that's really th- the thing that really bugs me the most
but they've all gotten grown up now and we live in a neighborhood where there is not any little kids to bother me
but what else would be an annoyance
well i guess traffic could be an annoyance
um it can get busy
and you would like to
and i've been through dallas texas
so when i first moved here i probably did consider that an invasion of privacy
because it at first you'd hear a lot of noise especially at night you know when you go to bed
and every time a a fire truck or anything went down the road i would wake up
but i guess i have gotten used to it because i don't even hear it anymore
and uh i just close it out i guess because i don't i don't remember waking up in several years at night when i'd hear a fire truck go by you know
so that probably wouldn't bother me
well did you have has name all over them
it was a a letter from a girlfriend of mine
i i just i was upset because those were mine
and you know i thought he
so that was upsetting
i was going to say my uh college is northern state university in aberdeen south dakota
and our head football coach dennis muir
so i thought that was kind of an in- interesting coincidence
so you went to what college
uh northern state university in aberdeen south dakota
and what did you graduate in
and i'm going into nursing so
well that sounds interesting
but it's probably going to take me longer because i didn't decide to major in that until
you know i read a study once
and it said that uh like thirty-four percent of uh college students actually graduate in four years from a four year program
it took me it took me five years
so you just you get started
and you change your mind
or you want to pick up a second major
if you're management you you thought i i'll take that marketing
it's just only was three more classes you know
and you just doesn't happen that you get out in four years
so what is your advice to picking a college
my advice is is uh look for at the student to faculty ratio you know
oh that's great
which is you know
it it's interesting
but it it's
what i thought was nice is you could al- there was always time to talk to professor you know
and and they knew you
you weren't just in their class you know
and so you could you could go talk to them in their office almost at any time
and or if you ran into them in the student union or whatever you know you could sit down talk to them about a problem
so but i i's i i put that against uh my high school where we had uh a biology class of three hundred and fifty students
yeah it was a biology lecture class and you know it it just wasn't the same
and you're taking notes
and you know you got a computerized test scores multiple choice because there's no way they could correct a three hundred fifty point short answer test uh you know a three hundred fifty person short answer test
and it just wasn't the same
you you'd run you'd pass the teacher in high school
and even in high school you could say high to your teachers unless you're in that biology class
and they just they'd look at you like do i know you
so it's hard to get individual help
do you get uh a lot of tutoring
very little i mean
well like my
for example i have i'm in a chemistry class right now and there's tons of students in it
and there's one t a for the whole class
and he only has certain office hours
and so there's only certain times you can talk to him
and you could get there
and his office hours could i mean he could have like a nine to eleven in the morning office hours and have forty-two people waiting to talk to him
and you still didn't get to talk to him anyway
well what would be your advice to a parent of a child thinking of attending college
oh man i think your advice is good
um let's see my advice would be to pick a major before you get into college
and i took tons of classes that i didn't need to
and um i don't know
i just feel like i'm it's it's going to take me a lot longer than
and not that's always bad
well it it it does get it
you know you get to the point where it's i'm never going to get done
you know i i mean i was taking summer classes
and let me get out of here
but uh no
even if you don't have your major decided on have an idea what you think you might want you know
so you don't want management
but you think you want business
i haven't uh talked to anybody outside the metroplex
so i didn't even think of saying arlington texas
i i i've been trying to get people at five thirty and six thirty in the evening
and i thought well i'm not having any luck
well i'm i'm happy we got through
well do you have any uh opinion on the subject
well i'm i'm especially interested with what what's happening in the soviet union uh
the the move to uh the the the ukraine's vote to uh basically to secede and set itself up independently uh is quite a remarkable counts
is that is that reported in the texas papers
we uh we hear a little of the news
how how big is the ukraine the area
uh as an area it's not
i i'm afraid i don't have the statistics in front of me
if i was looking at a u s map i would say it was sort of reminds me of of a uh
but but but it's it's more significant in the sense of it's a great agricultural region
oh i see
oh i i didn't really know that
i know a lot of their oh their countries that they had overtaken or wanted to be independent or several of them right
and uh what about astonia
the three the three baltic uh republics got out as quickly as they could
but but the the ukraine is especially significant because it of the agriculture
it's it's very important for the economics of the whole of the soviet union
uh so there were probably really fight to keep it in if they could
it's done democratically uh
and bush has already given his
so now uh not that they may that may matter
i uh fear for the russians from what i read you know
sounds to me like they'll start rioting soon or not that that would do any good
but i guess people do that when they're desperate
that that's true uh hasn't happened here for a while
but it uh
well that's true
i guess when the veterans went to washington and well you know the war riots of course
i've i've heard they're i hear you have some problems
well we do
we have lots and lots of uh layoffs here lot of companies folding lot of layoffs
and it's pretty scary
do do you do you blame the the government in washington for this
well i don't understand economics that well
i i know that we have a terrible situation with foreign trade and that other countries put a lot of restrictions that we don't and so i assume that that has some effect or a great effect
and i do uh i mean they said during the way reagan-bush years the rich got richer
so uh i i guess
so then you think it's it's you think it's reagan and bush have done this
or is it just coincidence it was during this period
well i really don't know
i think maybe they uh maybe they contributed to it
maybe they should pay more attention to these trade or you know to the more equalization of the trade
of course if somebody in in china can make something for ten cents and we have to make it for ten dollars because we have unions well i don't know what's going to happen then
oh the chinese use slave labor too
that's that's one of the ways they get away with it
well i don't know
uh i don't think there's any one simple answer to the whole thing
i mean it's that's very complicated
well they say too that having a democratic congress and republican president is not good
i mean i've read that is a theory
so which one are we going to throw out
but i i'm tending to go straight back into my original democratic party
texas texas used to be a democratic state didn't it
oh i know
well you don't want too many democrats anymore
and for a while i kind of deserted the party
but now it's looking better to me
oh do you
oh i'm glad to hear that
well i think so too
i i just admire her a lot
and uh i ho- i really hope she does well
but she's uh n- you know probably more popular out of the state than she is here although she did manage to win
but look who she was running against you know
oh i i know some of the people
well i i uh we're going to compare notes uh
i uh i often desire to exercise often believe i should and rarely do
well i tell you i i firmly believe in exercising
what what what sort of of regiment do you have
well i just got back from biking twelve and a half miles
but this time of year you can't get much biking in uh
but every morning i use this president's uh council of physical fitness
and it really is uh uh it's worth doing
and you can do it anywhere
i i travel quite a bit in my in my business
and you can do it you know wherever you're at
and if you do it
i i do it every morning after uh usually after breakfast before i take a shower and get you know dressed going you know to go to work
and uh now what i do
i mean i've done this for you know like fifteen years
so you don't start at this kind of regiment you know
so what i'm telling you isn't something you go out and do
and and you'll hurt yourself
every every uh
but i uh i do twenty-five uh uh where you have your arms above your head and and your body twisters touch right you know left and right toe
and i do uh ten uh right and left uh trunk twisters
and i do uh about sixty uh bicycle type uh leg thrust type things
and i do uh twenty uh leg lifters on each side you know when you're p- laying on the floor
and then i do fifty push-ups and do a hundred sit ups
and uh then i do about uh
and then uh thirty uh
now if you did football like the old grass drills where you're on your stomach and you you know prone type things where you're kind of rocking on your stomach type thing
and that takes about really about maybe about thirteen minutes uh in the morning
now what what keeps you doing that
i mean i i sometimes start little much less much more modest efforts
but i give up
years ago i used to uh referee football and uh to stay in condition i did that uh just as a normal basis
and uh uh i tell you just by doing it uh
well example this summer i i was about fifteen pounds heavier than i wanted to be
so i i increased
i do three hundred sit ups a day now but not at that in the morning
and then i do about a hundred before supper and about a hundred before i go to bed
i lost fifteen pounds just by doing that because you tighten your stomach muscles and you know you can eat anything you want drink anything you want
but you don't you know
within reason you know you can lose weight or maintain your weight and your physical being and uh i just you know
i i i think it's really important
well i i whenever i do it i feel good i mean good that i have done good because it's it seems right and good because it has good effects
but but it's this maintaining a a regular habit that i just can't seem to do
well that's why chuck i think uh if you did it on a daily basis and you didn't need elaborate things you know where you can make excuses like
well i i like biking
and during the summer i'll do you know at least seventy-five miles a week and when i really was doing it maybe a hundred and fifty
but you can't you know
there's excuses weather or you don't have time or something like that
but if you do some basic exercises and you say every morning just like brushing your teeth you're going to spend fifteen minutes or a half hour
and you get up a half hour earlier and once you start getting into that one you just feel good and you look a whole lot better
do you do you does your wife participate in any of this
and there's no way i can get her to
it's a like it's something you either just really want to do it
if you don't like to exercise you know it isn't going to happen
i i sure wish she would
she's you know unfortunately overweight
and but she's a wonderful woman
and you know no sense getting in arguments with anybody about it
well i i uh i keep saying if somebody else would do it with me i that would be little bit of peer pressure would help considerably
but you seemed to have s- solved that problem without any any external help
and uh if you get one of these mats
you know go to a store they normally have these exercise things these a b c of physical fitness on them
what what what what's on what's this mat i mean
it it it's just an exercise mat that rolls up
so you can put it up you know just in the corner
but but it doesn't
i mean it's that it's that kind of like half inch of foam or something
and it's it's just about six feet long rolls up and i don't take it on trips with me
i you could
but uh i don't mind uh you know
if i do like sit ups i'll throw a a towel down or something
so you don't have the abrasive
what do you think about uh the self insurance business
well i watched something on t v a couple of months ago by uh general ex uh surgeon general koop
and he talked about canada's system
and it appears to work fine for the normal colds and things like that
but the expensive stuff heart uh operations and things they have a managed scarcity
and they said that in canada there were as many heart uh trauma centers as there is in san francisco
so in one city of in america there's as many uh hospitals that are equipped to do hosp- uh heart operations as in the entire area of canada
and that's kind of spooky
well i uh i understand what you're saying
and there's probably some truth to that
i think that uh generally i don't welcome added government responsibilities
however when a anybody can't police their own profession it eventually leads to that
and i think the costs and the uh the way the medical profession has every year
i being in my own business uh
and i think eventually the number of people that can afford health insurance as as it is now getting squeezed and squeezed tighter
uh i think they're asking for it
i i think the medical profession is just just pushing until there's no option but the government take it over
do you think that it's just uh medical guys
what about you know you know how expensive new equipment and technology is
well i i think a lot of it is uh
i i don't disagree totally with that
but uh my wife this last summer uh when we were on vacation tore up her knee
and uh uh it was lig- ligaments uh in her knee
as it turned out uh
she came back that uh
and uh she got home
and the leading orthopedic man who has handled football people for years and is as good as they come
i mean he knows knee problems okay
i mean if anyone does this guy knows it
well she goes in
he says well i think this is what it is
but uh you better go to the hospital and have one of these m r i things
a thousand dollars for this uh oh magnetic uh resonance imaging type thing
and my wife said well do i need that
and he says well uh you know it it'll help me diagnose this
i mean uh you know i i suggest you go have this thing
thousand uh uh dollars for thirty-five minutes
i mean doctors routinely send people in for anything
now for years they didn't have this
and they solved these problems
and you know
i said to her well look you know if you feel you got to go go
but i i think a thousand dollars
and even if they cost a hundred two hundred five hundred thousand dollars at uh roughly a thousand dollars every half hour uh that's ridiculous
i i don't care what anyone says
you know the costs are not
it shouldn't cost more than thirty-five bucks for something like that you know reasonableness
but they aren't reasonable
but there's another problem
and that's the how litigious our society is
well i think that should be that that's a another problem
but that's part of our legalese problem
and that the government eventually will address too
i i agree with you
you know uh i was on a jury
or i i didn't make the jury
but there was a
like it was three days after it was born
and he was the one that delivered it
and they got four attorneys
and he says well anyone have trouble awarding five million dollars
and i says yeah
i mean as sorrowful as it is uh you know if the doctor is wrong you know he should be pulled from his license
but five million dollars and away he goes because insurance pays for it you know
it it doesn't make logical sense to me
well aids is a nasty terrible disease
and you die from it
so i think that uh they need to look into it
and it's kind of like cancer
i don't you know
uh how about yourself
um well i'm certainly in favor of aids research
and i think probably the government could spend a bit more money on it than it does
because besides the fact that it's a deadly disease that it's a contagious disease so that it's um
and uh yeah
uh in the country america
yeah and they have millions
sometimes you hear things that on the radio that you know could be true or couldn't be
uh do you feel like this is
i i guess they're spending a billion or so a year on this aids research
uh i i think they should actually although prob- perhaps not a an incredible amount more than what they're doing
and i don't necessarily think that they should uh fund aids research and in the process neglect cancer research or whatever
um well i well i am sorry that he has the virus
i um i don't know
i don't i think it's very strange that the media hasn't um questioned him more strongly to about gay sex or intravenous drugs or anything like that as they probably would for a lot of other people
do you think he's the hero that he's being called by a bunch of other a bunch of the media
um well not not really though i mean i think he's probably doing the right thing for a man in his position
but i don't think it's anything exceptional that he's doing
you know i took advantage of the opportunity when you know he came out
i talked to my kids about it you know it's something that i hadn't hadn't done before
well that's good
i'm glad that mister johnson's changed his tune on uh safe sex to abstinence
or i was glad he did that for young kids because a lot of kids would have ended up dying because of what he was promoting
uh let's see
uh you don't uh
i guess you might might not
he's actually um
and he is now in full-blown aids really not doing very well and has a brain tumor or some- that sort of thing
it's it's a very nasty thing
that's that's basically it that um the immune system can at first slow down
and the white blood cell count goes down
which is that's aids related complex
but then when things get completely out of control and it basically hits bottom that's aids and in that case you know people are prone to getting any kind of you know weird cancer that only animals got before and
all right um um well uh
and i had a hatchback a nineteen seventy-eight version before this one
and uh i'll be honest with you
i have never found any automobile that has been more conscientiously constructed and and uh put together
and it it does its job
and i i did have to put two two new front tires on at fifty thousand miles
but that car just purrs like the day it was built
i get forty-two miles per gallon on the highway and uh twen- twenty-eight to thirty driving around in town
and i can carry more in that uh that trunk area in my little honda than i can in the big cars
and i have a large um pontiac
and i have a sixty-nine cougar which really is i'm saving because it's it's old
but it's in beautiful shape
but i can carry as much in my honda or more than i can in in those other bigger cars
well that's very interesting
i've had i've had exactly the same experience with the one that i've got
and surprisingly it's also an eighty-four
um i'm sorry what
but it's um it's uh
big roomy trunk uh and uh and very happy with it
and i must admit it's you know
if if if uh
my only consideration were were you know buying another car just to tool around town in and make you know brief trips and things like that
i would very very seriously consider buying one uh
um my my real concern with uh uh why i'm not sure i want to buy a honda is because i have to make a kind of a a steady um trip down the road about once a month because i'm divorced
and i have a daughter that lives down in north carolina and uh i drive
and it's just an absolutely wild highway
there's no doubt about that because i i i run over to crystal city or used to
i'm retiring the end of this month but i'm very much aware of the crazy driving that goes on over there
and you well you've got it
and uh so having precious cargo in the car with me
in in fact quite frankly i've owned a volvo in the past
and uh i've i've
uh course i'm a mechanically inclined kind of person
and i always wind up getting under the hood and finding out all the things that you know need to be taken care of and so forth
and i guess that's one thing that that recommends the honda to a lot of people is is there's just very little that you have to do under the hood
it just just sits there and purrs
and you all you got to do is the main major thing of changing that oil and that filter
oh i know
so um yeah
anyway i've been looking at the prices of these cars and and so forth
and i think that it's it's very surprising some of these very expensive volvos can be gotten for a lot less money than you would think if you're willing to buy ones that are about
the vintage of the cars that you and i currently own and um
well a brand new volvo costs what thirty thousand dollars
well certainly some of the top end ones
you can still get get uh even the the low end wagons um for less than twenty thousand dollars and uh we get you know
in the washington area of course being as affluent as it is there are lots and lots of volvo dealerships down here so there're lots and lots of them available in the paper at any any week
and i sort of you know scan the paper and look at them and so forth
and so um
and i've tended to um to uh buy cars that are you know two or three and sometimes even four and five or six years old
and in fact it had an extraordinarily low amount of mileage on it
and it's a seventy-four i mean an eighty-four
well my my eighty-four just has seventy-seven on it and i've made many trips to washington and down to virginia beach virginia where my mother lives and things like that
and i drive it
uh you ready for this
well guess what
the weather is uh this time of year has actually been kind of unusual
i haven't expected it to be colder until you know
and i've uh
oh you do so you you you probably go everywhere and have all sorts of weather
well it was around here last night
and i understand it's supposed to rain until saturday night
i went through uh phoenix on twice on uh wednesday morning and uh approaches to low minimum both both times and phoenix never gets that kind of weather
i have a brother i have a brother that's a pilot also with american
oh is that right
so i imagine you uh oh with all this kind of weather it uh makes it kind of dangerous for you
well now i wouldn't call it danger
this is uh this really isn't bad stuff to fly around in
oh i guess so
the the air systems are reasonably calm
we don't have uh the turbulence have a uh little bit of chop
but it's not like it is in the spring time
well we moved actually down here from another location
and it's spectacular the the thunderstorms and rain storms you get in the spring time the torrents of rain
lights up the whole sky and even on a on a
actually i've i've seen it where there's not a cloud in the sky
and the rain isn't falling
but you can see the thunder and excuse me see the lightening going horizontally across the sky and back and forth and what a light show
it's it's fabulous
yeah cloud to cloud it can be real really sensational here
i'm from uh northern utah
and that's a very arid climate from uh salt lake city area and there's always a lot of snow
in fact where i grew up we were about an hour's drive from seven to uh twelve different major ski resorts
and so there was an awful lot of snow
and because it was an arid climate the snow was always a crisp powder light snow which made it fantastic for skiing and and sleigh riding and everything
so we had a great time
were you near near the park cities area
in uh in snowbird and solitude and and brighton and yes
so i imagine have you skied before
well we've skied
uh i skied we skied california a bunch when we lived out there
and and uh um and of course grew we grew up in minnesota
and we do some skiing there lot of cross country skiing there
well do you think this the the weather is typical for this time of the year
well not really
i you know
minnesota's gotten just hammered with snow um
the um uh
we've gotten a fair amount of rain for this time of year already i think and uh i've been surprised that we haven't seen more of the temperatures that we've got today you know that moved in last night
it's been it's been cold
there was a time though in the uh middle part of november that got really cool really really unseasonably cool and then it warmed right back up
and i thought great
and she said yeah
it was it was real cold
but that was very unseasonable for us down here
and uh but uh i've really enjoyed the weather down here too
because uh two years ago we were the day after christmas able to go out in shorts and play tennis in the nice sunny weat- weather
and it's not as severe i should say as the weather that i've experienced up in northern utah
that's that's real true
it's it's uh
in fact i've i've played golf on on uh new year's day one year
oh it is
and they say boy six months out of the year it's bitter cold and and the wind and the blowing snow and everything
well and they've had uh you know
and they're up over sixty-five or sixty-
i guess tonight's subject is uh woodworking
do you uh
well k- kind of mainly the woodworking i've done lately is uh made like uh for example a little nativity scene
uh not the uh the whole figurines and so forth but mainly the stable put some shelves in and and some odd stuff around the house
and so i i enjoy doing a little bit of woodworking
and i do it out of hobby more than uh you know something i have to do
uh well i like to think of it as a hobby but i i guess also partly out of necessity just repairing things around the house
uh a few years ago uh we needed uh they needed some book shelves
and i kind of drew up some simple plans to make some book shelves
and uh it actually worked pretty well
and over the years i've i've refined those plans
and i'm i'm very good at making book shelves
it's it's also a way of relieving stress
well i'll have to come and see them
i you know
and that's that is right
because lot of the things that uh well we can't be able to afford
but also i i sometimes think that uh i enjoy doing that
and i like to get out and and uh to work with my hands
and uh sounds like you got some real nice tools too
uh well yeah
i mean little by little i i started out
uh gotten a a good belt sander
and and the router uh helps a lot because you can make better joints with a router
the latest project that i've been working on and this has been kind of sitting here for a few months is a a cabinet to to put a t v in
oh a entertainment type center
and it that's works well because you can design it to to suit whatever equipment you have
so i designed a space just the right size for the t v and then the the v c r and shelves on the side for my stereo equipment
and uh that's worked pretty well
uh with uh with the router you can make nice uh
and it's uh
and also with a router you can uh make ornamental facings too better than a just straight wood edge
and uh casings and so forth that are that are real nice
so that's that's good
but what i need next is a good table saw
and i i debate whether it's better to get a uh just a straight table saw or to get one of these uh rotary arm saws
uh it t- seems to me the radial arm saw is is better
well it it takes up less room
i mean you you set the wood down
and you move the saw
whereas if you're ripping wood you're probably better off with a a table saw
well and with a radial arm saw if you do have a a big piece of wood that you need to rip like you say or cut you wouldn't be able to do that
uh but uh yeah
a table saw does take a lot of time excuse me a lot of space and is a pretty big investment
uh that that's partly my problem now
i uh i
where uh where we lived before up north uh basements were were common
but not so here in texas
well i'm from up north also
and and uh no
there's no t- basements down here
and it's kind of uh hard to get uh shop space unless you have a dedicated shop or a dedicated room for that
lot of the equipment too that i've i've used in the past uh i w- you know i've used in school
and uh i would
i'd i'd kind of like to to look at equipment like a lathe or like you say a table saw and some of those things that would make uh some pretty nice uh pieces of uh well wood for for different things for tables for for uh chairs for you know decks and so forth
i i just enjoy woodworking
and i think the the main thing is like you say it's a it's a good out
and it's a great stress stress reliever
i have in school i have
and i've made uh uh different things uh la- uh tables for chairs
and i've made uh bowls
and uh and uh
what are are you settled in a place
i've been in it for twelve years since nineteen uh actually thirteen years since nineteen seventy-eight
and it's in richardson texas which is north texas right
or north dallas
and we've lived in two houses in richardson
well we uh left here in seventy-six
uh we were here for a few years
then we uh have come back just this summer
right now we're looking for housing uh somewhere down in the duncanville and cedar hill area
and uh so they've enjoyed the school
so we're kind of trying to stay here
well what the problem we got is that we've got five children
and uh you know everybody says you know how many houses are on the market and all that kind of thing
so we uh we look at the paper
we look at our talk to our realtor
and you can cut you know the listings uh in about a third when you go from three to four bedrooms you know or five
and uh we're uh
but anyway i my youngest is getting married this year graduating college
so i can board up their rooms
so we're looking forward to retiring in about three years and maybe relocating to florida or somewhere
closer closer to our families
you are you from florida originally
but everyone's uh my wife's parents are from the new york new jersey area so but everyone seems uh has seem to relocated down that area
and the oldest is uh ninth grade
and the youngest is second grade
and i think they're going to be uh with us forever
but it's sure you know we're not anywhere near looking to uh uh cut down in size
oh i understand
we're we're trying to find
it's tough to find a five and six room bedroom house isn't it
oh i don't think it's possible unless you you know multimillionaire something like that
oh i know
and it's that's an awful lot you know
uh we're having
actually if we find something for uh i'd say less than a hundred and twenty thousand we'll be doing all right you know
but i think the thing's out there
it's just a matter of uh you know looking you know finding the right place uh
lot of people will buy in your situation will buy a four bedroom house and convert maybe the garage or something or the or do something
and she had uh there were seven kids in her family
and they converted the dining room and
but they always seemed to get along fine you know
but you know it's until then it's uh oh a little stressful you know just looking all the time and that sort of thing
oh i know
and it's there's nothing harder than that
i always just sort of a assign my wife that chore
at least she's got more opinions you know
there's uh seems like there's more constraints more things that she thinks about you know openness uh the size of the kitchen and all this kind of stuff that i would probably gloss over and
maybe even ignore you know
i'm in the uh sporting goods business
what who are you with
uh we're with an organization called uh wycliff bible translators
it's a a missions organization and uh doing uh translation linguistics that sort of thing
uh it's got an office down here in uh in near duncanville
and we just moved down to be on staff down here
how how was the uh
s- you say you lived in the denver area before
how did that compare with this area as far as house- housing prices
uh we were uh really surprised to find that they're higher here uh
when we moved from louisiana to denver it was astounding you know to find that prices were oh i guess almost two or three times as high as we'd expected
and then uh to come down here we thought things would be lower
and they're not
i guess uh really prices for housing are just
uh i can begin this um
basically i work for honeywell in minneapolis and the the benefit program we have here is really quite good
i'm i'm pretty pleased with it
they cover uh just about everything vision dental medical uh you name it
and for me this is the first job i've had where they've covered that much
so i'm pretty satisfied myself
um what's your situation
and uh our benefits package isn't uh isn't quite as good in some ways uh you know
we do have the health care and the uh and the medi- or the dental
i work in i'm a on the professional administrative and technical staff
and i effectively i run the telephone switch at uh at the university of new hampshire
oh i see
uh so the uh the benefits
uh probably the main thing i like about the benefits is the uh the uh very generous vacation time and sick time
oh no doubt
and uh we get twenty-four days a year right from the day one when you start work you get twenty-four days a year uh time off
well that's good
that's one of the things i guess i would change about honeywell is uh
and being a uh a government organization you got quite a few holidays off
but here you don't get that
so it's really
unless you unless you have some vacation time or some some sick leave or whatever um you kind of have to finagle your way around to get that time
so that's that's kind of a drawback i think
but uh i don't know
what do you consider most important you think in terms of of the different benefits
well i think uh the the health care of course is an important and has to be the single most important benefit and uh the rates that we keep paying seem to keep increasing uh you know
i'm i'm a little disturbed about that
but i think that's a national trend
and i don't know that uh i don't know what the solution is to it
they uh they basically reviewed oregon's plan or the oregon plan toward uh nationalizing health care and that kind of thing
they've essentially made up a list of uh oh all the different uh medical maladies that you can have and then basically made a cutoff
about six hundred and eighty-seven and below will not be covered by by uh subsidized health care
and the ones above would
so it's kind of like drawing this line
and and if you have it great
if you don't you're kind of out of luck but um it was kind of an interesting show
i think health care is probably the the most pressing uh the pressing one
but i'll tell you i i don't mind having dental you know
sometimes dental costs can be um just about as expensive if not more
and i know historically a lot of companies i think carried dental as a rider along with the medical but i'm not sure that's that's widely followed any more
how how does uh university of new hampshire handle it
well we have two different plans that we can subscribe to under dental uh depending
and and the cost between them is very is very little
i think it costs me something like five dollars a a month for the dental plan
but it pays uh a substantial amount
i mean the examinations and and uh checkups every year or every six months are free and uh it it covers the bulk of the dental expenses
is that uh let me interrupt is that the same for both uh professors and and also staff and administration
the benefits plan is different for operating for what we call operating staff which are considered to be uh clerical personnel accountants things like that as opposed to what they call the p a t staff which i belong to but the main
i think the the health and all that and the dental is the same for everybody and the retirement plan
but the main difference is in the uh the way sick time is accrued and vacation time is accrued
uh for the operating staff it's on a seniority it's you know based on how long they've worked there
that determines how much uh vacation time they get
i'm kind of interested because i'm actually that's the route i'd like to take when i finally get my degree is to uh is to teach in a university
i'm a doctoral student in florida right now but uh
that's that's interesting
that's one of the things i'd like to think about is in what kind of benefits they would uh they would cover and things like that
college programs belong to this t i a a uh c r e f retirement fund
oh is that right
and in the case of the university of new hampshire uh
you know even if they give it a shot it's still going to be black market all over the place you know
but gun control is probably frowned on quite a bit down there i would think
but i'm not really from
oh you're just live down there
i've i've lived down here a couple years
but yeah there uh there uh there's a lot of hunters here
well i know how you feel
i'm uh i grew up in nebraska
and and we always use to go out and hunt all the time you know
and man there's no way
i just think i think it's ridiculous
i don't know i anymore
i keep a thirty-eight in my truck you know
well i live in minneapolis
well actually i live in florida
but i am staying
and you know both areas are pretty crime ridden right now and it's just you never know who is out there
you know it's just for self protection purposes
and then of course there's the hunting issue
uh i i'm in uh program control for a company up here
i'm uh researcher of honeywell up here
uh i haven't had a chance to do any hunting since i've been down here
but i'd like to go bird hunting
you know that's something i miss quite a bit
uh when i was in colorado we went deer and elk hunting you you know quite a bit
my brother was uh a guide for bear and elk hunts out in idaho for a while
but i don't know
i guess that what the scale now is it's zero for uh for a complete
one for a total ban and uh
i i agree with you there
i mean if they can anyway get it keep criminals from having guns which they can't i you know i'm not for it
if there's if there's a way you know to limited it to people that i don't know
they i guess they passed a couple of uh uh laws a here while back
and then they actually uh
and that's a week and then they check you out and make sure you don't have a record you know and things like that
uh and that's
but then again you can always get around that
you know you always be able to get around
but uh i don't know
i guess i guess some forms of guns should probably be controlled just like i'm not real sure why anybody would need a full automatic weapon
i think those have been pretty much you know banned altogether anyway
but even well i mean a semiautomatic i guess that's
you know it's like what can you do with that that you can't do in a self protection situation with like a seven or a twenty shot twelve
you know you might do the same thing
and so it's like i don't know it does
i i like bows
you know i have done some bow hunting
and i uh i get into it
and i think it's more of a challenge you know
but uh i don't know
but uh i don't know
anyway that's about where i stand
and you uh have you eaten yet or whatever
oh it's not too good
it's kind of rainy actually
around this time of year you expect it up here to get down to about uh i don't know ten or twenty degrees and it's been up around forty
so people are people are whining about the rain and stuff but not too bad about the temperature
and it's kind of shocking
and any kind of long term financial planning or anything like that uh
do you have a uh budget or a monthly budget or a long term budget that you stick to
wendy i guess we get to talk about budgets tonight or lack of budgets if uh if that may be the case uh-huh
and i'm on work study and so my budget comes from my dad's help
and i get paid monthly
so that's kind of hard to have a budget
my mother uh doesn't get paid much money
so her budget is uh just uh planning for i r a's
but i i i went through that too when i was in school
but uh i was i was working to get through college and and uh trying to make it through that
i'm married and have uh a a couple of children
and we have to uh pretty much stick to a budget
so i don't get any overtime or anything like that
and we have to make sure that uh every dollar we have will is spent accordingly
and uh what we try and do to to stick to our monthly budget is we pretty much have you know the house payment
we have the insurance premiums uh utilities and so forth
and we do sit down at the beginning of every month or the end of every month and write down how much we know we're going to spend and set that money aside
and we also try and set aside money for savings set aside money for the coll- the kids' education college education the future and uh set aside money for bonds
and and we also set aside an emergency fund
because we've uh
and we find out that you know no matter what kind of budget you stick on there's always going to be an unexpected car repair or something happen with the house that you have to have money for and uh not enough to go and to take a loan out but uh you have to have money for
and uh then we have you know
whatever's left over is disposable in- disposable dis- yeah discretionary income
so and it's worked out very well
well that's good
it's uh it's helped us so that we haven't been you know too long on the month and too short on the money and uh try and stick with that
and nice thing about it i my wife is is excellent in that we both work together
and we stick to it and there's no surprises in that
well actually i have four kids
i i guess i should have specified
oh my goodness
i have four four little boys
oh my goodne-
and my parents divorced three years ago and my sister had gotten through college
but i was still in high school
and my mother paid for a lot of my sister's college while my parents were together and then uh before the divorce she had saved for my college
but uh when we had the divorce she just didn't get much money out of it and had to spend it all on getting another house
so now my dad's paying for all of my college of
so i have auditions coming up
well what year are you in in college
so you have a few more years
i'll i'll probably have about two two and a half years left
well good for you
i imagine it uh is a little difficult to stick with a budget during that during school and so it forth
oh it sure is
i i know how much my dad is going to give me every two weeks and i and i don't spend over that
and sometimes that's a little hard with books and music and and sheet music and stuff you've got to work on too
there's there's always music books to buy
well you're not a starving artist yet are you
the- there's enough of those in the world huh
who's who's not very well educated
there's enough out there that if you have if you're educated enough then you can make money
so that's why i'm
you know plenty about planning a b- a budget
but uh once again
so i hope she's turned it in
uh i ju-
and then w- after five minutes when the uh uh voice comes on we can talk all night if we want
but uh i'm afraid i'm i'm probably in the minority
i i actually don't think that we uh pay too much in this country uh uh particularly uh in this part of the country w-
uh i guess i do have a a bone to pick with uh uh the way taxes are distributed
uh i just finished fuming at the fact that we pay an eight and a half percent sales tax and no income tax when the income tax could have been deducted from the federal form
and uh uh it's kind of dumb
but on the other hand i don't mind that it's only on you know things that aren't like
well i mean nobody taxes groceries
but we have a pretty low income ta- i mean pretty low tax rate here
oh i think the the sales tax they just got to do something about it
but that's the politicalness of trying to not create any new taxes
but i guess when i hear when i see the comparison between the united states and uh any other western country uh their their rates are like uh forty-one forty-two and ours are like thirty-six thirty-seven you know
t- th- there's no other country that's that is taxed as low as we are
well and i still think that having lived in europe for awhile you know
i'm i'm not sure i understand what you mean
well i mean i think
i was in germany you know for several years and
uh probably m- less so now than it was ten years ago or whatever
but i look for example
and you're not quite in the same situation
but like school taxes for me biggest bargain in the world
that that's probably a little tougher on you
it's not it's not quite the bargain that
i think it's a dumb decision on our part because countries like canada and england and germany do perfectly well with a uh two tract system in which religious schools coexist with secular schools f- with the same tax money
but uh i mean that's that's the way americans want to interpret it
and if i were uh
i will not mind paying uh what it takes to keep the schools good
i think in places i think in places like california people are beginning to find that in in areas that are fairly well off if you add the uh uh people of various sexual persuasions and those who never intend to marry and those who are retired and those are uh just looking for fun th- people with families turn out to be such a small minority that they can't get a tax bill passed no matter what happens
that seems a a like a cultural lapse
i mean people always used to be willing to ante up for the schools
people would rather uh increase the fire department and cut down the schools
but i think it's sad selfish and shortsighted
uh haven't have i have a wide variety of of hobbies
therefore my my reading pleasures are quite wide
um i get a charge out of uh texas highway
which is uh very colorful and uh not being a native of texas but being here eleven years have a tendency to uh find out the uh about the different areas of the co- of the of the state by reading it
but my mother always gave me hers
and i i really enjoyed you know all the little things that you find out about texas
it's it's uh absolutely it's great the way that it's broken out and you can uh set up little trips and day trips and things
it's pretty pretty neat
um oh i like photography um magazines
um things oh
being an engineer in facilities i do read a lot of a lot of uh building magazines and and and plant engineering magazines and read up on different ways to do things and energy management type of magazines
and and uh kind of strange because i it's not unusual to uh see uh an engineering manual or something laying around the house
and then i'll sit up and read just to refresh uh you know to keep active on it
well um i have an interest in art
so i frequently purchase and read uh books mainly on water color because that's my big interest at the moment
oh that's great
and uh oh i guess i like a variety of things uh lots of fiction uh type books
uh right now i'm occasionally reading on a book about uh the mardi gras in new orleans and its history
uh that's uh self improvement
that's that's alwa- well that's kind of a hobby
but it is self improvement from the standpoint of probably relaxing uh
um well i hate to
we uh we have these classes we attend uh management classes
and and they give you books
and and the last book uh matter of fact i read was at america's service by carl albrecht
it talks about uh who the customer is and being customer oriented uh which falls in line with the t i culture here at texas instruments
uh one of it's great slogans is if you're not serving the customer you better be serving someone who is
uh so that's all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer is
and as you probably well know all of us are our own customer
um every now and then i'm loaned a tape i can stick in the uh in the car cassette set on the way home to make the drive more enjoyable talking about uh better outlooks on things and the philosophy of of pat hagerty and these kind of uh mind stimulating philosophy type
which all you know betters yourself
well uh maybe i am into some things occasionally that i don't think of in terms of self improvement
i mean they are
but i don't label it as such
well i don't know um
i uh have attended some seminars that had some tapes that went with them but uh i guess not so much books although they sometimes have manuals and things
but uh they would be things on like how to be successful and sort of talking to yourself you know ge- getting your yourself in gear to uh sort of pull yourself up by your boot straps and do what you really want to do
how about items like um the one minute manager which used to be a big
so those are self improvements
um our supervisor uh subtly bought all of us a book called what every supervisor should know
by a man man named doctor bittel b i t t e l
and it's a very layman's uh uh approach towards managing different types of people
and the very last chapter and i haven't figured out why that one was last is how to manage engineers
so it's it's ver- it's interesting
here again it's it's casual reading
and it's not eaten up with a lot of uh mechanical stuff
and it's really excellent fast reading
and uh but as you say it's it's sometimes it's difficult to to know if it's you know
if he casually just walked into it and uh put down a stephen king book and i picked up one of them i might be a little more interested
that's a little little heavy for me
they're uh quite uh they're hard to set down because it's so interesting
and of course they're all just a little spookier than the movies
it's always they're always challenging to get through one of them
well i guess i also have been reading uh a lot of things on uh quality improvement and that type of thing because that's what i'm involved in a lot at work
in quality especially now days uh that's almost everything that comes across the the the airways
exactly exactly right
yeah we we have i think we we name drop it a little too much and and don't fully understand what what it is we're saying
and and all that kind of rolls in together there
but uh that's just kind of part of it
well any other comments
uh not that i can think of
um i think i'm under my quota a little bit
well we just started
uh this is true
well you too
and uh good-bye
but where i am we have a like an extremely lax dress policy at work
and it varies like every day i mean from jeans one day to business suits the next
but it's true you know
they tend to try to be you know real lax
and supposedly the policy is like you know we you know we hire these wonderful creative people
and we don't want to smush their creativity you know
and you know you really will see people in in jeans one day and business suits the next
well i'm kind of that way too
and where we are now what we're doing is some very big lawsuits that happen to have a heck of a lot of boxes of documents
and i get to toting around boxes of documents several times a day
and i can't see getting dressed up and wearing heels and stuff when you have to carry you know boxes of documents around
so if i'm just going to be there working in the litigation center and doing you know odds and ends and stuff with the boxes of documents i dress down
but if we're going to have a meeting where we're having the attorneys come in or people from uh other party's attorneys and stuff then i normally dress up
and i'll wear a dress and hose and stuff
you know we're kind of that way too
i know you know where i am we work a lot with the customers
and we have a lot of government folks come in all the time
and and you know if i know that they're going to be there you know you i try to really watch it and like you say you know really dress up
and if i know they're not you know
i i've been doing a lot of reorganization you know the last couple of months the same way you are you know
and it's just it's just impossible to crawl down on the floor and dig through boxes in a dress
when uh i was at t i the first year or so we were sent out to our record retention facility to look through two thousand boxes
and at that point it the warehouse was over across the road
and it wasn't air conditioned
and it we were there like in the middle of the summer
it was dusty and dirty uh
there was like a fan at the very end of the row
and that was it
and so we didn't really know we weren't supposed to
and the supervisor from another area came up to us
and you know this area where record retention is there's only a few people that work there
and he sho- he knew who worked there
and he came up to us
and he just said who's your supervisor
well he called our supervisor and our supervisor and our supervisor's supervisor
and it went up all the way to the head of facilities
he didn't at at least say to us did you know you're not supposed to do that
oh how awful
you know just yesterday though i saw a girl in the spine out here at lewisville that had on a pair of shorts
and i don't care
and you can call them culottes all you want
but these were shorts
i don't care what else you call them you know
if they're above the knee they turn into shorts you know
and these weren't even really full ones
i mean they had a problem out here with it last summer wearing these shorts that were you know the real wide full ones you know
and becau- these weren't even those
these were like pretty short black
and they were very dressy
and she had on black hose and black heels
and she looked very very nice
but you don't wear shorts to work
you know i mean as far as i'm considered she was in violation
and nobody says anything to them
you know if they just you know
the management doesn't ever seem to want to take an cut off you know that no
this is shorts you know
and and nobody will ever kind of take control and do that you know
so it always gets annoying because the rest of us are going well god we have a pair of those at home too
it sure would be cool and comfortable to wear you know
well i've seen some people try to just come in like over the weekend because they want to use the texteller machine
and they have said no
and then during the week you see these women in the you know
just because you put on a pair of hose with them doesn't make them not shorts anymore you know
i mean i've never seen them do it without hose
i mean they always have hose on
but still it's they're shorts
well i think t i's dress code is pretty lax considering everything anyway you know uh
i know i didn't know that e d s has a very strict dress code
oh do they really
and they spell it out
for men it's particular suits uh the pin stripe and the particular colors of shirts and win- wing tipped shoes
oh my god
oh it is definitely lined out
i coul- i couldn't afford to work there
and and a particular kind of shoe you know so high heel
oh it is spelled out
when i was looking at her materials when she first started you know she had her benefits package and all that kind of stuff
and it told about the dress code
and it said these are the color pastel shirts you may wear or white shirts with this kind of stripe in it for the men and this kind of shoe and hair just this way
and e d s is very particular about this hair cuts
i mean it was like you can't have you know such and such facial hair no beards you know and just really detailed
i mean i see
i i am more
and a lot of bosses may say i'm nuts
but i am more productive when i'm in pants
i i am
i get things done faster than when i'm in a dress and heels you know
and it's weird
but i it's i do i can i can get so much more done if i'm dressed comfortable you know
well the the time we were there at the warehouse we felt really bad because we had uh another person coming from washington our outside counsel
and she was told that we were going to be in a warehouse
but she really didn't get the idea that we were in the warehouse part of the warehouse not the office to the warehouse but the warehouse
and she came with skirts just like she'd be going into the office
and we'd try we'd try to say didn't you bring any pants or anything
we're we're out here in the warehouse you know
you you got your skid of you know that wooden pallet of boxes
and you're going to have un- unload you skid look at the documents in the in the boxes and then repack your skid
and she was so she was so hot and miserable you know in the skirt
she finally tried to go buy you know a pair of pants
but you know i mean it was just completely miserable for her
well i don't know
i just figure you know yeah
sometimes i worry about you know if i go in in pants
and i never i never ever ever ever go in in a pair of jeans you know
but i'll go in in pants
i mean today i had on a pair of you know navy blue dress slacks and and uh like a peach colored top and you know not cruddy but not a dress either
and sometimes i wonder if stuff like that would will hold you back you know if you don't dress in you know your dress for success business suits everyday if you know if upper management doesn't notice that and remember that later on
but you know i don't know if they do or not
you know i see a lot of the managers
and they're in jeans
so you know
we have um assistants to the general counsel
and it's funny
because there's one that always wears a suit
and then there's another one who's who's a little younger and a little more yuppish
and he's always kind of like in the khaki pants and you know a shirt
and sometimes he wears the jacket to it
and some of the patent attorneys have been real casual in their clothes
and then other ones tend to always wear a suit with a very starched cotton shirt
so that's just
we've we've kind of had a variety there
but i think a lot of times it's it's mainly who they're going to meet with
or they're meeting with people that they know is going to be dressed that way then that's how they are
if there just going to be meeting with t i like to talk about a patent kind of thing and the they're engineers that they're talking too they dress kind of like how the engineers are dressed
and they're usually casual
that's the way to do it i mean that's the smart way to do it
it really is because your making you know
if when they're meeting with the engineers who they know are going to be dressed down if they come in in you know a six hundred dollar three piece suit it's going to make the people they're meeting with feel very uncomfortable you know
or it would me you know
well it was good to talk to you
this is this is kind of a fun project
but we've never got to talk to another person
so this is a little different
well it's kind of enjoyable
well thanks a lot
we um i'm presently living in a house uh
first time uh
and so this is our our fifth year in it i guess
and uh um it was a real excitement to uh to go out and select the house and have one made and built
and like you wanted it we were the fourth to build out of three hundred and forty houses
and um as we did with probably ninety-five percent of the people here in dallas-fort worth we bought a fox and jacobs home
and they're good for about five years or four years
and after that they start falling apart
so i would uh not recommend f and j house for my dog to live in uh because they're overpriced uh
but they're a cheap house
if you can't afford something good you know
and um you can call it a home because it's a place to go home and keep the rain off your head
but as far as the costs for what your getting uh the longevity of the house is not uh is not worth it
well in my case my husband is not a carpenter
but in fact he's in electronics
but he knew the only way we'd ever have a new home is if he would build it
so it took him about two and a half years
but uh he built us a house
and it's a brick house
and price-wise it was great because he did it all himself you know
so that way he could we could kind of control
and uh we live in kind of a small town
and i mean it's nothing fancy you know
it's it's a house
and it's real pretty
and we're all comfortable in it
well that's great
i have another gentleman friend of mine who uh who had a house built
and the city's a little upset with him
but i understand you save a lot of money off uh by doing that
oh you can because that way your not having to pay the middle men and everybody else
uh i'll vouch for that
but uh of course my husband did everything except
and he came in you know and did the inside for us
and that helped
and uh we had to hire of course the plumbing and the brick and everything else nothing you know
well that's great
w- uh have you been in it long
well have you any plans to uh maybe uh expand or move onward
well uh our kids are kind of still small now
and we had thought before maybe a lot older we don't need such a large house that we'll sell it
but he will not build a second one himself
we're having a an architect friend of mine design a house for us
and that can basically be be put on any lot in any state any kin- you know
so that's kind of
and he's charging us about a buck a square foot to design it
and he's re- certified and registered
so at least we know we're it's not going to fall in or something if it's built
but uh i have heard that your approach is is right
you can actually go out and sub it if even if you don't want to get hands on
and and that's kind of the plan i have
everyone i talk to uh i file in my little book and do other things with it
but uh like i said otherwise you know a- the expense
but you know we could not have one as large as we have if you know we hadn't did it ourselves
i mean it's not an eldorado house or anything like that
but you know it's ours
on- you only have to uh satisfy yourself and no one else
ap- apparently the appraisers likes it because our taxes sure is high
oh that's uh that's uh an encouraging sign if you ever want to resell i guess
because i i'm always shocked at about you know what they have it appraised at
well that's great
and it was nice talking to you
real problem the last few days one of their uh young hopeless stars has apparently ruined his knee for this season
and they really don't have an excess of catchers
and it's really kind of kind of late to you know to start be trying to trade for somebody especially with the salary cap that the rangers have
but i you know i would i would gladly take the salary of most of the guys i'll tell you
i used to go take my son you know
i'll have to admit i kind i kind of went more to see to see the other team a lot of times than i did the did the rangers
but i think they're doing better
well i do to uh
i have boys you know like eight and eleven
and we go quite often
oh i do too
and i think uh what caught so many of our attentions last year was that nolan ryan you know
oh of course
he just pitched his first uh exhibition game a day or so ago
and he pitched five uh yeah five full innings
that was almost unheard of for a pitcher to you know to start out that strong
no big deal you know
he really is an you know
but last year i just figured they was under a lot of pressure because of all the publicity and everything
they've got uh i guess all
well all their players are signed now
but there there's no hold outs
so that should help
but in a way i really do
and of course there's a few more you know i think are good ball teams also
oh you haven't
oh i have a few times
uh they're a good ball team
wouldn't it be something to have a world series between da- the rangers and the astros
oh wouldn't it wouldn't it though
oh my goodness
we might actually get to go to a world series huh
but there are a lot of ranger fans around
oh there sure is
and uh that i mean they really are
uh now incavalia i don't know how familiar you are with him
but last year i was kind of thinking he sure did get in a slump
but they're saying this year their predictions is that he's really going to come out of it and
and they're not sure they're going to be able to sign him again
that you know may or may not happen
oh you never know
if you offer them money i'm sure they'll they'll do a little bit of everything
i mean oh
i i really haven't uh
the uh those cowboys have increased their prices again this year
but i didn't know
i i don't think i've heard anything on the rangers
or i don't remember it if i have
well i hadn't either
we hadn't you know
we we try to go so often
if you have young young children you know they they get a kick out of it
oh they do
well i've enjoyed talking to you
well you too lori
and we'll hopefully we'll get to talk again
what what is
well it says why would you what you would have for a dinner party
um this is strange because i pressed one and i thought it said begin
maybe maybe we're all set
oh that's wonderful
um if i can find it
well i have this new fondue pot
and i was going to do basic cheese fondue
and i have two different kinds of breads and some ham
and i was going to try something weird which you know
i was going to make some uh like fish chunks and dip it in the fondue
some people like swiss um
and i'll mix
i won't make i won't have a sharp cheddar because it for fondue i think it should be a little calmer than real sharp
and then i was going to make other things like potato skins
oh that sounds good
it- see you don't necessarily have to dip this stuff
and um i was going to have broccoli and cauliflower for a a vegetable
i mean i think they like to have healthy stuff too
you know it's
i think better even than than other kinds of food
my uh girlfriend's do catering
and they always about every party they do is they have a vegetable tray
what i've been doing when i get invited someplace and bring something i make uh food kabobs
uh pineapple and strawberry
or even have you ever seen where they they'll take a watermelon and just cut the top out of it and then hollow that out
um they they made a couple of those uh
they made one for my uh bridal shower
and i was pretty pleased
but they look easy enough to make
oh i think it would it would be a lot of work
you know because it's you know
you have to cut each thing or you know use the melon baller and stuff
but but i think they're really neat
and you know i think they're worth the time you know because they
you probably get this probably pretty sticky after you get done
then you've got to drain the water out of the watermelon because you know when you scrape it it makes the water
um something i do is a fruit
is i'll get um make chocolate sauce and dip strawberries and bananas in them
and they they they go melt some chocolate chips
is that is that good
you know i've seen that so many times strawberries dipped in chocolate
but i've never tried it
ther- you know if you get a sweet strawberry they're much better
but if you get a sour strawberry
oh i bet it doesn't mix well does it
they um the strawberries are coming in season now from
they're they're coming up from florida of course
so but they're really reasonably priced
oh well that's good
because i know they've been really expensive lately
of course they had to be be uh grown in greenhouses and stuff and in
i think the uh actually i think they get um some of them from south america
oh is that right
a lot of um of a um winter produce comes from south america
so um do you want to discuss the recipe
um it filled
but i make my own homemade pudding just because i don't like box pudding
it and it if you um well
and i put it in a two quart saucepan
and you put it on a really low heat
and you want to use one of your good sauce pans that dissipate the heat because it it ends up burning
i mean no matter how careful you are you still might get a film on the bottom of the pot
and i get the milk lukewarm
and then i pour about a half a cup of cornstarch in it
and i have this thing
it it makes the uh it makes uh a whip topping out of milk if you get the milk cold enough
it's uh i don't know
is it like a hand held
and they used to whip skim milk into a dessert
but i didn't get that one
but uh it's real handy because it doesn't have a cord
and you beat this cornstarch right into the mil- the milk you know
and it does an excellent job
or just hand beat it
but i don't think it pur- i don't think it gets it good enough
and then before the milk gets too hot um i add two beaten eggs and i really mix them in good and then about a half a cup of sugar
and i let it pretty much
i beat it like every minute for about ten seconds
and it's it starts thickening
it gets like little globs of this rubbery cornstarch
and you just keep beating it in
and it's the
the trick is is to have this blender
so if you were
and someone who's just going to make it first time it's
and then you can add cocoa powder to it to make chocolate
or after it's thickened i cook it for a good
once it starts boiling i just i cook it for a good seven minutes seven to ten minutes
and then you can make chocolate
or you can take it off and let it cool
you put um really good vanilla favoring in it and some butter
and that makes french vanilla um custard
are you saying to use like um for chocolate like unsweetened
that cocoa yeah the unsweetened
ri- i have some
well i used to make the regular pudding the chocolate and put it in the pie shell
and if it would sit in the refrigerator for a day where you cut the pie it would soak into the pie shell
and it was like red
and i'm like oh
well how did you get a recipe for pudding on your own
um actually i found it in one of my mother's um homemade cookbooks
i think you couldn't make it with a hand whisk or or a regular beater
but i still think a beater would do it good enough um
right in the in the lukewarm milk
and i would put it in the sink
and i'll take my lukewarm milk and put it in the cornstarch and beat it good
it seems to be better than putting the the cornstarch into the liquid
it once it hits the top of the liquid it seems to make little balls and stuff on the top
so you put the milk in the cornstarch
and i'll do this uh
sometimes i'll put my after i pour that into my back into my saucepan
and then put that back in the saucepan
and then you know if you can put your cocoa in with your cornstarch if you wanted to the cocoa even seems to thicken it even more
because by the vanilla doesn't seem to thicken as well as the
like my husband really likes it thick
because i'm always worrying it won't firm up because it when you take it out of the saucepan it's like boy i hope this thickens a little more because it's not like real package thick you know
it's it's a little less
but i put it in a nice glass bowl
and um some people don't like that that film on the pudding
so you can put uh saran wrap over the top
and then once the pudding starts cooling it makes little balls of water on the saran wrap
so when you pull the saran wrap back you sort of should be a little careful pull it back and shake the water off the saran wrap
and i might put it back on
do yo- do you put it in the refrigerator then
after well when it starts steaming a lot uh i definitely yeah put it in the refrigerator
but um i
so well i don't know
that's my my great hard recipe
you haven't huh
if you were uh what do you think about the whole concept of a trial by your peers
well i think it's a good idea
and i'm not sure what needs to be done to fix it
but i think they've got a lot of problems
and i don't know if that's just a pure volumes number or or what
but uh sometimes i think the jury is ignorant in the facts of law and how things should be determined
and they're too easily swayed by their emotion
do would you prefer all trials by a judge
i think there are certain things that uh the jury can determine as far as uh guilty or not guilty
but as far as the af- af- affixing of punishment and fines and things of that nature
two point two million dollar kind of settlement versus a judge knowing you know it's true that you know this may be sad and all that thing
but uh the jury i think is best in most cases suited for determination of guilt and innocence but not the award of of penalties and fines and punishment
i think they sometimes get carried away by the circumstances and make huge settlements thinking well it's only going to cost the insurance company
but uh i do like the idea of the jury being the the people who decide in the matter of uh if it's a jail term versus life and death you know the death penalty and such
when it comes to sentencing phase i guess they tell them if a guy if the person has a previous record and stuff
sometimes it seems like during the trial part the jury's not you know misses some of the best evidence because they make them leave
and the judge decides whether or not they should hear it
uh it it it's kind of difficult
and i guess the whole system is set up to rather let uh some guilty people go free than to put an innocent person in in jail although you still hear about those occasionally
um i don't know
i you know i heard a very interesting
and maybe it's just the t v show or movie i was watching
and i think it was like on one of the the documentary t v shows where they ask for the the verdict by the jury and they went by each one saying guilty or innocent guilty or innocent
and they took it more as just like a majority
so i i
i mean some of them said one way and some the other
but they took you know whatever the majority was
so i didn't know if that was just something for drama or that's truly the way it is
but uh rather interesting
but i thought that they all had to agree
or else they it was a hung jury
i did i did also
i thi- i don't know how i feel about that
i think maybe uh majority might be sufficient
i guess the the problem with that is there's no true authority in any kind of international verdicts like you know the old day with the rack
we they're going to say okay you're guilty and you have to pay kuwait four million dollars
well whose going to really make them
so but i think it would be kind of interesting to incorporate that concept of you know people from different countries uh in as international law also
i don't know how what it would take to be come up with a true perfect system or if one exists
uh is that the crime
and it's already some chart and determine the punishment
like if you're convicted of a certain crime you automatically get so many years
i think there should be a core minimum that they get but uh i guess there should be some flexibility because every situation may be unique that the judge can either increase that or keep it just at its minimum things of that nature
that serves a kind of if they're i guess uh
and i guess you're eligible after twenty-seven for parole even though you're in for life
and sometimes those people are are young enough they can still get out and cause a lot of trouble
although i guess it's you you want them to rehabilitate and become better rather than sitting in there and being a drain all the time
because uh inside the jail there i don't think there's no real rehabilitation
but who knows
i think i think maybe they ought to just be punished with some some kind of real punishment like hard labor for a shorter length of time you know
actually make them do something that's not pleasant and do it and get it over with and get back in the you know world and not spend so much time sitting around letting the bad influences of the other ones rub off on them
cleaning up or picking up dirt or weeds or who knows what something for the for the state
since the state is paying for them they should get some kind of kind of work out of them
well i think that covers it
well how many credit cards do you have
um i've only i've got about four maybe
i try to limit them because i well one i don't use them too much
and i use my visa just for abou- for about everything
and i pay it all off
so i try not to
and my wife was carrying a different one
and since the slips all look alike uh you commingle them
and then you get the statement
and you try to sort them out uh
and it uh
and then when a t and t came along and offered a free one uh i accepted that
and we've been using that one
uh the interesting thing is is that uh the amount of money you can can run up on them
do you know any people that run up big big bills
i'm i'm you know i'm in the age group you get out of college
and i think a lot of these people have them maxed out
well did um were you able to get one while you're in college
um i don't think i ever tried
and he's heading off with any kind of luck
but there has been
i've had a couple of ads for for for to provide a card for a college student
uh what do you think about the idea of providing one for somebody like that
i i you know
it's you know feasible
i mean i know a lot of college kids who have them you know who had them but just depends
well that that that i guess from the from the card issuer uh that
since since it's it's in mo- the parent gets it for them that really the parent becomes the one that's responsible
so basically if you want to take the risk
do you trust your your son
to to go run up a big bill
and the thing is there some advantages if he got off some place and stranded
i i'm i'm leaning towards doing it for for conven- a convenience
i'd say do- you know have one with you know at least a thousand dollar credit limit or something
and the idea that you know if he got in trouble there's some some ways of getting out and that he doesn't have to carry cash
i i like the idea of credit cards that uh i don't i don't i don't carry cash around and and uh i don't even carry checks around
and she writes the checks
and i record them
so it's uh it's uh it's but it's interesting that uh the people that can that can uh the amounts of money you can run up wi- on on credit cards
and uh i i had recently had some dealings with a fellow that
they had run up he was making oh considered a modest salary for an engineer
and he had run up uh more than a years salary in in various debts to
and he wound up declaring bankruptcy
it it's hard to believe that you'd run up twenty thirty thousand dollars of uh
well it was a combination of things he had
there were there were several credit cards
and then there were several other businesses
but uh i i guess what's interesting have you seen the the the the ads where they're offering to extend payments from uh things like uh like the credit union's offering be more than 1 slash unit
the the extended loan payment for your car
the interesting thing about that is is that uh that that they're encouraging you to incur more incur more debt
well it's it's it's business
and they're making money off that
and they make more money if you extend your loan
and and it's so it's business
so and you notice that they're they're only going to do it to like cars that are one or two years old
and so they've already shifted the risk
and they'll recover the loan
and they know that people own a car that new unless absolutely die of service can't be right transcription
the interesting thing about it is is that from a uh uh an economy standpoint or in economics
i i thinks it's i think it's poor poor uh economics to to carry all that consumer debt at least from a tax standpoint
so it's interesting that that the american public is encouraged to incur all that debt and then next year none of it will be deductible
and this year it's ten percent or so
it's uh it's interesting that that uh they encourage us to do things
what now what's ten percent we can deduct
of your of your consumer credit
oh if you had a thousand dollars that means there's another hundred dollar deduction i've given you
any thing on a loan or
it's on uh yeah
i mean a mortgage i know you can
on the the
there's there's there's a place for consumer debt
and then you take ten percent of it
oh i've never itemized yet
so maybe that's
it's on schedule um
schedule a under uh
well it's the same place it's the same place you put uh interest
but but see that's what that's what makes texas squirrelly laws that you can't you can't take out a a second mortgage like some states where you can take out the mortgage and declare that
and so uh it's fully deductible
but it basically comes down to
but uh anyway
i try i i really do i just try to stay out of debt
and i and i use my visa for for as much as i can
and i pay it all off
sounds like you're you're very respon- very financially responsible
and he's got just enormous debts
but i mean what do you say it's like shucks
well he's had had two kids in college and and this kind of thing
and that i think that the whole credit card issue i think they certainly encourage people to run up the debts
and but i agree with you i don't i my debts
well i did buy a new house last summer
and uh i'll never do that again
it's it's remarkable how many people as soon as they get out of college buy a new car
and that uh apparently that's been going on for a really long time
i i bought a second hand car when i was the middle of my senior year
well you you think you're starting out well until you start paying all those bills
uh apartment rent
and and uh it's it's it's amazing how it what you learn
well anything else good to say about credit cards
um you know they're convenient you know
and and uh and it's it's it's certainly accepted more places than the places you know
well i was used to using my credit card like at skaggs alpha beta in dallas and stuff and now i'm out here in phoenix
they don't allow they don't do tha-
so now i have to carry cash when i go to the grocery store which is new to me you know
so uh that was interesting cause i always you know
well you know they they they've started towards a little bit of the debit card
and i think that's where
the banks will line up with uh
so many of the grocery stores don't do that because of the the time frame which they get paid in general
i've seen checks deposited the very next day i mean cleared my account the next day
and you know almost
well i guess it's the day after uh
but the- the- they took that check and scurried it to the bank
and the bank scurried it back to my account
and you thought there'd be just a little bit of float
but apparently that's why the uh the uh the uh grocery stores are reluctant to do that because their volume that is quite high
and they have uh
well it's good talking to you
maybe we'll get across we'll cross paths again
now that's it's all over with you know
well it is over
but i don't think we're out of there by any means
and uh i wonder are we going to set up you know peace keeping type forces for long term
you know is that something we should do or shouldn't do
uh i guess they uh they're anti u s in that region
and now they're you know
like syria and egypt you know had some pressure against the u s
but now they now they wouldn't allow us to have a base in that region
but now i think they are rethinking that
the other thing that i think is good for like american businesses are to be involved is the the reports that i hear back
and of course on the news i try to listen and also read between the lines you know
but they said that because the americans you know took such a proactive stance involvement in the war that
like so much of the business and the rebuilding in kuwait and things like that will go to american businesses where as before they may be dealt with japanese firms or other people
they said even though the japanese were involved monetarily uh they still
like the first first priority ought to go to american businesses which i guess will be good you know which will be good for our economy
but i you know
i mean we don't seem to slow down even when there is a crisis
and a few people i guess will make a few people pretty wealthy in construction and so forth
i mean what's what good is that
if i can't have it you can't have it you know
that sounds like something a little kid would do you know
but look at their war
and and you're right
it's like you see two little pre-school kids fighting over a toy you know
i i am a little concerned about you know
i know they are putting president bush right now in an awkward position concerning the the treaty over there right now
the the deal with the uh supporting the kurds
well supporting the kurds
but uh you know the cease-fire
i'm trying to say another because he yeah
you know because he he wants them to uphold their end of the deal as far as the cease-fire
but at the same time he's not wanting to go in and say okay i'm going to fight your war for you which which i think is right
you know if it's an internal thing i don't think we can walk in and say gee i think you're right and you're wrong you know
uh but i know that that's causing him a little bit of unpopularity with the people over there because they feel like gee you told us
so i think he's in a pretty awkward position now
and i i think we ought to help you know
but i don't think we ought to be over there fighting it for them
and and so i think he's done good on that stance
i think bush handled has handled this whole situation quite well
he stood up to to the bully and
and uh and uh saddam hussein miscalculated all along
thinking that he wouldn't commit u s lives and and forces and and monies to just to liberate a little country
and uh then he underestimated his ability to to wage a war with us
i mean one thing when we all came over there and said okay here we are get out and he said no i can i can win a war with you guys
and that was a horrible miscalculation
you know they'd advertised and said in the news and said he had the fifth largest army
well he may have
well not any more
but you have to have loyalty
you know i know they tried to turn it into a holy war because to them that is what's honorable you know
but i think they are smart enough
but he uses it
and uh and i think the people were smart enough to realize that
and i think they're afraid of him is what they are
and i don't think he's going to be there too much longer
well i hope that's true
someone is going to assassinate him you know
i would think that you know
i guess in the back of my mind i think like maybe the israeli massad probably has ideas of going in and huh
you know i thought they uh showed a tremendous restraint in their reactions towards everything
but i don't believe for a minute that that means that they don't have ideas and plans of their own
but i do agree with you
i think president bush handled it all politically very smart you know giving the support of of the other arabs and other nations in the world
and i think that's how you have to go into something like that
i've heard reports that president bush was staking his future on this uh this war and that setting a precedent saying that this league of nations will always combine against bullies and to stop this kind of stuff in the world
any would be bully would think twice if he knew that you know
and don't you feel
and you can't you just can't do it and get away with it you know hoping that you know
and the nations will combine against you
and you can't you know you can't just do this
and don't you think that long term that's been a big boost for the united nations
i mean the united nations been there for years but all of a sudden
had no had no teeth
and the fact that when they have sanctions and we support things like this it means something
and i think that's good for the strength of the united nations
i guess i feel sorry for just the average you know iraqi
and rebuild from nothing
must be terrible living conditions must be terrible
and it's not getting any better
you know except for a few medical supplies they are allowing through now and then powdered milk i guess for babies and things
and until they
i guess yesterday they came out with this these rules i guess or whatever
for a permanent permanent cease-fire
and the kuwaitis said we don't want to have to repay israel for all the bombing that we did that was in there you know
but that's only fair
and i think they should have to
but we don't want a kuwait there that's also you know just has no power at all
and that that you know
well that's true
and we don't want you know to be stabilized to the point where iran will say now is our chance you know to go in and wipe them out
well i don't think iran is under the same type of madman type leadership
but there's always the possibility i guess
i think the person who really may be at this time has a hard road to tow is jordan's king hussein because he really kind of really tried to kind of straddle the fence
you know he wasn't necessarily for iraq
but at the same time he didn't feel like everybody ought to be going against iraq
and yet so many of the citizens are the uh the lebanese
and uh trying to connect with israel all that time
and there really was no connection at all
and uh but boy those lebanese in jordan they were saying you know this whole war is israel's fault because israel told the united states to attack iran
it was like it was like you know israel controls our government
but one thing i did learn was how deep the the hatred runs toward israel by a lot of countries
i mean anyway they can you know they can see to connect into something and hate it more
i mean they just
and actually purchased it and then and then moved in and started a country
but see you are also getting back to the ages old problem of arab-israeli conflict
and theirs tie so much to their religion
and they both have holy sanctions
so very different things than what we face
well what what do you is think is the uh the main change in
i'm i'm thirty years old
so we're we're both children of the very early sixties
and i have i mean i've seen some change
like i know um when i was young most mothers pretty much were housewives
and stayed at home with the kids
and to to me it seems like its almost the opposite now where the the woman is working and and they you know take the children to child care
or maybe they work part-time or something
so that seems to be a pretty big change
um i uh
it it's funny
it's both of us then were really just adolescents when when
but it seems to me that the uh really the seventies the early seventies was a period of the most change
and if i had to somewhat abstract about it it seems to be the major change has been that woman have acquired more choice
oh that's true
uh i mean that's sort of the overall the meta the meta change as it were uh where that woman really have more of a choice now about what they do
uh course they find that the choice creates its own hardships in a way because life is not quite as simple even if it is for your you know
but it does seem
like an awful lot of my uh my adult women friends are anguishing over over some of some of these choices
well i know the choice to either work or to be a mother is probably pretty difficult because i think women just naturally tend to have those instincts that you you know you protected the children
yet there's so many material things to be had out there that a lot of people think oh but if we both work we can get a really big house
and it's kind of almost expected of you anyway
people kind of look down on a on a you know the role of a woman as a housewife
it's kind of like oh well you know she didn't go to college
well i only know
of my friends who have have children uh
and i have a lot of respect for her because she made it as a real choice
but she decided that was what she wanted to do in her life
and she wanted that role
and i you know i say all power to her because she's an example to me of someone who really does have the choice
i feel that a lot of uh women don't
but they don't necessarily feel that they do because they no longer feel like if they were just to be a parent rather than uh you know a sort of super woman success in the business world as well
and and then you and then it's not a choice anymore
uh and frankly it's the way that men are
uh men don't have this choice
uh in most subcultures in america that that i've been exposed to if the man were to say uh no i've decided not to work i want to stay home and do the child rearing my wife has a good job and i want her to keep that
and i i'm going to be the primary caretaker and you know and then then take care of the children because we don't want to put them in day care and this and that i think most americans would feel funny about that
so it's um
and i i think i've seen it once
but uh there's a t v show where the man is the one raising the kids
but uh there is a t v show out there
because i know there are cases of where that happens
i knew i knew people who did that years ago
but they were very apologetic about it
because you could tell they were used to people saying what are you doing that for you know
in fact it seems like it's kind of like anything goes now
when you know the husband's the one at home raising the children
i've seen more and more companies that have uh parental leave not just maternity leave
because uh one of the area supervisors uh in my area as a matter of fact took off um for a couple of weeks when his wife had their baby
instead of having a you know a a nurse or someone come in or or something like that or whatever mid-wife or whatever they call it that they have for the first couple of weeks
but i don't know if he took that out of his vacation or if they really do have a paternity
but it might have just been him describing the fact that he was taking vacation days to go be a father for a little while
but i'm not real sure how that goes
the other big change i see in in woman's lives is um
they uh women because they have choice are having children much later in life
uh i mean my friends who are having children are having them at age thirty
and uh if i'd been a couple of generations ago they would have had kids running around by then
well people they in general are just getting married a lot later
so i'm sure i'll be one of those parents that's you know one of those women in her thirties when when i get around to to ever getting married and having kids
that's uh i think i think that's getting a little more common too
i actually think that i'm i'm somewhat encouraged by that trend because after all people live longer lives now
so it's not like you know it's not like you're going to uh you know pass away before your child is an adult
i mean barring you know unforeseen circumstances
and i think most people make better parents when they are a little bit more mature
and then it gives her a little more option if she wants to stay home with the children while they're young
and then once they've gotten to school age maybe she could go back to work
so she's kind of got that option
if if they wait till later they've saved up some money
that it's not as difficult for her to stay at home with the kids and live off one income or something
so i guess i i'm pretty encouraged
but then i'm a product of my generation
but it sure seems nice to me
uh i mean i have other things to complain about
but in terms of uh woman's roles
um things really seem a lot more flexible
i seem to see more women in uh in leadership type roles and management positions
i mean it's still it's still a small minority
but it's but it's an improvement
like the mayor of dallas is a woman
and i'm sure that twenty years ago that never would have happened
she's i think she's in her second term now
so she's she's
i think she's going to going to uh
but but uh we do and we have several council women that are women
in fact oh the the governor of texas is a woman too
what's what's her name
so so you're starting to see more of that
and i know when i was younger it was all the presidents and still all the presidents are men
but i'm sure that one of these days well look at ferraro ran for vice-president
and i guess one of these days we'll we'll eventually have
that's right although during during the presidential debates there was some really nasty patronizing
but i thought she was treated badly for being a woman
frankly i really did by by uh the
uh who really i thought had a demeaning attitude towards her
and uh it was sort of it was acceptable to say certain types of things to her that she couldn't say back
that kind of thing which i i i found myself getting quite enraged about
but really that's a previous generation
well i think we've we've gotten our five minutes
well they've gotten their five minutes worth of us
well what's your views on it
i think it's uh a good idea
um i grew up uh
graduating uh high school in sixty-eight um i remember when the peace corps movement first came about
and i thought it was a very good idea at the time
i was one of those uh kennedy children if you know what i mean
and uh right now i see a lot of kids who get out of school have no idea what they want to do
and there's a lot of things out there that we could do uh for our own country
and i think that we've got the the people power to do it
it's just uh
we need to channel it and focus it on some things that that need some fixing up
some examples are this uh some of the things like jimmy carter's been involved in uh a little program to you know fix up housing for people
and there's a lot of housing
a- i know in the area that i live in that's run down and beat up
but it could be fixed up and used
and it's just you know sitting there wasting away
so i'm i'm same generation
i i think uh
i think it ought to be mandatory uh for kids to either either do military service or public service one of the two
uh a lot of reasons for that not not just because i'm a i'm a hard ass or anything
and either the military or public service organization can give them a lot of focus
and i think that it might stop us some problems later on
i mean you know y- these kids will get their their heads on straight and and figure out what they want to do instead of hanging around street corners selling drugs or something
uh it's i think it would be good for them uh
i think a lot of people grow up with uh with uh preconceived notions li- what the world's about
and uh you know it's there's there's a heck of a lot of difference between you know the intake that you get from t v and and movies and what you hear in school and then what reality is
uh i remember uh i've i've worked since i was
well i started delivering papers when i was ten
and i had a real job when i was thirteen
so i've you know worked most of my life
but i remember when i got out of high school all through high school was
and i wanted to go to college
and i had the grades to go to college
and i got accepted to college
but when i got out of high school i kind of said you know what am i going to do now
you know it's
like you know when i actually started working full time and i i got married shortly after getting out of high school
i uh thought i was smart ran away and got married
and uh i remember there was a time and within the first year of marriage i said boy wouldn't i give to get be back in school
and just have to do homework and and go work my part time job
and and most of them aren't
i mean you look you look at the number of marriages that are occurring right ou- i mean even in high school
and you know y- you wonder where are the parents in all of this
you know why isn't somebody stepping in and and sto- putting a stop to this
they ha- they have no idea what the world is like
uh i mean i was in the same boat when i left high school
i my parents wanted me to go straight to college
and i didn't
you know i was ready
so i joined the air force and ended up staying there for thirteen years
um but i had lived in my own little bubble up until that time
and and after traveling around the world a few times i realized that things ain't the way they seem
and i i did a lot of growing up there uh
i think once once kids get out and see how other people really live
a- if you're willing to work for it
well you know it's just like you say there's so much stuff that needs to be done here in this country
and uh you know if if you could have a thought of something like uh like a uh uh a peace corps sort of organization i mean this would be so useful just in uh for instance just helping old folks
you know they you know they need help
and it would be nice to have somebody come over and cut their yard or paint their house or do minor repairs or something like that
you know i've i've s- i
my my parents are in their late sixties now
and um so many of the people that live around them are unable to do those things for themselves anymore
and it's it's really hard on them
and the you know the thought that i i see the uh the mall rats you know walking around the mall nothing better to do than just walk around the mall all day long when they could be doing something to help someone
and uh you know yo- there's a uh a nice warm feeling
i mean i was a boy scout
and the whole bit and
and and it got to the got to the point where i mean me and my brother both were were gone and she couldn't maintain the house without large expenditures of money
you know it finally got to a point where she just had to sell it and move into an apartment
and uh i i'm not i'm not saying that that wouldn't have happened anyway
but it would have been nice if there had been somebody to come around and take care of the little things you know like the like the yard work and little repairs and painting and stuff like that
i think there'd there'd be a you know a uh economic benefit for you know everyone concerned
those doing the work and those receiving the the uh the services
i mean i mean the kids who would be giving the service are going to get a lot more out of it than just money
you know that
i i remember when i was a kid i used to do little little things for the old folks around the neighborhood
and uh i know how it made me feel
peop- people just don't help people anymore
they're they're out for themselves
i think uh president bush covered that in his uh state of the union address this year when he said that you know it's time for you know the individuals to start thinking about what they can do to help each other out instead of counting on government to do everything
well that's that's the that's the point we've gotten to you know
and y- the government's going to be limited
i where are they going to get the money
and we can do it a lot more efficiently than the government
um the thing that carter works on uh habitats for humanity i was involved in that w- uh in montgomery before i came up to north carolina
and uh it was it was a pretty neat little program
and everybody else would donate their their time
and uh the materials were at cost
and we'd put up houses
and that was kind that was kind of neat
i uh in a way i think it's a little bit inefficient
but but it's better than nothing
and and at least i had the opportunity of seeing two families move into decent housing
um course on the other hand i can start complaining very loudly about people on public assistance who are quite capable of doing something for themselves but just won't
because it's far more advantageous for them to sit there and just draw uh welfare money than it is to work
uh we did a uh a cost comparison in one of my courses
and we took all the benefits that a family that a a married couple with two kids would get under welfare and what they would be making at minimum wage
and they came out four thousand dollars better a year by taking welfare
so there's no incentive for them to do anything
one of the things they tried to push through in maryland and uh weren't very successful was that if you were an able-bodied person on welfare
a- an- and that's been tried that was tried in alabama too
and it got shot down
i d- and i don't understand the reasoning for it
it it seems perfectly logical that if somebody's going to take public money then they should return something to the public
i mean if nothing else go out along an interstate and pick up garbage
what do they what do they do in maryland
or do they use prisoners
tha- that's the way they did it in alabama too
u- usually you'd see these big chain gangs out there
uh they have a they have another program in maryland that's called adopt a highway
well good afternoon to you mary
let me ask you what's what's the weather like up there to begin with
well well today uh when i got up it was twenty-nine degrees
and it managed to get up to about fifty this afternoon
but it's been cloudy overcast and threatening rain all day
well you know i bet that's what we that storm we had last night
oh we had a frog strangler go sw- sweeping through here uh yesterday and last night
and we're expecting another one tonight
oh i mean it was raining so hard you could swim down the street
but not uh but uh no rain at all yesterday and uh no rain today
well it's probably on its way up there
cu- couldn't you send us some nice weather
well it was nice today
oh was it
uh in between the thunder showers
well you know what they say about the weather here in texas
if you if you don't like it wait five minutes it'll change
well that's about the way our weather is here also
and i grew up in saint louis
and saint louis was much the same
well tell me uh is is it normally that cold up there in in the spring
this is uh about uh ten degrees cooler than usual
but about a week ago we were up to eighty and eighty-five degrees
it uh it fluctuates from one extreme to the other it seems
you are you sure you didn't leave your refrigerator door open
it no it really was extremely warm
and then all of a sudden a cold front came down and uh temperatures dropped thirty degrees in a very short length of time
and uh it has gone down gradually each day
oh mother macree
so it it really wasn't too wasn't too pleasant
well i i sincerely hope that you don't have that terrible storm we had
oh i hope
well they are predicting rain and thunderstorms
and i wouldn't be a bit surprised by what we would not be getting the same weather you had
well i- if it's the same as what we had at least it'll be warmer
well of course by the time it gets up here it may ru- run into a cold front coming down from canada
the that whew that would be tear disastrous if you
we had uh a week ago they had golf ball size hail coming down in one part of the uh of the city of dayton itself
and uh then we just had about an inch and a half or two inches of rain in less than an hour
it it wasn't uh it wasn't conditions to being out in it
and i had just gotten home
and i had gotten home shortly before that uh the rain started
so uh i felt a little more secure that i was at home rather than having to be out driving in it
well uh i heard on the news this morning that um one of our local schools uh lost the roof of their gymnasium
and they suspected may have been a tornado
but uh uh thank god for small favors the uh uh
what do they call them the the the marching band or something
uh uh had just quit rehearsal about a half hour before
that was ca- very very fortunate for them because that could have really been disastrous
oh and how
well of course this is tornado season uh
in to uh
now we're in the southwestern part of uh ohio
and uh but uh northern indiana has many tornadoes come roaring across
and we get the backlash off of it if not the part of the tornado itself
so uh we you know we get a lot of bad weather in this area
but of course you're supposed to be the sun belt
and i do know that you get some freezing weather down there on occasion
well during the winter
uh we've had uh well
and uh of course people down here they just don't know how to handle themselves
i was going to say that it does make a difference when you're not accustomed to uh
but we're we're ee- don't have the equipment to handle it either
well all you can do with with uh freezing rain of course is spr- spread sand on the ice
and but uh you know we don't even have vehicles that will do that
they they have to get uh a truck of sand and uh uh four or five laborers up there just spreading it by hand
well uh well here what they do and i i contend that it's certainly not the right thing to do they spread salt
and of course the salt does melt the ice
but then what melts immediately freezes and becomes uh a perpetual problem
well and then to make matters worse it destroys your vehicles too
oh it sure does do that
they well we they do that down here too
well sand and uh
but i have learned to do is uh now that i am alone is uh to carry bags of salt in the trunk of my car
um not only in case i need it for that for traction but for additional weight
and then of course kitty litter is also excellent for that i don't know whether you've ever thought in terms of
well the dogs don't use litter
but kitty litter is excellent for uh getting under the wheels of cars
it uh works out uh really quite well
course i have i have a dog also
my son brought me a little lhasa apso uh for my birthday last thanksgiving
oh wasn't that nice of him
he just thought i had been without a dog uh for three years
he he had
i have uh a a chowperd myself
oh a what
now that one i'm not familiar with
well she's part chow and part shepherd
but she's the best the best of both breeds
well i've always had big dogs before never had a little dog before
but she is scared to death of thunder storms
oh well i had a german shorthair that was frightened of storms
and uh i had to push him down when he was fourteen
and two months later i had to put my yellow lab down
oh that must be nice
oh well it was great
but then i didn't need all that anymore so i finally sold that
and i'm in a fair size condo
and i have a nice size patio
and uh so this little dog has plenty of room to run
and he is a a cutie
and uh but i've never had a dog i had to keep taking to the groomer's to have groomed either
now you know it sounds like you ought to be in a condo down in miami beach somewhere
or better yet down around saint petersburg florida
oh is that right
oh well i was there once way way back in nineteen-sixty i think for just a week's vacation
but uh i that's about the only time i've been to florida except passing through on the way to someplace else
well i lived there in the seventies
and uh i i love it
well uh uh most of my friends do spend a lot of time down in florida
but uh i have just that's just not been my thing
now that i'm alone why uh i uh prefer to travel overseas if i'm going anywhere
and uh course there too you never know what the weather's going to be
well that's that's
why i was suggesting uh that saint petersburg is got got to be the finest weather in the world
oh is that right
oh i i loved it down there
course you could tell always tell which were the the na- natives-
oh is that right
i i think our experience of camping is
i i am the the passive member
uh because my my husband is a good camper
and so they
and they do the work
and i have fun
well uh uh your you said your family was gro- uh all grown up now
did you go cam- take them camping
i thinks it's a marvelous activity for younger families because uh
i it seems like i would go through a period of time where i just uh was really overworked you know
and and getting out into nature and relaxing
and having the family do a good share of the work you know
and the part that i did was more fun than uh than labor because they did the the running and toting chores and i just helped cook and kind of organize you know
bu- e- even cooking over an open fire is a little more fun isn't it
have you done uh uh uh the big pot cooking
oh oh uh well it was really my ex who did the the uh uh the cooking back when we first started
and we found that the you know what was one one great handy things was this uh uh uh hamburger helper
and it was enough for all five of us six of us
oh that's interesting
you know interesting enough uh the food part was kind of uh important thing in our camping
uh when my oldest son uh
but the the neat breakthrough was when my oldest son mark took his uh uh cooking merit badge in
and and mark was the kind of camper who ate beef stroganoff
i mean you know he did it up really good
and so uh after he took that merit badge he did all the shopping and preparing getting ready for it
well that's great
it was it was a marvelous experience because after that then all i had to do was uh follow the instructions you know and do
and we did a lot of interesting kinds of things
like i would take corn bread and uh cook a pan inside of a pan over a over a camp uh stove
and it works real good
just put uh put a thing on it
well really just commune with nature
we started out uh
well we were living in florida at the time
and we early in life we discovered that six people all going on vacation gets to be very very expensive
so my ex decided we're going to try camping
and she went out one day on the spur of the moment and bought a tent
and that's how we got started
we did it for years and years uh
well now in florida is ther- is there ti- are there times of the year when it's very comfortable to camp or is it always kind of hot
well ye- uh
i mean um ye- in the winter time yes
it's it gets kind of chilly or it can get chilly
but uh there's really no time of the year that you can't go
oh is that true
now now we're we're in texas now
and you're in texas
we have not camped a great deal here because uh a good share of the time in the summer time it's too hot really to be very comfortable camping
well it just depends on where you go
but but we camped mostly
when the kids were little we were in we were in new jersey and w-
oh where abouts
uh in uh allendale and uh and uh waldwick
and we'd go up to the adirondacks and camp
and it was so you know pick your own uh blueberries and make blueberry pancakes for breakfast
i co- i come from up in that area
oh are you
oh oh yeah
that's a that's a neat area
but it's a that is a particularly neat area for camping because
well that i wouldn't know
and uh and there's uh a lot of trees lot of mountains and lot of uh hiking sort of things
and and we had uh collapsible boat which we clipper little clipper sail boat
and so we would sail and and uh did a lot of camping that way
well uh me i outgrew uh sleeping bags and uh tents
and i now have a motor home
oh do you
and it's fun too i think
well i live in mine
so you kind of uh uh an everyday camper
uh well yes
well now are you living alone now
well just me and my dog
you and your dog huh
well we don't we don't camp quite as much as we used to
but uh i still think it's a great way to spend a time with your family
and enjoy nature and uh kind of wipe out the stress of everyday life
i'd always come home just relaxed and uh comfortable and ready to go at it again
so it was a neat activity
are you uh from dallas too beth
we're we're in plano
but we've been here about uh eighteen years
well that's where we that's where i am
are you are you
well we're all lots of people from t i up this way
oh dear that's a hard one
that's really hard for me because uh you know i really i have a son that's sixteen
and i think you know eventually you know he'll be of of drafting age
and i think gosh do i want him to go
and yet i'm proud to be an american
and i know that we have a country that you know people would give anything to live in a lot of people anyway because we have so many wonderful things that they don't have
and yet i don't know whether i'd be willing to give his life for for this country
and yet and yet i know that i that
and i i when i was in school it was always the tired the tired excuse that we went to war to save us against communism
but i'm not sure that that's the reason anymore i mean not sure that communism is is as strong as it once was
and i'm not sure that that that's the reason why we're like we were in vietnam supposedly so
well with the
well you realize why we were in the middle east why we invaded iraq why we were in saudi why we attacked kuwait and we we're why we are still fighting iraq
well it's because of oil isn't it
but saddam is saddam is a madman
he's uh a bad person very definitely
and and if you know
i can see that he was in kuwait kuwait was the nonaggressor and the saudis are our allies
you know they've been our friends through thick and thin
but what at at what cost you know
that's the uh the thing it came out it came out wonderfully supposedly
i mean everything is and we won
and that that's wonderful
but what if if that wasn't the case
would that would it have been too much of a price to pay for that
see and i think there are a lot of things that we don't know
well and there's a lot
but i think there's a lot that we the public doesn't need to know
i think there's some things we shouldn't know just for nation- national security sake
and i you know i think if we did know i think there would be a lot more chaos than there is because i don't i don't think people could handle it
so i think there are things that we should not know the masses shouldn't know
but i also agree that there are a lot of crooks and liars too
you know it's uh
and uh one of the guys that was on the jury they were asking him if if you could believe a lawyer or if a
and one guy being selected snickered and couldn't keep his head up you know
and the guy said well can you share it with us what you what you find so funny
he says well i already told you my sons a lawyer
he told him dad you know how to tell when a lawyers lying to you
oh my gosh
and ninety percent of all politicians
so by definition all lawyers and politicians are liars
so what's it going to cost us in the long run there in saudi
see and i don't know i don't know i can't tell the future that's what scares me so much about it
i mean i thought the war was going to go on and on
well we hit them with more in one month than we used in three years the last three years of vietnam
and whenever you strike on open terrain with that sheer volume there's nothing they can do about it
you know it's not like we
so honestly if there is was a well perceived war world wide this was it
but what i can't understand is then many of the kuwaiti youth didn't fight wouldn't fight
and it's not their job to fight for their own land
that is very
uh and yet you know see that's another thing that that's difficult for americans
their culture is so much different than ours you know
i've heard from many people that we could not even begi- begin to understand how they feel about things because their values and their perceptions are so much different than ours
and um they just don't think the same way we do
and really from all i can indica- from all indications the iraqi beliefs if you will are more similar to our own
and the kuwaitis aren't even helping rebuild their own country
uh i didn't realize that
oh my word
the uh u s army is doing it all
see and that's another question you have to ask is this our job
is are we should we still be there even you know
and i think you know it's
but i'm not sure they really are one hundred percent sure
well they talked to one kuwaiti woman yesterday
and her biggest concern in life was that she couldn't get a housekeeper
and do you have a housekeeper
and don't plan on having one either ever
well i wouldn't mind having one
oh i'd love to have one
but you know
but you know i'd like to make sure that i have a job tomorrow first
it it astound
i wasn't i didn't wasn't aware of that
for noth- for for doing nothing
oh that ought to give their programming trouble shouldn't it
uh they do nothing
and they're part of
but we support our schools here with property taxes
and the land owners or home owners are the ones that pay the school tax
so if you're renting a house or doing anything else you're not actually contributing to the education of your children
and i think that's wrong
so as it turns out we don't really have a tremendous education system because they don't have the money they need to run it
i uh i spent a couple uh years down in uh plano texas
and uh i was one of the home owners down there that got taxed to death
for the uh plano uh school system
and uh i f- you know i know that texas doesn't have a state tax
and so all the things come out of the the property taxes
and i was uh really shocked at the amount of taxes i ended up paying
i was i was better off paying a state tax mo- back in maryland where
than i was uh paying the uh property tax down there
uh what they did in maryland to get around that is they uh they developed a renters tax solely for the purpose of paying for the services
that the renters were getting including the uh educational services
and uh the tax was administered by uh the uh rental company that actually was managing the apartments
so when uh long long time ago when i used to live in apartments i would pay a rent payment every month and a tax payment every month
and the tax payment went to pay for the services that i was getting as a a resident of that particular county
and uh that's the way it worked
here in maryland we have uh a certain portion of your your property taxes uh goes to education
but also a portion of the state tax that you pay goes back into the county that you live in to pay for the educational system
oh well that's pretty good
and so it it works out nice
it it it makes it so that the uh whole county now
i i know the concept of counties in texas is quite a bit different than it is here in maryland uh
like collin county uh would only equal about maybe an eighth the size of baltimore county here in maryland
i mean the the counties are much larger
you know in the the whole state of maryland i believe there's only like uh fifteen counties
and so uh you know each county has their own school system an and it works out real nice
um the the flip side to this is are we getting what we're paying for
and i don't believe so um
and i heard a report because of uh uh the emphasis that the president was putting on education you know
uh him running as our education president and then finally a couple of years later getting around to doing something
um they said since they imposed the federal regulations on education
and then at the end of uh school year they would be tested
and then they go into the fourth grade
and everybody in the fourth grade's basically taught the same thing
so when they came up with these this nationwide system of public schools uh they gave some figures out
and since it's inception uh they've the price has gone up per stu- the prices paid by the federal government per student has been thirty-three percent
and so they're actually spending thirty-three percent
and that's real dollars you know
adjusting it back to to the days you know when it started uh probably you know seventy years ago
and what they've said is that we haven't had a thirty-three percent improvement in education
well they say that texas schools are some of the lowest in the nation
so you know our school system down here is no where near perfect
but they keep complaining they don't have the money to do it
well they they've been having some problems uh even here in uh like baltimore city which is a a pretty good ci- goo- good sized city
uh they've been putting a lot of uh stress on it
and of course speaking of stress the teachers are all getting stressed out from trying to you know do everything they're supposed to do
and of course they've uh been cutting the teachers salaries
all the services are costing more money and and everything uh
but the- uh a lot of emphas- now is being put on you know when children used to be taught you know like uh uh each child is individual
you know they're not all the same
and some students do horrible until like eighth grade
some do horrible you know until they get to like tenth grade
and then all of a sudden everything clicks in you know
and then there are some students that you know read well at five years old
and you know seem to excel
and so that the you know one of the things i heard proposed on uh one of the public radio stations up here was that we should go back to teaching children at their own speed some ki-
you know each child has to learn at his own rate
and and uh
they can't keep force feeding things to each other and or you know at the kids
and on top of that they they make the child feel inferior
i mean it's like you know that's ridiculous
and it's not that he can't do it
and uh you know i have uh i i have five children total
and i've got two out of the house already
and i ha- i have two that are in uh eighth grade this year
and prior to their um
when i when they were in elementary school they were identi- identified as being slow
and so they put them into special programs
and then we actually held them back in fourth grade
and it wasn't until the last two years um
last year my uh
they're they're a set of twins
um a boy and a girl
last year the the uh boy twin started doing real well
and it it everything started to click in for him
and he knew what he needed to do
um and this year it it happened for uh for the daughter
um all right
and she has the right attitude towards school and everything
and i think it's just a matter of everybody has to find their own path
i remember when i was in school i did horrible up until about yeah about the seventh eighth grade
i i i started to to come around and realize
an and basically i got interested in math
and uh never really did well in english
but you know once you got interested in something and things started to click in place then after that you take off
and see when i was a kid growing up and going to high school if i wanted to take a little electronics course i had a electronics course i could take
but we lived out in the country
and we didn't have all that fancy stuff to worry about you know
and and you know we had just about every thing that we needed
but they don't have it anymore
m- our oldest boy goes to lubbock high down here
and they go to school four and half days a week
it is um
my children had a uh real culture shock uh when we lived in plano
they're re- uh they really stress academics there
and uh god if your child is not an honor student well then
and tha- that's kind of the way they are there
and uh when we moved back to maryland um i moved to a uh a baltimore county which is a northern county in maryland
and it's basically a rural county once you get above about the half way point
and we lived you know in the northern part of the county
uh we went from a uh middle school in texas that served fifty-five square blocks to a uh middle school in maryland that served fifty-five square miles
and it was just a complete culture shock
because i mean they they're riding on the bus in the morning with uh other kids that you know are a sleep because they got up at three o'clock and were doing chores
and they had uh ag
they had an ag course uh
i forget what it was called uh
but it goes along the the lines of industrial arts
but it's agricultural
and where they had to raise a small animal
oh like four h then
they actually had to g- take a driving test on the tractor
i mean they just couldn't believe this
and it was great
i mean they really enjoyed the courses um
and it you know it made school fun for them again because prior to that school was just a big pain a drain
and it was you know
it was like ki- kind of like the way we feel about going to work
but uh up here they seem to have made it uh a lot of fun for them
and they they seem to really enjoy it
all right uh
i i well i have uh these
well i don't know if they consider themselves animals anymore
they actually you know sort of take over the place
an and we're kind of their pets
and naturally these are cats
i remember one time uh i used to get a chuckle out of out of pogo
and he used to say pets can be most as much trouble as ki- as kids if they work at it a little bit and even more when they work at it a little bit
and i think that's true
i i i think that um
my husband and i are in such a situation that uh um i'm kind of um not able to do a lot
i'm i'm kind of in a wheelchair
i mean i kind of am
and i don't what i'd do without them
th- co- just good company huh that's neat
you know it's funny how pets get to be so uh
they really yo- you really do mourn them after when things happen
but uh but we have had some
and and i ca- i
we had a little uh uh oh dog
it was a little uh
i got it so it wouldn't wouldn't shed
and uh he used to i used to come down stairs in the morning to feed him you know
and i'd let him up out of the basement where he was sleeping
and he would just dance around the floor
and i just got
and we only had him about three or four weeks before he was hit by a car
but i cannot believe the whole family just he just got in t- to us so quickly
i i have to tell you about our most interesting pet though
oh uh by choice
about two years two and a half years i guess
it was about uh oh three feet long about three feet long
and uh my son dan went to uh to uh hawaii for the summer
and when he came home uh he didn't bring the iguana with him
but for some reason or other he had a thing for them
i think there was one in the school uh zoology department you know
or biology department one or the other anyway uh
and anyway he just he went and found this guy in in dallas somewhere who had picked up one in i guess in te- in mexico
but anyway he brought this home
and i looked at him
and i said you've got to be kidding
but you know i visualize that animal racing about
and you know like you think of lizards doing but they don't do that
they're very much like uh
well the thing about them is that they hold so still you don't notice that they're there
and then they move and about scares you to death sometimes
it was he was really a neat pet
and though i you know
and it it was a long time before i could really pet him
and but i fed him
and he he knew how to get me to feed him
i mean you don't argue with an iguana do you
he he'd lay in dan's lap you know
and just uh when he'd pet him he'd just stretch
and you know you could see him just enjoying it like a cat does
but he did a lot of interesting things
and uh dan carried him around
and he liked to ride on the back of his up on his head you know with his tail wrapped around his arm so he wouldn't fall off an and scare everybody to death
oh my g- goodness
and and he tolerated them you know
he didn't like them too well at first
but he he got tame you know
so that uh people could go in there
and dan was a drummer
and he didn't he the only thing he didn't like very well was the drumming
when dan would drum he'd sit there and scrunch up you know
like he was trying to hi-
and then he'd leave the room
isn't that funny the way we put you know um human characteristics on an animal like that
an an i- i- it's
they really are they're interesting
well they take on human characteristics like
uh our other animal
the next year our our son ken went to hawaii
and well while dan was in hawaii ken decided he wanted a dog
and he and he looked around a long while
and he found a norwegian elkhound
and he just brought this norwegian elkhound an
and he was so funny
uh for a while they built a a run for him out to the side of the house you know
but they put the run out there
and he didn't like this run because there were no people that came by
and sometimes he would just make a racket until you came and got him
and one night we'd forgotten to put water out for him
and and hal and i were in bed
and all of a sudden there was all this noise out to the side the house
and and he'd pick up his dish and throw it in the air
and then bark and march around you know
and then he'd pick up his dish again and throw it in the air until we came out and gave him some water
they eat uh they eat greens
uh we fed him the outside leaves of lettuce you know
and he'd eat the outside leaves
and then in the summertime you could put him out
and he'd eat outside o- except you had to keep him away from the garden because he liked to eat the little peas as fast as they came up you know
it was really
well can we ask you whatever happened to clyde
when uh when dan went up to college up at ricksun idaho he took him with him
and uh everybody was used to him
and they just loved him and what not
and this f- his roommate put him out one day
and dan didn't know it
and it got dark
and he didn't get him in again
and they searched and searched and searched for him
but uh uh it got too cold up there
and he he died in a tree
tha- they found him the next day in a tree
oh oh my
so you ca- you have to be pretty tender with them
we had a he had his own heat lamp and uh and uh hot pad he laid on you know
and it it burned up one time
and boy it was that was funny too watching him kind of burned up
an we got him a new one
and when we got him a new one it was brown
and he wouldn't lay on it until we changed the covers
because that was like what he was used to
bu- so they really are they really pick up things
he was he was a clean animal uh
we h- he went to the bathroom in the bathroom
pu- well we put some papers on the floor
and he went there to go to the bathroom
you had to be sure you left the doors open you know
he'd he'd scratch and do all kinds of things to get you to open the door if you happened to close it on him or something you know
but but even when he went when he had an accident or something uh
if you just let it dry it dries kind of like uh
and you could just vacuum it up
oh my goodness
in the winter time there was no smell at all no odor at all to it
and in the summertime when he was outside and eating outside the smell was a little bit like a cat you know
but that that's incredible
he is he was a really interesting animal
i i just uh we just really
and you know to this day i still miss him
and that's been years ago
well see i guess it's because you lived with you know him an and overcame some fears to get used to him
but i- it's it was interesting
well what do your cats do besides sitting and purring and letting you pet them
oh my goodness these guys they well actually they're my husband's pets
oh and you just kind of took them over huh
well well actually it's like he's the cat person you know
and i've i was always kind of nondescript in that category because i always liked dogs
and they've kind of taken over
and and uh you know
we- i think
well i'm glad we have two of them otherwise i think they get neurotic if there just one of them
that could be could be
but there blu- brother and sister from the same litter
they are they are well they are siamese cats
oh pretty ones
but one is one is uh um
they're both registered you know
and then uh n- newhart is the uh the the
he really he just he just wants his belly scratched
and that's it you know
and he's just the warmest thing in the wintertime
he just sits on your lap sits on your lap
but they're like seven ye-
well um i haven't been doing a whole lot of reading for enjoyment lately
i read uh one book a friend recommended to me
and it was so frightening
and it had so much violence in it
she thought it was riveting you know
but i couldn't deal with that
and mostly i read things to do with raising kids
and now i have two little kids
or co-dependency or you know fifty thousand things like john bradshaw's books on uh the family and homecoming and inner child and so
and right now i'm reading um
in m- in my spare time with a two and a half and a three and a half year old
i i read
you know but gosh it's uh it's getting pathetic now
well my my kids are up
so you know i will uh encourage you that
so you can
oh uh well i read for a living
oh well how interesting
and s- so i i'm at the
center for advanced study of the behavioral sciences and therefore
i read uh psychology sociology anthropology political science philosophy linguistics history
and you name it
well that sounds like a fascinating job
it's it's a great place to be
and the uh
well you probably
i i seem to remember that uh little byline
um is is is that um
uh normally we don't publish uh things under our own
but i also get of course lots
so i'm uh i was just thinking when they
uh a book called
oh my goodness
there is a
like uh nursing
and now it's practically all women
and that uh
like the scribes who did the old documents you know for churches and
well that's interesting
and then i have one novel that's called first light
that's about uh archaeology the british novel
so are you reading these in the form of just like printed manuscripts
uh those are
but they're just things
that pertain to various things i'm working on or were uh mentioned prominently and attracted my curiosity
so i got them out of the library and decided i'd read
so i read a lot of history and uh a few novels occasional mystery stories just
my husband reads a lot of the um
well he did before we had kids
but he's got a quite a collection of those
but uh my stuff re- uh revolv- revolves around uh one hun- one thou- let's see
oh i think the the boom to parents and the the shoelace department was those little velcro tabs
but there's a surprising number that are still around that aren't
so that's an alternate means of dealing with
uh since i'm um a therapist and all i've done recently a lot of research into some of the twelve step groups
so i've got all the different alcoholics what they call the blue the blue book the big book
so i'm trying to get fami- more familiarized with that because i refer clients and different groups
well let's see
and then he did uh he- he- healing the shame that binds you
and then the third one that he came out with is now called homecoming
uh and uh there's a subtitle to it
it's something like um a journey in in your inner
his literary agent in houston when she was just uh convincing him to write all this down
and now he's had the the first the first one and the third one put into a ten session uh p b s series
i s- i saw one of those episodes on p b s
so people can just tape them i guess
there's an author that's in um
and she's got some fabulous workbooks out and a whole series of tapes and uh
so that's been
but i really have enjoyed exploring children's literature because there's so much more uh new things out that you know
i i'd pull out the classics once in a while for my kids
but there's such cute things
oh there's some
oh i know
and i just go to the library because i just they're expensive
i mean it
and they go through them so fast
so i just i really have been going to the library and getting my ten books out
and they just love to sit and read
and now finally the littlest one is oldest to to sit you know and watch the pictures instead of
so that that has been fun to do do that you
uh which lists all the upcoming books forthcoming books
uh there are so many that look like they would just be absolutely wonderful
but i was tickled to see that some publisher is uh reprinting the the
wonderful o and the thirteen clocks that have been out of print for about oh i think about twenty years
well i'm going to have to
and they really did
but they were
and so they probably were out of print all of already when my kids were small
well i don-
i mean what thoughts do you have on the subject
uh you know we even lived there for a a while when my husband was in the navy
oh you did
in fact the first year we were married he was already over there had been there two years when we got married
and so our we had a one year honeymoon
uh it was very nice um
well do you have you probably have a different sense than i have
um and that's not where i am originally from
and it was a a cultural shock to me
uh in terms of what i went through
the high school is now called in fact it was called tulley high school
and now it's called roberto clemente
that yeah that's exactly about twenty years now
uh what was it like living there
i mean did you find that people appreciated having the privilege of being
and i find it really difficult an and frustrated trying to make stereotypes you know
and uh i- i can understand the the frustration you must have gone through uh going to the the school uh
we- i didn't mean that in a totally negative sense
if if it's not part of your culture
uh the firs-
i had gone to a very uh uh
and when i started teaching school it was in an inner city situation
although it was not puerto rican it was uh a mexican american and black students
so it was it was very very different
i mean i'll give you and idea that i had um
and i would say i would say the ones the majority appreciated what they were having in this country
uh but a lot of the ones that didn't e- even in the minority not in the sense of the cultural world word they made it worse for the other kids in school
and you know chicago back then even had bilingual classes
and i mean i had geometry
so if you can imagine how i even go-
and i mean and i guess i look at is as an enlightening sense
um but i think basically i think they should leave things the way they are right now
i mean i don't really have enough in terms of an argument pro or con in terms of making any type of change
i'm not so much against their making uh it a state
but i would want a very very very clear majority
because if the minority can be so vociferous whether you're talking this group or or
any other group that that has a stake in something
and they can make as you said uh so well the a a few can make it so miserable for everybody else
and that's exactly
i mean i can remember instances that uh wasn't as uh you know bad
well i know what it looks like
that that my give you a clue
um but its' but it's an experience i wouldn't change
i mean my husband um grew up in um a majority uh wasp southern ohio you know
so that um
when he saw where i you know saw my later teenage years he was just i hate to say aghast because that sounds so trite
but he was
and yet how did i turn out the way i did turn out
and i said that's really irrelevant
what you find is that um if you can talk to like
i mean i learned a lot about the um island of puerto rico from talking to these kids
oh i'm sure
you know and you lived there
so you know that parts of it are beautiful and parts of it are squalor
same as as any other part of the world
like here yeah
i i don't i don't think it's really to their best interests
to uh uh attain statehood as it is right now
they have uh representation
but they don't have to pay all the taxes and so forth that we do
uh being that it's an island economy um
and yes the cost of living is super high
but but they're protected in so many ways without having to to pay for the rights and privileges
so so you know i i would just as soon
an an and if if they voted to for independence i would back them a hundred percent
and that's that's because i i guess because i'm not into territorialism or whatever that we have been in the past
i probably would say the something if i knew that inte- intellectually that it was good
and emotionally that the people there wanted it
you know it's just um
i mean r- right now they have the privilege of voting with the united states don't they
they count yeah as a principle
um but i've also been down there
so you always pass through san juan in going to places like or
and it's just it's i think what they do need is an infusion of some of the united states um privileges some of our resources the educational the teachers the um
academic opportunity you know
i don't think we do en- do enough of a resource transfer if there is such a thing
part of that though has been i think uh selected by by them
in that that whereas they want the benefits of some of of what the continentals can offer
they they want to maintain that um culture of theirs
which which i understand
and and so often when you when you bring in the advantages the resources and so forth there there is a trade
most of the people who that i- that i know about who really uh would fa- favor statehood
have pretty much assimilated into the the continental states already
or they have family here and this way they can go back and forth
and and it's not that much of a strain
you know they're kind of lackadaisical about it
that's the way the way the pendulum seems to be swinging right now
it sounds like you probably know qui-
i mean to this day are you still in touch with any native puerto ricans that you have made friends with
because i really don't have any um personal or professional or familial ties down there
i don't know the peop- the the the that's just children but the the people that i went to high school with um i think the majority are in that the probably the generation yours and mine
and the one right after us that um their parents did not want to acclimate to the united states
um in terms of retaining um
and my background's european heritage
and their background it would be you know the we- i guess i would say the la- latin or latino heritage
not speaking in english um having the children drive them everywhere and these were not old people
these were like in their early forties
um and i always that always bothered me
and then there were some children that i noticed as soon as all the kids were out of high school i mean they went back to puerto rico to live
you know they had made enough money here
and so th-
but on the other hand i guess it's all about choice
um was it
i mean how were they toward
that's interesting the the way term you used continentals which i'm sure is the proper term
i mean were they glad
there really were three major um camps
and there were those who who uh were very friendly very open any anything we can do for you uh uh
either way you know was great
and then there were those at the other end of the spectrum and those that ho hum whatever
and and uh it it was interesting
there was always some on sunday afternoons uh going through the all the little urbanizations the little neighborhoods with uh
blow horns oh
but you know
and with banners and and a parade of vehicles with their with their colors of the of a particular party
so they were very very um passionate
but it it it kind of broke down that you couldn't really see
i couldn't see that there was a clear majority that that stayed
it seemed to shift as as
i don't i don't predict
you know what
oh oh i see
well i have enjoyed it
and uh thank you for your time
but i guess medical insurance is probably what i consider the second most important
and you know it seems pa-
compared to what we our salary is versus what our health care is our health care keeps increasing increasing increasing
no matter what you do about that yeah unless you're like a senior v p or something which i am not
and then when you interview for a job or something sometimes people um expect the benefits to take the place of a certain salary level
you know they'll say maybe we'll pay you x amount annually
but then we you know ten percent to fifteen percent more are your benefits
and if you're like
um like my husband works
and i do
so i don't take some of
and he has other things he takes
so i mean in that kind of situation it's really almost redundant you know
you know that some of the benefits i would rather have um money
more money actually um
or flex time or something that was a little more personal you know
um we don't use any of t i benefits other than i i buy bonds and
you don't use you don't use the medical insurance
you use your your company's
he he works for bramalea company
and they pay one hundred percent
oh you're kidding
and and building they own a lot of buildings and lease buildings
that's see that's probably why cause cana- canada has the the um government run health care systems social medicine
and you don't pay them if you live there
yeah but our prescriptions and everything our visits to the doctor our hospitalization
the only thing we pay for is if
i mean that's nothing
well t i was getting for the both of us it was like seventy-five dollars a month
oh my goodness
you know deducted for an h m o
but it's like um
but um and we take my dental my dental his medical
and the medical is just i mean i think it's terrible you know
but they're then they're getting ready to change it again for aetna
um i don't know
i just don't think companies um they want you to feel responsible and don't abuse the medical system
and you know
um t i just did the thing where with the smoking premiums
but did you do you know about the smoking premiums
you know like a lady in my office said she said her husband works for t i too
and she said what about the people that are walking around
and i hope
i don't you don't sound like you're in this category but i mean for extremely obese people or something*[[needs slash unit note punctuation
the kind of people that can't sit in the airline airplane chair you know
you know who's going to croak first the people that smoke or you know
i mean i'm not all for smoking at all
but i just you know
i mean i don't know um
what other what other type of benefits do they have that i mean canadian based companies
they have to be a little bit different than the american um
they are as far as their like pension plans
and they're vested after their first year
to- totally vested
oh my goodness
and they have the four one k and the usual benefits like that uh
but that's a pretty standard thing anymore
you know um um your husband's company probably matches more than t i though
oh they do
well they match four percent which is the same
you know fifty percent or four percent particularly nonsensical
that's still pretty good though i mean the fact that your vested that quickly in the pension
i know um
i think e d s has seven to to eight years
so it's like t i in that respect you know
and and i mean and i'm working for a company that's making money
um not e d s t i um
but i i don't know
but if i were to rank them i guess i would say next to income it's really just health benefits
and then um for most people i know it would be day care
like t i has
that and i know that's a big issue
because i i belong to a women's forum group
and some of the questions we're getting are are on site day care and things like that
and i can't tell you anybody right now at t i that's uh considering that
oh i don't
they really should because they're big enough um
and the other thing i think is really good is that e d s is much better than t i at i think right now than that we have day care um they uh the health the health program like t i has texans
but it i don't think it that it's
i mean if you ever walked into e d s health corner court health clubs on site and you walk into spring creek well spring creek's better than the one on dallas parkway
e d s is m- is better than spring creek
oh it's really nice
you know instead of like six um treadmills you've got like twenty
i guess it's just where they um and like e d s reimburses you for adoption
oh i see
and t i doesn't have anything like that
you know so i guess i i wish the companies like t i and a lot of others were more progressive in that respect
that's a that's a fortunate benefit you know that they're so active for their employees
and there's i mean they have some strange things
i mean they have very strange like dress codes
and you know
um you can't wear slacks at the corporate site and that kind of thing unless you're in a y- you know
but it doesn't there aren't manufacturing environments because of the type of company it is
i i guess i also wish that uh companies would look more at cost of living increases instead of just merit reviews
because you know with utilities and and homes that are uh
price of homes have went up dr- drastically
like an average house is now a hundred and thirty thousand
and that is unreal
but then we've got these million dollar homes
so you know where do you find a happy medium
and how does your salary deal
and i mean
i mean i don't know how you and your husband are too
but i mean we have friends that laugh at us
and we i clip coupons
and i said hey i'll probably do this even if i'm a millionaire which i won't
but i mean it's like
because you just can't
i mean it seems like every time you try to get ahead and take a vacation or something well the car insurance is due
um kind of nice to talk to somebody in dallas
and i think dallas as far as um economic uncertainty is better than what most of the country is
so wer- somehow we're better off than a lot of them
and that doesn't definitely make it any better
just something you have to keep telling yourself you know that um that's what i want that uh you know
and people are lucky to have any kind of benefits
when you see people that don't have um anything but h m o or you know i mean really can't even afford to get in a job that costs
like we had a guy fixing our air conditioner
and he said he didn't even make ten dollars an hour
and he has three kids
and i went oh
um but benefits
that's a good word for it um
well very well um
at least they're making the effort to put it out there and make it available and and cultural change within the management first
and now it's kind of filtering down to the peon level
i mean it's just it's that mind-set
e d s is oh they're better
but they're a little bit too um stiff collared in terms of you know what you want to do
they're pretty much put the if that's where the widget goes stick it in the hole you know
and and you can't really argue with them because they've always been successful
you know what can you tell them
well i guess that's what i know about benefits
go- good talking to you
and keep cool
and uh i don't know exactly how we're going to cover many of these people because i'm sure that some of them don't uh don't have the wherewithal to do it themselves
so uh i i have a feeling since i have just about as good a health care coverage that anybody can get that this uh then becomes an obligation of the government
because it's going to become an obligation of either state local or federal government anyway
because when people can't pay they end up going to clinics or you know to public hospitals and that kind of thing
and you know
well it seems to me that that i'm paying anyway because when i go or my insurance carrier anyway when i pay something the bills seem inordinately high
and the reason that they're inordinately high is because that has
it would seem to spread it out a little better if the employers who uh employ these people and pay them uh you know subminimum wages or whatever
were asked to sh- share their fair burden of this too just as my employer is
well well who who else is going to do this then
i mean it's worked successfully in europe
i travel extensively and spend uh maybe half a year in europe every year
and i find that the health care programs there uh are administered with uh at least people i talk to with uh a great deal of integrity
and uh people don't seem to be reluctant to use them to any degree
as a matter of fact if i'm injured or have an emergency when i'm say in germany or france uh that i'm automatically taken care of
i mean i don't even have to pay
well i think part of the the tremendous benefit of that is that there's so many people who wait now because they don't have the money until you know they have no preventative measures
people um you know just go on and on and on
i mean so many people don't even get prenatal care
or and it just extends with i- if it w- what would be a minor problem to deal with if they had a help available early on
becomes just this horrendous you know burden on the taxpayers
they're saying now that one out of every ten child born i- in public hospitals is addicted to crack
well you know
well i uh uh i know it
i have a solution you see
m- my solution
even though i'm rapidly approaching the uh the age when i'll qualify for medicare and medicaid i i
my mother and father both uh uh
well my father's not living but my mother is
and they are um of an advanced years
and when i see the money that's poured down the down the drain on medicare and medicaid
i mean the
and the extraordinary amounts
because those people vote
i mean they're the ones who get out and vote
that's what's robbing a poor mother of the p- prenatal care
and we're spending on these useless many times useless and inordinately complex unnecessary tests in hospitals for older people
oh it's unbelievable how much you go through
when i just had a problem with my neck and they ended up doing a seven hundred dollar cat scan and i mean a chiropractor got it in one time
i mean it does
seem like we're th- th- th-
now i noticed just the other day in the paper that that medicare will be based payments will be based not uh just on cost but on cost effectiveness
so i gue-
oh well that should help
well i don't know uh
but we'll see what happens
oh i see
well listen uh i think i've i've exhausted my uh self on
well i know that uh
i have only like two or three favorite television shows
i think one of my favorite then is from the guy stephen is it brochco who does like l a law uh-huh
and uh he also did hillstreet blues
uh i don't get a lot to watch a whole lot of t v
and so we're usually outside
and so it's usually the nine o'clock shows that if we get them in bed we usually watch that
and l a law is one of my favorites
they uh i think they're different than a lot of other shows of which they have like the re runs in the middle of the season and then towards the end when everybody else is showing reruns they start showing some of their newer stuff
oh and so you must watch a lot of uh disney or cartoons then
well we have on sesame street and mister rogers that kind of stuff
and i think those programs are really good for children
it's kind of nice to know that they're just going to be seeing you know not a lot of violence and that kind of stuff and they usually uh show a lot of things that really teach them different things about the world
my so- older son he's going to be five
and he's more into watching the cartoons and that kind of stuff now
oh that's true
well i noticed that my kids are uh older now
they're uh getting close to the teenage years
but they did
but even some of your uh cartoons can be very violent and you know they talk about death
and we were watching uh oh gosh bugs bunny just last night and um i think it was on i have to remember which channel
but anyway uh we were watching that
and it was talking about opera
and they showed like what they thought an opera would be
and one of the things was to kill the rabbit kill the rabbit
and i thought oh how violent you know to kill the rabbit
so he ended up killing the rabbit in the end
but then of course the rabbit comes back to life and says well see this is how an opera is supposed to be
and i thought gee whiz if a little kid was watching this you know that would be pretty violent even for a small child
and you know they especially boys i mean they're always talking about shooting and killing and all that kind of stuff and i don't think that they really realize that death is forever you know
and showing them something like that really doesn't teach them that it is
well i don't think cartoons portray that
and to get them to feel like that that's just pretend i think is the hardest part you know
a cat has nine lives but they don't
but uh we've gotten
thursday nights usually had pretty good with that and as far as very good comedy
i used to watch uh dallas
i don't i don't know where you're at
we're we're in dallas
and somewhere in the middle i got uh bored
and uh so i in fact i didn't even watch the finale
uh you know that's about how disinterested i had become
after a while they just kind of you know there's no new stuff they can do
they've done everything dirty in the book you know
oh but you were just talking about
everything you could think of you know had a hard time
and i think maybe with dallas as far as they lost a lot of characters that had been around at the first
but i think they've had a lot of their characters stay around
you know and if you notice on dallas they lost all the women
so the men mainly stayed
but the women were the ones who left
and i thought that was very interesting and wondered kind of wondered about that
uh well anyway that's a whole new issue
so anyway i don't know if our five minutes are over yet
but we uh we also have the paid uh television channels
uh the only thing i don't like about it especially with teenagers is that all the violence the sex the nudity and the curse words you know
and so i know they didn't pick up these curse words from me
so uh they had to have picked them up from uh the t v
one nice thing though about the cable company we use they have uh they have that little parental uh uh key
so i i have that at home
and i keep the keys with me
and that's about the only way that i can that i can do it
because their natural curiosity you know to go towards that way and want yeah
and i don't know the way the generations are growing up now
i mean i just think they watch so much more t v
they aren't sitting in the house watching t v all day because i think it's good for them to have physical activity and that kind of stuff too
and especially in the summer time we aren't in the house very much in the evenings
well and here lately it hasn't been that cool anyway with the humidity being so high
well it was nice talking to you too
um does is this something that concerns you
and uh personally i don't live in a real bad section of town
but uh just because of the general area i live in the insurance rates are real high on your car
and there's a lot of crime within a few miles of me
well i live outside of dallas
and it's kind of in a little suburb
so i feel pretty safe out here
but i know the murder rate is going up every year in dallas
and that worries me
and when i was looking for a job there was a lot of openings right in the in the worst areas of town
and uh my husband was was
what he his concerns were
well not that i think you'll get involved in anything but it just be an innocent bystander just to be in that location
and i thought how sad it was that
and and a lot of kids you know are caught that way
there's a little boy just got shot and killed like last weekend down in what they call the projects which is you know sort of a bad area
but he was just out riding his big wheel
and a couple of drug people got into a fight with a gun
and he got hit and killed by a stray bullet
that ex- exactly what happened down here
so you know it must be frus- frustrating for the parents who can't get out of a situation like that
and it doesn't seem like anything is working
i think that uh i think the laws have gotten so lenient you know
but in in on the other hand they have to be because the jails are full
we can't at least in this area you know they don't have any room to put anybody
so a lot of people just get out you know back on the streets because there's no they can't keep that many people in the buildings they have
but i say you know they commit crimes let them be overcrowded
they have all sorts of of rights that you know are questionable
you know the other thing that worries about it is kids that are doing such bad crimes so young you know like eleven and twelve and thirteen year olds that just go out and kill people
but that worries me
ex- ex- exactly
because they get involved in things so young that they don't really
and uh some people prey on that you know
they'll take uh kids who don't really realize the seriousness even at fifteen
well i don't know
i was watching on a movie on t v
but you know they one guy got all sorts of kids under eighteen to do it by telling them you know you won't have a record because you're under eighteen
so i guess if they had
but the courts are so backlogged right now it takes forever just to go to trial
seems like if they had imme- more immediate uh consequences to their actions it would sink in faster
because it seems like now even in the country you hear about bad things happening
like everybody thinks of them only in l a and new york
but they spread out to cover more area
and i don't know if if gangs occur much down in texas do they
and they've had some drive-by shootings outside of the schools
but i've never had any personal you know i never met anybody that i knew had anything to do
but uh that's a scary thing too
seemed like like in the fifties when gangs were big
but now they're so much into selling drugs and weapons and all that
and the weapons my god the weapons that people have are
some people are mor- seemed to be armed better than the military or the same as the military
that's the other thing uh
especially if you're an inner city you know you can't really feel like you're putting much of a dent in what's going on
and you're putting your life on your on the line everyday
dallas they were saying in dallas that they can't hire anymore policemen
and that uh
and they keep leaving
i just read an article yesterday um where this what used to be a nice town in this area they had a lot of budget cutbacks
and a lot of the towns are declaring bankruptcy
and the crime wave rate went up almost instantly because it was so well publicized that everybody in the area knew that town wouldn't be patrolled as well
they figure what a heyday huh
well there's someone at the door
so i guess i'll have to
but it was nice talking to you
oh that's where we go home too
we live up up uh lake in the broadmoor area that's where my fam- my in-laws are
oh we've been there
and it was twenty-seven below
so we had to cancel our ski lessons
oh just this year
it doesn't doesn't pay
so that wouldn't be a good spot to go on a vacation now if you were a skier
well you know well now i don't know
and uh so it's it might not be too bad if you want to go skiing somewhere else
but you can't can't ski up there any more
oh i'd like to go on vacation
i c- my husband and i want to go to florida to go to disney world
but we have two little ones that are under two right now
so we want to wait until they're a little bit older to do that
well we went on a family cruise last year on the premier family cruise line
and then we went to disney
and on the cruise ship they had mickey and minnie and chip and dale and goofy and donald duck
and it was really oriented toward little kids
well how fun
so the kids could eat with chip and dale you know
and you know it was just a lot of fun
oh i bet
so then we were on the cruise for three days in the bahamas
and then landed at cape canaveral and then drove over to orlando and spent four days at disney
well that sounds pretty yeah that sounds pretty good
and it was all a big package deal where you just pay one price and get everything
and kids are really cheaper too
so they said we could either cancel reschedule or take whatever was available
so we took whatever was available
and we left a day early
and they put us up at the cocoa beach hilton
and the ship that was available the only uh rooms that hadn't been booked were the suites
so we got the suites at the same price as a regular cabin
oh what a deal
so then our cruise was actually extended a day
and our disney was extended a day
so we turned a seven day trip into ten and they paid for everything
well that's great
so that was a wonderful vacation
well what kind of things do you like
oh well we like to ski of course
so we spend so much time with our families uh and seeing our friends
because we moved to texas about two years ago so when we go back we are just jam packed full of people to see and things to do so we don't we don't get a lot of time to just vacation
we did um last year though go to san antonio for memorial day which was fun just to get to kind of walk around and see the sights down there and do that kind of thing
oh with the santa claus on the cover
but we will probably be going up at thanksgiving this year
oh do you live where do you
oh you're in texas
uh so that's not too far
so i guess they get people from all over
well it was when we left last year
we left on the eighteenth right before that big snow storm hit colorado and we pulled in just as it hit
so how do you go
well wait a minute
that's on like route two eighty-seven or something like that
and then we go straight up through trinidad and straight up i twenty-five from there
we uh went a different way when we went last christmas because of bad weather and because we were pulling a little u haul trailer
so we went all interstate
we went up um through oklahoma city and then up through uh kansas and then turned left and went in on i seventy and it wound up only taking us about an extra hour
it was a little more mile wise but because you could go sixty-five miles an hour on the
it's more uh concentrated so they know where you are
uh anyway i know here in here in plano some of the things that we do are um kroger
and some of the other stores too have said if you bring your bags back to to the store to recycle then they'll pay you a certain amount of money
and that's one thing that started in the community
um um brookshires up in uh allen uh you bring your bags back you know they uh the plastic bags back or the paper bags you put them in the receptacles there
but i didn't realize some people are actually paying you for that um
and i think albertson's does it sometimes
um and and yet i know that uh some of the stores will actually help the community not pay you the money back but will pay the the uh community like through the schools or things like that
so um that's always helpful
and i know that we ha- we have the the can the can different can banks around the city that you can go to and do that
um one of the ways
i don't know uh if this would be helpful
it said on the the computer what do i think would be helpful
and i don't know if it would be helpful or not
but i know on monday the the garbage men pick up like just um any limbs or any extra trash that you might have
and that might be an extra day to put out things that might be recycled if we had a a certain colored can to put them in or something in the city to put like either glass or newspapers or whatever
um they have to it's a little bit more difficult because people have to remember okay today's glass okay tomorrow's plastic and all that but i think that's the way we need to go
it's uh it's pretty bad
been especially in this country all the uh the plastic and the paper and everything we just used to throw out
uh i know getting a newspaper everyday i know i could just you know do that because i have to pick it up
and it just goes out with our trash
and i guess i'm not as um recycling minded as i should be
but that goes out with the trash
and it really could be recycled
and uh so what i do is uh
but uh it you'll be amazed if you ever start doing it
and it'll start stacking up
take your glass um you know pickle jars or or whatever uh liquid jars you know
and put them all in a place
and uh plastics
don't you have to take like labels off of those jars
from what i understand uh you can leave the labels on um although i rip rip them off
i don't i don't scrub them or anything
but uh put all the glass in one place and plastics like milk jugs uh orange juice jugs things like that
um and then of course uh cans coke cans whatever
but uh i haven't been down to the recycling center yet to find out exactly what they need or what they take and all that
and i'm keeping these big piles of it right now
but uh you'd be amazed how quickly it all stacks up
i i know with our family that we could really be helpful if we could find a way to just um get it into different categories like that
and i i don't know what it would take to to get my children to start working on it
i have two older ones that probably would go along with the if i had it arranged so that it wasn't a big project you know
it's yeah it's not a big deal
let me tell you one interesting thing when i went back to the store and i said hey um i understand you all are taking these bags back uh you know what do you do with them
and they told me they look through them all and throw out the ones that don't belong there and then you know go and recycle the rest
and i said what do you mean the ones that don't belong there
and they said well people come in and put anything in the receptacles
and what i found out is if you look at the bottom of those bags kroger or whatever the plastic ones they've got numbers on them
and if it's got the little recycle symbol and inside it it's got a number like bags from drug emporium have a
well i'm my name's gail
and i guess we have to
well if you're ready then uh
well i'm not
i just find it so easy to to charge something when i don't have the money to pay for it
and i'm really trying to get out of that habit
so i think they're kind of dangerous
and unfortunately um we use ours in we don't use them all the time
but we use them like at christmas time
and then it seems like it takes all year to pay them off when you use them like that
but um i would love to just take some scissors and cut them in half
i think sometimes when you look at the interest that you're paying on them um that's what gets to be the really scary part you know if you think when it comes around to income tax time and you look at how much money you paid out just in interest all year
seems just like our society is so um pushes so hard for you can have it you know and then no interest no payments for a year and stuff like this
like um we have a sears one
and we always get a maintenance agreement every year and it's just easier to say you know just put that on my credit card
well that's probably four or five hundred dollars you know that goes on at that point and then it seems like takes forever to pay that off
i mean i i think like half the amount that they cost in the first place
it's just uh you know you never never get it out
and now that's real irritating
one time we just borrowed took a personal loan and paid off all our credit cards
and the interest on the loan was cheaper than it was you know to just have that
well we did you know
one time we wanted to buy a truck a used truck
and so we went down to the bank
and they said sure we'll give you a personal loan
and they said sure that's no problem but you know why don't we consolidate your bills
and at the time we thought oh that would be great you know we could
and it's going to be a lower payment than it was for all of them
you never miss one or whatever and we did that
but we didn't realize at the time until several months later that we we were real
i mean this was four yea- three years ago
and we were just kind of like
well i guess that means these credit cards are closed
and we didn't you know
and so we charged them all up again
so then we were not only paying those bills regular like we were before but also adding the lower payment for all of them
so we were paying like twice
um so we didn't ever make that mistake again luckily
but uh we're definitely working on not doing that credit thing
as a matter of fact this it's real interesting the subjects i get
but we just discussed this last night at church talking about debt and things like that
it's so so alluring and uh so easy to get
and uh if you could stick to that you know we'd get rid of a lot of indigestion
oh i just picked up my daughter
and she was eating a cupcake and now her crumbs all over
oh so i don't know if i if i i just feel kind of
and i just thought you know if we ever had something go wrong with our refrigerator or something you know and we had to had to buy one then we would really need that
and so he said okay we'll keep it
and then we weren't smart enough to not use it
you know one thing you might do with in a situation like that though it's just like keep
so you're into microwave cooking
it's just it's so easy nowadays you know
and it's uh especially when people are working just to come home and pop something into the microwave
and it be ready in just a few minutes
and that's what we all are looking for isn't it
well we've done that too
and he he sometimes makes a huge spot o- uh pot of spaghetti and you know we're eating it for a week and a half
and i kind of get sick of it after he
it's just my husband and i too and i try not to make so much that it lasts more than that week
um i have a great recipe for sour cream chicken enchiladas it's it's really good
i got it from a friend of mine that i used to work with and uh every time i've served it everybody just loves it
so that's that's one of my favorite things to make
we- i end up with an old stand-by that we call russian chicken because it's so easy and uh it go-
and that's about it you know
well what do you put in it
uh you make you just take your boneless chicken breasts
and then you take and make a a dressing out of uh russian dressing one bottle of that and a package of lipton onion soup mix and three ounces of apricot preserves and you mix it up
and you just put it on the top of the chicken
and then i cover the pan with foil and put it in the oven for about an hour and then i take the foil off and let it brown takes about another twenty minutes and it's delicious and it's so simple because i can pop it in when i come in the door you know and then uh go about my business
and by the time i've got everything else ready the chicken's re- chicken's done
so that's a real easy thing for me
i've got a um a great recipe for cheese cake
but they have one
every recipe i've tried out of that has been a really good one and um you know every month they've got all different kinds of recipes
and it's just a regular cheese cake
and then you can put raspberry uh topping on it but inside the cheese cake uh recipe you put um lemon peel and orange peel and it's just enough to taste it you know when when when you're eating the cheese cake
and it is wonderful
oh my goodness
but it takes a long time because you have to cook it for forty-five minutes and then you turn the oven off and you leave it in the oven for another forty-five minutes and then you open up the oven door and leave it in for another
but it's it's very good
well i love cheese cake
i have made i have not done that well with
i like a baked cheese cake you know
i have had a recipe that someone has given me that it's kind of like you just mix cream cheese and stuff and refrigerate it you know
but that's not the same as a a new york style cheese cake
and uh the recipes that i've used
everybody will say oh this is real simple
and then i make it
and it's it's really not very good but yours sounds good
and it it it is really good
um well that sounds interesting
so there's your good dessert for your dinner party
but i mean i'm not a wine connoisseur by any means
i've been to you know some wine tastings up in napa valley but um you know and i learned a little bit about them then
but you know what would be fun they have some of those classes you can take yeah
and then there's places um
there's places here that um offer
i think it's like once a month
you can go and to a particular restaurant or whatever
and you can kind of take a cooking class and then you get to eat everything afterwards
well how neat
and then they also go into the wines you know to serve with you know different types of of meals and that kind of thing
and it sounds like it's a lot of fun
we have some friends who've done that
and they've really enjoyed it
um well i didn't even know they were offering that
this place is called like medina's or messina's kitchen or something like that
oh well i bet that would be a fun thing to do
it it sounds like like it
my kids are are both in college um
and i'd i played a fairly active part in helping them decide where to go
um what what kind of experience did you have
well i uh
one girl went in in state and has graduated
and then uh that was uh you know that was her choice pretty much where she wanted to go and i have uh one out of two out of state both in missouri
and um i teach uh in a college
and so i they had heard me talk about it and for years that i didn't think it really made too much difference where they went for their undergraduate
uh so that was pretty much uh
well i may maybe i'm wrong
oh oh if they if they're content there
but i think it makes a big difference in terms of finding a school that is sort of right for the child in terms of his or her happiness and and and the appropriate support environment and things like that
i mean as far as the education as far as looking at the degree at the end that uh it's very little difference is paid to it where you get that bachelor's
uh if it's a halfway decent school they should be happy naturally
and if they can get uh um two out of
let's see my son got a full total scholarships and so there's uh there's plenty of scholarships out there
and so people should be advised to look for those
did did you play a a strong role in helping them pick schools
or did you just sort of say listen to your guidance counselors
well they uh
i went we went around
my son was a graduated from a jesuit high school and so he he was pretty much looking for a jesuit university
and so there you know
and um so he's in saint louis u
and i guess i played a role in that
i i just sort of uh let them um you know
they'd all been uh pretty efficient as far as studies
and uh so i didn't have that much to do
they just uh they just knew they wanted to go to college
and i you know helped them get there as far as traveling with them to look at different places
and i would suggest a person always goes and looks at the school before they sign up
i mean that
and then they get there and hate it or whatever
so if it's possible
it's it seemed expensive at the time you're doing it but but the compared to the the total decision it's nothing
in the long run it's very uh reasonable if the person
my daughter has been in in missouri for a second year
so that's you know strictly up to her
and uh she'll finish down here uh uh finish this year down here and then decide what she's going to do next year
it'll save me a lot of money because i'm not going to have to pay out of state tuition but again that's her decision so uh but i have so many students in my classes that have dropped out and come back
and they're much better students at twenty-five twenty-six may twenty-eight
so you know i don't i never have pushed them
i just say that education is important you should do it uh
but uh they have to do the work so uh
well back back to this visiting thing
oh i think so
i mean i found that my kids had no conception what college was really like and and that the process of going around to a few schools with them really helped them understand and being able to go with them to so- at least some of them gave me a chance to explain things to them and to uh in reference to what we had seen
and also i'm opposed to the to the size
and so my daughter first looked at a place that was forty thousand
and that was twenty-five hundred when i went there
it's southwest missouri state university and uh it was twenty-five hundred when i went there forty years ago
and uh my son's in a school about seven thousand
and that's that's not bad i teach in a school about eight thousand
and that's that's even a little large but it's much better than twenty-one thousand
but they do have to visit and if if the parent can point out all the different places to look for for scholarships
and then oh those rating uh
but probably fine just to compare
if they you know uh they need to
i like just about any kind except country and western
that's the same with me same with me
it's it's course country
and western even i've gotten a little bit used to because it's not like it used to be
like clint black he's pretty good
and who's the other big guy
well in oklahoma we say garth brooks
that's yeah that's the other guy i was thinking of was garth brooks
and kenny rogers he's kind of country western verge you know on the verge of country western
of course garth brooks lives about uh you know
his his home town is about uh fifteen minutes away so he is he's a home boy
well then of course you like him
but well i have teen age children
and so you know i'm hear the the rock music not the hard rock but the you know michael bolton type stuff
my son is uh twenty-eight
so but he he's real unusual in that uh
oh that's good
he likes jazz and uh blues and and course the rock i i can't say he's real crazy about elevator music as he calls it
i i don't i don't actually we don't listen to any elevator music at my house
but i've got teenagers
well my teenagers are all gone
i actually when i'm home alone which isn't too often but uh our public radio station has wonderful classical music
it's just very wonderful soothing and you know uh lot of symphonies
and i just i love that
you know uh i i teach and we can have music in the classroom
but it you know it can't be the rock or anything like that and i i find that the classical music is very good for the kids too it doesn't disturb them and yet it's it's it stimulates them
and and uh
well it's ninth nine through twelve and
well it's uh business technology
i was just sitting here while she was trying to find a a another caller uh
my my husband and i are taking a computer class at our junior college
but uh oh boy
but we're learning a lot
and we have a home computer
so it's it's very interesting
uh back to i guess we'd better get back to music though
i play i play piano
and right now my nine year old is taking piano
and i just got a whole mess of music
i i play the volunteer to play the piano at the children's christmas program for the whole grade school which is k through six five hundred kids
and and um i i just sub at the school
so i just sub at the school
and that's kind of my volunteer thing
so that it it's really neat
and my older daughter plays the saxophone
and my third son just started baritone this year
and my little girl will start french horn next year
oh well my son played the sax and drums my daughter the piano organ and french horn
and so i'm pushing that on my daughter because i want to play in our city band not the symphony with just the city band once we get the the french horn
and i get a little bit more time
i do i do i love it
but we have a a marvelous band instructor
and and he's just he's wonderful
we have uh couple of hundred kids in the band
oh that's a
and then he has a jazz band that my older daughter was in
and my son will be in next year
i mean they ca- play college level music in junior high
and the kids just love him
oh that's wonderful
so it's really good
oh do you
i i have totally totally a tin ear and i love music
but i you know and i love to listen to it love to sing and i my kids when i was little and they were little
and i was rocking them singing to them
oh i guess uh this is a a topic near and dear to my heart
since i am a am a healthy eater
there really isn't any kind of particular food that i i don't don't like really
and i like a good italian restaurant or a good uh uh
especially like good prime rib so if it's uh nice to get out and find a good restaurant like that
and i live here in uh rome new york
and there are a lot of good restaurants around here
oh you're in new york
it's called lawry's like lawry's seasoning salt and it is absolutely wonderful
and uh we were there a few months ago
and it i mean it's kind of pricey
well from new york it probably doesn't matter
and it's actually very inexpensive
oh is it okay
there's a there's a place um half a mile from me here that uh has uh fantastic prime rib for oh eleven dollars for a whole meal you know a potato and salad and soup and the whole whole nine yards
well i think the cheapest there probably starts at eighteen
and it includes you know salad and rolls and oh some other stuff
but it is absolutely wonderful
uh i was going to this place up the street from me is the best i've ever had
i'll have to go there when i get to get to dallas
well we like uh lots of people down here like mexican food so um that's
i i think italian and mexican food are probably my favorites
but um i'm not into sushi or any of that kind of stuff
i'm not into the the don't do the the raw raw fish like that
but i do like uh like a seafood bar like a raw raw bar like oysters and things like that uh that they uh
i'm an officer in the air force and travel quite a bit on business so i uh find myself down in melbourne florida about once once a month once every two months or so and uh go and hit the the oyster bars down there quite a bit but i love that
oh yeah fresh seafood down there
and um and uh maryland's great
you get the crabs it's like i can't go anywhere where i
seafood seems to be a lit- a little bit more expensive than than other types of food
but it sure is good
and it's supposed to be good for you
well uh it's really strange that that that seafood is so expensive because when you in reality uh uh i say that uh the oceans have the greatest re- resource of food on the planet
and yet we haven't as human beings haven't figured out a way to harvest it economically
but not uh not seafood
i like uh i make a a wicked chili
and around here the big spicy thing is like uh buffalo wings and so uh it people they you know
and those are really hot and the hotter the better
well we uh we like spicy food down here especially uh the hot sauce picante sauce or salsa whatever you all call it and uh we we sure go through a lot of that
but i like it hot
but i don't like it real hot because then my nose starts running
my generally my my scalp will start
but uh i don't know
well there isn't isn't too much in the way of restaurants that i don't like
things that are kind of oddball like uh thai cuisine
that'll that'll literally blow your head off
and uh and i can handle just about any kind of food without uh um
well but that that stuff is goes one notch beyond uh
so although i guess on this topic are to talk about the uh service in a restaurant is always nice though too that's one thing
and the price and the price
well i find that lately that so many people are working you know working waitressing jobs or waiter
um i haven't given this a a lot of thought
i'm uh that that's a whole pleased with the pr- practice that is they
i uh i don't
you would favor invasions of privacy on the other hand that's arguable but that that uh people who's jobs are critical to public safety should have to meet special standards
uh i haven't given this matter enough thought
oh all right
well see we have the testing already here
we've had it for oh about five years
and now it's for all employees
they uh randomly select employee numbers
and uh the day that they select you is when you have to go and and be tested
and how do people feel about it
so we're familiar with it
oh we have a lot of um people upset about it at the beginning some not all
but what was happening at t i is that they found certain parts of the company there was a lot of drug abuse um
and what they ended up doing is uh kind of like doing a little bit of an undercover agent to watch what was happening
and we had people using on the premises and actually selling and dealing you know on the premises
that's that's a very different issue
it was you know combination of of uh both activities and uh and using too
so they developed this uh drug policy so that uh to eliminate
there's some parts of the company that we do uh government contracts
and i think some of those require the drug testing
but now t i thought well we'll just do it for all employees that um not just because of safety issues but because we want a totally drug free safe environment for all people to work in
and that we shouldn't have um people on drugs within our you know offices and such
but i don't have a problem with it
um does the testing cover alcohol as well as illegal drugs
but one thing that to to me was um going on stretching it a little too far was that they also check um if you are taking somebody else's prescription drug
you know it happens a lot of times
and you know then they give it to everybody else in the family and don't always go back to the you know doctor and get another prescription
well according to what they do at t i if you take a prescription drug it has to be in your name
it you know it can't be in your spouse's name
so they will look i mean the testing will look for i guess any kind of drugs
and you have to tell them what they are taking a prescription for
so they ask you to declare beforehand what prescription drugs you are taking
when you get tested you are supposed to tell them you know everything that that might be there
and then if they ever um question you or something you may have to show proof that you do have a prescription in your name
well it i mean it's i guess that in fact they don't test for for they don't routinely test for very many prescription drugs
but that i but they don't say in advance uh
well what they wo- be testing for are the ones that would have like you know barbiturates or codeine things like that in them
i guess that's what i- they wouldn't be looking for penicillin and an- antibiotics and stuff
they would be looking for the yeah controlled things barbiturates amphetamines
so what they are asking you to tell them is all the prescription drugs you are taking which are controlled substances
you pretty much you know put down what you remember even if it was just contact or something like that
but afterwards uh maybe if you had a controlled substance
you you probably put down you know you had drixoral or contact if you would remember that you did it
just saying you probably pro- put down on the sheet anything you have taken
but if they had a controlled substance maybe they would ask you then to show that you had that prescription in your name
and they test them too even if you are not a real uh t i
and he had taken some kind of um
and he took his mother's
well i was just trying to think
um i love watching some of the uh new new shows basically
and we uh to- we subscribe to c n n
and we took that
and we started watching a lot of those especially during the war or during anything kind of thing like the earthquake
and i have gotten stuck on a lot of this
the new shows and the stuff that comes on that that it you know
like the uh at night the discussion talk shows and things
and we really haven't gotten a lot into the sitcoms that are current uh especially with the kids here because we have to kind of filter it before they get here
uh we do let them watch nine one one
and we think that's kind of informative to teach them
but not a lot of
i mean i'll watch you know maybe a little while when i first get home in the evening
and i usually watch you know the news
and then i'll watch that hard copy or or that kind of thing you know
and i like the nine one one
that kind that's the kind i like really more than
my husband is really crazy about evening shade that comes on on monday evening
and i've got to where every monday i rush around so i could sit and watch that with him because it's really funny
and also uh i meant to be trying to pick up on murphy brown
well his favorite night is monday night
so we've got to where we will sit
because that and then that uh oh
like i say i'm not
and the one with the the sergeant that married the woman with the kids sergeant mcgillis
huh i don't even know
sergeant uh ma- major dad
that comes on right after uh the evening shade and then murphy brown
so we always he watches that
and i kind of s- i watch the first one then kind of sit in on the others
well you know on friday nights especially we like to watch twenty twenty
but uh we used to like knots landing a lot
oh excuse me just a minute
well you can't hardly watch knots landing with the little kids around though
oh i know
well they are
but we have just gotten any more that where we just keep it off
um but i was to say on saturdays there is absolutely nothing
and that's the day my husband
well do you know
and that's sisters
but i saw that advertised today
and it sounds like it's not fluff
it's really you know it's really pretty good
i mean it's kind of like you know um soap opera i guess
but it's a
so far it i've watched it about three times now
and it's really held my attention
well and a- and another one now that it's getting darker
and you are wanting to cocoon more
but i haven't
well they said that one and i'll fly away are really quality you know
i think what i need to do is kind of read to see what is on these days because by the time we get the kids in bed at eight o'clock and then i get my bath it's you know it's almost too late to start
and i'm tired
and i sit and watch for a few minutes
so i have to get up and do dinner
and then we've gotten to where we rent videos for weekend nights
well we do too
but there are some good shows on
i i really probably should watch more of them than i do
but i like
i i'm always in to making things
and and i don't just spend all my time
there's a lot more to do with with your time when you get into it
and i my husband now he sits and watches t v constantly
well my my sister and them and her husband do on weekends
and they just turn it on when they walk in
so they are used to that too
i could be around here for hours by myself and never have it on
but uh but there are some really good new shows that i have enjoyed
and i'll have to watch that i'll fly away this week
and then of course in the afternoons if i get in from work in time i watch oprah some of those
you know talk shows
well it's it's nice talking to you
but it's nice talking with you
well it's nice talking with you
uh i guess it's uh
watching the ra- the t v today there had a lot of stuff on on uh crime
in our state right now uh recently they've had a lot of uh uh the rapists uh murder type uh killers going around
and well i i
and they they're in there
wasn't it your state that had the uh guy that committed all those murders
there was that uh
wisconsin uh and milwaukee area you know
well i i live right on the border of minnesota and wisconsin
so i kind of get both both news
and i know in minnesota uh they had uh the one that just uh got out and went after a uh college student and raped
and they are not too happy about that now
well i can imagine
i i don't know
but it seems like you sure hear a maybe you just hear a lot more about them on the news
uh that's hard to say for sure
i uh sometimes i wonder if these people aren't don't it just for the publicity
they they get their names in the in the paper
and they become big celebrities
i i wish there was some way that we could change the news media so they didn't feature these way out stories
well uh i know one thin- i i think texas has the death penalty right
see i i no- i-
well it's it's it's not going to prevent any people from doing it
and there are a lot of repeaters uh
i guess that's another thing that to me is a a real problem
and i know we have got so many people in our prison system now at least here in texas i mean they are really in a crisis
and a lot of them they put out on parole
and then some of the ones that they put out early you know do repeat offenses
well some i'm just wondering a lot of times they will put uh people lesser crimes in uh with uh people that did more severe crimes
than they maybe they just tend to learn from these people
and they and when they get back out they just go into worse crimes
maybe they should try and separate them a little bit more uh
i think the whole parole thing you know if somebody is convicted of second-degree murder or something gets fifteen years well they are out in six or seven you know outbound on the streets again
and to me that's really scary
some of these crimes that they commit you know seems like the punishment is not really equal to the crime
well uh i don't know with with my limited
if you want to stop the crime i think you've got to get uh the people when they are kids
a lot of this probably just starts with from the from the homes also from the the the media the t v the uh
all these uh gory movies on there becomes uh just a natural fact of life
you know i
well a lot of the european countries uh they tend to sensor
well they probably won't sensor so much the sexual stuff as much as the violent
and they have a lot less crime
some of some of those european countries are are you can leave your your uh doors open and and and be safe
uh even uh i think new zealand is one of one of the places uh that
have you established what kind of requirements you are looking for for your next vehicle
uh i guess i look at uh getting the best deal
uh that's my main objectives normally whoever is willing to deal and and give me a good price
well i i tend to be more methodical i guess
uh i determine first of all what i'm going to use the vehicle for whether it's going to be primarily as a family mover or as a a personal mover uh where it's going to be driven you know what types of uh driving i'm going to be doing on it primarily highway or or local mileage more often
and uh hanging in the back of my mind is always the knowledge that i tend to drive cars for about ten years and a hundred fifty to two hundred thousand miles
so i'm i'm real picky
i- if you are going to keep something that long
i don't know i've had pretty good luck you know
even if if you take any car and and you care for it well enough uh you are going to get some good life out of it
uh my my oldsmobile right now that i have uh is getting near eighty thousand
and it's still in pretty good shape
uh there was a flaw in there where a where a head gasket bolt broke
and it cost me some bucks to to fix that
but that was you know something that was unforeseen
but i still think i c- i'm going to get probably a hundred fifty thousand or more out of it
well it sounds like you tend to drive your cars quite a ways also then
well i i drive like the song says the little old lady but uh but not from pasadena
i i baby them as much as i possibly can
uh it's a pretty big expense nowadays
uh and i guess i like to take care of it uh
so i don't have to buy one too often
uh do you have more than than one vehicle in your fleet
uh do you have a family fleet
i i i got an old uh seventy-six uh grand fury that uh doesn't want to die on me
so i i just keep running the thing don't want to sell it or get rid of it until it quits
but it just doesn't seem to want to
i'll probably have uh three four hundred thousand before it wants to die
well that may be
they chrysler made some really good old engines back then
like the the three eighteen was particularly an exceptionally good engine
oh i've got the big three sixty in there gas guzzler
but it runs good
at the moment i've got uh cadillac cimarron which is approaching its tenth year of age and a uh reasonably new plymouth voyager
it's only a a couple of years old
but that's the second one of of those that we've had
and that's the the family travel vehicle
you know not only does it do all the the uh carpooling around during the week
but it's also the vacation vehicle that we all drive in
i think that what i'm getting ready to get next is probably a suburban unless they drastically change the the vehicle a lot
uh i'm just getting tired of when i do get hung up in traffic not being able to determine what the problem is and and come to some resolution of whether it's better to sit in the traffic light and wait or get off at the next exit and that kind of stuff
just because i can't see you know
i'm to my cimarron is just so small and so low to the ground that i can't see past any vehicle
well i'm considering probably some kind of a pickup truck myself for the next vehicle
uh i just have so many hauling projects a lot of times
and uh i i'd like to just start doing some uh carpentry uh type work around
so so what have you seen lately that um you think is worthwhile
um the last movie i saw was regardin- regarding henry
i i saw the previews
um it's um
does does he does it have a happy ending
really good ending um uh it was the it's one of the best movies i've seen in a long time
but i saw that one
and then before that one i saw um oh naked gun two and a half
oh that was funny wasn't it
did you have you seen that one
and and and and the regular naked gun and airport and you know
but it was silly
so now these are for two very different movies
one one uh absolutely slapstick comedy and one clearly you know serious subject
i i guess i have similarly broad tastes
um my most recent um movie that i that i liked a lot not my most recent movie was henry the fifth
i only rented it you know maybe a month ago and it's been out for a couple of years
but have you seen that
well it's it's a it's an adaptation of the of the shakespeare play
and it's beautifully done
um i believe that all the language is as shakespeare wrote it except it's been shortened a little bit
and there might be a word or two changed
uh but it's it's it's a glorious movie um and i like as you know these these these sil- silly movies
and i also like just some strange movies
well the the one that comes immediately to mind i um is the the cook the thief his wife her lover
um but there are also these various um david lynch movies
um i got i got hooked on twin peaks
um well i don't i don't especially recommend
i mean you have you have to just sort of like this thing
so if you weren't if you weren't drawn to watch that you maybe you wouldn't be drawn to these movies either
they're they're just strange
uh and but but a little bit strange and esoteric
and uh in the case of twin peak a little there's some elements of the supernatural in it too
um there's also a a a producer of movies in baltimore called um john walters who who puts puts on even weirder movies
uh his most recent ones have actually been fairly mainstream like hair spray
um but back in his early days he he he had things um um
what what are the titles
i can't remember the titles any more but some really weird ones uh with quite a random crew of of characters
um it would have made you know these fellini movies look normal
so do you like um movies a lot
see i don't do
i do i do like movies a lot
see i don't do that
but just recently i've been to a couple
do do you rent them
we i just go to like the dollar movie theater around here generally
but i don't know
i just i usually fall asleep
or i get bored pretty easily
that's what my wife does too um
i mean she falls asleep
so we have to we have to pick just the right kind of movie to to to to appeal
well well it was good talking to you
uh what is the topic
and what kind of decision you'd do you think about getting you know pick that car out and uh and why
uh my next car to buy probably would be a cadillac
i've had uh
well i'm on my third one
and i'm not real sure that i'd be in the market for a car for quite a while
i was uh i had two cadillacs
and uh my grandfather worked for ford motor company
so he always said why don't you drive a ford or why don't you try a lincoln so i finally tried one after fifty years
and uh i've had i guess i guess four cadillacs and and one suburban in my last five cars
but i bought a lincoln
and i like it
my dad has been a a uh
but i've always been a g m man
oh are you
and uh the last cadillac i bought was an allante
and i just love it to death
well i'm a i'm a traveling salesman
so i like a little heavier car
so that's why i choose you know to drive a heavier car and more luxury car
but i tell you what
but there's just something about that cadillac that whether it's a g m c product or whatever
they seem to put they seem to be put together a little bit better
and you know the buttons on the controls and things like that are a little easier to get to than ford products
and i think that's one of the things that makes me shy away from uh imports is they put so much you know gadgetry on the dash
and and the the buttons are so small to push
and g m doesn't seem to do that
you know i'm a funny duck
that came it comes to the simple things like front end alignments i have never had to have a front end alignment on a cadillac
i don't know why why whether i just seem to drive them better or what
but i've never had to have a front end alignment on a cadillac
i've uh i had an eldorado was my first one was an eighty and uh i think at about sixty thousand miles i finally had it lined up
and i had them do all four wheels
and the only thing i miss about a cadillac is
and i traded it in traded it in on my lincoln
and they're just not as large as before
but what is big today
well you're right
you know lincoln is still as big as it always has been
but the trunk space for me uh
and that's where i put my samples because trunks just aren't big enough
now i have the town car
and it's it's a deep trunk but not as broad as the uh the cadillac
well the town car i noticed uh
or with the with the continental uh i was rented one one time uh we could uh put golf clubs in them
you know straight across
well that's good
and we got three full sets in there and still had room for luggage
i sell sporting goods uh hunting related items
i sell guns gun cases and things like that and i need to you know
they need to samples need to stretch out and gun cases and things like that
uh it's not as peppy as a as a town car because it's a v six
but it uh
i too- i drove it from here to memphis
and i really enjoyed driving that car
i drove mine a couple weeks ago to our one of our big national sales meetings in nashville
and it it handled real well
but my main thing is space
so if a continental
they they had a a lot more trunk space
as a matter of fact they had more trunk space than my uh sedan de ville had
uh all three of mine have had leather interiors
uh i had a eighty eldorado which was leather
and uh then my eighty-six was a touring sedan
and uh it had the gray leather package in it
and my allante has uh i guess saddle saddle colored type thing
and i'll i will say one thing about cadillacs versus
uh so my favorite team is about the rangers
you know i really don't
i just don't think you know with that guy from pittsburgh getting all that money twenty-seven or
and it's just going to be a shame for you know our area
i think it's going to have a big effect if they don't on the other uh hispanic players
oh i do too
it's just going to effect on the the team you know
we just can't seem to you know
i i'm i haven't been to a baseball game in a couple of years
it's just it's just too disappointing
and uh i liked him
but of course i understand baseball decisions are all just
so and that's the name of the game too
you know pay these players so much money
now it's just it's frightening
you and i should be so lucky to you know to go out and swing a bat and get two thousand dollars every time you swing the bat
but uh they were talking about trading him if they're not able to sign him and uh use the money that it would take to sign the guy you know to pay for pitchers or you know what it what it what they what else they need
because they've got the hitting
but they need the pitching
i think they uh i think they need them all
i just don't under- i understand the big cities like in new york or l a or somewhere because big cities
oh i know
and you know a guy a pro athlete can go out there in the afternoon and probably make five thousand dollars just by doing a personal appearance at a at a men's clothing store or something or sporting goods store
but i realize the difference
but i just don't understand
it's sure aggravating when you go out and bust your butt working you know your day job and you can work your day job the rest of your life and not bring home as much money as they bring home in one game
oh i know
but one thing i don't understand is why a group you know headed up by george bush would buy the texas rangers and not really get behind them
because i tell you we need a winner in this town
but so that's that's going to be a big help to dallas
but you know in the past half a
it's always it's always wondered me why i mean they act as though this area is not you know a big metropolitan area
but you think we'd someday get an owner in here that could afford to buy the
oh i know
because i've lived here you know since well i was born and raised here
so i've been a ranger fan since about seventy-seven
so it's a lot of losers
oh i know
it's about to get you know as bad as the cubs or whoever you know
i've been i've lived here since seventy-four
and i've really been a ranger fan for the longest time
i mean i follow them
and i follow them like i follow the mavericks and like i follow the cowboys
but and i want to see them win because you know damn it they the fans deserve it
i mean it
you know we have pretty uh great fans put two million people in that stadium
i think this town would go crazy if they ever got a even a playoff team
t- i mean
oh i do too
and they got that new stadium they are building
so at least at least that will be exciting
well where do you think they are heading this year
it's going to be depending on where the what they do with ruben sierra
and uh i mean i'm getting tired of them going into each year saying you know bobby witt is the answer and kevin brown is the answer
and man that's getting old you know
i mean it's time to to either you know put out or shut up
and they have the later ten game winning streak and they give him all kinds of money
and then he just goes right down the tubes
and valentine and greave they're about to get you know they're about to get old
but i like this sandy johnson
well i hit one and nothing happened
well just go ahead and talk
i'm i'm supposed to find out what you do for your lawn what do i do
well i uh i cut it occasionally
is uh is that good
and i edge it occasionally
oh that's really good
see am i good or what
uh much beyond that i don't do
well i call my lawn man eric whatever his name is i can't remember
oh he is going to build you a fence
well he's giving me an estimate
and for ten dollars a week i don't see any reason for me to be doing it
oh well i thought isn't he the same one
but ten dollars or what d- what does he charge not even that
th- it's ten because i
but if there's five weeks i still pay forty
but you know you ought to get him to g- pull the weeds
well he won't pull weeds
but he won't pull them
uh he won't cut them is what he won't do
because he said with the rocks that it's too dangerous for him to take the the trimmer over the rocks
and he's right
but he just says to keep spraying them so
so that was real
so you haven't you haven't pulled any weeds lately
but i haven't bothered as i walk on by
i started to pull the weeds in the rocks out front and all of a sudden i came cross this big clump of weeds
oh oh goody
and there was dog dirt in it and i threw the gloves in the trash bag that was out there
and i left the whole thing
and that was about a month ago
i thought you were going to say there i thought you were going to say there was a snake
oh god oh
so anyway but
but uh how are your your flowers your little things you planted
oh they're all
so they oh
and then i got some nice uh mums at thanksgiving that i put in the pots out there and i thought they were supposed to live through all the cold weather
so i don't think any of it comes back
but i don't know
i don't know uh
well they're i know they were still blooming up until about a a few weeks ago
well that's good
they they're like indestructible
they they're really pretty
and sometimes they're not supposed to come back
but lots of times they do
i mean isn't it supposed to be five minutes
but that's because we didn't hit one for a long time
boy i hate to think i hate to think i'd be talking to you without getting paid
and we get each other down the street
i g- i talked to someone woman from oklahoma city and some woman from dallas
and that was it
i've had uh one plano and then a lady from brigham utah whose son lives in plano on ranier someplace
and then uh another state
but she told me about the utah jazz
and i don't remember what what the place was last night
but i'm thinking colorado
but i'm not sure
but mostly they're from the area
well there isn't really much to talk about as far as lawn and garden goes
you know not not for me because all i have is rocks and weeds
but i don't you know
i what do i do cut it one you know and and edge it
and that's about it
i i mean i'm all talked out about gardens
well we can talk about something else
oh oh it's just suggested
so how's the baby do you think
we could talk let's talk about the baby
we're we're at the point now
i go- i quit working about six months ago to start this house and i'm out of cash
and i'm not out of project yet
so uh i'm going to go back and do some consulting work
as far as budget's concerned i'm i'm fairly fortunate
uh we've we're right now where if we don't buy anything extra we can make it on what my wife makes
so you know the project's kind of halted until then
but as far as budgeting is concerned you know we have uh some pretty strict guidelines that we go for you know
and that's a never touch
uh into savings
but we don't ever put it in a high risk
well that's pretty good
and as far as the rest of it's concerned we don't have any kind of uh what i would call extravagant expenses you know
we uh we pretty much live on about eight nine hundred a month you know just travel to and from work and clothing and food and the rest of it you know we pile into the house
and uh you know i'm fairly fortunate
i mean our credit cards are out to the max right now because i'm a little behind on that
but uh we're still making the payments on them
see in texas you cannot borrow the money to build your own home and do it yourself
yeah it's it's tough here too
but it's easy to find a contractor for a couple of hundred bucks who'll sign it and let you do it where i live that is
and where i live it it's pretty scary because texas is one of those strange states where if you have a contractor sign on your note like that and you screw up you don't get it finished
oh bad for him huh
but the homeowner can't be touched
see right now if i quit paying any of my bills
you know they can take your car and your clothes and your anything
but as far as uh you know
well that's kind of handy
well you know we're we're not ones to budget much you know
we uh we're l d s
and so we pay ten percent tithing and then you know we put i guess it's like fifteen to twenty percent into a savings account
but that sometimes we use for emergency type things
but uh and my wife doesn't work
we're pretty pretty fortunate as far as the uh the budgeting is concerned because you know we don't have any long term debt
you know uh we paid cash for car
well we bought the car on time one of them
but we you know we since paid it off
well that's pretty
so we don't have to worry about that
well it's fraught with other problems
uh systems consulting computerization for construction firms
i i'm a e d p auditor
an- oh really
i'm just brushing up on well c plus plus
and he had a bunch of computer stuff
and you know i bought it all
well some of it wasn't worth anything you know
you know a lot of the uh diskettes were just totally unusable
but i did get out of there with uh vermont views which is a huge
well i've had them uh where i've served up to twelve to sixteen people
uh and i had help with them
uh and part of them i did were like a buffet and uh it
i had uh just different uh side dishes and appetizers
and one of them that that i'd remembered was uh some uh sausage hors d'oeuvres
and uh anyhow uh you take uh a couple of uh cups of bisquick and uh sausage oh like a a owens mild
you can i guess you could use the hot if you wanted to
whatever you like huh
and uh you put that in
and then you get some real sharp cheddar cheese and put that in and a little bit of milk and make it all doughy
and then like i just put them in little balls and bake them for about fifteen minutes and they are so good
oh that sounds delicious
you know i've made like little swedish meatballs
but they're just made out of the beef you know
and uh with spices and things in them
i i've used that quite a bit
and it and it seems to work real well
and uh uh when i've had so many people uh t- to feed like i try to do a ham and a turkey
that's my that's my parties mostly is at christmas time and thanksgiving time
you know i've uh i had an open house party here once when after we moved in here uh which i had things like that
but i always cooked them ahead of time
and then i just sliced them
you know and had macaroni salad with uh shrimp in it
put some fresh little fresh shrimp
and it's in your macaroni salad that you make
oh i'll bet
i like things that are easy and and uh nutritious
but uh at uh christmas time we just have a regular sit down dinner you know
and then by time you pass everything around
but anyhow i
thank god for microwaves you know
always take your plate and just heat it up you know
but uh other than that i i don't have too many parties
uh you know i have like maybe just a cou- another couple over for dinner
but uh other than than than that i don't have you know a whole bunch of people like except except at christmas
and i have my family
well i don't anymore
y- it's been a few years
and and uh i don't have you know over a couple either
and and uh i try to uh have everything all ready
and and it it just makes it a lot nicer where a don't s- spend all my time in the kitchen
and then uh if you have a nice big roast that you can throw in the oven then you can put your potatoes and carrots or whatever else all in there you know especially if a pork roast
and uh other than that in fact i'm just thinking of what g- next weekend when the super bowl's on i've asked a couple people to come over
and i just uh had been thinking what to have for that
well have you had any good ideas yet
and i you know i don't want to have to come away from the t v
you know so i'll think of something just th- that we can munch on over there you know
and they can just fill their plate up at intermission and then go back over there and sit down
and that's the way to do it too
i think it's you know what's i think is so nice is that
and you don't have to spend hours and hours and hours in the kitchen
and and it makes an awful lot of difference doesn't it
oh it sure does
well when i was brought up you know we didn't
uh go ahead
not with the not with some of the things that i hear that our tax money is going for some ludicrous things
well they did a thing on the thirty-five billion dollars we waste every year just on storing stuff for the military we don't need
and uh it's staggering
well how does this grab you how did this grab you
i i mean i'm i'm a lady
but this i heard this on a christian program
and it was uh about the n e a
and that's the national endowment for arts
and they fund they funded this thing this act on a stage and did a study on it between two lesbians and two homosexuals and wrote a report about that with our money
well there are a lot of things that people i think general
and then it just frosts me terribly
well i think it's interesting to look at uh where the money goes
and it goes a lot of places where it probably ought not go
and and i don't think generally i think what's interesting is that
and how it serves us given the extraordinarily large sum of money the government has to operate with
and that what i think is going to be really interesting is what we do about it
i mean we are going to have to change the people who represent us
i mean and i think it's going to be real interesting to see and and then force upon them uh
right that's y- i think that's the only thing that's going to change it
our anger is going to have to to give rise to to more activity on our part
uh i've i've said for years that there's full employment for the politically active
and in our society uh there's very little full employment
eighty percent of the public according to bill moyers' uh
piece for uh
but this special focused on the fact that eighty percent of the people in this country are are seeing their real incomes
and thus standards of living decline
and twenty percent are seeing theirs improve
and the government really plays a role in this
i mean w- well they are the people whose strings are pulled and by i guess powerful intere-
you know and it's really interesting to see how that affects people because essentially more and more people in this country are not likely to revolt in the way that people used to think of of the voter revolting
but people are pretty much getting the picture that some people get taken care of and others don't
and they think it's unfair
and when they recognize that it's their tax money they're going to do more about it
i th- i'll tell you one quick uh one thing very interesting
and people can call in and say what they think about what's going on in this country
and i've thought for years it would make a lot of sense to p- create an eight hundred number for voters to call and and vent their frustration with government
you know y- just a number you could call from anywhere anytime
and i think once once people really start to communicate how they feel things are going to change
until then i think you know it's going to be really painful
so the question is how soon are we going to start to get our money's worth
and as you said it's how soon we get involved
and i think we need to create mechanisms to allow us to get involved like allowing us to call a toll free number and say hey look do it this way not that way or i like this or i don't like that or this is how i feel about your spending my money on art that i don't think is art
but hopefully that the people that are listening to what our comments are take some action on it
well that's the good thing about what is happening because i think more and more the news media which takes a heck of a beating and and deserves some of it is telling us you know about the problems
so the more we communicate hey look we want a change here because you know as it turns out we've wasted a tremendous amount of money on our defense spending in this country
uh and uh
you know there's so much of it going on that it would really you know uh set us into a deeper depression if we knew the whole picture
well you may be right
what i think is really going to be interesting is to see how uh we as a society deal with it
and i and i think it is what you say it's it's a
well what do you think about the everyday occurrences that are that are an invasion of your privacy
well the uh
what i really i don't like is the ca- the constant calls people selling things people telling me i want things
you know that's what i really
i think that's that's the only thing i wrote down also
because that's just a it's terrible today
i mean my wife and i seems like we get home at five thirty and the damn phone starts ringing and rings up until ten eleven o'clock sometimes
well you know the the great uh thing for that it's uh is is an answering machine
i mean this is this is the one of the best inventions ever you know
but you know people
it's like your name must be on a list or something because i know at my office i get calls i mean i must get at least i probably average at least a call a day
um even in an office
and a lot of days i'll get two and three calls from from people selling insurance you know to the small business man and uh you know i think dunn and bradstreet puts your according to what i understand dunn and bradstreet puts your names your name out to people also
and uh california always trying to sell something oil oil investments or stock investments or whatever
and now i'm getting the same calls at ho- at the house
and they get your and they get your name from dunn and bradstreet
and uh credit card companies they sell your name
uh well you know these people they sell your names
i mean you know i
i think it the whole thing is uh
oh they do
i understand they sell it you know they sell names because it's quite profitable to them
well sure it is
and that is an invasion of privacy
well you know if you've ever gotten anything you know in your life your your name is somewhere
i mean one magazine and boom they got your name forever
magazine companies uh uh from from subscriptions do the same thing it's the way they make additional money
but it's uh you know i guess it uh
you have to be a certain income holder to uh have an american express card
so your name is valuable to i guess x amount of solicitors calling
so i don't know
what what do you where are you from
oh i'm from texas
oh we're in plano
and that was uh california
i was thrilled to death because that's you know the furthest i'd gotten any call from you know
i got i've talked to people in utah people in new york and a lot of times i'll call eight or nine o'clock in the morning
and i'll get people you know from out of the uh out of the state
see well that's uh the there was another call on saturday saturday that was also from uh that was the one from california
or uh i don't know you know
uh originally from new jersey
from uh saddle river
oh that's nice over there
we're from more uh from sort of towards the shore central new jersey you know
we're like uh
well that's nice too
that's why i i really miss it
i i don't really like it here at all
so she's been away for quite a while
and her mother was from new york
so they just they over there in new jersey
uh and anyway this topic is is a good topic as far as invasion of your privacy
but that's the the biggest one i can think of is just just all the solicitors calling
and then of course they call you know
before i got the answering machine it was ridiculous you know i said this is absurd
i you know i the minute i get home the phone would be ringing
that's a that's a good suggestion
oh it's great
well you know in fact i've been missing calls from the t i switchboard
because i i always have it on you know
and i'll get that that message that says uh to uh um you know uh end this call press three
it is because one day i listened you know and it was
but um i i just got totally disgusted
and then you know people asking for for money for everything you know
i mean i
and you know the policeman's associations
oh i used to do that
they call you one time to send three kids to the car- carnival or circus
i'd send or three kids to the movies or something
and i my my pat answer now is well you just called me the other night
so it's nice to talk with you
and um food is a very intriguing thing
our lives are are built around foods that we like and an- nutritionally good for us
one i guess i'd say is with my wife where we enjoy uh oh i guess we usually enjoy a good seafood restaurant
uh you know something nice
and the other is with my whole family whom we uh go somewhere that the kids will enjoy
uh recently we have been hitting pancho's up
because they have got a good rate on you know good prices and everything
it's it's a chain down he- uh
we have one called chi chi's in th- in our area
and uh we had a restaurant called la bamba
but it's just it closed recently
but chi chi's is a national restaurant i think
i think think it might be
i've se- i think i've seen it around
well i love mexican food myself
oh do you
but you go ahead now
oh we we do too
we uh we enjoy mexican food
it's just primarily the price that's uh satisfying at this point
but the kids
uh and uh let's see
we've uh just recently discovered a super restaurant down here
but it's uh not part of a chain
but the first one we've been to that uh i don't think there was anything on the menu that that any of us had
that was uh not just really super
oh boy that is wonderful
well i i agree with you on that
and i wa- was really a seafood addict myself
i i love crab meat in particular
i uh i can almost live on on seafood and almost live on the crab meat if i
have you ever been to uh what is it original book binders in philadelphia
i uh know the name
but i haven't been there
uh that's an old established uh restaurant
uh i went to the naval academy
oh the u s
and we used to
we use to go up there on uh for football games sometimes
we would go over there to uh
pr- pretty sure it was original original book binders
well we're we're supposed to be talking about dinning out
but i'll just make one comment that uh i just retired from penn state
and uh all my work has been in research for the navy
did you have any dealings with the uh underwater sound reference laboratory in orlando florida
i have dealt with nearly all of the all of the research laboratories that the country has
that's wh- that's uh that's where i grew up was down in orlando
oh you grew up in orlando
that's uh that's interesting well i was in submarines uh
well that's what i worked on
must have had some interesting uh assignments for you there
wh- when did you retire
so wa- i hate to uh
i wish i could talk to you about that uh
but uh i guess we should continue on uh
oh we we do enjoy that
uh i don't know if we are particularly adventurous
we find something we like uh like cashew shrimp or something that's got a good uh at a particular restaurant
and then we usually stick by it
but do you
well i uh enjoy the szechuan type of uh chinese food
i i do a lot of chinese cooking myself
but uh it's in the sweet and sour porks and things like are just really delicious meals
um where did you learn how to do chinese cooking
i i enjoyed the food
and i bought a lot of uh good cookbooks
and i've been following through on that
well that one's a good question
i guess one of the things we've uh started avoiding is the uh run of the mill chop suey and things like that
but we enjoy trying uh different kinds of chicken or uh sh- you know even uh shrimp uh dishes that are fixed in a chinese restaurant
one of th- th- this book i have is called chinese cooking made easy
and i think it's by someone named chang
thanks for that uh reference
well it certainly is nice talking with you gene
and uh what is your phone at home
what do you think are possible changes in the uh way trials are conducted these days
do you like the way some people in there for instance really take over and uh we have no way uh of knowing whether they are legitimately right or wrong and so forth
well as i look at our trial systems
and they've taken a lot of the things that were set up to make it be a fair system and used it to their advantage
i think that a jury should listen to the courts uh to to the hearings and to everything
but i think they should only weigh fifty percent of the decision
i think the judge should hold the or maybe even forty-nine
and the judge should be able to rule one way or the other
y- so you're saying yo- you think the judge should actually have the final say
and i think that there should be more than one judge
um and i think that there it's important to have a jury but i think the way that they go through so much time to get it a fair one
but they only w- you know would cover fif- forty-nine percent of the decision or fifty percent
and then the two judges would go ahead and make the final decision
i hadn't uh thought of it from that point of view before
and uh what bothers me is i was concerned of the ability of some of the people in the jury to adequately understand what was being presented so that they themselves could make a proper and uh accurate decision
um i really think that the the the jury ought to have more say so in the selection or in the determination of whether they are guilty or not
but i also think that the jury should be uh very very uh carefully more carefully selected to make sure that they are entirely intel- intelligent people and that they understand some of the details that are involved so that they can make accu- accurate decisions
and and they just make a decision based on whether they like the dress she wore that day or whether that guy smiled or growled all the time
well what if they used you know
sh- let's say
we we would have fifty percent of them law students
and that would give them
and it could count as some aspect or hours going into their major
and they would learn a lot about being lawyers later in life when they see what it is like to be in the jury side of a trial
that would be a a really good thing to do
and what happened was her husband was uh involved in a motorcycle accident where a drunk driver ran the stoplight
and he ran into the motorcycle
but the reason the actual reason that the motorcycle person her husband was killed was because his brakes went out on his motorcycle
and his brakes did not work
and this expensive big company that owned these motorcycles um railroaded this into three years worth of trials for this lady
and she had a son that was just only two years old when it happened and they were following him home in the car saw the whole thing happen
oh they saw the husband
and they railroaded this whole trial into mistrials um this and that and the other
and she would have to sue him
but i just felt like justice wasn't served because they had the money the big lawyers and she didn't
you'd think there would be enough uh people who saw the accident other than his wife
to to also uh make statements
and they have nothing to gain one way or the other
so if they say a certain way then why not believe them
and i don't know all the details on that
but i certainly think that we've come up with a good idea with the
and i don't think that it would be such a bad idea even if the judge didn't have the final say
we have a a dog that we got from the uh
well we call it the s p c a
it's the uh an- from an animal shelter
uh he'd come in there as a stray
uh he's a pomeranian and sheltie cross
uh well he was very well trained when we got him
oh that's good
we suspect that he was hurt in an accident you know got away from somebody traveling through and hurt in an accident because a dog that looks as good as he does and is trained as well is someone that has lost him and not have been able to locate him
and uh if they were local people they would have been able to find him
the only pet that i've had uh
i'm a i'm a doctoral student right now and in my in my earlier days as a student
and uh it was an amazing dog
they had he had gotten it from the pound
and uh it it's a spanish pointer named domino
kind of looks like a dom- a dalmatian
and we trained it from a pup
and basically it right now it it's fully trained
and it can do a lot of things
and it will get the newspaper and do all kinds of stuff
so it's really
oh i think so
she's been a real good a real good dog
and uh just it's kind of a shame that i'm i'm go- i'm away from it now
i i j- i actually live in florida but i'm on an internship up here for a year
and then i go back down
uh what uh possessed you to get the dog
well i guess in one sense we felt that it it's nice to have a dog even though there are you know complications come with it
and then with our children uh
at the time they were oh grade five and and grade eight
so it was an age where it was uh we thought it was be good for them to have the discipline that goes with with having a pet
sure learn a bit learn a little bit of discipline and how to care for it and things like that
well that's the idea
uh it depends on the on everyone's discipline
and uh from that aspect i'm short on the discipline because i don't uh enforce that the kids look after the dog
and uh we've had him about four years now
uh but i think it does it it you know
it's necessary that individuals have the discipline to look after the animal properly uh
i think uh do you live in a in a in a fairly rural part of the uh or
we live in a in an area that's oh probably about two and a half miles from the university
oh i see
uh we live right might say we live right in uh in the middle of a residential area
and uh so that is not as good uh you know
this dog being a small dog it's uh more you more acceptable but again
and you know we lived in oviedo which is a small town
it's a suburb of orlando but
and she was a dog that loved to run
so that was the biggest problem i saw
and i think that's one of the uh the issues people need to think about before they get a dog is you know do you have the room for this dog to run around
or s- you know i guess you can't really say for cats
me and cats don't get along too well uh
but you know that whole space issue i think is real important
it's uh that's one of the biggest concerns
it's like uh
but the same time one has to recognize the reality of physical requirements of of the animal and the larger they are the more room they need to exercise
and that's all part of y- of keeping your part of the relationship
you know showing the maturity and responsibility to recognize those uh those issues
you know and also the whole whole thing with noise
my mother oh she freaks out because she's got neighbors that have dogs that don't train them and you know we h- we had a neighbor in nebraska when we lived there that had uh brittany spaniels
and they're very high strung animals to begin with
and then sometimes uh if i've got time i'll be reading the front page of the newspaper and just fall off on the articles that i like
uh also since my wife likes to watch t v sometimes uh
well i can hardly wait for my morning paper to come
so that's the first thing i want is the headlines
it's really funny because because uh uh my sister grabs the sports and i grab the headlines
but uh and then when five o'clock comes around i just want to get in the house and turn the t v on to watch the news
uh i don't stay up late to watch late news because my eyes won't stay up that long
but uh i love to watch the five o'clock news
and i makes me angry when my paper boy's not there on time where i can read my paper
uh i do have my radio going most of the day though
so about every hour it breaks in and gives me news too you know
do you get wh- like one of the talk stations the news stations
jus- i just have a channel that has music except for like every hour you know say eight o'clock nine o'clock they come on for just a little bit of the news
but as far as the actual news i get that from
uh i was calling from work
so and that was a call waiting
s- it sounds like you uh like the news a lot more than i do
me i figure if it's something really important somebody will tell me about it
but uh you know i the thing is if if i catch the news all the time it just makes me depressed because they tend to produce a lot of bad news
or that's what comes on first
and uh you know also late at night you know i don't wa- like watching the news late at night
but my wife is usually up then
and so i can't go to sleep with the t v on
but you know i i wish i had uh more news on things like that i consider long range things like science and medicine uh i'm more i guess i'm more into science and science fiction
and uh there's you know
but uh uh i'm more interested in that
things like uh is nasa ready for another space shot uh you know how hot are they on the trail of a cure for such and such cancer and uh uh you know a lot of the news isn't that interesting to me
well you're right
there is a lot of it that's that's just garbage as far as i'm concerned you know
but i just like the more or less the the daily news you know
just uh especially the weather
but uh like i say as far as as actually listening to the news it's mostly t v five o'clock to six thirty
uh that seems like a long time for news
but that's how long it is
and uh seems like they have the local news and they have the world news
and then uh my morning paper i can hardly wait for it to come
i'm you know i i just uh i would
i i i'm not a morning person
so i would begrudge the time it takes me in the morning to catch my morning news
and then at work i have no time to read the news
but i've always been a morning person to get up you know
an- but i can't stay up late at night to watch the late news
but anyhow well listen i guess that's about it then
and he said that he got calls from the same caller sometimes
oh well that hasn't happened to me yet
so you never know
uh i have it's pretty much a ledger sheet
and i just write down e- all my bills how much i'm going to have to pay
and i do it per paycheck for me which is every other week
uh i mean i include everything from groceries to insurance to car payments to credit card payments you know everything
and it tends to work out pretty well that way
i can anticipate you know a little better
and then when the bill actually comes in i go ahead and fill in the actual amount
so that works okay for me
well my bills i usually know approximately how much they're going to be
each month they g- are more or less just about the same you know
uh very seldom are they any different
and then uh like for groceries and everything we try to put like two hundred and fifty dollars in a little can
and then we put our receipts in there you know
and usually that's enough
and uh but i don't have any you know small children to have anything extra come up you know like uh running to the doctor or something like that with them
i mean you know
but i mean usually that's not so much that it would throw me off
tha- that it's worse than having a kid huh
i guess the worst thing i've ever had come out is like car maintenance kinds of things
but i do try to build in a little extra money each month to to be able to do that type of thing
uh i'm not working right now
and then uh they went bankrupt
so i just went ahead and took my early pension
but i only get that once a month
oh that's tough
and that last week's pretty lean generally
so you know i really have to try to budget that i don't go over that amount you know each month
i for for years got paid once a month
and and in ways i liked it because i could go ahead and pay all my bills at once
for me it worked out that they were the smaller ones but i would pay all of them at one sitting
and i would know okay you can go spend this much on groceries now and you get this much a week and that is it
and and it worked okay for me
right now i i'm in the mode of trying to dig out of debt i think as everybody is
it's yeah it's really bad
but uh it's going pretty well
and i've got a real good plan mapped out here
i also like long-term christmas club be- you know
then so then naturally christmas comes along
and that puts you behind too you know
so this year now i have them taking out fifty dollars a month out of my checking account for my christmas club
so i figure you know that's going to help some
most people are spending three or four months di- you know at least digging out after christmas
and i'm ta-
i i was pretty fortunate this christmas
oh that's good
i'm taking like uh sewing lessons to try to learn how to sew better than what i can so i won't have to go out and buy the ready-made clothes anymore
i even bought myself a surgery you know
and i just love it
but i figure that will help me save you know
my uh roommate does sew some
and and uh i- she hasn't sewed anything in a long time
but i i'm sure that she could pick it up again
well see some people are some aren't
because i have some sisters i have three sisters
but that's a real good way to save money
and then i can also you know do some crafts and sell those at garage sales
so which i've been doing
well that's a good way to to make a little extra money
well this is another way that i'm making a little extra money
so that was you know nice that i tripped over this opportunity
and you're actually my first call
i had not uh done
well have you called
i i guess today today's my first day that i could even do it
oh it is
oh well that that's nice
i i was about to call to get to see if i could get on with somebody
so so that was great
well i guess that's about all i can talk to about budgets
when i was working i uh bought a bond a month out of my you know
they automatically took it out of my out of my payroll
i take have some money taken it and put in a four oh one k
so what sort of car are you interested in getting next
well actually i love the car i have
and i would get another one in a minute
unless i could afford what i really like which would be a red ferrari or you know a little corvette or something like that
and that's what would influence my decision to change because i like a really sporty car
and i'd love an expensive one
but i probably
uh well i understand and can sympathize with that because i also enjoy driving performance automobiles
uh i currently have an eighty-seven five liter mustang g t that i've done a bunch of modifications to to make it uh handle and perform better
and i suspect if i were to be able to get another car where object was uh
well i'm a nurse here
and we have a doctor at this hospital that has a beautiful new red ferrari
a a three twenty-eight g t s
and i couldn't tell you
but it's just beautiful
and i go out and i love to touch it
but i can't even do that because
so i just look at it a lot
but it sure is a pretty thing
so have you had the opportunity to drive a ferrari
i mean they came in and up and out
and i mean they did whatever
and and we went for a test drive in that
and i was able to open that up pretty good
and that was really fun
and i wanted it
but i had a choice of that or my house
and i thought that i'd continue
there there's something about having a place to live
you know it's just necessary
and i did i thought well a tent wouldn't be bad but probably not practical
i find that uh that the corvettes are are becoming really really nice cars
they are they're pretty aren't they lately
and they they've improved
it's not like driving a a winnebago or something
see i'm not into station wagons and vans and things that people are really buying now
and i go um
i mean that you know
the new type is prettier than what their they used to look like
but i sure don't think it's attractive you know
it's not like like driving a little sports car
it it's very hard to find something practical that's also attractive
so but i i love mine
so and i i bought it because i drove a friend's in hawaii
and i just went home
and i walked in
and i picked it out
and he said take it home and bring it back if you want to
and i never did
and i knew nothing about my car when i got it
well so it was a completely new experience for you
and i'm sure you enjoyed every minute of it
and i've had it
and i've i still love it
and it took twenty min- i mean twenty seconds
and so i figured there was nowhere i was to late to go that i didn't have twenty more seconds
and and you couldn't get
i mean it's just a button that's it
so you won't get
so you don't have to get out or anything
and twenty seconds you probably won't get caught in anything too substantial
well i did actually
and i was on a highway going like eighty
so i really did
but it all dried out you know didn't take long when the sun came out
and the weather was pretty nice too
and wasn't it pretty last week with the bluebonnets and everything
and it's pretty far from where i live
um wh- where do you stand uh on
well i think that people should be allowed to have them
which my son goes hunting
uh he's read books about guns since he was like probably eleven or twelve years old
and i just think that uh as far as that's concerned he should be able to have them to go hunting with you know
as far as just having handguns around to to have them i don't believe that you should have handguns around
it's it's as far as the ban goes and everything i don't think it's possible uh to completely ban guns
there's too many sports people out there that that do do these things
that that's true
and i mean the the technology's not that hard
i mean you could make a gun you know from simple you know you know
well i suppose you could uh
you know if if you really wanted a gun you you could make one uh
and i think if they want one they're going to get one
the bad guys are you know
there's there's no way to stop uh stop anybody from getting a gun
well i agree with you on that because i know uh
in fact i had bought my son a rifle like for a christmas present one time
and for a rifle there's no waiting
but there wasn't anything for you know rifles and things like that
i guess it was just handguns that there was a some kind of a waiting you know two weeks while they checked you out or something
but uh most of these people that's got these guns that's going around you know robbing people and shooting people
uh i i know my friend is uh really into guns
and uh uh w- i went a couple of times with him to gun shows you know that come through town and everything
and i mean they just have i mean they have anything you'd want
i mean you know you know anywhere from rifles and semiautomatic weapons and
and it's easier than getting a like a video membership card at you know a video store
i see now i know they were having a gun show about a month ago
and i was just wondering how that did work if somebody wanted to buy a gun at a gun show
you just go and uh buy the gun
you don't have to wait or nothing then huh
well except for the the pistols and th-
i was just curious you know because uh i know at at the regular gun show you know gun shop that you that you do have to wait for pistols like a couple of weeks
and then they check you out
and you h- go pick it up
i think there is some something like that
anyhow here out here in california i think there is now
i'm not really sure but what uh th- the gun laws in p- pennsylvania are like
but like i say my son he's he's always had a
like i think his first little rifle that we got him was like he twelve or thirteen years old
but he's always he went to the to the school to learn how to shoot it
and th- and the rifle range to shoot them
he likes to go to that uh shotgun thing where you shoot at those uh yeah
he likes to do that you know
but uh i don't know
i think they should try to control it and everything you know
but as far as just banning it completely there that's not going to happen
i don't yeah i i don't think it can happen either
i just don't i don't see
and then i i think uh hadn't thought about this before
but if you do that if they would uh
and so you know they they would just
all the profits would go to you know
they can be you know put in jail and everything the whoever owned the gun
you know now when they have kids around you'd think that they would be locking them up
or you know
you know that's that's true
uh you know i i had a friend who was a uh
and uh she said tha- that that uh you know he used to always keep his guns locked up and everything like that
but i mean you know you're you know
people make you know
they forget or you know you know
the way kids the way kids are you know i mean they can you know
well they can get into almost anything anymore
we don't we don't do enough
uh although lately i've been uh
and it's it's it's uh
and then she's almost had an impact on me uh where she doesn't say anything to me when she comes
just unconsciously i've i've stopped buying a lot of uh uh paper plates and paper cups
and i don't do that anymore
how do you how uh is recycling done in your community
it really it there's not a whole lot
they're they're given three baskets and they put them out on a certain day of the week and each uh home does participate
but we really don't have anything uh close in this area that that do anything
and and some of the communities that do the residents are having to pay to participate in it
over here they uh have several private companies that you can take uh recycled
but uh if you want to take them all to one place they have uh the first saturday of every month they have certain places that you can drop them off
uh and i i recycle aluminum glass uh newspapers
so it's nice to have you know one place that you can take them all to instead of driving the glass to one place
so it's so that's nice
it would be it would be really nice if they uh came to the house to pick it up
and they just were talking about a bill in tucson about that
but uh uh it didn't go through
but i heard that most homes that do participate in that are having to pay a monthly fee to do that which uh
i guess what they what they were talking about here was uh was reducing the garbage collection in order to make that up or something you know
uh so i guess that's one option
like uh have you noticed that on the bottom of plastic goods they have this little number now that tells what kind of plastic it is
oh i didn't know that
so now they're like marking uh
and they they mark on the bottom what kind it is
so i guess that makes it easy to recycle
and then they're they're uh trying to make plastic goods that don't have a bunch of different plastics in them you know that are that are only made out of one kind of plastic
so that that makes it easier i guess
well that's good
i i'm you know
unfortunately garland doesn't have doesn't
they don't i don't know they don't do anything like that
or i you know i read those little slips that come in to your utility bills or your uh garbage collection
and they haven't you know talked about doing something like that
and i'm not sure where what she does
but she's uh oh she's ve- very heavy in that
and she takes her own bags to the grocery store
uh she has i i really don't think she has any paper products
uh and just a lot of things i've
and she does make a lot of sense
i guess that's how it gets passed on you know when one person you hear from another person
and then uh and then you and then you pass it on
it seems to be catching on uh slowly but surely i guess
and uh my little boy has watches a program that was really neat
you know the little i don't know if you know the little character barney
they had one uh on that kind of type of thing
and how children can can do that
and how to save water b- when you brush your teeth in water
and it's really caught on
and he's really caught on
so that's really neat
well when you start early i guess
i'm uh just editing a spreadsheet right now
this is a very appropriate topic for our uh conversation today because what i'm figuring out is that i'm going to have to put in a lot more money than what i'm making
well we've got a pretty good situation my wife and i since our property is already paid for
you know the main things that i like about the uh
you know they give you an opportunity to either transfer into an on going on going project
so you work for it t i then
well i work for d i s d
and i don't know what your talking about when you say health insurance
but dallas doesn't pay
it pays most of mine you know
now after you work i think five years they begin to pay most of it
but then for the the family you know i put my kids on my policy
it's like two hundred dollars and it's gone up quite a bit
and they predict you know of course it's going to keep going up
and benefits you know
and it would make women go to work sometime if they knew their kids were being taken care of
that's uh something i hadn't really thought about because we don't have children
but i can see how it would be a a real benefit
well we keep a shelter also monies that we're going to pay in for child care too
you know go on and pay a lump sum
and as long as you pay that amount you're okay
but if you paid in more than you actually used and the same thing for insurance what you predict your going to be paying for insurance as long as you pay actually pay out that amount of money you're okay
but if you pay out less then you lose that money
but you don't have to do that option if you don't want to
well that could be i could see where that would be important
and then we got that cafeteria plan
you can uh
let's see it it shelters you're money that you pay for for insurance
but we call it the cafeteria plan
oh it's probably what the first guy who did it called it
so let's see what else can we do
we could prohibit people from being hired that are historically going to cost the company money you know do a little bit better research on who gets hired because you know
you mean like for health insurance
well not only just health insurance i mean for the whole benefit of the company
see i look at it this way if the company folds i got to go find a job
now if we got somebody in a position to affect the way the company performs just about anybody in the company and they're not doing their job or they're not capable of doing their job then we should find a a place to put them or b you know boot them out
well that's easier done in a company than it is in uh school teaching
well frankly i think school teachers ought to get about ten times what they're getting paid
oh i'm i'm
but it's hard to get rid of a teacher if they're not good
well there's two schools of thought on that
you know i i'm looking at trying to get into a university job position as a a professor i got about eight years of education ahead of me before i can do that but once you get that job with the university you've got ten years of probation
and they can't fire you
well you know in a situation like that i don't know if that's good or bad
and i've also had tenured professors that were the best things on two legs
well they did away with tenure in teaching along time ago you know in the public schools
but in addition
you know you knew you weren't going to lose your job unless you really did something horrendous
well they they really can't fire you without cause
you know the governments taken care of that
but um what i'm looking at is you know there are a lot of teachers that aren't getting paid what they need to be getting paid
and there are some teachers
you know and i could see a point protecting someone's position
but on the other hand i don't think it you know that someone that teaches uh say shop for instance should have to have degree at all
well they don't
but you know you you get specialized education now for instance take computer science
and these people can't even get jobs doing anything besides digging ditches because there's no comprehensive test that they can take that would allow them to to step into that position without having to go through the rigamarole of college
you know i went to college late on in life
and i realize that hey it's nothing but four years of endurance
and you might be teachable
you know what i mean
i mean my agree is absolutely worthless agree is probably degree
it's my experience and and my knowledge that that is beneficial
but then you know like i said i came in backwards
and what's your job now
well actually i'm selling computer software
but the two are mutually exclusive because
oh i'd like to see flexible hours and teaching
we've we've we've already got that
well see we've got a little bit of it but not much
i'd like to be able to to evaluate your boss
and it really carry some weight
and you get to choose your boss
supervisor evaluations have always been a tough one especially in my line because you know my supervisor has nothing to with my job except to make sure i get my check
well so you get to evaluate him though
well not really
you know i mean there's what's to evaluate about him you know
i mean my my supervisor level is like practically zero
and when i need something i tell my boss
and he gets it for me because he knows that i know what i'm doing
you know and uh that that is something that i think needs to be expanded on specially in the large market place you know the major corporation because so often you know you get a guy who's got eight or nine or ten people working for him in separate areas so to speak
you know it's it's hard for me to you know especially since i'm in marketing sales you know
you know if i don't make a sale i don't make anything
well it's tough
but uh you know there are requirements and quotas what not for me to make
but um the bottom line on on that kind of thing is you know we have a lot of people especially in major corporations who aren't doing a damn thing
you know the work they do could be totally eliminated
and not that they aren't worth or not that they aren't trying or anything but it's just that their jobs are useless
take for instance um a large construction company i used to work for ed swampers
and he's assigned to
i wanted to see it uh because there was uh much recommended
and it was a a genre that i wasn't in the least bit interested in
and i usually when i hear about a movie that's supposed to be very good even if it's in a genre i don't like
i figure well i should go see it because if this is you know the best of the genre and i should know about it or something like that and i usually come away thinking no i really don't like this show
i i i i feel that way when movies are like blown up out of proportion you know
and you always you know end up with expectations too high or whatever
well the the problem i had with the movie was the problem i've had with a lot of uh i guess hollywood movies which is they are it's a formula movie
and they're making the movie according to certain formula that's a good formula but they seem to fall short of of being really creative with a lot of things
i mean here's the situation of this kid at home you know
it's a classic slapstick situation with these bungling burglars trying to get in and you know he did some clever things
but given the size of the house and how clever the kid was it seems to me they could have done a lot more i mean you know basically stepping on things and yelling in pain and it seems to me they could have been a lot more creative stuff used
i was very surprised that did do a slapstick movie because that's uh not really the way comedies are right now you know all the comedies are more like jokes and you know gags and stuff like that there's not as much slapstick anymore
well i guess it was a uh a very successful movie financially
so we may see more slapstick
tha- well that's true
it is it is
and i guess you don't have to but you know if you look at oh
the last movie i saw i guess uh was uh uh the one about the french the frenchman that leaves and comes back and he's someone different
um he's uh
well it's about a man uh that uh leaves his home and comes back to his wife
and his wife's all excited
but the guy that comes back is not her original husband
it was a very famous uh popular movie
oh shoot i'm going to hit myself after i hang up
but uh anyway that was a french movie it was um that was the last one i saw downtown
but i live in d c well actually falls church virginia outside the city and uh so a lot of times they have the the the international films downtown but uh so this uh french i guess are into the slapsti-
they have they have a
yes they like your lewis much to the chagrin of sophisticated am- of sophisticated american everywhere
but they have this one guy who does slapstick comedy
and there's something about it that's so innovative you know
but there's something about it that just it isn't just slapstick
there's something about the human character in it and that's what i find lacking in a lot of you know like home alone
and there was a lot of human character there
but when it was the real slapstick moments him versus the criminals kind of thing it just sort of lost the human element and became purely a caricature does that make since to you
there's less character development rather just the the the funniness of the gag
rather than and how it fits with the character right
we went uh without the kids
it's was a night out away from the children
oh i would have liked to have a kid with me i think preferably someone seven or eight just just to get a sense for you know how how it affected them
and you know i would have gotten in trouble the next day
that that's true
i i was thinking about that too
i saw that um
that's why i watched another silly movie um um with my cousin was uh uh the one about the um the turtles
oh teenage mutant ninja turtles
and your cousin's a kid
i saw that with my cousin just to see what you know what the kids are into and that is
anyway and that was just excessively violent
it was all bloodless and the good guys can get hit all day long and they have to shake it off they don't they don't you know get uh epileptics that sort of thing from getting hit on their head you know it's a little disturbing the violence in these films
but the aftermath is usually not there
so you see people who are severely injured very very badly lose control of body functions they thrash around
they scream you know uh
and they never present that
even the movies that want to show violence as real they don't really show you what happens with that real violence and i'm not really sure how i feel about that
uh on the one hand i'd like it to be a warning
they i guess they figured i mean they know what they're doing
and they make the movies good enough i guess i'm a bit of a snob they make the movies good enough to be successful and then they don't and they but they could make them better you know
i mean as far as i was concerned teenage mutant ninja turtles could have been a classic of world theater it could have been you know
it was it was innovative uh a completely new approach to making a movie in a lot of ways
and yet it ended up not being anything particularly memorable because the the story was stupid and and then things like that
and they built up
i remember feeling annoyed again i didn't have a kid with me and i remember feeling annoyed that they had this whole thing about the master and the passing of wisdom the from older to younger generation
it was it was a classic greek you know you know a sort of european mess going back three thousand years that they're playing with um and he had to
and he told them remember remember you were united you can succeed individually you will fail and then there was a big climactic fight scene
and they didn't remember that
and they failed individually
and then that was it
then they had to have the master beat him and the master should according to the classic myth the sort of joseph campbell type myth he the master should have died at the end because the the lesson was passed to the young generation
and the older generation is not needed
and is reborn to the younger generation
and on and on and on and all this wonderful mess and it still would have been every bit as accessible a movie for the kids if they had included all this stuff that i anyway as an intellectual adult would appreciate
and it would have make it uh broadened the audience that it could have been targeted for i thought but i uh i'm truly enough you know i'm truly an intellectual snob
i realize that i mean to go to these movies and expect them to be you know other than just just good entertainment kind of thing
there's not too many that are uh that are good just on their you know that that you wouldn't want to change something
and there's always something that uh
i i i i'm very i'm very critical
i i i'm actually originally from hollywood
and then then then
and my father works in films
and i tend to tend to be hypercritical of these things
and then perhaps perhaps it's unfair because i i i must admit i enjoy these movies and that's what they're for
but i don't don't remember them
and i think it's i think i can think of movies i have less fun during
and then after the movie's over i remember it so terribly well because it it had some some meaning to me or something
there there there are several movies that hit home like that
of course the ones i always remember are the the older ones i always like the musicals and uh
they leave they leave some songs with you
i don't know what it is but it just
i mean i don't know if this is old fart talking here or something because i'm not that old
you know those old movies seemed to have had something that uh that was memorable somehow
well i guess i got to get going
well um thanks for hearing me rap i guess
well thank you very much
well i'm from the
what what would you what would has your experience lead you to advise uh if my child were thinking of going to the air force academy
well i'd encourage it
it's a good general e- ed- education for a a bachelor's degree
and obviously and obviously it's where they don't have a any post graduate program there
but you get a an excellent wide uh basis of topics
you know you get a good broad education out of it
you don't they don't graduate the best engineers or the best english majors but maybe a graduate pretty good overall students out of there
how does that uh
how do you feel that is for someone at at that phase in their life
uh other people
it uh it's uh suffocating
you know you kind of choke on it uh it it depends on the person on the individual
but uh the one factor i think more than anything else in this day and age that's got to be a big factor in your decision's just the the cost of how much you're going to pay no matter where you go to school
and if you've been in for twelve years i'm sure you've
you've got a your share of student loans that uh you're probably going to be paying off or have been
well i sort of
one of the reasons it's taken so long is i've been working all you know
sort of half student half working and source of income and stuff
so i'm actually managing to do this with zero debt
oh that's good
uh i couldn't you couldn't do it otherwise
oh y- i mean i know people that graduated or that i went to high school with that went to civilian colleges
and they they've got twenty thirty thousand dollar debts
i mean you could have uh
i think if there's any major piece of advice i'd give is to find a way of getting an education that doesn't incur that kind of debt
i mean i remember seeing an article one time about you know if the average person who spent that much money going to college just took the same amount of money and put it in a a in an investment fund they'd be considerably wealthier than they would be from the
so it's it's really kind of crazy
it's it's staggering when you think that just here in central new york is uh
hamilton college is just a few miles south of you know maybe about twenty miles to the south from where i am and uh they're looking for twenty-two thousand dollars for tuition and room and board now
i mean they they they are s- it is a select
i was actually i th- i was thinking of trying to get a job there
but you're talking incredible tuitions now
but uh i get
i mean it's more money that i make in a year
you know it you know
for new york state you know
i'm a s- i'm a second lieutenant in the air force now
even as a somebody making twice what i was making how could you put half of that into to your child's education
and then just when they make made make it to the college years it's
well my my real feeling about about the purpose of undergraduate education is it's really the time
but you eventually forget most of it
but what you don't forget is the growing up
i mean people who don't go to college become adults in other ways
and i think that the best way to choose a college is to decide what kind of environment you want to be fostered in as you become you know as you gain new social skills as you become you know more of a functioning member of society
and maybe the air force academy is a perfect
as you said for someone who you know a more you know who needs to learn self-discipline and so forth would be appropriate for them
or it's also a good environment
and want to develop that
but uh you know i i agree with that because i see people that i know f- again from high school
and they do the same old things they did in high school and
same uh same socializing same exact crowd that they hang with
and it's like it's like frozen time
it's ki- i find it kind of sad
it really is that they haven't found anything anything better that uh
or their their experiences haven't been broadened at all
to to you know you know
it's it's a it's a tremendous thing when you sit in a in a college environment and discuss some issues and really sit there with people with disagreeing opinions
and you hear all these different sides of the story that you never thought of and uh that's another big thing i think people get out of college is the appreciation for different point differing points of view
you know or different opinions
the the one thing i think that's no good for anyone is these monster institutions
these institutions of th- thirty thousand students and such
and i see some freshmen wandering around in there
i mean when i was undergraduate i went to a relatively small school for my first two years
and then i transferred to a very large school
and that worked out pretty well
i went from a you know a second rate institution to a higher rate institution
but the first couple of years it doesn't matter to me what the quality of the education was
you know there were things like that that mattered a lot more
and i needed basic really simple education that you can get pretty much anywhere for the first couple of years
well your education's a lot what you make of it too
and if you're alienated
i mean i see people at supposedly really good universities who are just having psychological problems
well i i've seen more graduates from m i t
i work in a in a labora- an air force laboratory
and so we've got a lot of uh m i t graduates that are in there
and they are the biggest collection of screwed up people that
even even more so uh like military academy grads are a strange lot too
i i mean i have to ad- confess to that
it's sort of a a rare select environment
and they have their own quirks and tolerances and
you know certain things that don't bother us at all
and then certain things that
ways things we do
but these m i t grads are off in their absolute own world
it it's a
i i have more re- i have a lot of respect for m i t master's and doctorate uh
and now i
but they're undergrads are like
i i'm amazed at at that's a lot of them even graduated
but uh i don't know
well i i had known a lot of undergraduates who pick schools because they want the best reputation for a school
not realizing that the reputation for m i t is because of the of the doctorate research
and you're not going to see the professors
and they don't think they think what the best is is
reputation for for research
and that's a one standard
but it's not relevant
and i didn't think about that before when you were talking
but the service academies have all all the faculty uh for the most part is is military with a few exchange
instruct- professors from other
but uh having the military faculty is really beneficial because they see it as doing their job and spending time with the cadets there uh is investing in the air force
or the the military itself it's the future officer corps
and so i hear hor- horror stories from friends of mine that they could never see their instructors
for me any time i needed extra help any time of the day i had all my instructors home phone numbers and could call them
i had some instructors that uh would invite me over to their house for extended study things on weekends
you won't get that at m i t or virtually or anything like that
and you c- you know and you can't blame the professors either
you'd s- you know
and and that's appropriate if the university is trying to do serious research because it's hard to be a researcher and a teacher at the same time
so i'd say go to a go to a college that has teachers
but oh well
it's there's a lot of factors that people don't ever ever consider in in their selection of a college
and uh i don't know
maybe i wonder if if they enter these conversations that people have been having uh
well uh normally i like to to go out fishing in a boat and uh rather than like bank fishing and just like to try and catch anything that's swimming because i've had such problems with trying to catch any type of fish that uh i just really enjoy doing the boat type fishing
so you like fresh water
i've never tried like with deep uh sea water fishing because you get i get sea sick
oh i see
so i can go out and go uh deep sea fishing
now that would be nice
well i was raised on the texas gulf coast
oh my goodness
and during the christmas holidays we'd go down to our house on the coast and so i thought fish came out of the ocean and anything that was fresh water was muddy so i didn't learn to fish in a lake until i was well into my twenties so i had i had always been a a sea fisher type which is a lot of fun
oh i bet it is
you know at night you can go walking in the shallows and gig flounder and things like that
but it's a lot of fun
so i i grew up fishing
well uh now i haven't done much fishing here in texas uh because i moved from ohio
oh i see
uh but uh we did a lot of fishing when we were up there
but down here i have a brother that likes to go over on the east in east texas and do fishing
and he was just here this past weekend
i i think he mentioned it again
but i couldn't remember what it was
uh i want to call it salt fork or lake fork
i i can't remember
but he said it's one of the best bass fishing places
i you know
and he said that he has never gone anywhere before
and he's fished all over the united states in which they can catch the biggest bass that you've ever seen
so i would love to go over there
they were talking about going over there and and some time in the spring
and i was thinking it would be great to go over there to go fishing and uh and catch some bass
but they have snakes over there
and i'm not too welcome around
i don't i really don't want to share a boat with a snake
i just i i i don't see it
i just i don't i think that i perhaps would let them have the boat or something
i'd make some quick arrangements and i've told so many stories about the snakes you know when they pull in there's a snake instead of a fish
i think it was only like three and a half pounds
and for me that's big
uh so because it's always been you know in the on a lake and uh
but you know three and a half pounds and that was
oh on a lake
so uh but
i'd love to go ca- catch like the marlins or whatever in the deep sea fishing
i've i've seen it uh
and and i have no problem going out in a boat uh
and there's just so many other ways live down there
uh one of my favorite things was we were forever catching crab and steaming them you know out on the on the beach and you know just uh pitching them out on uh on uh what am i trying to say newspaper and and breaking them up and sitting out there and eating them
and then digging a hole and pitching the whole thing in it you know and and that's it
and uh but the other little creatures would take care of what was left
going out on a boat never did appeal to me simply because it you know there was so much else to do
well do you live like along uh houston
well i meant when when you were when you were growing up i mean like galveston
but you uh
that's close to uh
uh south padre is on down the bend it's like if you drew a line from austin straight down it would be in that region
i i've been to port aransas
but it was when i was a child
so when would go and we would go to port aransas or then on down to corpus or further
because i was just wondering we went to galveston this this summer even with all the oil spills and everything
i mean i was oh it was horrible
i don't think uh
oh i hate to hear that
and that that's true uh uh you know
the the water was murky
and i would hate to think about catching fish or anything there huh-uh
uh i have a favorite hotel that extends out over the water the uh what is it the flagship
it most certainly is so uh so that it it was it was certain things that were enjoyable about it
but uh i don't i think it's lost a lot of it's appeal since then because of all the oil spills that they have had
and uh it always smelled the entire time we were there
and the rest of the time we stayed in the pool because the water was so awful
well of course being raised on the water i'd never swim in it
and i have no desire to share
but really but huge sharks are down there
uh some of the young dread naughty boys in my family would fish for them all night it was incredible the size of them
the next morning they would have them strung up across the getties and it you know
so just strung up
now i never knew they were that that big huh
well it was nice talking to you
well it certainly was uh
almost almost ever single day from when they started it
well i um
about or just over a year ago i bought my own house
so this has been the first opportunity i've had to uh be working on my own lawn and garden
and uh you know when back when i was a kid you know mom would send me out to weed the garden
i i'd hate it you know
now i sort of take pride in uh in the yard and you know how the place looks
and uh so i don't mind doing it so much anymore
so do you have a do you have a garden
or do you just do your landscaping now and your lawn
well it's yeah it's it's primarily just uh like landscaping a little bit
you know i've got some uh bushes around the fou- you know foundation planning things like that
and then there's some just some little flower beds
and my mom grows
and she starts her own stuff from seed now
and she gets a little over zealous when she is planting these seeds in the wintertime and starting them
uh she ends up with so many plants that she can't fit them all in her garden
and so she brings them up here from philadelphia and gives me all her extras
well that's pretty good
my my sister is very over zealous too
this is my first year in a in a house where i'm thinking about doing some flower beds and stuff
oh we i've always had crude ones at my father's
but this is the first time that i really have to landscape a house
and it has nothing
i mean nothing
but um what i do do and i've always done it is
at my father's house we have my sister and i have a couple of gardens
so we each have a third of an acre we do
that's more than that's more than the property i have right here that you've got as a
well it's my dad's
and we've had it for ov- he's been there for a long time so um it just happens they built a shopping center next to it but um they put up a nice fence
so we still have a
and we grow a lot of food
uh i enjoy it
um the gardens are kind of old
but there's still
we we my sister uses probably a fertilizer
but i wish this phone would stop screeching
i don't see i don't think my phone really does that
but every time i have this phone is a little weird
i mean it's been dropped on the floor a hundred times
well i don't know
well whatever it was there was a second there
well i guess we better stick to the subject for the benefit of the people uh uh doing this work
i mean that's a heck of a pla-
especially up in vermont there you should have uh some really nice soil
we grow a lot of uh the basic corn potatoes
and see how many she can grow bas- corn potatoes
and uh acorn squash are good winter keepers
i mean things the way we grow are carrots cabbage that sort of goes to waste you know we eat it we
she she starts her own plants
and i i do a lot of the uh a lot of the the ba- the back work and stuff
but she does she helps me a lot too
now they find that tomatoes don't do well if you put them next to something like uh peas
because of like the cross-pollination
it's just like something like an onion and a tomato would go together but you're not supposed to put your onions near your beans
i guess it's it's just what scents it gives off
i mean she she reads all kinds of books
so i wish i knew more to tell you why
huh my mom put uh cantaloupes and cucumbers near each other once
and the got cross pollinated by the bees and we ended up with these these like things on the cantaloupe vines that i mean were looked like round big huge round cucumbers
oh that's really weird
i mean there these were like some mutant
and like i'll make an l shape i've put my cantaloupe
so they've been pretty close together
but i don't think the vines
they don't real- they don't have to be touching or anything
it's just the like the bees and insects will do it
this year this last season it was too wet up here we lost a lot of our root things our squash and our potatoes
and we got half our yield
and when we moved in there we had a a really wet backyard
and uh my mom wanted a vegetable garden
so we trucked in uh
i think it was seven what was it cubic seven yards cubic yards
and i'm going to have a seven yard truck come in with some top soil
and i'm going to
well it seems
my problem is i want to use those rail ties to build up a planter but i don't know if the creosote in the rail ties is going to do something you know if i want to grow a tomato or something in there i mean i guess it'd go with my flowers
i've seen a lot of people use them you know for flower beds
but i don't know what whether they'd have creosote would do anything
i don't i don't i just don't think you
i always thought i'd put a tomato plant in there or something weird but i don't think i could really eat the fruit off it without wondering
and i don't know if they make landscape ties that aren't treated
well you can get um you can get pressurized lumber
but they put
oh that's right
there's even there's bad chemicals in those too
well i'm not really worried about it
so i'm not going to no goi- i'm just not going to put that tomato plant in there
my flower gardens are always been like on the ground
they don't it just looks so much better when it's up against the house tiered up
well you can see it a little better
and it stands out
and i can tell you there's nothing around it cement foundation all the way around it not a shrub not a bush
and the landlord cut it down and said yeah that's one thing you have to do is keep that lilac bush cut down so it doesn't rub up against the siding and i'm looking at him like jeez
so that's all right
rub up against the siding uh
that's what he's worried about the trees or a bush because lilac bushes they they grow fast
some people uh would really like to have them
and then the people that do have them they spread and they sprout all over th- their lawn
so they're kind of a pain
but you know people who don't have them think they're great
and people who do have them
another thing i have that um is weird is the a locus tree in the back yard
and i can imagine if i had to mow the lawn in the back which we said we'd do if the trees hang down
so and the locus trees have like three quarters of an inch thorns on it
but i don't remember what they look like
but you just when you walk up to them they're covered with thorns
so we're going to get a chain saw and limb it extensively so it gets the trees up overhead
so it'll give you room to get under it
oh a tree is always something very nice to have
so i don't think i'll have a problem
well if that's not the problem
did you vote in the last uh national election
we uh uh i haven't missed a one since i've been eligible to vote
oh that's good
and sometimes the the local ones aren't as publicized it seems that uh they should be
and uh there's usually nobody running against you know the incumbents
or you don't know what they st- you know where they stand or anything like that
so uh but i i feel that uh a lot of people have gotten lazy about voting
and also they're fed up with the system
and they say well why should i even vote
or sometimes they don't like either of the choices for the candidates
so they think well you know why vote
the last gubernatorial race was oh it was awful
so i don't know
it'll be interesting to see how the next uh few years go
i think well it's it's definitely a problem
and i think it could get worse
you know we get this lackadaisical attitude
and say huh you know why should we vote
then you know it could uh it could lead to some serious things
it also seems like maybe a- another candidate that nobody wants could slip in if you know not enough people are voting
we can get uh yeah if we get someone in there like that then you know they could make all sorts of changes that they were you know had enough pull
it's kind of like in louisiana where that uh guy that's like a ku klux klan member something got elected
and uh who's the other guy larouche
he's so off the wall that uh he's gone in and tried to get into city elections
and uh but he's got he's been put away for uh credit card fraud i believe
people will sit home and assume oh that guy would never get elected
if you don't go and vote then you know very good chance that they they will because a lot of the people like that they'll strike a chord in something you know in some of the people that so will say look you know this guy's got everything together
you know i like what he says
and he'll be so far off the wall that they'll elect him
and uh i think that's sort of what happened with louisiana because because um the guy did get elected correct
and uh but you know they can always fool us you know
i think one thing that maybe would help people vote is if the polls were either open more days or you could mail it in or something like if you have if you have real strict work hours and you can only go like at seven in the morning or after work and you have to stand in line for so long i think that discourages a lot of people
what we do usually is uh vote uh absenteeism and uh i know here you know you don't have to have any reason
you can just go and vote and the polls are open what was it a couple of weeks
and they're even open on saturdays and a couple of sundays
and so we've got plenty of time to go because down here in houston it's uh the lines are long
and they're long here too
so uh but uh
so i did it
but uh it was nice
well uh i recommend it because you just walk right on in and there's usually not anybody in line and uh you know that vote's just as good as you know the one on election day
i've been involved with uh some of the campaigns and the state conventions of the of the republican party
and it's really interesting to see the process as far as what goes through as far as the voting and the uh how the uh the not the ballots
but uh my mind has gone blank
and uh it's it's interesting
a lot of times i'll vote a straight party ticket just because i don't take the time to find out what every you know other than the major candidates what they stand for on what issues
so i'll just trust well the party kind of goes along these lines so i'll go ahead and vote
there for a while that would that worked
we've uh i know i have um
i'll stick to uh to the you know sometimes i'll stick to a certain party depends on the guy
but uh if it uh gets down between two then i'll i'll vote for the party
or you know they're both just as bad
and i'll say well i know what this guy stands for as far as for his party
and um but
you know that's not the best way
but it gets to the point where
i mean you've got to have the ti- find the time also to read about the guy and and be able to find the information about what he stands for
and try to determine if what you read was objective or not
or what you've heard on t v which i think is just outrageous
i i don't agree with how the media handles elections
i you know i'm tired of hearing about the polls you know you know
it's just it's just ridiculous
i think it could affect the outcome you know could make it unfair
and uh then how sometimes how the media will blow things out of proportion and will run an issue into the ground which is good and dead
and they keep dragging it on
and it could hamper the outcome of an election for the guy that should have won
i i sometimes think that that should be limited more
oh but boy you try get into that
or they i agree with the freedom of the press you know and all the amendments
but sometimes it's for the public's own good that we don't hear things
and i don't think they ever care to
well i can't think of anything else really about the polls or voting to talk about
well i enjoyed talking to you
well it was good talking to you
well this is kind of ironic because i work in t i legal department
and although we don't have any criminal actions here we do have other um lawsuits that do go to trial from time to time
and uh when was it
a couple weeks ago i was asked to go to uh jury duty
i i wasn't selected
but um for some of our cases in particular we have um very technical cases from time to time because of like our patents and such
and it's very difficult for lay people for somebody who might just you know happen to be selected in our jury to understand what we're talking about
well i do think that the cases like the uh oh say something like texaco versus pennzoil
or or the texaco pennzoil problem
uh is ridiculous for people just taken off the street to understand and
you know some i don't
now in criminal i guess you always have a jury
but in civil cases you have the option of whether you want a jury or not
oh is that right
and in some incidences i think they ought to ought not to have a jury
or uh or there should be some way where it could be opted for them not to have a jury
uh i was only on one jury ever
and uh it really was a pretty trivial case
and it seemed to me all the time i was thinking of all these people in the courtroom over the case that involved oh a couple thousand dollars i think
it was it was really just uh uh terrific waste of everybody's time and money
and it finally ended up that uh even though we had reached a verdict before we were allowed to give it they settled the case
they wo- they had settled while we were deliberating
now the one thing i did approve of there was that we didn't have to be unanimous because it was a civil case
and uh we were split uh ten to two
so it was uh a good thing that
well um i've never fully served
i mean i've been asked twice to go down
but i didn't get elected on the panel
but i know that um for a lot of the civil cases it's rare
i mean if your a lawyer um there you could be a lawyer who never actually gets into the courtroom
some their kind of law doesn't get them to the courtroom
but even in um litigation which is doing lawsuits is a lot of times that you never get to the courtroom itself
well i think that the trial in a sense is kind of a threat to hold over people to try to get them to reach an agreement out of court
but it's a shame that oh
but there's awful lot of money in time and effort spent in preparing for trial only to then finally get scared enough by going to the court
and usually it's the scare kind of of the jury because you really don't know one way or the other how that jury is going to feel
but the jury may or may not see it that way
so you get a little antic- you know anxious there and go well you know
and who knows what the jury will say because sometimes you know the juries come down with a result and you go gee
i was a witness in a case in a criminal case
and it was absolutely horrifying to me how that operated because so much evidence was excluded
and that the jury was never allowed to hear
and they convicted the defendant i on as far as i could tell very flimsy evidence and two perjured testimonies
and i knew the people involved both the people who d and the people who uh were defendants
i think that was just a a horrible miscarriage of justice because of the uh you know staying by the absolute strict rules and not allowing things to be presented to the jury that uh were highly irrelevant to the case and could i thought have established the defendant's innocence
so uh i do
and judges on both sides of the family and uncles and cousins and things like that i really think that we have gotten into much too legalistic of society and that we we spend far too much on the fine points of the law and far too little on achieving justice
and it seems a lot of times that uh especially in criminals that their rights are so protected
but what about the rights of you know the rest of society
i mean we're protecting this person's rights who has broken the law
and we protect him so much
but what about the rest of the society
we're kind of you know forgetting about them
and i think sometimes that a criminal should kind of
well and then in a lot of
in criminal cases uh for instance you can't bring up prior convictions unless they are somehow directly related to the case
and it seems to me that a jury can make a much more rational decision if they know somebody had fifteen convictions for a similar crime
now it's possible that he didn't commit the
that was one of the things that we're not allowed to was not allowed in the uh trial i went to
though uh one of the two people who gave the perjured testimony had a long criminal record and had been you know a real sleaze bag
and he came in and was presented to the court as a standing young man who had uh been in seminary to become a priest
but i happen to know his background
and i know that he would have sold out his mother for uh uh shorter sentence
and you know it's it's really annoying when the
he said that that was barred uh by the court
so we do have some problems
and it seems to me that uh maybe it's time to just scrap all the case law and go back to general principles
but uh where you
i'd even go for for trying to get some truth out of the witness stand if they come up with some pretty reliable uh um lie detector tests that we can see right then and there whether they're lying or telling the truth
i witnessed one trial many years ago when i was first um studying to be a paralegal
and uh uh they barred priors on this uh person
and they never then told us i guess because priors had a reason as to why these two people were very much in hatred of each other
and they never told us why these two people had such a vendetta against each other
and the crime was uh uh attempt to commit murder you know
but they never told us why these people were mad at each other
and gee you know
and you think that would be relevant
you know because they they told us in school that you know crime has to be an intent you know has to be not just the act but you have to intend to do it
because there could be accidental kind of things you know
but they never told us why these two people hated themselves or if one had done something to you know really aggravate the other
and and i had a tough time with that
and and being a person who saw what the jury didn't plus what the jury did because we were just observing you know there in the courtroom
and i've seen everything presented
and you know they just haven't done a real complete case here to my thinking
and you'd still you know
and it seems to me that you'd get a lot more uh information if your questions were heard
if you were allowed to ask the witnesses things or if or the lawyers things or even the judge
but particularly the witnesses
allow them to uh go back and and deliberate and uh you know after each days proceedings come out with some questions that they want answered like the next day bring those people back
or if they would allow them to uh give broader answers they
it's really kind of uh choreographed
i can remember uh friends of daddy
well uh what do you think about taxes
i uh i look at it this way uh you've got to pay for the privilege of living here
but uh being a uh a rec vehicle owner
well in fact i live in a motor home
i'm a ful- what they call a full timer
and uh it burns gas like crazy
and they call it uh uh
anyway a a luxury tax
they ga- add it on on to tires and gasoline cigarettes liquor
and i quit smoking
so that doesn't bother me
but i don't think it's fair
it's too um um it's attacking just certain people
well gasoline especially in this part of the country we all use it all the time you know
it's that's not what i would consider a luxury
uh fifty years ago the automobile was a luxury
but it's a necessity today
and uh as hard as they try to get these public transit things going i have never seen nor heard of one that really got of the ground
or that accomplish what they set out to com- to accomplish
well um i i think that we probably are paying a little too much tax considering what we're getting for it and how it's being managed and so forth
i mean i i think there could be a better system
and we would get more for our money
so we don't we can't really do a whole lot about how that money is spent and where it goes
that that's that's so true
i mean they say well you voice your opinion uh uh uh on election day
but not really
and what happened they turned around and double crossed us
so uh i mean you can't believe what you hear
well i think too
one of the things that rubs me the wrong way the most is those programs that are funded by congress and uh that don't seem to have any validity at all
i mean they're always far out
and uh you know they're studying some obscure bug you know
and our tax money pays for those things
and i think that's wrong
and and uh i i also think we extend too much help to other uh countries
and i think here lately they've been saying quite often and maybe somebody's coming to realize we're the nation in trouble
now i can't wait for uh
i i could just picture wha- what's going to happen here in the not to distant future
we keep hearing well we're going to receive uh eight billion dollars from japan for the uh uh-huh the the the big
and uh so many billions of dollars here and there and everything
and uh the next thing you know we'll be turning around just like we did to poland
and say well just forget it
and i think that's a mistake
somewhere you know we have to realize that we can't just keep giving it away
well another thing now they keep decontrolling different things
first it was the airlines then it was banks and and uh um savings association
and the same with the airlines back in the days when they were uh controlled and and uh transcontinental or um um interstate uh trucking
i mean as soon as the federal government gave up control on all that they just went to hell in a hand basket
then in in the case of airlines of course they became highly competitive
and they cut each others throats until they're they reach the point where they're cutting their own throat
and uh well of course that's getting away from taxes isn't it
th- that's government controlled
well i i think another thing too that um i've had a little contacted with uh
in regard to taxes let's say that uh you have something that the i r s disagrees with or you know says hey we're not going to allow that
well i think they're very unfair in the amount of penalties and interest that they can attach to that because you you will not only payback that that you wrote off
but you will at least double that amount
and that's to me there's something wrong there you know
oh by the time you get through with the uh the penalties
i mean i can see paying the interest and some small penalty
but they really stick it to you big time
uh i agree
i think the i r s is uh just too powerful
and they should be a little more humane
uh the uh typical bureaucratic i guess that's that's one of my pet peeves
i came up with a brilliant idea how we could reduce the the budget
give uh uh uh government employees the average number of uh holidays as the uh
i mean you think about it now
they they get about sixteen holidays a year
and i think here at ti we get what is it nine or ten
well i haven't counted
i i would have guessed eight even
but you might be right
well i remember uh uh
thinking i think it was the last time i did hear that we get about the average
but uh government is ridiculous
i mean they're they're paying out this money anyway
and well anyway that would of course eventually come back to taxes
but uh as far as income tax is concerned i can't complain too much about it
uh i'm single
i have no uh dependents or anything
and they're out worrying about their own income taxes
well i i have another thing that i thought about too for instance when you try to save money and you earn interest on whatever your investment is
and you know we're not typically talking about big dollars
but here you feel like you've you've done something good
you've you've earned your interest
and then you have to go back and pay taxes on it
so the real amount of your savings on that is is not much
uh very true
you know it's kind of a vicious circle there
and then they tell you to uh well invest it in uh is it i r a or something
when you turn when you turn sixty-five why then you pay the tax on it
and the tax is a lot less
but in the mean time you've got your money tide up in a low relatively low interest bearing investment
i mean it's not making ten fifteen percent like a business is today
uh me i'm a firm believer in that if you got it spend it
well you can come over to my house and spend it
well you well do you do you need some help spending yours
well that's my problem too
i'm i'm trying to figure out from one payday to the next whose going to be the lucky one this month that's going to get paid
well i guess we probably talked just about long enough
uh let me ask you something
i've everybody i've talked to has received one
but i haven't gotten mine
uh i don't know
um well anyway ellen it was nice talking to you
and uh until next time
i think that maybe the the automation people that are very discrete or not discrete electronic devices
so and did he i- is he the one that got you connected with us
well are you going to buy a car soon
well it won't be too much longer because my husband and i are both going to re- retire
and when we retire we're going to buy us a you know a new one and and get rid of the two that we have right now
and what are you going to buy
i do- i don't know
we're either going to buy a pick up
or we're going to buy a van
or we're going to buy an economy car
well have you been listening to iacocca's arguments that uh that chrysler products are the only ones
and i'm hoping that by you know
but i keep saying lets put it off lets put it off because i'm hoping they'll get so many better features
well just like that air bag
because i've seen some of the you know like the head on collision type things
and the people walked away from the wreck
with no scratches nothing you know a few bruises
di- did you see the uh
i don't know if it was twenty-twenty last thursday or friday night on on seat belts
i i tell you what
i would not i would not buy a car that had the seat belt where it was hooked under the door
i i guess i
that that a little more than scared me
that irritated me uh
because it it it surely didn't come as a surprise that that if the door came open
i mean and
well you know what the average person
i mean now i-
and so it's not a uh
for me it's it's a real it's a real consideration uh uh
and and uh the
it's it's probably my main hobby
right because you always think
i mean i don't know
but that's just like
and and it it was on one of those kind of shows like twenty-twenty these people were like paralyzed
but they were hooked at the waist
and so it like you know did something to their spinal cord then they were like paraplegics
you know road and track had a had some articles on
and particularly with with back seat uh with some where kids were were sitting in the back seat with seat belts on
and they were thrown forward into the front seat
and there was enough stretching
so really if your sitting in the back seat your better off not not to have your seat belt on if it's just a seat belt
well tell me about your van
we have a van that uh just has seat belts in the back doesn't have a shoulder harness
uh it's it's a mini van
and uh they replace the engine at sixty thousand under extended warranty
and the transmission was replaced
but they really are nifty uh
and it's a foot or two shorter than a
we had a regular size station wagon and it really uh
huh the reason that we're thinking about something like that we took a trip in my brother in law and sister in laws to florida and like i said i mean we're not that old
but my husband works for the state
and after a certain amount of years you can retire
and when he retires i'm retiring
well as soon as i get my quarters in i'm
you know no more
well but the
did you did you go to florida in a van
well that was really nice traveling
but you know i like to know more i mean hear about more people that have things like that you know
and see what they think of them
the different kinds because i've only ridden in the one
what what kind was it
what what was remarkable this van even with the
and we went to disney world uh actually i grew up in alabama
and i went to see my mother
and then went on down to disney world
and it got better than i think twenty-two twenty-three miles a gallon
and this was with the air conditioner on and and you know four people with with luggage
and uh course this
that's you know it's been four years ago
but it's remarkable that the that the bigger vans uh they're uh
my boss just bought a a pick up truck
and uh he only gets seventeen miles a gallon
but it it has a big engine
and it it pulls a boat and stuff
but it's and it it's got the seats
that and the other thing that is interesting is it has uh rear air conditioning
and that that makes a lot of difference in those of us that live in warm climates
well now this one that we went in
well the big you know the big vans are all
i mean it was a big one
oh those are yeah
it has the front and the back and you know it has the uh back seat let down into a double i mean a queen size bed and then it had the two swivels in the middle and then the two swivel chairs on the front and i mean it was fantastic
and it got good gas mileage
i don't really i don't
i want something i can drive too you know
and i was scared to drive that big van
well well the mini that
you'd be surprised if if you drive a one of the the mini vans uh
more or less alike the the uh chevrolet
and uh well of course oldsmobile has got one
and chryslers got one
but they drive remarkably like cars
well do you does yours have that this one had it where you know you would see something coming in the rear view mirror i mean not the rear those little side mirror things and it would look like it was further back than it was
but the little thing etched in it
say objects are are closer than they appear or something
oh i was wondering if all vans did that
well you you can you can uh install those mirrors
i don't know if you've well if you've driven a pick up truck you know
these are these uh mirrors must be six inches across not nearly a foot high
and they're really nice uh
actually they they fold so when you get in tight situations you can fold them back
well see that's the reason we couldn't make really make them
but they're uh-huh
at first we were going to get a pick up truck with a camper on the back of it of it
but then that gas mileage was just atrocious
i mean it's
it's it just practically don't get any
well they have got some of the newer ones they you know with the aerodynamic features
you can get pretty pretty decent gas mileage
and then uh he talked about a van
and i said well you know i don't know i don't know how the gas is on most of these
and another thing was
that's the reason i said you know there was such a big difference you know in a little economy car
but i said maybe we might have to get us an economy car to pull along when we went somewhere
but really and truly the safety features
but i wouldn't get one that
ford now announced i think in ninety-two they're going to put uh air bags in their in their vans
oh that would be good
so uh and i think i i believe safety
i i i i really do believe in this stuff uh
and i i think it can go
but uh surprisingly uh they're uh
you need a combination of both the air bags and the uh
oh i think so too
but i think you need the shoulder thing i think you need the thing around your waist
but i think you need that bag to pop out too
you know because
but uh i think it's fantastic
uh that wouldn't be fair
well no because what they would do is that's what they're going to plan on you know
these cars i guess they figure all the old cars will be off the roads or something by the in ten years and then you know if you didn't have a car that had one then your insurance would go up enormously
uh i've got to go
oh that's okay
uh i think we've probably spent a reasonable amount of time
well you you too
but uh i know i know our policy
and they are missionaries there
and they they live there
and they have to travel by boat forty-five minutes to get to their car and stuff
and uh i know that they helped a lot of those sandanistas refugees coming across the border
and they housed them and stuff
and they wrote that it's kind of weird
but the bats eat the bad spiders
so they leave the bats you know
it's a whole whole different culture
it it's weird down there because there's always lizards and things running around that people live there
they just they take it for granted
and it's like we go down there on vacation
it's like oh how can these people live with these lizards and like bats in their house
i think their policy with them that though is uh
but i don't know
i just i'm glad that the sandanistas aren't in power anymore because i think that they were
and i feel like most of the leaders in latin america are probably
you would be safe to say that they were just very very you know big into drugs
very very corrupt like the panamanians are were very corrupt
a lot of a lot of american servicemen are involved
because i guess there was a big big uh scam that that all these guys up
so it's it's like everybody is into it
and we have i
my girlfriend used to uh be in the navy
and she was based uh based in panama
in honduras very uh uh pro-american
and there's a lot of men i don't know how many american uh
but there's a lot
i mean they uh
and you can't the american government you can't trust them either because you think you don't know how corrupt they are i mean they keep people in power like the shah of iran and
i mean it's the lesser of two evils
but i don't know how corrupt the honduran government is
they need to i think they need the repentance on the leadership of the different nations for all their uh you know the atrocities that they commit and the drug dealings and in the just in the drug crimes
because i feel like a lot of the leadership in those nations are so engrossed in the drug crimes that until they repent or they are moved from power that you know
and i know a lot of those nations there's uh brazil i know is like forty percent evangelical christian not just go to church but you know really on fire for god
and they are just surpassing america latin america by the drugs
you know it's just incomprehensible
and uh so i just think that i think that god is going to honor that and that he is going to put in some good leadership
and i know the president of i believe costa rica is a christian
and he goes to no guatemala because he goes to virgo church in guatemala city
and he is a former president of guatemala
and you know that that god is doing something
and he is raising up some leaders
and the people want him back as president bad
but they have a rule in guatemala that he can't have another term
and so the the people are trying to override that i mean not just the christians but all the people because they see when a righteous man is in authority the people rejoice
see that's the thing
that it's going have to
and it's the
that's the thing that will eventually you know
and it's funny you mention costa rica because they are just they are one of the most successful and peaceful countries
so i was reading an article in the uh national geographic
and i don't know
and they don't have big tourism
so maybe it is their faith that enables them to keep the crime out
i know that costa rica they don't allow anybody to come that uh to come any uh what do you call what do you call immigrants
they don't allow people to move in like less nations you know
they don't they don't probably take a lot of refugees from other countries either
i mean i couldn't even go there
so even with uh you know in uh inner company you know transfer or something
and i have another friend in uh costa rica that
and that aw that was just really sad
but a lot of it though is their debt
we need to if we feel like we need to give them money then give it to them
but quit loaning all the money out
but that's how we got into a problem
we have we went in the hole by us loaning them all of these billions of dollars
also uh uh mexico uh we will loan the money in uh
a lot of the higher the higher people
so we are we're suckers
we we are it's like we are partly responsible for their problems by loaning them all that money
i mean if you feel like you need to give them something to help them out fine
but you don't go making billions of dollars of loans in to people that you can just look at the situation
and that puts a bondage on them
it makes you know pressure on the nation and on the people and on the leadership and makes their inflation go up
and it's just a big mess
did you go to mexico city uh anywhere near when the earthquake hit
but i knew people
but i knew people
i got a letter from a friend of mine that i had met there that who who the apartment building was destroyed
and they were living in a tent
so it's kind of weird you know
so they were you know just normal people weren't squatters or poor people or anything that uh
i did i knew all of my friends there
but none of them that i know of got killed in it
but uh they're all christians though
there's been a real revival in mexico city since that earthquake because there's a lot of you know there's a lot of sin in those nations and a lot lots of witchcraft a lot of witchcraft a whole lot of witchcraft
oh i can imagine
there's a lot you know
but you know they are over there doing witchcraft and stuff and just a whole lot of the generational things too like the mayans and the incas
and yet they are revered and honored and almost worshiped by
so many people
even now in america you know we wouldn't know the truth with all of indian groups that were totally removed from the face of the earth because of how wicked they were
and i have climbed to the top of the pyramid where they used to take a beating heart out of a young thirteen year old boy
and they hold it up to the sun god
and that's pretty of heavy duty
is is there still blood stains on the altar
or has it worn away through the years
but it was kind of weird you know
or do you get butterflies in your stomach when you go there
uh at that time i kind of did
it really impressed me just you know feeling
but i wasn't a christian when i went there
but uh i think that a lot of those those you know generational things
i think that god sees i'm praying you know
that keeps the christians that are beginning to rise up there to be able to pray because that does affect that things you know in your background
well do you have a family budget
but we haven't
so why don't you explain to me some good tips about what you've done which you've found useful and workable
and i have to say we're my husband and i are both from financial backgrounds
i i'm an accountant
and uh he has an m b a
so uh we were sort of you know keyed in on expenses and things like that
um coming from that background what we pretty much do is we in our household as far as living expenses we live on a cash budget
every month my husband uh goes to the credit union and withdraws you know x amount of dollars for the month
and then that money is used during that month
but uh we've gotten pretty good at it
so we our budgets are realistic
and they are not so stringent and you know to make us feel uncomfortable
and i i really try to stretch my my dollars here and there shopping uh at warehouses sometimes like at sam's and things like that
but uh we live we live on on a cash budget
and it sometimes it's tight come the end of the month
but generally we always make it
the you know are sometimes several hundred dollars like uh tires for the car or car repair of some sort
or like a a dental bill or something that you're not prepared for
well uh most of our medical things we don't uh have to worry about because of insurance
and they're they're relatively small
uh we've been lucky
but right now we don't
like we have a car fund
and we put a certain amount of money into that every single month whether we need to or not
so i mean
and i i can't really remember what it is
do you kind of continue call this like a part of savings account or a different savings account
uh you know a certain amount goes straight to the savings account
we decide okay you know let's say it's a hundred dollars
you know every month fifteen dollars is for car fund you know
uh and we just we constantly do that so that there's a buildup of money for those things if something does come up
like i know that my washing machine is going to go any day
so but we have the money set aside
so if it does it's not going to kill us
uh so we're we're actually we're pretty disciplined
so it makes those surprises not so difficult to get through
then so like your pay what kind of a percentage do you basically keep out that you think that you know will cover all of the expenses kind of thing
or like what what percent do you then save or something
uh we have a lot of different things
right now we save about twenty-five percent of our of our pay
it and it goes toward different things
it's for you know for vacations like i said for you know emergencies like for car uh breaks down something like that
uh and we also put money aside for our kids college
and just this last month we paid off my final school loan
do you uh use a lot of credit cards or your checking account when you go out and buy things
checking account a lot uh not so much credit cards
now several years back i used to use ch- uh charge cards and you know all the time kind of thinking oh well it's on sale you know it must be a good deal
and so pretty much now uh we don't use them too much
if we travel or something yeah but you know
or if it it is a purchase uh then it's paid off when the bill comes
you know so it isn't any extended uh
but then when the bill comes we always pay it off then
so it's not any you know uh build up on the charge cards at all
and but that hasn't always been the case
so i'm kind of
i feel at least better now that i have finally gotten some of those things uh you know in the past
and i don't have you know big cumulative amounts due to those charge cards because that interest rate just is a killer
oh and it's not deductible anymore
well i've never been in the situation of itemizing anyhow
but uh pretty much when i always i go to the grocery store or something i just always write checks
we did we did that for a long time
and it got to the point where we had no idea how much we were spending on things
and it seemed like we didn't have enough money when things cropped up you know
so we decided to put ourselves on a cash budget
well the first time we did it we just took some arbitrary amount that we estimated it would be
and then we kept track of everything for a month
you know how much we spent on food how much we spent on gasoline how much we spent on everything
and from that built you know a cash budget
so now i mean i have
and uh i mean some months i may spend three hundred on groceries and a hundred on everything else
and some months it may be different
it's not as though we feel like we have to keep ourselves you know down to the dollar or the penny in certain categories kind of thing
but the way we set up you know the amount that we want to save and the amounts that we have to spend for you know uh utilities and uh the house payment and all that
uh the cash budget just fits right in there
i mean but again it's a set amount every month
and uh on special occasions i mean birthdays and things like that
we we don't we still have fun on things
uh we are in the process of trying to buy a house
or did you have a budget to uh get your down payment going to get a house
not originally because when we we did buy when we bought our first house it was at a time where you
and the kind of loan we got you really didn't have to put down anything
so we got into it fairly cheaply
and then uh after we sold the first house we were left with enough cash that there was enough to make the down payment on this house
so we we got out of that one pretty easily
i mean it it's really rough to keep yourself on a strict budget for a long long time when your you know your priority at least mine is to save for the house
but then it's awful hard to really scrimp for a long long time and keep putting all the money into that down payment
i mean jeez they are one and four
my husband he's the real he's the real disciplinarian when it comes to that money usually
well i know
but there are times when i sit there and i think wow you know we make x amount of money and where is it
i mean you look around
and you go
you you haven't made uh big purchases
and that's the easier thing to see
if you can see a big purchase and you go okay well this is the year that we bought the couch or the t v
but all those just monthly payments and stuff that just go out the door
and there's big chunks of your money to pay like the utilities and the gas and the groceries
that you don't have tangible i mean the perishable kind of things that's gone used and gone
it's it's amazing how much we spend on some things
and that's all he has
and i mean so i'd say at least two usually three times a week he takes his lunch
the other times he'll uh i don't know go out somewhere
but but he keeps himself on that
i mean he found it's it's so easy to spend five dollars a day on lunch
that's that's twelve hundred dollars a year just on lunch
when he can take a sandwich you know
well how about you are you an exercise fanatic
since t i has uh uh instituted that um walkabout
i have gone out and started walking even more bought me the you know the proper shoes and everything to get started
and uh park out there you know way out there in the boondocks
and when we came back they said oh there's a parking space real close and i parked way out in the boonies
and i said you can walk off your lunch
it's just a it's just a chore you know
and i finally decided one semester i'm in college and i'm taking night classes and i still don't have any of my p e classes
and so one semester i thought okay that's what i'm going to do
and that will get me where i'll have to do it you know
and they were offering a a walking class
where you you know you have to walk you know that like for every mile you walk and every so many minutes you get you get points you know
and then you have to go in once a week and log your points
so it's not like you can do the class like anytime you want you know
and at the end of the semester you go back in and your like your final exam is a three mile walk
and if you walk it in this many minutes you get an a
and i thought oh this will be an easy class
and you know and i did it and i did it for a long time
like about the middle of the semester i ended up having to have surgery on my foot
and this has been a couple of years ago
and you know i had i did that
and i just ended up having to drop the class
you know by the time the final came around i wasn't even where i could wear a shoe yet
let alone walk three miles you know
but that was the only time i have ever been able to like start an exercise program and really stick to it
because then i had to i had to go every week and log in what i had walked
and my teacher looked at it every week you know
but other than that i just you know i kind of get in the mood every once in awhile say
okay i'm going to start going to aerobics now you know
and i'll go for like two weeks and go this is for the birds
well you know i have noticed too that uh when i started the exercise uh not the exercise but the walking program uh that i did tone up you know like all over
but it didn't get the upper part of my body
and uh so what i do is i bowl
and i used to bowl five times a week
so i really loved it
and i still bowl at least once a week now on a league on on a
and i'm bowling on the t i league
um but i've noticed that what i do is that i have my towel that sits on the floor so that every time i get up to bowl i have to bend over to pick up my towel
and that way i get the little extra exercise
i'm always explaining to people i do little things like that like you know take the stairs instead of the um the elevator
and i do silly things like that versus a a regular program that you would have
i was on uh nutri systems for a while
and that is one of the things that they really stressed doing you know
park at the other end you know
i mean and they stretched stressed things like that too
you know during when you're sitting watching t v at night
um um um um
and you'd be surprised at how much just that little bit adds up
you know just gives you a little more activity
i really did uh years ago
and uh i was thinking about that not too long ago that i used to walk
but i used to watch all those exercise programs on t v
and i would tape them
and then i would do them like two times a day
but i don't do any of that kind of stuff anymore
well i can't use that as an excuse because i didn't do it before
i just i'm more into you know sitting than i am
so but you know i have found that with
and i have found really though i'm kind of the opposite i'm more active now with him than i was before
because now you know he'll i want to go outside and i'll go outside with him
and we'll walk up and down the street
and we'll go to the park
and i'll run around with him and stuff like that
so i'm getting more you know more exercise that way than i ever did before i had him you know
um um um um
so i think i think that has helped a little bit
just chasing him around the house you know
running oh yeah
tha- that's enough
well mine are older now doing uh their own things
oh lucky you
same thing huh it repeats the terrible twos repeat at about thirteen
it it absolutely does
i i i know i just know you can't
but i at least since t i has implemented that program i do
and you know that i'm need to do this that and the other
and uh so i try to do combinations of things but not like go down to the president's health club like i see all these people do
that that walkabout's a good program
it really is you know
when they first started it i i got all the information of course
but just like everything else i was real gung ho with a friend of mine
and we did do it for a long time
and then i started school you know
and like two nights a week i was going to school
and then the other two nights a week my husband worked
so i had to pick ryan up you know
there's always an excuse you know
and it gets worse
oh i'm sure
and that's where i actually get my exercise
well it was nice talking to you
well it was really good to talk to you
so do you fish
and so we go there for the small lake uh just outside of the dallas fort worth area
and we go and we fish
and we catch a bunch of junk
but it's fun
uh from a boat or from shore
oh that's nice
uh mostly catfish
oh mostly we catch carp
and you know we go ahead and eat those
but we've never caught enough to really have what you'd call a fish fry
what we normally do is just uh go ahead and clean it up and then uh you know put it in a bag and freeze it
and and somebody takes it home and eats it then when there's just a couple people instead of a whole crowd
usually there's a pretty good crowd there
so we don't ever catch enough to eat
because i've caught up to about an eight pound carp on a little you know a little pole with twenty pound test line
and that that's a pretty good fight
so that's a lot of fun
well that sounds like fun
fish in colorado s- different than that
and in the rivers and stuff
very yeah very much there you know
oh you mean size wise they're not very big
um by and large no
but but they're big fun
well i've been
is that mostly uh fly fishing when you're doing that
or are you using a bobber
i i i'm a fly fisherman
i i cast a ways
but it's fun
well let me explain fly fly fishing to you then
so what you do is you strip off oh four five six little rolls coils of line into your hand
and you whip the line
um so you're fishing downstream so it will carry some
oh you fish upstream
and then you let it carry it downstream
and then you reel it in
and you do it again
you hope that they think it's a bug and and eat it
uh from what i'm seeing and hearing and all the the big pattern that's really looking forward for spring is the grub pattern
it it looks like a grub
oh it's a it's a lure
whenever you yeah
whenever you have a something that looks like something else and it's a fly you call it a pattern
all right uh you know there's bumble bee patterns there's
and and you're going to make one for yourself
or are you going to buy it
uh i've got some
oh it's just that that just happens to be what the fish like this year
but bait tends to work the best just some blood bait
you see i'm from west texas
oh are you
oh i'm from midland
oh another west texan
so you've been out to buffalo gap fishing
but i've been up there
it it it's kind of nice way to get away from everything for the day
well there you fish mornings and evenings
in the summer well
but both times it was really pleasant
in fact it snowed on us in in gosh when was that
and it was like the end of ju- it was just before july fourth
and it was twenty-eight twenty-nine degrees
and here it went and it froze
and it snowed on us
fishing is not just just dragging fish out of the water
it's it's a total experience you know getting out in nature and
uh i probably ought to
goodness it must be a little bit cold
well you know
um do you have any
you know i always intend to just stand on the bank and just kind of slip it
oh i see
and you know how it is
and you get you get a little more carried away with it
and you move a little closer
and then you're in to it just a little bit
and then you splash in
uh got a stepdaughter
and uh at times she enjoys it at times not
and the little one of course is could care less
the uh three and a half year old has just gotten to the point
and just put uh his big thing last year was throwing it in the water and reeling it up
we we were at a friend's uh stock pond we were out at their farm
and and they had been fishing and let him use the pole while we wal- we all walked off a healthy hundred yards or so and let him fish
and he started trying to cast it
so he he was kind of getting there
but he's he's at a dangerous point right now
last year we had a oh just a wonderful trip up to travers lake
oh it was cold and rain the whole time
and we still had a good time out
well that's good
uh and colorado is a beautiful place to live
but i don't know all of our family is here
well and you've got to have
but t i is up there
i'm sorry what
we're both uh
i was uh military
but he's division three
well the only thing up here
and he's in school
and they like to fish
and they go fishing up there
so that would be neat to
oh fishing's fishing is fun up here
it seems like the success ratio the success rate here is not as good as on some of the better lakes there
the the experience is is better up here i think
you know it seems more relaxing there's
and and there's something about listening to water run that's relaxing to the soul
you know if you're if you're just sitting on a nice hot lake
and we figured we were up a long way off
and then it rained that night
and we thought well wonder how far off we are
and we got up the next day
and that creek that had been fifty or sixty feet from our site of our tent was now about three feet away
and it's like oh well maybe we ought to move just a touch
so that was kind of funny
it it is interesting to watch that water rise all of a sudden
we in fact we have gotten out on on trips before and just stopped and watched it because there was so much
and if you were there i mean
and i guess it was late may
so it was really your spring almost
you know at even though it was it was really summer down here
and and the i guess the creek the mountains were really starting to melt
and the creek was just wild just running
and and all the white water and noise and the
it gets f- foamy almost
and you know it's just pure and pristine
and they're older now
but um i found it very difficult to find good child care when i was looking for a place to for stay while i thought school
and um i wanted when they were very young when they were babies say till they were about two years old i preferred that they had an individual take care of them in a home
and that's what i looked for
and i was lucky enough to find one right across from my school
and that worked
well that's good
but when they got older i wanted them to be in a school type situation three i think they were both three when they started where they could learn to interact with kids and and be around kids their own age because i think that's that that would prepare them for school also it's real important
that they do that um that they get that preparation for school
but i had
i have switched schools several times because i di- i really didn't care for what was going on at that the school
oh oh you mean you switched schools for the kids
for the sch- for the kids
well i'm just recently married
so i don't have any children
but i think um that i that that's probably one of the biggest difficulties uh
i think um i'm lucky though that um my wife
and that's also
and it's nice for me because um
so that if my wife does um does go back to work part time um
oh that's wonderful
so it will probably workout real nice for us uh
i can even teach on saturdays and and things
um i do know that my brother and his wife have a terrible time finding uh child care
and one of the things they made in um uh
they're number one priority was that um they're children didn't have to leave their home
they um um
my sister-in-law is a uh um a clinical speech pathologist
so she is als-
i guess her most recent position after she returned back to work she applied for a director's position an- and got it
so i guess she's very well qualified for her field i guess
and even though she took off two years for um
i guess she took off three years all together um
and yeah and my nephew is two almost two
so i guess she took off three all together
and then when she decided to go back to work um she was able to find good position and pay for somebody to come into their home
oh that's wonderful
but i think they've lost this woman she wi- she will not continue
and and she won't do it in the summer because her kids are home from school
oh you know that's an ideal situation
but not many people can afford
i think they they're both they were both professionals unlike me they're um they were married my brother's five years younger then she is
so she was probably twenty-seven when they were married
so she already had had gotten bachelors and masters and established herself in a
um where you know he then they waited a couple years
and and he got himself pretty far along i guess they didn't have kids until he was about twenty sev- twenty-six
so by that time she was so well established you know
but uh i think the longer you wait the easier the easier it is
oh i do to
if you have that that professional occupation where you can change
but they're they're are just so many people out there that aren't that uh
that's true yeah
uh because i'm a single parent
and i uh you know my husband and i ex-husband and i got a divorce um when the children were small
and so i uh was a teacher
i uh still am teacher
and it was really difficult to find affordable child care that was that was what i wanted
have piece of mind and when i taught school
and i knew my kids were being taken
and uh plus i i uh wanted them to get something out of it
that's you know that's so important i um i i guess it's so funny now with schools you know they don't take kid into kindergarten and when i guess when they're five
and sometimes they flunk kindergarten now
and i think that's so funny because um
and i hope to read with my kids
but i don't know if i want my kids to go to school at four
you know i can see tha- that when you make that point
well the thing is
i teach this grade and i i can see very readily the kids that didn't never learn socially how to get along with other
and they're the ones that are having problems not only getting along with the other kids but academically
because they were not they're should be there's to many things in their way
and so i want my
and they did learn to get to get along with other people
and i mean i feel a lot of maladjusted adults
and i bet if we trace back to their
early childhood we could see some you know times they didn't get to play or be with other kids their own age really learn how do get along with
i think that's really that's important
i i've seen the same thing
i i think you're exactly right because you know i've gone ou-
and you know
and i bet
and they could be traced back to just not being uh you know being moved between day care centers when she was one and two and three years old
and never always being a bit snippy and spiteful
because it you know kids have to learn how to get along with other people
and if they don't they just don't turn out to be really you know good adults or
you know really
but uh it is a big problem
and you kno- i have lot of friends right now that uh have young children
and they daily have problems with with whoever is taking care of the child
or they switch a lot which is not good for the child either
so you need
and it would be ideal like you you hope when you have children
i would have have given anything if i would have been able
i i think i'm i'm very lucky
um because of having you know flexible higher education provides a flexible schedule
it's it's one of things where i'm paid a little bit better then a history or an english professor
and i'm also um you know
and you know you can take you can teach two three hours classes on a saturday
that you know whole week's worth of courses
so that lets you be available three days during the week
so you be will home with your kids i you know
it's really funny is that i
because my dad had very um nine to five type job
with uh forty-five minute commute into the city and a forty-five commute home
so by the time he got home he was so tired
and he was all rung out from the day
and i think he he missed a lot of um our up bringing
you know my mother
i i came from a family tha- that my mother stayed home until we started school
um and i i don't uh
oh don't they though that's what i have right now
oh it is
my goodness if if you want them to be able to drive the car the insurance bill
well and they
so you know right now i'm looking for a little truck for my for my son
so that you know an older older older
but you know i i just look forward to him helping me out because i for years just car
and and it will be nice just to be able to have him say will you go to the store will you take his sister somewhere
and just to save you trips to and from
you know uh ball games and athletic events
isn't that something how you know you think about child care
and it lasts along time
and then when you get through with your own you've got grandchildren
you think we've talked a long a long enough time
well normally they come in uh
oh they come in see this is the first time i've done this
oh oh cause they'll come in in ten minutes normally and stop us
oh in ten minutes you have to talk that long
well you don't have to
but they they
um you go the length
and sometimes if it's a very busy time period you'll go about seven minutes
oh my gosh i'm from uh plano texas which is which is outside of dallas
well most of most of the people i talk to are from texas
because that's where t i is
and i've discussed i've discussed um
uh well i guess you know it's you know
since living in dallas it's always so hot so in the summertime i just i wear lots of shorts so because i don't work during the day
so do you work
but i work at a manufacturing plant
so i wear a lot of blue jeans
but occasionally i have to get dressed up and wear panty hose and a dress
and i feel really uncomfortable doing that
in the plant so uh it's it's a problem for me
but normally i just wear blue jeans and a t-shirt
and buying suits and stuff yeah because just being at home
and i work at home
i just have you know i just wear my you know my shorts and stuff like that
i don't go out and spend lots of money on uh different you know suits and stuff you know
but when i
before i got married you know i was working
so i uh
uh i have all these suits and blouses and skirts and mix and match and that kind of stuff
but now that i you know work in the manufacturing plant then it's just it's so much more difficult for me to to actually get dressed up to come in to work like that
uh but occasionally i have to because uh part of my job is teaching
and uh so you have to look just a little bit nicer than your normal
but i'm like you too uh i moved from ohio down to here and i had mostly polyesters and
and then of course you have to iron them all the time
because i came from wyoming
and i had wool suits and wool skirts
you know i've got all these clothes that i never wear
and uh the seasons are just so much different
and uh so then when i you know i finally get a chance to go out with my husband it's like a real chore to find something nice to wear
well i know i was just now uh uh putting away a lot of my winter clothes
and i was going through here
and i was thinking i haven't worn this in three years
and because it's a wool skirt
and there's just not that many opportunities to wear it
and i have five or six wool skirts
so i was thinking well maybe you know i need to think about getting rid of them
and it's real hard to get rid of some of that stuff i know
well i know last year uh well this past winter it wasn't that cold
but the previous winter we had more uh cold weather where i was able to actually wear
your double and triple layerings of uh clothes yeah like you would when you're up north
and i i just don't spend you know
right now my clothes come from target you know
and they're all one hundred percent cotton
and they're wadded up in a ball
so i uh i have my ironing board sitting out all the time
i'm so glad to meet somebody that that their iron board is their permanent fixture in their house
you know i have very little furniture
but my ironing board is part of my decor
and and i've been looking at these uh uh like in home depot where you can go and they've got that ironing boards that will just flip right down off of the uh uh what the the the door
and then you can ha- actually have one where you can put it inside of a wall you know to have it
and that's what i'm thinking i'm going to have to do because
and it's just it's just an eyesore i think
but it's like uh i just don't want to do it
and and running you know a line in there for my iron so i could do it in there
and i wouldn't have to have that eyesore
so i have a big closet
i you know
if i know i'm having somebody come over to the house and there's a possibility they might be going back into my room
but i iron our clothes as we go along
so you know
and i'm like you
i the night before or that day i will iron whatever it is that we need
and that's it
because it's too many
and then with my kids they're always getting into you know
change their minds you know i know i mean my oldest is only four
but she's still changes her mind two or three times
oh i know i know
and then they never put anything back
that uh that would be too simple
that that that's called smart you know they don't we don't do that kind of stuff you know
it's been good talking to you to see somebody hear somebody that does the same thing i do because i tell people what i do
and they just go oh how do you do that
it's like it's easy you just do it you know
that's right you do you do
i uh i know several of my girlfriends though we uh we all keep our ironing boards out and just uh an ever present thing in our household
i don't think i'd know what to do if it wasn't there you know
oh well it was nice talking with you
oh it was nice talking with you too
uh it's kind of hard to put my finger on a on a favorite t v program
however uh one that i've been watching for a number of years is dallas
oh how funny
so i've i've kind of enjoyed watching over the years
and uh i was uh greatly disappointed uh when i did move down to plano to uh find out that the uh the uh great south fork ranch was really only a one bedroom house
well i think i've seen it in the distance
but i have not even seen it
and i have not seen the program
and and uh i know when we went to london it was really funny
uh people recognized dallas texas by the the texas uh the the cowboys and by that program
and that's that's the two things they associate with dallas texas
they asked me uh
several times several times they ask me why are there two bridges
and i didn't know what they were talking about
because they ask me why are there two bridges going into dallas
i was blank looking you know
well it's it's uh
when you look at the uh you know route seventy-five coming down there i mean it's actually a bridge
but it's a bridge over top of roadway
there's no water there i mean uh
well there's water in the trinity
i thought it was to going to oak cliff over the trinity
well there's there uh
oh do they
and that's why
oh i see
but it kind of confuses people
but uh uh i enjoy uh uh a lot of different comedies
um i think it's mainly for an escape um you know you uh my job is not the most thrilling in the world
and uh i enjoy laughing and uh some of the shows that uh are on the air some are just purely you know brain drainers
and then there's other ones that uh deal with uh in a funny manner uh socially relevant things
and uh one show that comes to mind is like designing women uh
and usually i can handle both at the same time you know
but that's one of the few that i just actually watch
because it's funny
it uh it has been very entertaining
and and also uh the the issues they deal with uh really tends to open open your eyes as well as your mind to some of the problems
and uh i've i've really enjoyed that one since it came on
um i don't like the politics surrounding the program though
but i mean other than that you know there seems to be a little in fighting going on between the producers and one of the actresses
and then uh i've kind of gotten hooked on p b s stuff uh public uh t v
uh i like things like nova and uh some of the the special programs they come up with on nature and stuff
uh and the ones that sometimes will hook me to put down my book will be the one there was one uh recently about the gettysburg address
and they wrapped a fictional story around it
and i thought that was well done
and and it it caught my attention
uh i guess the awards ceremonies and there seems to be dozens of them per year
but they could take that whole collection
and it would disappear
and i'd never miss it for a minute
i i particularly take issue with those
i i really dislike those
well i'm one of those rare guys who i i rarely ever sit down and watch a whole sporting event um if ever watch one
uh there's just not that much i'm i'm interested in
um for a while i i i watched some football
but i've just got too many more important things in my life now than to sit around and and watch a baseball game
you know my husband used to just be riveted to the dallas cowboys
and now we're out running around
and if they're if they're playing he'll turn it on while we're in the car to see what the score is
and he'll listen
but even i've said hey look you're fascinated with this you sit and listen to the cowboys
and i'll do some things
and i'll come back
and you don't have to miss he'll say na na na
and he doesn't he doesn't watch it
but he just doesn't watch them on t v like he used to
well i think it was great when they were you know like world champs and they were doing real well
i uh i
personally i i came from the washington area
and so i was a big washington redskins fan
oh those people
and uh when i came down to dallas it was uh you know i found myself rooting for the home team
oh how neat
in fact i have a uh a baseball hat that was signed by tony dorsett and hershel walker the only year they played together on the dallas cowboys
well i actually got to go see them win in the super bowl when they went down to new orleans
and i i i make the trip and did the whole new orleans before the game and the game and everything
uh that was that was a lot of fun
but i don't know i haven't been as
but what is a lot of fun to go attend is this arena football
it it doesn't
the field is half the size and there's no
uh gee i'll have to try to catch that sometime
uh again i think it may be on cable more than anything else
i uh i couldn't rationalize paying you know
and if i you know if i didn't use cable for anything else other than the basic well i can get that for free
and well i really don't need c n n i see enough bad news all the time
so i i've kind of uh rationalized that it's it's probably a lot more economical for us to just go rent the movies we want to see
and of course when we were living in texas it was real convenient with tom thumb
you know having movies uh back then it was ninety-nine cents
i mean go
um you can see them a lot sooner than you can see them on any of the stations like h b o or cinemax
well and i like to rent tapes because you can put the thing on hold if you get a telephone call or something like that
or it becomes snack time for various reasons
you can put you know
because i understand that that your you'll lose fifty percent of it if you don't
and i uh i've been trying to get my wife to go with me to go see it
she she doesn't like going to movie theaters because usually they're dirty
and uh you know she just doesn't like them
and um she doesn't think that she could sit still for three hours and watch the movie
and i've told her you know everybody i know that has seen it has said that the three hours go really quick
and uh so i'm i'm hoping i can get her talked into it soon
well my husband smokes
and you can't smoke in movie theaters
and that has really slowed down the forward progress of going to movies
but i haven't really cared up until this point
but as as far as uh regular t v shows i mean i've got some some shows that that that i would be afraid to admit to you that i've actually sat down and watched
and then there's there's others that uh uh i wish i had time to see
but i i just don't have time to watch it
um i think about the only night that i really sit in front of the t v set all night long probably is on monday night
because um i work so hard over the weekend doing other things with the kids and stuff and going to work on monday
so i kind of use it as the time to catch up on correspondence and and look over things
and i can sit in front of the t v set and look at you know do go through my mail and and watch t v at the same time
well i tend
i'm in facilities and happen to have uh weekend duty here
we we pull mostly evenings
there's three of us uh facilities' managers are covering the off shifts just to have somebody here uh from management to uh see if they need anything
i'm uh getting close to twenty
yeah hopefully you have a lot to talk about in this one
but i don't really have a lot in this one
so i got a good one
when the phone rings and you've got a recording and this always happens like around five or six o'clock
and then it won't go away
and any any of the type of solicitation that where they call all the time you know
well we must get in the neighborhood of anywhere from three to six calls about that time of night
more people call that's where you want to jerk the phone out of the wall you know your sitting down to eat and the phone rings
the worst one i guess is like you when it's a recording i thin- i don't mind so much someone calls
and it's a and it's a salesperson at least you can chat or whatever and say okay now we want to go
and then when when they actually start off with a a computer
and expect you to talk to a computer uh that's where i draw the lin- i just hang up immediately you know
uh shut my other radio off here
that's that's real irritating to me
uh i guess they get their name-
i'm i'm amazed the question about that the
and i have one too
and they say that they can tie up your answering machine and just have a big long if they catch your answering machine
they they can erase all your others you know because if you have
i think that's the way it is no mine i guess if it's full it will not take it i'm not sure
but they can certainly uh block your answering machine so someone else calls you uh and your answering machine is full you know
but your right
that's that's a high irritant for me
and it doesn't matter if you have an unlisted number or not because a lot of times these computer things will just make up numbers at random and just call them
and so it really really doesn't make much difference as to whether or not you know you have a unlisted number or not
and they pass around uh cards that have everybody's name on it
you know then you'll start getting a bunch of stuff in and a bunch of stuff and a bunch of stuff because they sell their customer list
or they sell their catalog list of people
but it's uh annoyance for me in the office with uh speaker phones
you know i
but this one guy next to me who's not here just so i could talk about him
and it carries over
and so not only would you hear
it seems to me that you talk longer from wh- you kind of yell into it
uh and so he yells into it
and you hear the other person too
so it's kind of a double annoyance
he actually uh ruins my privacy you might say because the the t i offices are so open anyway
uh that i'm amazed that the fact that i'm about ready to say something uh if he's even thought of that that's a real uncourteous thing an an invasion of everyone else's time and and concentration to just be loud
i don't know whether that's an invasion of privacy just being loud and and annoying you know
but i think it is
oh have you heard that that i'm trying to think of what company it was there was a company that was going to uh be giving out information about your financial status
that's that's a good one too yeah
but go ahead
well um i work in the computer science center
and so we hear a lot about things that are that computers are capable of doing
and uh this was a software program that a company was developing that was going to have x amount of million peoples financial history and information on it
and they were going to sell it to companies who would up in turn solicit you for business et cetera et cetera
and uh they finally uh stopped production of it because of all the hullabaloo it caused
and i wouldn't have been too thrilled about it either
i mean there was a lot of stuff going on about it
well i uh heard something similar to that
i'm a uh uh talk show person
and there was
when i when i do my chores up at the rad-
and so i listened to was it five seventy which has continuous talk on the weekends
and neil sperry and everybody i mean the lawyers and veterinarians and all that
and uh i don't know if it was a lawyer or whatever it was talking about when you make out a fin- a financial application all that information on there is really not necessarily
even a your social security number you know they
uh if your just making out a credit card application you don't need to put down
and i was curious as to w- you know what specific things you you did have to put down
but he says social security you don't need to put that down there which i thought was surprising
so maybe there's something along that same line where you know in all these financial uh applications that you make out you don't have to put all that stuff down there
it would be nice to know what's what was
of course of course they could say well i can't give you a card
and you could say fine
but you know some things will be private you know
but he said just put n a
and he said usually you'll get approved anyway because they just want your money
but if you don't feel like putting it down just put n a you know
well that's real interesting
on several things and you know your credit ap and th- all all they ever need you to do is give them permission to to pull a credit thing on on yourself
and there it is
i don't have any friends down at the the austin plant
but i heard that they were really upset about the drug thing
and we seem to up here have just breezed through that
and apparently some other companies are having trouble
that i don't have any trouble with it
uh it's kind of unusual here we are in dallas you know the biggest location and and it just breezed through
and wasn't really no one was i guess was really too concerned about it uh yet in austin there there were whether it was a class action or how far it got i don't really know because t i only had a few things on t i news i think about it
some people object to that which i don't mind no problem at all you know
oh i know that there's several people i've talked to that really have a problem with it
so you get kind of used to to going through stuff like that
you know you don't pay any attention to it i mean
i know yeah
i served my time too yeah
so i think i think the people who have who have been down that route or have had it to deal with anything like that have learned you know it's just one of those things
but i do know that there are several sites
but i think johnson city was one
oh did they object too
there's there's several of the cities that have been having real trouble with the issue
and the but also on things that i'd heard too from a stockholders meeting was that there were people uh there were the same places where they had a real bad problem with people fighting it were also places they had a big bad problem with the drug usage too
well i'm i'm all for it
uh it doesn't bother me that whether they do it in high schools or you know carry it to wherever you want to carry it really uh
uh of course that would really be a big thing in a public school
but uh i'm saying certainly at work i have no problem with it
uh uh and i think it is they they found that it's been very low really
i don't really know if uh they need to publish that really
oh i don't think it's a necessary thing to publish it they just need to deal with it and on an individual basis
but i think that was an actu- actually a good thing that happened uh i never considered it i guess it's an invasion of your privacy
but it's something that is for the good of so many people you know to
have everyone uh take the test right away
and uh and hopefully maybe some people will convince other people that are on drugs that well uh i might as well get off you know if i want to stay so you know
oh i think it's a safety factor too because you know when people are inebriated whether it's alcohol or drugs or whatever they are very unsafe for the their co-workers you know
it's like you know my father was a fireman
and i can just imagine if you know
and and you know you've got somebody that's supposed to take care of you
and they fall they fall out because of the drug issue
you know i mean you can forgive somebody because all of a sudden they maybe get hurt or whatever that that you can understand
but the use of drugs or anything like that
will uh be a problem
this is this is a tough one i don't really haven't thought about any of this
and boy i could
and um i'd i'd probably buy another this is the first american vehicle i've owned
so i would probably purchase another one um i would be more selective in the dealership that i purchased it from
but as far as uh the quality seems to be there um it's quiet it's it handles well um
but i believe i'd get that or a porsche one of the two
um if i had the money i think i would love to own a a b m w
and why would that be
oh i don't know they're they're not as nice looking
but everyone i've seen is kind of plain
what what city are you calling from
well that's a that's a
if i had um had the money i mean that's just
but uh i don't know i like
my actual favorite cars i- were uh like the ford thunderbirds of nineteen eighty-five
but i don't own one of those either
uh mercury topaz
cheap taste cheap taste in cars okay
well there nothing wrong with those uh
i mean i've never had any problem with it
they're they're nice veh- they're nice vehicles nothing wrong with those
it um it's just everybody has their own taste
but man the mercedes are expensive
and it it's nice i mean you know it's okay an
sorry i roped on volvos then
sorry i roped on volvos then
i i kind of wish we would have maybe gone for the g l rather than the d l
but because they- it is the safest car on the road uh
oh is it
see i don't much about them i guess
and it's the safest four door you know it's good for if you have a family which we do
we just we just
and so it's it's uh um you know
you know i presently
and i'm a tall guy an
and uh they're hard to get around in traffic to see
because you can't see a car ahead of you
but they're fast as lightning and all that crap
but the explorer i mean you're sitting up on top of everything
and you can really see real well
and i just
and and uh
um i like anything besides japanese
but uh european i don't ha- have any i mean
american cars a lot of people say they they don't last long
but i've never had any problem with um my mercury
my husband has a uh cougar
and he's never had any problem with it either
but it was
i don't know uh i mean i think european cars are great course you've got to have metric wrenches and stuff
and they're eas-
some some of them are easy to work on
uh excellent warranty i mean just unbelievable warranty
and and uh of course ford isn't too bad
uh but all of it has to do in my opinion with the service
and and uh i've written a a letter to middlekauff
and i've told them that matter of fact i got another letter last night from the quality ford division their still concerned about my attitude
and it it will never change about that place
but uh anyway that's my own personal comment i guess
they they had a problem with they uh took their camaro in to get it traded and they they hadn't signed any papers
and they had all ready uh taken it in to paint it and everything
and everything was stolen out of it
and the people um wouldn't reim- reimburse them for anything
she'd she'd come out like a champ on that one
so i've heard some stuff about them
so ha- have you been using well anyway
i was asking you some questions about the telephone and how long and how many have you been doing
they they don't want to hear that
oh just about a week
oh god i've
i'm like twenty some phone calls
that's why i i wasn't sure if this was the second time around or what
and keep smiling
well i'm talking to you from dallas
oh north dallas
so we're in the
well then you've been getting quite a bit of rain also
oh um i don't know i haven't lived here let's see we m- lived out of state in wisconsin
and we just c-
and when we first lived here we l- we were in garland east richardson
and um doesn't seem like it was quite as humid
and i don't know then we went we lived in uh madison wisconsin for five years um for my husband's schooling a- graduate schooling
and it just
but um it's a lot colder too
well what brought you guys down to texas then
uh his job he came back to start work again for a different company
i don't ever remember of course you know you only remember the good stuff
but um i just don't remember the humidity
well definitely i'm sure the winters are more mild here
actually though it was a lot rainier here in the winter uh we came back last august
it's just a lot rainier than i remember it all th- through the seasons you know
and i think it's because it's just getting more crowded and more polluted
um uh in in wisconsin and minnesota when they get winters it's um th- the winters are bad but not what you hear about
it's just like down here when you hear when people here think it's a hundred and six people up north think it's a hundred and sixty down here
you know when it's only like ninety-five
um it's just like up there when you hear it's forty below it's probably really only five below
um and it's so dry that it's it's like going to ar-
well probably what y- arizona used to be like you know
so it's not it's not what you think it is
you could talk about that that's that's a strange state for
oh sure i i'm uh i'm very familiar
oh there you go okay
so i'm uh quite familiar with how it is up there
and if you
kind of interesting uh the people down here typically don't think it gets above you know fifty degrees
and it's always snow you know
well actually the summers up there we thought were the most beautiful time of the year
um in terms of colorado i know my husband likes to camp and backpack and all the stuff i don't like um
and i did a lot of business in uh um colo- well denver
and that's that's probably one of the stranger things when you see the air inversions
and it's snowy
and col- uh it just was a very mixed bag in terms of colorado
my parents just live uh thirty miles south of denver
and it can be sunny and and no problem in denver
and they'll be having snow
so it's pretty amazing it can be that drastic in just a short distance
and then things like torn-
uh it's getting to be more and more of a possibility
it used to be no problem just because it was such a a rugged terrain and with trees everywhere
even i mean
and i can tell you that um they've even had
and and that's just a part of the country that it's rolling hillside
that was unheard of you know twenty years ago
um so i don't know what's happening if it's you know we are the greenhouse i don't really know
it's just you know
it's definitely not as um
so i guess one thing we do miss is that's a smaller town
and it w- it was
it just seemed a little bit more pleasant in terms of the atmosphere you know
well it's been good talking to you
well uh i have two children
so i do not have a whole lot of spare time right now
one of the things that i have made time for is uh playing softball
but i enjoy all kind of sports
but i do not get to do that too often
and then i i really enjoy sewing
but i do not get much of a chance to just really sit down and do much sewing
oh i uh like sports type things too
and we like the water sports too
but like you unless you have a pool in your backyard it is kind of hard to get to do that very often
well part time
so part of my big hobby has been
so i have not done that in years
but i have kind of enjoyed that
well that is
and i guess i kind of consider shopping a hobby
i just go out just to just to enjoy it and not really spend money sometimes
well since i have had kids it is kind of funny i i never really was much of a garage sale shopper until i had kids
but you will probably find after your children get bigger uh like when they want things like tricycles toys things that cost quite a lot in the store you can find that kind of stuff at garage sales for just a few dollars
we bought some baby clothes yeah last weekend at a garage sale
oh you can just get all kinds of things and kids especially clothes and toys they just do not use them and wear them you know for that many years or anything
so i am
and it is fun
on the weekends i drive around look to see you know who is selling what
and i found my little daughter some tap shoes for her tap class
and just you know all kinds of things like that that you would probably pay thirty dollars for
and i got them for two dollars
it is kind of a hobby it that is time consuming too really to find the things that you want sometimes you have to stop
it it does take more time
but i do not work
so uh that is something i have decided i am going to make sure my kids have a have a happy growing up years
well that is good
so i guess hopefully i will have more time for hobbies
well at first when you first have a baby you uh seems to take every moment of your time partly because you are not used to you know juggling your time around like that
eventually the you will you will be doing lots of stuff
but i think my husband is real into sports too
and by the time he plays two games a week and i play a game a week we go to lots of softball
but the kids enjoy going because there's usually a lot of other kids for them to play with
and we that is getting outside and you know doing things they like to do too
so that is good
and one other thing we are doing this year is uh we bought wet and wild passes
but the kids are always wanting to play in the water
and uh like you said unless you have a pool in your backyard or access to a good place to play it is kind of hard
and uh they have real good kiddie areas uh at both of the wet and wild's around here
so we are planning on going two or three times a week
because my oldest daughter is in school
and she gets bored real fast when she is home with nothing to do
so i think that will be a lot of fun
so we are looking forward to that
uh do you consider yard work a hobby at all
or is that just a chore
but my husband and i both i think consider it a chore
and uh we have had to start all over trying to plant grass
so it has become a chore
oh well we like it once in a while but not as often as we have to do it
i like to put flowers out and you know
but as far as mowing every week and finding time to get all that stuff done
well that is how sewing
and uh i wish i had more time to do it
but sometimes i will get started on a project and then finishing it is more of a chore than
i i like especially
but i like to cook for other people
like i have a friend that is uh pregnant
but she can't get up and walk around right now
so i enjoy you know cooking things to take over to her house
oh that is nice
and it it is fun for me to do that
it is it is something i enjoy doing
it is kind of like when you are a kid and and someone else's house was fun to clean
but you did not want to do your own
it is not it is not fun
but i think i will like it better
when you are home it's it makes a difference
well do you guys go camping or anything like that
well that is something that we are planning to do not this weekend but the next
and they invited the kids and my husband and me to go with them
they have been a couple of times and uh just getting to be outside you know all the time and sleep in a tent and that is really fun to them
well that sounds nice
i i think that would be a good family thing to start doing more often
my uh my husband loves to fish
but uh my daughter thinks she wants to learn how to fish
so i think it will be real good for them
uh if you can find some place where those little sunfish are right around the shore where they can just pull in a line
oh they have so much fun doing that
and they think they are really great fishermen because they are catching so many
oh i know
uh she is really looking forward
that is another thing though when sometimes your uh hobbies can interfere with each other
because my husband is afraid he is going to have a softball tournament that weekend
and i am saying no no
and you have to decide what you enjoy the most
well not really right now
i keep thinking when the kids get bigger and i have a little more time uh i might take up there is i would love to cross-stitch
but i have never done any
i do not think it is as hard as like knitting or crochet or something like that
i i crocheted when i was younger
but you know i can't even remember how i did it now
i started to s- to knit a sweater
and i got off on my rows somehow
and so what should have been the back all of a sudden was on the front
and then i tore it out and threw it down
and now i can't remember anything about it
well i did the same thing
uh when i was pregnant with my first daughter i was really bored
and i bought one of those latch hook rug kits
and i thought well i could use this as a gift or something you know
but i did not realize how long it took
and i got about two two-thirds of it done
and then i just
and then it was just like i forgot all about it
and every once in a while i will be digging through the closet
and i will find that thing
and i will think oh maybe i ought to get the rest of that out you know and finish it
but uh for a while there latch hook rugs were a real big uh hobby
uh uh people do not do that much any more
so it was something easy i could do
well it has been real good talking to you
and i hope you enjoy your camping trip
oh thank you
and thanks for calling
i mean you know they keep threatening us that maybe there will be a day that they're going to uh
so they keep trying to say we may need a uh state income tax
i think that uh we probably will have to have have to uh have a state income tax because uh texans don't approve of such things as lotteries uh well i i come here from new york
and new york had a state lottery
and it really raised a lot of money for the for the state
uh although we
in new york we had to pay a state and a city uh tax
and it was really a great relief when i got to texas that i didn't have to pay that city income tax though
makes quite a bit of difference in your uh well your income level
you know because other states quite a bi- a chunk out for uh city and state taxes
so you're uh looking at your yearly salary it makes quite a difference
it sure does ma- make a difference
oh you do
i work at well mainly the expressway site is where i work
oh i do too
and then you know too that um taxes are are less like if you live in mesquite
you know some people will go shopping in mesquite at the malls out there uh
or up to collin county somewhere that you're getting out of the um dallas county area because
what do we pay like eight and a half percent
something like that for the uh sales tax
which yeah that really is pretty high
is it uh less in collin county than it is in dallas county
i think so although i really i don't go up there too much i mean i i normally just kind of go to richardson square mall or valley view mall just kind of for the convenience
maybe i would consider where i was buying it to try to you know
save a little bit on that sales tax because on a car that really mo- kind of mounts up
and then once you could deduct at least some of that um off off your income tax
and you can't do that anymore
it really hit me yesterday i had uh air conditioning service for my car done
and i had a little little uh coupon special that was twenty-two dollars for um air conditioning service where they uh checked it and ch- recharged it and put one one pound of freon in
and if you needed another pound of freon they ga-
it it was like seven dollars and something
and then with the with the twenty-two dollars and the seven something it all came out to i i ended up paying like thirty-four dollars
and i couldn't believe it and the tax you know really hits you
although i wi- i wish you know overall they'd try the lottery again
oh it's been i've been here for nine years
okay well that's about the same time as me i came down in eighty-two
um well ohio kind of
but you know basically i went to high school and college in ohio and lived there
well uh i did visit uh michigan i visited kalamazoo once
that's true i tell you what hit me the first year i was here uh christmas eve in new york there used to be stores open the department stores wouldn't close uh
well i'd say they closed maybe eight or nine o'clock department stores on christmas eve
but uh there were stores that you could go to uh you know like discount stores and stores down in the village and just all over the place where you could go to
and you could shop until like twelve or one o'clock that night
and that was like that was really the only night they were open that late
but it was christmas eve
and when i came to dallas i thought i was going to do that christmas eve
and i couldn't find hardly anything open
were you shocked like oh no i'm stuck i need to buy stuff
an i was oh i was i really i really was stuck
and i think target was the one that stayed open later than any anybody else
and uh i was able to pick up a few things in there
but boy i was i was really shocked
and then another shock i had
oh few places now seem to do it by the slice
well the the uh there was other things too i mean i think it's taken us yankee's influence down here
to get them to uh come to the you know the correct decade here and century
um i couldn't believe that you could have open containers of beer alcohol whatever
uh you know if yo- if a cop stopped you then you would um you know get arrested or what not
and people would just drink openly
and talk a talking about alcohol and beer look at the taxes on that
and the taxes on a package of of cigarettes
i used to smoke you know and uh that would have been enough to to make me me give them up
but i gave them up a couple years ago because i had some sinus problems
so i don't really know what the
well they're like two
or i i believe they're hitting two dollars a pack now
a little bit a little bit more in some places
so you end up about paying about twelve dollars for a pack and two dollars of that is taxes
uh well i believe it's a little more than twelve dollars for a carton
um because i remember we went to to oklahoma to th- this bingo place this choctaw bingo uh a couple weeks ago
and somebody that went with me bought a carton for uh ten dollars and something
and they really thought they were getting a big discount
well because it's you know the indians i don't think they pay tax
in in oklahoma
oh i got you
and uh it was a indian well it's a bingo hall for the benefit of the indians there
there were just bus loads of people that come from everywhere else to play that bingo because it's it's the stakes are higher and payoffs are bigger and so forth
well how did you do
a dollar oh well
but you had fun playing right
i had fun uh a couple on the bus won some money
one one guy won t-
i've had i have had a number of them in my lifetime
but i had to replace it with something that the kids could carry
well they were
and i uh really wanted that retriever's disposition
uh the ultimate to tolerant trainable disposition
so i called
and and i asked them you know these are the ages of the kids what do i get
and they all said golden retriever
and i said okay
and the only thing that they could come up with was a bichon frize which is a
they're calm they're not yuppie they're trainable they're uh very personable in a different way that a golden retriever is
so how old is your retriever
oh she's about four
we got her from the uh humane society when she was a puppy
but she's a little bit smaller
well actually you know that's the breed standard for females
what you see shown and bred now as golden retrievers this you know plus eighty to a hundred pound range
but they usually run about sixty to sixty-five
and the ones that are shown they are inside that weight allowance
you cannot show your retriever if it's you know a hundred plus pounds
so don't say she's small
well she's got a brown nose instead of black too
but but we love her anyway
and we're expecting a baby this summer
but up until then she's been our substitute kid
and she was a lot of fun
well they are they are the ultimate dog to have around kids so long as your kid is not scared of a big dog
and fortunately it was just like a retriever
and then i've had a retriever
it was just gorgeous i mean just gorgeous
um and they both you know
both the half breed and the pure breed had the uh what i consider the the the perfect disposition
but you know what you know what scares me about golden retrievers
which is probably where yours came from people that don't know what they're doing and they breed them you know for a certain characteristic
and in the retrievers it happens to be they like them big for somehow big is perceived as the better
and when you start doing that you really tamper with you know the all the the years of uh culling litters
and and uh you tamper with what the dog innately is
when i bought my last purebred retriever i mean i looked all over because i wanted one that still looked like a retriever you know the short to the ground stocky golden uh trainable tractable quiet animal that could hunt and still be in the house
and i ended up getting one that uh came out of a a a hunting stock because i wanted one that could still perform like a retriever did
and i've seen an awful lot of
and i'm and i really fear for the breed because i love that breed
but i really figure right when it becomes really popular that it's
and those dogs have been having seizures
and i wonder since both of them are having them if it's some kind of breeding problem
and they bred it for companionship and uh uh disposition and and ability to hunt
but they selectively culled those litters i mean for many hundreds of years
and since it slept in the castle with its master i mean it had it had to be of a disposition
but they would go through all the litters and destroy the puppies if they were anything other than perfect
now you know that seems like a cruel thing to do
on the other hand you sure you know they sure created a a wonderful breed
i mean a wonderful breed
i i had never really had a golden retriever before
and all the other
we looked at some of the shepherd mixes and the puppies weren't very uh social and stuff
and we went to a pen of a little bit bigger dogs
and all the others were standing there barking and jumping up and down
and one dog would stand there wagging her tail and smiling
well i tell you
you know the the german shepherd is the classic case of what i'm talking about because in america that's called a rin tin tin phenomena
uh uh i-
but the third one is a children's dog
and there are distinct breeds in europe
now what happened over here was is that people saw the the first um which would actually have been a skutzhund which is what rin tin tin was
and everybody wanted rin tin tin
and it was known as a german shepherd here
so they created a breed standard the american kennel club did
that said anything that is a skutzhund a a tervurien and uh alsatian that's the other one alsatian any inner breeding of that can be called a german shepherd here
and what happened is is that people wanted this shepherd to shepherd and protect
and they bred a dog that i th- it's called a an animal's critical span which basically translates to how much shit will it take before it bites you
that german shepherd the american german shepherd here was a a a such an unreliable animal that the american seeing eye institute refused to use them
because they would turn on th- on their handlers
and even um uh police corps which started you know finding other breeds to use because this thing this this thing known as a german shepherd here its personality and its dependability and its reliability was just terrible
so about fifteen years ago the german shepherd club of america decided amongst themselves that they were going to change this
so they went back to europe and brought back some good examples of each of the three breeds and bred to a standard what they wanted an american german shepherd to be which is a very heavily now skutzhund and alsatian
and it's the alsatian that's the kid's dog
and they're just lovely
but you'll see
i mean if you ever start looking in papers now and you start seeing these ads for german shepherds they will say on them bred for disposition a k c conforming which means that their advertising that this is no longer an indiscriminate dog
and they had to go through and destroy a for a while there about seventy-five percent of their puppies that they bred
because they were looking for this disposition
and nowadays you you'll get you'll get a dog trainer to recommend a specific you know breeder handler
well i'll start off being controversial
but uh i still feel that it could be a deterrent to crime particularly with the increase of serious crime that's going on now
well i think that those crimes which are punishable by the death sentence need to be reevaluated
i think uh
any any crimes against person
uh i feel uh there should be more than a slap on the hand
and being sent to prison and being released in uh two or three years
actually i would like to see the system revert a lot back to some of the forms of punishment that exist in middle eastern countries
you know uh
i believe that uh
well it's just an an example
i think there's uh someone that's on trial right now here in the dallas area
and they were interviewing the the
a personal trial and the reporter was asking a stup- stupid question of the people outside
well how do you feel about this
and you know
how do they feel about it i'm sure that uh they want it over with
and they want the person punished and punished
i think that there should be no way i i realize that innocent people could go to uh what is it lethal injection now
but for every innocent person who would be executed hopefully there would be ten guilty
i feel like the the cost of s- someone who's quoting figures made the cost
at like thirty thousand dollars
and well the problem there is they're not keeping the right ones in prison in many cases
or this individual was out on the streets
well i don't have solutions to the problems
but you know you have these
this would be nice if
and there's probably thousands of holes in that theory
but i think that if you did something for example to an individual and caused them to lose the ability to earn a living i remember a man drove by randomly shot a woman in the head while she was driving
uh who has been harmed you you you know
and i s-
here again anytime anyone goes out with a gun in their hand and crime on their mind uh the opportunity exists for someone to get killed
now i'm not in favor of gun control to the degree or anything because uh there are uses for guns which are noncriminal but it seems that the criminal element are the ones that are using them uh aside from domestic disputes husbands shooting wives or vice versa
but these individuals if they have a gun with them i think that the the sentence should be even longer than if they don't
i don't i don't agree with the length
well but here again uh if a matter of expediency
there should be some uh
well i think that automatic appeal ought to take place uh within a reasonable length of time say six months
there's got to be a there's got to be a time limit
i think if it is appealed one time and the appeal is turned down or the sentence stands then you might be allowed one more appeal if it is if if it is
a a legit legitimate appeal
if and they're not arguing that the guy or woman committed the crime
they're arguing over well were his civil rights violated because uh someone didn't file the proper paper at the proper time
well one of the sad things is that so many of these never actually come to trial because of of the process in which the criminals were apprehended
i mean uh you know the guy is guilty
you you may have stood there and seen it
but because he wasn't read his rights whenever he was arrested you know
he he goes free
or some some mickey mouse type thing
and i realize that that is designed to protect the innocent
and uh i i just don't think that
and i agree
but i really believe that our justice system is is the best around
but it's not perfect
and that doesn't mean that you leave it in tact
well it's it's a case that we have a a legal system which the criminals have found a way to use and a way to benefit them rather than the public itself
so that's how we get caught in this uh sort of a catch twenty-two
but you have to continue uh to protect the innocent you're giving an open door to the guilty
and and it
and that just
i mean i can just get so
but you know it's it's going to take smarter people than me to solve the problem
and i hope
again one of our one of our problems is that uh our legislature and the state and our national congress the majority of the members thereof are lawyers
well uh if you had to pick a a type of music that you like would you be able to
well i could pick country music
uh are you from texas
okay well see
i'm i'm from chicago
uh i would probably go with
it's tough uh i think i would just stick with the classics only because uh i like music just for music's sake
so i'm you know part of that whole deal
and uh that was a real interesting time
and you know the music sort of made the whole time very rich with sound
uh but i think i'd stick back with my beethoven and my bach and my mozart
i mean because it's just
and i don't have to worry about you know what's current and what's not because i haven't been current with music for a long time
but you know same uh
and as far as country music is i've never really uh listened to it
i mean because that's just
so there you go
well i understand what you're saying
i think if you would listen to it a little you would discover that it has a lot of roots from the both from the classics and from some of the rock and roll of the era that that we both lived through
it's it's a different perspective on everything too
i i know well whenever they talk about uh country music it's about it seems sad to me
it's always about some guy losing some girl and then you know playing the guitar and singing about it
well there's some joy in it also
but mostly it it just tells a story about life
well i must say though uh i listen to amy grant
uh uh let's see well name some people that are country that i should listen to
well i kind of like uh i like groups like the statler brothers
i i must admit that's yeah they're fantastic
so uh uh
well i guess i i have listened in on some of the stuff and not really realized it that i do like some of that
uh dolly parton
uh uh how about the oak ridge boys
well i like them too
so i guess i've had a smattering
and i just uh you know picked
i've picked up a little bit along the way that i probably wouldn't have if i'd stayed up north you know
i mean i think life is just music
so you know you can hear it wherever you want
and uh and i've i've kind of shied away from some of the new stuff because i just don't understand it
but maybe twenty years from now they'll look at it as classic rock and roll which i really like
well it's just difficult for me to believe that anybody's ever going to make a a record of the rap songs of the eighties
so i mean it it it'll if it stands the test of time we'll see
and uh then it'll
if it survives then it'll just probably be one or two songs that sort of hey listen what we listened to
but uh you know i i think of
i get real tickled when i listen to some of these old beatle uh music you know the orchestration of it and that it's so popular still
and and uh you know all these rocks rock stations call it classic soft rock you know
but we used to listen to it full blast
so it's kind of funny the way we listened to the stuff
but i don't know
well you got any more
well the big key is that i think you've already stated that all music is rooted in the classics
and it has grown from there
well listen i have to run i hate to cut
well it was great
and we'll uh
and uh i'll look at some country
well i have two children and uh two stepdaughters
are you are you running ragged these days
because mine are all grown
oh they are
so the topic for me
i i can only rera- relate now to my grandchildren
oh well good
uh my daughter and her husband work saturdays
my daughter is uh uh doing a schedule of uh twenty-four hours on the weekend
but she gets paid for forty
and dave is uh in supervisory work
and he has to work almost every saturday
oh so she's a little one
she's she's little
is she ol- your oldest grandd- child
oh that's nice
now do your other grandchildren live in dal- the dallas area
you know being from plano you know i know so very few people who have extended family in town
and you know just so that they get to know their grandparents but also for help
we don't we don't have that luxury
but we have lots of friends
and and everybody tends to be in the same boat
so we we trade off a whole lot with friends and you know run here and run there
and we have three playing baseball
oh that's marvelous
well i know uh that uh one of the ladies i know they are very involved with their little girl
and and i think it's excellent because she's getting qualified quality time for uh her musical uh talents her sports abilities and uh i think because she is uh
but that hasn't been uh possible
and uh she's tried many uh avenues and and so now it's just you know that she's kind of resolved herself that yes this is going to be the only one
and she devotes
and they're focusing on all of her uh welfare
well our kids you know
uh my daughter s- uh sings with younger generation i don't know if you've ever heard of them
and they're part of the ch- uh plano children's civics civic chorus
and they're going to washington d c next december
oh how wonderful
so we have been really up to our eye balls in fund raising and trying to get uh
well that's wonderful
so you know and then she plays softball
and my son plays baseball
and my stepdaughter plays softball
so we we tend to do a lot of running
oh they are
things are very different nowadays than when i grew up and i'm sure when your children grew up you didn't you know
but we had more i guess family time alone where we did nothing
now i think every- everything is doing doing doing out of the house
and and sometimes i you know i kind of long for the good old days when
but on the other hand we just love watching the kids play and getting to know the other parents
and we've had a lot of fun with that too
you have to look on that on the uh positive side of that
my uh second grandson is in a cappella
and i know what you're talking about when he's involved you know the children are involved in that
and he's been
and they have won awards
and i know where you're coming from and it's it's very nice
i think uh uh those type of children uh that are involved in things like that their uh goals are going to be set higher than the average child that are not participating in things
well i think so
and and i think they've learned a whole lot about being part of a team whether the team is your singing group your band your your sports team you know you all have to pull together
a a a team effort
and so i've been real pleased with that too
i think they've learned some real good life skills uh you know being involved in all those things
that that's wonderful
that's really is nice to have in your background that you know then you can you're you can be very flexible
and uh there's less uh friction involved in relationships when you add that skill of teamwork
and uh i mean a lot of people that are adults are having to go back and learn those basics when our children are already learning that
and i think it's a step a a giant step of progress i really do
so uh i
oh that's good that's real good advice
well uh cathy i think if you look to the word of god and uh think on the things that are pure and lovely
and uh keep your mind off of negative things
and keep your mind on positive things
and and stress that to your children
and uh even if they're even if they're discouraged tell them that that's just a passing moment and to dwell on those things that are uh
and and when you employ the word of god there's nothing as powerful as the word of god
well i would agree with that
and my kids do an awful lot with that
and you need to return that back
and you owe you owe that back to god because he's given you that ability and that talent
and and that's real nice
you know that's that's real neat
well if she looks if she looks at it as you suggest that that that's that she can give her h- her talent back to the lord for his glory and she can look at it that way and and uh that's
uh do you work outside the home
well yes i do
uh and so let me take the lead uh angela
uh i think what is really important uh
and uh one of the things that uh she asked us to discuss was benefits
uh i'm assuming that you are married and have a husband that supports you
and so we could we could talk about uh that path you know how important you think his benefits are and and and uh how important you think they are and if what would you like to see increased in his benefits
the benefit of having eyeglasses for the family uh uh and how much coverage uh it provides and also your hospital coverage and uh um probably dental
i i think that job wise benefits are import- just as important as salary is
because they of course if you did not have them you would be pulling from your salary of course
and they always have surprises for you
you know and so it's it is uh
we could not do without the benefit package from from any company that we worked for whether they be a conglomerate or just a small
i think any any even if your insurance policy is not the greatest
you you would not be pulling it out of your account all of the time just by yourself
they are getting a handle on that in fact uh my oldest daughter is uh is uh a nurse
and she just received her masters degree
and she is now into consulting
and that's one of the areas that she is working on to have uh uh a day care center for the indiv- the children of the of the nurses that are staffing the facility
and that is true in many many areas of you know uh job titles and professions
like in may case i have three children
and it's just unfeasible for me to try to get a job because all the money that i would
it would it would be just futile
and it would be just
and they would not have the quality
besides which it would be easier uh there's a lot of single mothers out there now from divorces and a lot of
oh i hear
and to go to work you are worried about your child besides which you have to get up earlier to take the child to day care
and if they were in the same building then you are going to the same place
and you could go for your lunch hour down and visit with your child
or you know and take your breaks with your children or something
do you do you think that you should fund that if they have that as a benefit if you would fund that somewhat from your salary that you are getting
i think if if the company could not provide it all on their own
for the for the people that would be using it you know
but it would still probably be cheaper
with the company than than having to go
our if everybody you know pulled their own weight in it
uh and how how do you feel about uh let's see eye care
but uh we
it would be great i mean uh the glasses that
it depends on who ha- examines your eyes
if you have an an optometrist or an ophthalmologist
there's a vast difference in those two uh
well like my mother she has to go for testing cause she has got
well she does not have it
she is like on the verge of it or
and she has to be tested periodically
and and those are expensive tests
but you know for something like that it- that's just as bad as a medical you know
and you know we have uh needs in our life that are unique to us
and uh you know people have needs in their life that unique to us to them
i mean we are all different
now i would like to see betl- better
so that's it
and she's on vacation
but with the three children um orthopedic care um not orthopedic orthodontic care
because on on a lot of the dental insurance they do not cover that well
for the the orthodontia stuff
and and you have to really get them when they are young in order to have uh not uh a decent smile when they are fifteen sixteen years old
and they started having extractions at age eight uh because they just had too many teeth for their size mouth
and we footed the bill because there was not any such thing and when they were young
my middle child needs to have uh orthodontic he's because his his pallet is squared not rounded
and it affects his speech a little bit not not anything you know
but just enough that his bite is off a little bit
and it's like four hundred dollars
and my insurance is only going to cover like fifty of it
well i tell you i
it's it's less painful and less expensive
i i know
but it it's it's uh easier on the patient in the long run
i i would much rather that do that
well i think that's a big part of it
and i i think it maybe started because women wanted outside of the home
i almost think with our society and and inflation and the cost of things it's anymore it's almost couples have to work outside the home
but but yeah i think that's a big change
well i've worked all the time up until just about a year ago
and i just
and i mean i love my job
but i have four children
and that's real hard
and that's been a big deciding factor because i mean i never wanted to be a career woman
but as long as i wa- w- you know was going to work i was going to do as as much as i could
and i i wanted to stay home when i had kids
well i have two
and we would like two more
it's like we talked uh i don't want two more unless i can quit and stay home and take care
i mean even i
of course my kids are are a little older
but then you then you give up the money
of course you know everything you give up something
but i just
but i do think that's one of the major changes you know
my mama i remember her being home uh
you know she made breakfast in the morning for us
and if she worked it was part time
and it was work that was done while we were maybe at school
and she was there when we got home
you know and
well i've decided now in fact i'm just i'm substitute teachers aid which is a afar cry from my travel agent career
y- which i loved
but i'm i'm there in the same school as my children my two littler ones
and i'm home when they are home
and i'm just really hesitating
because i've i enjoyed my the first summer home ever
so like seventeen years with my kids
i mean well i didn't have babies or day care or working as a travel agent
and it was wonderful
and i think
of course their their ages they are almost seventeen fif- almo- well sixteen fourteen eleven and nine
but see it's such an important time to be home
you know my husband was raised uh
his his parents were divorced when he was young so his mom always worked
and he's like well you know what's the big deal about being home
well as our kids are getting older you know he sees it more
i said russ you don't understand what it was like to have her home or to if you needed
mom at school you know she was there to help
and and i want to be able to do those things
i think that you know it's good
you know sometimes i'll have the cookies ready when they
and and a lot of my boys uh my older boys' junior high friends will come over
and it's wonderful
and you know we are just
i i'm very happy to be staying home
but again i miss
so where do you see
well see that was one of the things s- the the question i think is
you know what changes do we see
and i'm i'm not sure i i see it go anywhere
if we want uh extra clothes the extra car the extra
and then there is the gas
and then there is the lunches and then the day care
you know i pay four hundred fifty to five hundred fifty
oh my gosh
and i would love
you you you talked about having the summers off
and i thought oh that would be so wonderful
and i love the little preschool they are in
you know so i feel good about them being there
but it's still not the same
i i don't see things changing really
and and it's terrible for divorced women you know who are forced to work who maybe don't have a college education
and i could get a real good paying job
if i wanted to you know d- in fact i still have offers you know please come back
and we'll pay you this
and it's been a real tough decision
but i'm very happy to be here with my kids
but i've been doing a lot of volunteering at the schools and playing lots of tennis
well we're working on it
and my kids of course will be in school then
and i can work part days in my husband's business you know so that
oh that would be great
he can afford for us to do that you know
i think the the other thing that that has changed for woman because we are working is we are having less children
that that's that's the state that got was famous when they
and we still have a death penalty
a gentleman uh that was one of the hi-fi murderers just had his conviction overturned well appealed again
i guess we have the longest uh running inmates for death row too
and then we had another guy uh ronald lafferty that thought god told him to kill his sister-in-law
he just got a a new trial because
uh how do you feel about the death penalty
could go either way you know
it it sort of doesn't much you know
it wasn't a strong issue um i guess it still isn't a strong issue
but i must say i find it very silly the way politicians are running around
well i'm sure that's
by by by saying well this doing th-
well i kind of a- agree with terrorism
and uh drug dealing um
terrorism definitely and uh selling out your country
it's not it's not enough just to lock them up forever
we've got these guys in new york that uh i'm sure you heard about the ones that killed uh the gentleman that came from utah to watch the tennis people
and i guess they got convicted the four of uh murder
um and i i do find it hard to dr- know where to draw a line
and so if i had to draw a line i'd say just no capital punishment
i mean i don't i don't i don't see that it accomplishes a whole lot
wh- what about the argument where where somebody who is committing one capital crime chooses to commit a a more serious capital crime
i mean murder um because that one at least you might escape from because his victim you know his witnesses will be gone
doesn't this doesn't this encourage
you mean uh violence
doesn't this yeah i mean doesn't this encourage murder in order to wipe out the the witnesses
well maybe it would
uh i kind of have a problem with our legal system at the moment uh as it is
i think that people who uh infringe on other people's rights uh and screw up their whole lives with rape uh child molesting uh terrorism just uh
but i'm i'm for it for certain reasons
and i think that things like rape uh you can't get over uh it takes a lifetime
so so if if william kennedy smith had been found guilty you believe he should have been uh executed
uh if it was
you know we have plenty of convicted guys that go into jail and come back out do the same thing and go back
and uh if they're habitual like three times caught for rape or child molesting then snuff them
well the problem is that they've just been let out of jail
but we don't seem to keep them long enough
and then they learn such bad things in jail
that's that's for sure
uh let's see
so the other question that they wanted was whether the place that we live in uh compares to how we feel
uh it seems like an unusual subject this time of the year
but uh it's it's camping
the last time i went camping was about uh in the middle of october
and we went up to lake bonham and really enjoyed it
well i haven't been in probably about three years
and the last time we went was in um well i guess it was it was like hunting season
and we went down to like a hunting ground and a lake lake sam rayburn which is in east texas
um let's see
what do you think what kind of camping uh are you talking about
and is camping for you in a motor home or a trailer
or do you actually put up a tent
so you have
one of the ones that you pull along and then pop-u- is it pop-up
so i guess we really rough it
and we really enjoy that
uh one thing uh i've done all sorts of camping
i've i've camped uh in the snow on a glacier
i've camped uh basically almost anywhere even to the point where we've had to backpack in and everything you carried in was what you had to use to sustain you for that that camping trip and had to pack it back out
so you're a serious camper
well we enjoy it yeah
but since i've been married and with a family uh we have to go where there's restrooms
well that makes sense
so we really enjoy it
but also while i was growing up we did have a trailer
and uh i camped in that trailer and in a tent and in in log cabins and so forth too
to answer your questions earlier yes i we do enjoy fishing
and i do go fishing
we recently moved from the rocky mountain area up in uh northern utah down to here because of work and uh haven't been able to enjoy fishing like i used to up there which is uh clear water fishing and streams and and rivers
but when you all went camping is that what you normally i mean
we normally yeah
we did we did a lot of the fishing
but mainly what we did was we did a lot of hiking and exploring and and just going out and seeing what there was to see uh in the area
i guess probably just wherever you live at has a lot to do with where what you're going to do when you go
and you do actually camp
did you ever like travel around to what's that the little k o k o a camps whenever ever done that
although i've stayed in k o a campgrounds uh we've never done that just to go around and camp
um personally i when i when we were growing up and when we were going camping i thought that was a little too structured of a camp ground
um you know that was mainly for people in motor homes or or had trailers or and so on and so forth where you know we really wanted to go camping in a tent and uh k o a is is geared for the people that have a hookup
and uh i started out basically camping when i was when i was in boy scouts
and we did an awful lot of that as as a boy scout group
and we camped in the snow and in uh snow caves
and and uh
and you got a lot of that in huh
um well let's see i just i mean i just like to go
and normally i go with a whole group of friends and we just kind of go and hang out and just do fun stuff
or um take a deck of cards if we can actually see and um play cards and stuff
you know lots a lot of people i've talked to have said well isn't camping boring
don't you get don't you uh get bored and not have anything to do
but i've found out that actually we we really enjoy getting away from the television the telephone and yes
plus you um
kind of makes you appreciate some a lot of the things you take for granted
and like i mentioned uh the we we've been camping a couple of times this year
and the last time was in october
and we went up to lake bonham
and there was a playground for them
so they had swings
and i'm calling from garland texas
because yesterday i talked to someone upstate i'm not even sure where
and my husband talked to the people in utah
so um anyway let me press one
so we don't do this too often
um most of my family's in california
but my husband's is in san antonio
and so we did this in san antonio
and um it was an experience that i i won't do again
um well it wasn't that big of a family
but um it just got out of hand
and um so many people were coming that we were trying to figure out how much food we were going to need and and um how much um beverages we were going to need and this and that
and oh it just grew and grew and grew
and um when the time came only about half that
so it wasn't you know
but overall we all had a good time
but it it just kept growing and growing and growing and growing
and we're going oh my gosh
well you have you have
and if uh uh they come from far away it's uh it it they take it more seriously
but uh we're kind of
well i have a a a brother lives in indianapolis a sister lives in chicago and my folks live back in buffalo new york
uh i guess we have reunions about once a year or so
my wife's family they're they're all in
they have regular uh regular family reunions every summer
oh those are nice
and i'm i'm sure they're a lot more organized too because they've done it before
and it's it's just something that they they plan on doing every summer
and every year everyone asks when is it happening and where is it happening and they just plan on being here
well that's great
they they had a family reunion for uh well for my mother-in-law at her seventy-fifth birthday
and they managed to get just about everybody everybody into town uh last november including a number of people from out in california
so it was a it was good it uh it worked out very well
one in- interesting thing that they did at the time is they um they videotaped the the whole shebang which it made a nice remembrance of of the entire party
so so that that works pretty well that way
my uh my grandmother in california is um
and um it seems like most of the family is uh going you know all the nieces and all the grandchildren and all that are most of them are going
but it's too costly for us
but anyway they're going to go on a cruise
and um it sounds really neat it really does
i i can go for that
i guess interesting if you had a a a very extended family that that kind of involved a lot of people that cousins and things that you don't really know that you've never met it'd be interesting to meet a lot of those people
uh i don't know how you would go about uh getting them together
but that that would be uh
and a friend of mine um she plans her family reunion um every year
and they go camping
and she says they have the greatest time
and she says usually everybody shows up in exception to maybe one person
but she said they all go camping
and they have a really good for the whole weekend
i kind of wonder what what kind of tradition we're going to establish for our family
i had hoped that our our kids get together at least regularly
uh i guess one of my favorite ones is cheers
and i also like the cosby show
i i i rather enjoy the cosby show
you know i've watched that one time
and it was really good
but now that's on what saturday night
uh around here at least
you know what system you're getting it through
and i really liked it
but i just haven't uh seen it you know watched it since
uh we we always enjoyed it
it it seems to be kind of halfway between uh something like all in the family and uh hill street blues
the episode that i watched uh i liked him because even though he's a law enforcement officer you know sometimes the laws are kind of ridiculous and you need to sometimes break them to get your point across and for a good reason
and he seems to do that sometimes
i think that's what first drew us to him the uh
i i like to watch like sixty minutes and twenty twenty
uh i know we uh we watch commish any chance we get
but that's kind of th- th-
it's gotten more and more to where they are so totally against uh anything spiritual
but uh anyway
i i used to be a used to be a real big fan of star trek
uh pretty much yeah
and star trek's in a s- or the uh star wars set uh one of the first star wars movie
i think i watched it some- like nineteen times
oh my goodness
uh i did at one time
used to used to read a read a lot of science fiction work too
but uh no
but that uh i don't know if you heard them or not i got a twelve year old twelve week old baby
twelve week oh i was going to say i hear a baby in the background
well we're we're
so i know we won't be watching as much as we do now
and we're both full time students
that that's that's the best way you haven't found out yet or anything have you
well we had a sonogram
but we told him not to tell us
so it's going to be a surprise
i mean it's like finding out somewhere in july what you're going to get for christmas
i mean you know
i'm sure we'll be watching more uh children oriented television shows
oh i'm about half kid at heart anyway
oh i am too
but the uh
well a couple of the uh ones disney's doing aren't too bad
well you know it seems like a lot of them are a lot more violent than they used to be
you know i remember like the flintstones and the jetsons
and those were just kind of good old cartoons
the the the worst of the violence in the flintstones was when somebody gave fred a poke in the snoot
but oh shoot i mean blowing up galaxies and and putting a curse on the whole planet or or or you know or on all the you know everything of this species you know just all kinds of crud
and they wonder why kids turn out the way they do nowadays
everything's mutations and and and killing
what was it i uh t n turner broadcasting network used to used to uh do the saturday morning and sunday morning cartoons the old cartoons they used to put between the first and second fea- feature at the theatre
those old little ten minute jobs where uh the real ballooned looking art work you know a- and
oh so what would be the your favorite meal to cook
uh got kids
well uh- my wife and i and we've got a thirteen week old baby
so don't do much cooking for him yet
so i guess it's supposed to be dinner party is that what they said
and uh what kind of dishes you might have for it or some sort of thing like that
you know uh something light and easy
if it was pretty in- informal about anything
sometimes we'll have uh we'll have a bunch of people over and cook deer
and it is good
either that or hamburgers we really don't have dinner parties
we just had uh deer stew sort of uh it was deer steak stew
uh some veggies in it
the times i've been out deer hunting i i can go out in the woods unarmed and deer will be tripping over me and vice versa
i mean i get close to the woods with anything resembling a weapon
and suddenly there isn't a deer within fifty miles
uh guy was in a uh in a hunting club and you know
but the whole group goes out hunting
and then at the end of the day they split it and whoever brought it down gets the lion's share
and the rest of it is split with the rest with everybody in the group
oh well that's nice
well he wou-
they they went out last year and almost everybody got it the limit so there's everybody had deer coming out their ears
they they gave us some deer
and some of it's still in the freezer
we we either crock pot deer
or we'll uh you know put it out on the grill so that uh the bulk of the tallow will dribble off of it
we usually have most of it made into uh hamburger meat though
and cook you know spaghetti with it
anyway uh no
i think if i was going to have a dinner party i'd probably have uh sandwiches or something along those lines and then uh uh you know just something light finger food sort of something or
oh well anyway
uh we don't do much in the way of entertaining
we had a uh a turkey loaf
which uh kind of taco turkey loaf
uh scalloped potatoes
mashed potatoes with uh m- cheese melted over the top of them
um sounds good
oh don't you hate that
i've got a i got a few pounds to lose myself
i was left the fourth grade weighing about a hundred pounds and started the seventh grade grade at two
this is a a subject that i'm not real well versed on
well let's talk about air pollution
or where are you from
i'm from the uh
well i have some small experience in this area
the brown haze that you see if you look down central towards downtown a lot of that is uh tied up with the oxides or nitrogen although some of the kind of bluish gray stuff we see sometimes is tied up with particulates
but uh the one of the major problems that dallas has is oxides and nitrogen
that's because of all the equipment that's being operated but at the same time uh because we don't have we don't burn a lot of coal and solid materials we
uh power plants since
many of our local power plants uh are natural gas most of the time uh the things that come off of those plants are carbon dioxide and n o x
and we pick up a little bit of sulphur off some of these products
but gasoline of course now the lead's out at least theoretically uh i guess you could say we're picking up some sulphur because a lot of the fuels does have sulphur
and that's uh course hydrogen sulfide which is when you burn gasoline you also produce some water vapor and that goes back in with your sulphur
and under the right condition you get h two s
but anyway uh
well you are you are well versed on the subject i tell you
well i don't know
uh ron a lot of this is caused by the fact that cars sitting in traffic tend to run rich because the way the pollution is
and when they run rich they they spit out a lot of hydrocarbons
and that's another part of the problem
but uh hopefully if we ever get our road system fixed up this will get a lot better
oh i don't know i've lived here since seventy-four howard
and i d- i think i think they been working on the highways around here since i've been here
and i think i think they'll be working on them long after my wife and i are gone
well i guess i not trying to top you but i grew up in dallas county and i can remember when they built the north part of north central which was built after the south part of central
and uh i can remember coming over the hill down there long about uh i don't know little bit north of mark- mockingbird on up in over those hills
and i said i wonder if they'll ever need this road
course it was designed for most of us to go about forty-five miles an hour because the short on ramps and are off ramps
seems like uh those ramps might kill us yet
you know you get out on the uh interstate highways versus
and traveling from like dallas to austin to san antonio it's the same thing as far as the pollution created by the automobiles in the in the stalled traffic and the busy highways you you you're at your best
and i guess when you're out on the interstate
i tell you what i i don't think i really have
but i'm going that way tuesday
and i'm going to make it a point to
well sometimes it depends on which way the winds blowing but uh i also travel a little bit
and uh i don't know it just seems like there's a certain point down there where you can breathe easier
oh i know
i know going to uh uh
oh okay great
and quite honestly with the exception
i do uh quite a bit of sailing
you know our subject is on boating and sailing oh do you well great
i own a sailboat that i keep it parked up on the scout lot of my scout troop
and we take it out
and we do some teaching of sailing with the scouts
well that's neat
so it's hard for me to get it somewhere
the guy that used to live next to us in richardson before we moved twelve years ago or whatever he had a sailboat used to park it right in the uh driveway
and it seemed uh
i think it held probably uh
it does have a little kind of cabin thing that you can store things in but you couldn't really sleep in there unless you sort of stuck your body out the hole
i i understand
but but it's
oh they are
and you know we have a swimming pool at our house
and i think of all the time now that my kids are gone and away and married and going to college or whatever that i put in there i just could not imagine a boat because i know it's a lot of maintenance
oh gosh yeah
power boat then there's always uh stuff to go wrong with it
but you still have to worry with the hull and the condition of the sails and spars and rigging uh everything that's in it
and we used to go out with them and back then they had bought an older chris craft
and we were involved every weekend in just uh
but their boat slept about four people plus had a little kitchen
but i think that was the last time we were really involved
and that was twenty years ago or twenty-five years ago
it's a lot of fun i think uh just from the standpoint of
and when you work hard and you're under pressure and everything all week long a boat can be a lot of relaxation uh to especially with a group of friends and cook out or camp out or whatever uh or a cabin or something depending on how much you like to rough it
but but it's uh
and our daughter and he had a place on lake of the ozarks
and he had a boat
and they they go boat
i mean they go
they just go across the boat and get a and tie it up and go in huh
and that was sort of neat
that that that's true that's exactly how they do it
and that was sort of a neat setup
i'm envious i'm envious of people that have the big boats
uh once i get my son into and through with college he's going to be starting uh rice next year
so he's going off
but uh once i get to that stage where i'm not paying for something else and uh i don't have to worry about a lot of other scheduling things where i've actually got the time to go out and enjoy it uh i might do something differently
keep it and maybe consider getting a a better one for me uh
uh the sailing part of it i like because it's so quiet
and if you get a big enough one then you've got a little motor on it also where if it's light wind you can still putt around a little bit and have fun
or if or if the wind dies you're not stuck in the
and you're just stranded out there trying to pick up what little gusts you can to work your way back in
oh i know
and and that gets hot and and wearisome
and putt putt
and if you h- if you're a big enough boat to have the little auxiliary motor on there at least you can kind of drop the sails and putt on back in
well that's neat
i own an insurance agency a managing general a wholesaler of insurance uh out in addison
and uh i'm a scout leader though
so i'm i'm out with
so you have a son
uh he's thirty-seven
and i don't know if he's ever going to have any or not
but i do have some neighbor kids lots of little neighbor kids
i go out and uh i play ball with them
you know it's because like this one that lives right next door her mother does some work at home on computers and it just seems like she doesn't have any time for her which is kind of sad you know
so the kids are kind of hungry for someone to play with them
so i will go out and play catch with them or you know we ha- let the dogs outside
and they will roll around on the ground and play with the dogs
but uh actually i do think that the parents should have you know a little bit more time to spend with their kids
when when your son was at home did you uh working
or were you able to stay at home with him
when my son was at home i i did work
and then he went to a baby sitter that this lady had about five other kids that she baby sat you know but we always had our days off together
and we went camping on vacations
so we had a lot of time together that way you know
well when my mom uh
but she worked nights and uh as a nurse
and so she was always home for us and i always i really appreciated that having her there when i was you know when i came home from school and when i worked
but now when i look back at it it must have been a really difficult
well i am sure it was you know
but uh i don't know what the families are going to come to now days because they there just doesn't seem like they do have time for their kids
because most most of them the father and mother both work you know
so it's really rough
uh i have one neighbor that's uh the father is a fireman
and he works like four days on
and it seems like he is suppose to come home for like three or four days
but he can't make enough as a fireman to support his family you know
so he's got a second job
so he's you know he's not home very often
and that's you know
uh a family without a father it's it's uh a really hard thing
yeah you know
and i don't know
i i suppose they are trying to get through to them that well daddy is not home because you know he is out working trying to make some money for you know we can buy you this bike and that toy and so forth you know
so are you planning on to having any children
but we are
we just got married like like december
so we are going to wait a year
well that's good
then we will try
that's what my uh daughter-in-law told me that they were going to have kids probably after two years of marriage
and they will be married nine years
so i don't know
she's a nurse you know
and uh she has brothers and sisters that has got lots of little kids
so maybe they just decided that uh if they wanted to have kids around the house they would just you know call one of their sisters or brothers up and tell them to send the kids over for the night
well we really want to have a family
we feel like that that couple you know you are not giving enough of yourself
and you should you should be sharing your family
and giving your values you know making something better of the world by raising up good kids
give them give them an edge
but we feel like like the first year needs to be devoted to uh making the family the couple strong and secure in their love for each other
but then a family is is definitely a high priority
uh do you plan on staying home after you have your children
or do you do you work or what
well well i uh i am in i am in a different situation
i am a missionary and i am home on furlough
it called like
and i come home for a year
and then we go back for four years
but my husband and i will do the same job
and we will be living in in africa
and we will be working together
so uh we will we will share the job of raising the family
i mean as a mother i will have certain responsibilities that he might not necessarily have
but still we will share that job
but we have
then we have decisions that we have to make that are hard about schooling like do you want to home school your kids on a computer program you know that kind of thing or do you send them away to boarding school
and if you do that when do you do it
and that's a
i uh consider myself a hacker
well i'm into it uh
uh i'm not as good as i'd like to be
but it's a
uh i'd started playing when i was in elementary school actually
and i'd go up there with friends after school a couple of times every week
and then for uh
and then i'd started picking it up again a couple of years back
and i've really been enjoying it
that's kind of the way i did it too actually
i i played uh just a tiny bit when i was real young
and then uh i w- i got on to a team in high school but wasn't very good still
but and then quit for awhile
and recently i picked it up like you say about a couple of years ago
and uh i've been playing you know off and on when i can
up in minneapolis it's not too easy to play in the winter of course but i actually live in florida
so uh uh i'll be going back down there in may and hopefully be picking it up a little more regularly
i mean it's a great game
but i mean to play a really nice course you've got to have a really big wallet
that's that's true all too many times
fortunately uh down where i live in florida there's some golf courses that are pretty reasonable if you know where to look
uh one of them is the university of florida golf course which is open to the public
and that's pretty pretty good
i uh attend the indiana university
and it's the same way here
can you get like a a student discount type of thing
uh a little bit but not a whole lot
i mean i you'd think you would
what what what are green fees run there
uh well they range anywhere from about five bucks for your basic city type course up to fifty sixty dollars for a really really nice course
and i can play for free there
and it's a pretty nice course
oh that's super
and i guess well it's free for me
but not me
well that's the way to do it though
as far as watching golf i mean i can watch it on t v
but it's kind of boring
it's nice to see those who guys
they have such good style that uh it's uh
because once the guy hits the ball and they got to try to follow the ball
i mean it they do they do a generally okay job
but like you said it's it's kind of boring actually
i uh had a chance
they had the p g a tournament up in indianapolis last year and i was able to go and see one of the rounds of that
and that was really fun
i mean you knew it i never really thought it was would be that much fun to go to a big golf tournament and watch
but man it was it was something else just to follow those guys around and actually watch them play
uh you know looking at it on t v you're thinking man
but uh that's that's wild though
you got i mean it's uh it's a lot more exciting than actually w- than watching it on t v
and if you pick a group of golfers and follow them around i mean it's just watching them the whole time instead of like on t v you get to see them make a tee shot and then they go off to some other hole
and they come back when they're putting
but you know it's really something else
uh i'm a student right now
oh you are
which uh which university
at uh indiana university
uh i don't really know
i mean it seems like that that would be an okay life just to hang out
what was what was that movie that they had out
and i i can't remember
well you know it seems like well you go to work every weekend play maybe one two tournaments a month you come in about tenth you'd still be doing pretty well
but uh yeah
i guess when i get back i'm going to school in florida actually
uh and fortunately i've been able to to play some golf on a student budget which is
but it it's unfortunate you know
i guess you know it's it's like two hundred fifty dollar minimum or three hundred dollar minimum just to like to practice even
and those fees to join a club
like a million dollars or whatever is just that is out of control
i guess they have those uh driving ranges that are actually stacked one on top of the other
i i played uh uh eighteen holes with some japanese guys in in gainesville as a matter of fact
and it was really wild
you know they kicked our butt all the way to
do you work with a company that uh gives drug testing
i'm a i'm a student
and they do a little bit of drug testing
oh they do
uh they they do it before you go in
and occasionally they'll have a a random urinalysis
oh they will huh
so you can't be smoking marijuana in in the military anymore
i don't work right now because my company i worked for p i e went bankrupt but uh they was getting a program set up that for all new hires they was going drug uh give them drug tests
but uh they didn't hire very many new hires because all the people that usually work there you know just stayed there because it was they had been there for a long long time
i i believe they should too
you know uh i don't think anybody needs anybody that's to be working for them that's on drugs of any kind
but uh i don't know whether i believe that they should just randomly do it
i think they should kind of warn them like you know well we're going to do that or maybe tell them before they do get hired you know that this is what is going to happen
and then if you don't like it why then you know you'll have to go look for a job someplace else
but after you
well i suppose you are right there too you know
uh personally i
i know when i was doing my uh basic training in a i t there was guys who would fool around
and then when that urinalysis came around they would be all scared
so it does work it is effective
the only problem is you know if you have done drugs but you've stopped and uh you do get caught it is kind of kind of harsh
well i suppose they fire you and everything right then huh
or what do they do with you guys if that you guys get
uh we get counseling
and uh i think part of our pay is docked if we're first time offenders
oh i see
i i haven't
so i don't know
well i don't either
i think anybody that does them are dumb you know
and you just watch it on t v and see how it just burns your brain completely up you know
re- really dumb huh
uh what do you think about our uh like uh other government agencies testing
i think they all should test really you know
uh it just seems like there is so much more of it going on anymore that i don't know what's wrong with the people uh
but i think that the the government should do something about stopping it completely
you know they just slap somebody's little hand
and you know well don't do that again
oh i know
and and then th- you know they'll get out
and they're right back at it again
right now it is it's too lucrative for the drug dealers
so th- the risks are worth it for them
but uh other than that why i don't know
like i say maybe one of these days i'll get a job because i am looking still for a part-time job you know since my company went bankrupt
and i'll see what they do you know
but like i say i i wouldn't care because i i don't i don't even smoke
i wonder what if you take medicine if that would effect it
oh see that's
sometimes some medicines will give off a a false positive
i've heard of i've heard of that
see now that that would be really unfair then huh
but they should be like if you get if you get a positive they should double check you and still give you the benefit of a doubt
find out what you know if you have been taking some kind of medication and you know if that would effect it and everything
but uh well i guess that's about all we can talk about
well it was nice talking to you rose
and maybe i'll talk to you again
so we keep a monthly budget
and we try to stick to it
it it's really difficult here all because there's always something breaking
car needs tires or you know something
uh uh we do ours more monthly than long range
uh we uh
and out of his check they take a savings
and out of my check they take savings and retirement both out of both checks
so as far as extra savings we really don't have that much extra to save
uh his check once a month
oh how nice
my check weekly buys groceries and gas and you know that kind of thing
and it works out real well that way
we don't run into a lot of problems but budgets are horrible
and so we pay all of the little bills uh one paycheck and then like the mortgage and the electric bill you know those big bills the second second pay
and then again he does have a savings that comes out you know for christmas and stuff that kind of thing
when the car insurance is due and you call the credit union and tell them well send me some money
it uh it would be nice if we didn't have to touch the money he has taken out and put in savings
but we do
but it's nice that it's there you know
uh neither one of us has had a raise in a couple of years
and of course the cost of living keeps going up so much
and i keep saying my check does less and less
and it seemed like we spent more
then a lot of it was going to uh daycare and that kind of thing
so it just seems like with me staying home we had that big cut
but we save more
and i don't know why
but we it seems like we do
well i uh i know that since i do work i buy a lot of quicker cuts of meat and uh well the frozen things for the microwave and things like that
and i'll stop by the deli and pick up uh chicken or whatever where if i did not work i'm sure that the grocery bill could be managed a lot a lot uh better
i i don't i don't know how it comes out
well i'm sure you do
uh i do not well i do not have to pay child care during the winter
my son's old enough that he likes to come home uh from school
but in the summer he's still young enough that i cannot leave him by himself
and ours is seventy dollars a week plus all activities and that's usually movies one day skating one day
so you usually end up paying close to eighty dollars a week
and that's a lot of money
but you know if they're going to be in daycare then they need to have some activities other than just being there
and the other one's two and a half
well they're expensive too uh just the outgrowing of their clothes
so i'm sure the budget
and it does add up
and medical bill
although the insurance we had was good uh when thomas was younger a lot of the stuff had to be paid up front
and then you were reimbursed
so it was nice when you'd get a couple of hundred dollar check from the
but in the meantime you had to put out the money first
well that that's that's hard
but i'm enjoying my stay home for the little time that i can
oh i would too
i would i would advise anyone that could possibly do it to to
and that's what's so sad
well you probably wouldn't want to do it forever
and i'm perfectly happy
well let's see
i haven't got mine yet because my parents are getting all that stuff at uh at home in the bay area
so i'm not sure how much i'm getting back
but i'm pretty sure i should get back a little bit since student
but as far as writing checks out and paying taxes i think it's pretty high
but i i'm you know
i i guess it's where we have to be where it
it it's one of those necessities of life that we all have to you know pay taxes but although it is kind of a pain sometimes though
you know that that's that's scary too
because it's not anything like the way it was when i was young and small and a child
so you know that that's a scary part too that you have to think about
like as time goes on you know things get more expensive
and because we were increasingly complex society that day by day things get more uh things get more expensive as well as more complex
and you know
i mean everything from you know from medicare to uh to social security to uh to feeding the h- to uh to you know feeding the homeless to maintaining prisons to maintaining polices or fire departments and things like that
and you know it's it's becoming a larger
and that's us
and then you find out about all these things about are your taxes you know taxpayers are is your money going to where you want it to go
and there's going to a special this week
i i can't i can't if it's twenty twenty
uh i think it's one of the local news
and that's kind of scary too
and uh so that would be interesting to see
and and even even today it's like the amount of taxes that you know we're paying for
but you'd think that we're still in that
this this uh deficit state that
makes you wonder when there's you know countries out there that have you know tax rates of like close to fifty percent or higher
you know it's like fifty percent of everything you make is already gone before you even get it
and that that's kind of a scary thought
but on the other hand they also while those countries that have high taxes also have things like uh
so everyone has everyone has the access
and it's good
but it's it's the price they pay
well you sure do know a l- a lot
well just keeping up with the times that's all
as as it turns out you know it's one of those one of those interests you know i kind of like to keep up on
because well it's nice to know that when i'm actually you know i do start working that i like to know where my tax dollars are going too
work hard to get you know
what do you think about these items that are going to be uh taxed even more like uh tobacco and that kind of thing
i think in a in a way it's good in a way it's not
uh but i think in general
i mean a lot of things like tobacco and alcohol and things like that have been have been in the past uh have been not taxed because there's been such a large lobby against them against the taxes for them sponsored by the alcohol and tobacco companies
and it's things like tobacco are uh they're they're a proven health hazard to smokers as well as nonsmokers
as far as the safety thing in like in san luis obispo for example there's an ordinance which states that uh there's no smoking in any public areas
and so if you walk into any restaurant or any hotel there's no smoking allowed anywhere
uh i just currently quit my job
and uh i think one of the uh my
the second thing is uh because we have children
so it would be
and and uh right now we have probably some excellent benefits right now
and uh i don't know if you're familiar with them
but we're real happy with them
i've had a variety of different jobs with a various types uh in the computer field
and so i've seen a variety of types of benefits
uh i've worked for for for awhile
and they are you know a really academic type of place
and then i've worked with regular you know industry type places and then with others that are kind of half way between and stuff
so i've seen a wide range of both you know nonsalary type benefits and other stuff you know like health care that's either fully or partially paid
and you know some have like bonuses
and others have had lots of vacation time but not much other types of benefits
and so yeah i would
uh and that's one of the big things that we always look at you know when we when i think about t- changing jobs is you know you know what kind of health care they have
and does the company pay for it you know all or partially
or how does that work
and uh also uh vacation time too is a is a big one for me
uh and i guess support for whatever whatever other
you know kinds of professional activities you have at you know work
uh cause i've been at places which offer a lot of support and others that don't offer any and some that sometimes that's coincided with a place that offers more vacation time though
so that's not so bad you know
you know it's kind of a give and take kind of thing i think
uh i say that health care is probably definitely number one though
want to just you know all your salary can't
uh and and and another good thing is with the health benefits when they give you more than two choices
and that really helped us out a great deal
but my husband does get vacation
and it's worked out really good for us too
flexible hours are are pretty important to me as well
uh cause that makes a big difference
and she works uh as a assistant manager in a fabric store
and so she works a lot of evenings and weekends
and so two days a week i uh manage to get home early enough to meet the kids on the bus
so she wor- you know goes in early those days and works like you know noon til close
uh so we have
well that's great that you all can work that out
and being on a you know
and i think it's kind of neat to be able to spend the afternoons with the kids occasionally too
i mean usually you know you go to work before they're awake or as they're getting
and you get home
and it's already dark unless it's summer time you know
and even in summer time sometimes you get home so late that there's you know you can't do anything with them
and especially in the winter i mean you g- get up in the dark and come home in the dark
it's like it's like a vampire sometimes
it's the same with my husband cause he's got pretty flexible hours if as long as he puts in the hours he needs to do
uh well is there anything else that you look for
i think some of is how the uh you know
i guess it's not really a direct benefit but how your uh performance is rated and stuff like that at work
cause i've been uh
especially in large corporations you can really you know wind up getting having you know real problems i've found out
i've worked for a few you know several thousand plus
and it and especially if you're doing like professional work where i- you know it's kind of
i work with uh computer systems a lot
so it's kind of hard to say you know
if you're you know a brick layer somebody can look and see you know well yeah you laid you know fifteen thousand bricks today
and they were all straight
and your building didn't fall down you know
but if you build computer systems like well you know what does that computer program really do you know or especially if you write like papers you know
it's like get a painter you know or something a artist
it's like well you how do you really rate you know michelangelo you know
how would you tell if he was you know really good or so-so or whatever
and that does make a wan- a person want to stay
the uh type of cars that i was uh i would be most interested in if i was going to buy another car now would probably be something like a uh mazda miata
uh the uh
i'm very much a a fan of sports cars
uh uh though actually in som-
actually if i h-
i'd rather put my money into uh
and uh uh so uh
but if i was to buy one probably something like a miata
uh well i have a i have a nineteen eighty uh eighty-five c r x
uh which is you know it's
but it's it's actually it's kind of annoying cause i've got no reason to replace it
so what do the miatas run
oh those are
they're about uh uh thirteen to fourteen thousand dollars and you know a bit more if you add some some options and so on
well that's not too bad
and they're they're they're they're so nice to drive
uh uh it's it's it's nice
and i've also driven one at a something mazda put on where uh they went to uh autocross events across the country uh which is where you race in uh you race on in a parking lot or something like that with a bunch of uh cones to see who can get through the fastest
uh you know about a minute or so
and uh very twisty stuff
and oh it handles so nicely
and so you've done this
it it's just so smooth
you you don't get involved in uh car decisions
oh not too much
and he wanted to drive that van and travel and wanted everything in there t v you know the whole bit
but i never drove it
so it just it wasn't me you know
oh i'd want a minivan
because i'm with the kids all the time
it it's small enough that it's easy to drive
you pick up i pick up my little one from preschool
and the whole parking lot's full of minivans
but you know i i drive a little subaru
but i just wanted to hold on to it cause i just really enjoy that
and uh that's really all i needed was for something just to go here and there and back
and uh i've driven it a few times
and uh i- it's nice
of course you know my fam- my family has always had cars like that uh in that you know my father's had a had a always had a v w bus every since uh nine about nineteen sixty or so
he he used it
and pulled the uh the little trailer behind
and uh it's
so it's really amazing how much a minivan c- you know what it can do
and they're not that expensive
mainly because everyone makes them you know
and we we do a lot of uh driving
and so that's the only time that the that the uh conversion van came in handy
but it really didn't cause our our kids are still little
minivans d- do pretty well
you know twenty twenty twenty-five miles per gallon or more
there there's some other cars i'd like
but i u- u- i would never be willing to send quite that much money for uh like uh uh
uh mandatory service yeah i don't think it's a good idea uh
because we'd have to change the constitution to to uh allow uh involuntary servitude uh in service to the government
and i'm not sure that we could
i mean they might be able to ah say that anyone who does that uh gets certain benefits that
but to use force uh
and you are not a free american citizen
and when someone is say out of high school and not sure about college or out of college and not ready to go into a career and they're not committed to huge amounts of debt that's the best time to be able to do work that doesn't pay very well
and i also thought that uh that would interfere with with college work
and they didn't
you know if someone were studying something take something obscure somebody was studying economics the state department could offer to send them to the soviet union for two years to teach them how to run their country
but in reality i think what you would wind up with is a political football where they would see all these body counts that they can use to for their own will
and i just don't think it would work
what what year are they looking at
well they're not
and it's sort of a topic of debate
and the people who are proconstitution oppose it on the grounds that the government shouldn't even have the right to enforce you to join the military unless the united states is actually under attack
so mostly it's just kind of one of those things that goes away
ah they've got a noisy line
well it's somewhere between here and there
uh what age group i- are are they looking at
uh oh eighteen
if it's my line uh
maybe that is that's part of it
they they figure that they can draft you at eighteen
and that's the
and of course they're this one the women would be equally grabbed
and they're almost on the verge of saying that you if you're going to draft men you're going to have to draft women
and you're going to have to put them in front of the guns just the same
so uh if you're near that age
but i do have children to think about you know
and you don't want them sent off to the middle east to help defend bush from saddam after bush gets done arming him
so it's another thing
hey you're in perot country
and then i find out that he helped rid the united states of the gablers
he's he's helped out in a lot of ways
he's he's from dallas
or he's in the dallas area
and uh he's very well known around here
well i'm in the computer biz too
so i know he's well known in the industry
i i have high hopes for him
and i think that
i mean in the democratic primary i'm going to vote for brown just because i kind of like brown and his attitude
but when uh when it really comes down in the fall i think i know where it's going to go
i i think he's got a very good chance
so there's a lot of people here pulling for him
so i don't know
you know th-
how did you uh you work in the uh computer business is that what you said
uh my husband works for uh texas instruments
and so uh that's how we found out about the switchboard
oh that's their project too isn't it
so air quality
i know in here uh downtown dallas it's you i mean you drive by and you can just you can see it
but then again
and uh there is a big difference between texas and california
and uh they'd have their smog alerts and where you'd have to stay indoors for so many hours with an air conditioner
and of course they don't have that here in texas
you mean they don't have the uh the smog alerts
not in not in te- well not in dallas that is
i i yeah i spent a summer i- i- in tyler so i know just east of dallas there
actually i'm a california born person
so i know what you're talking about
i know that they've they're looking at uh uh you know uh you know better running automobiles
uh some things they do w- w- one of them is they're using corn in fuel
well that's big up here because of the they grow a lot of corn
and the uh
unfortunately it still contributes to global warming cause you have to you know wipe out forests to grow corn and things like that
one of the most uh productive crop in the world is corn
and of course i doubt if there's any
they're they're looking at
there's some work being done on uh automobiles that are electrical powered
but it has a a engine in the back that charges it
so the engine kicks on when the batteries need power
and it turns off
interesting thing about gas is when i mean about battery powered cars is when you're at a stop light you're not using any
i mean it's either on or off
there's there's a race in australia with solar powered cars
and ford and general motors and all those compete
i think that was a a a setback
g m uh chrysler announced that they're going to they're
well they actually have an electric minivan
their their caravan
but it costs uh fifty thousand dollars
and they're they're very expensive too
but you know people are buying them
free you know free for them
well it doesn't make sense
because if they want people to convert you know
so it's a good good vehicle
um well i'll tell you
sometimes it's it's pretty bad here
i don't know if it was if it's just uh the allergies or what
but some days it's r- very nice here downtown
and other days it's just really bad
so i don't know
so what what kinds of things did you experience in l a when you were there
or can you remember
oh i wasn't there too long ago uh
cause i haven't been there probably
well you know yo- going over the hills you know coming into the valley
well we were there when they had a
uh i tell you what i'll start off
um i personally think to set a mark with the judicial system and we're talking about criminals criminal cases that they should bring back hangings on weekends
um but i think if we quit uh building these taj mahals with the color t v and sixty dol- sixty thousand a year to keep an inmate in there on a on a on a life sentence we should start hanging them and get it over with
and let's just screwing up the system
well the sentences are so unbelievable
i just saw on the news last night that they said the average time a sentenced murderer you know is in jail is two years before he's paroled and a rapists is like six months
and a burglar is like two months
because they just say there's either no room in the system you know in the jails for them
or you know it's just that it seems like the automatic sentences if if a judge has leeway on what he's going to you know sentence someone for between you know two months and fifty years and you know what's his whim to decide it should be two months
you know it's crazy
an and the way the law reads uh if they sentence you to life in prison then he's available for parole
so what you know
well even if it's life like you say we end up spending sixty thousand dollars a year to keep some you know joker in there for life
we could spend that money you know for children that are starving or twelve million other things would be more useful than that
so to me if somebody has life you know beyond a reasonable doubt they should that should be it
you know particularly for some of these really i mean
it's not just like one instance or something it's just uh horrifying some of the murders that go on
i mean the guy is really
just shouldn't be allowed to to even even live
uh about the issue about sentencing by the judge
and bam bam the guy got off
uh he was he was a veterinarian and killed two a father and a son okay
uh it kind of gets back to the second request
we've been asked to look at is most criminal cases requiring an unanimous verdict
there's a certain perc- percentage of the people there with sixty percent of the people uh seventy percent of the people said hey
rather than have to retrial the whole whole thing and spend all the money for people to uh you know go back to court and all the lawyers
and i mean it just winds up costing the taxpayers a you know a fortune to keep doing that
and the victims you know the family of these people that have been murdered they just have to have it dragged on for years and years before they ever get any resolution
because it's not next day they have the start the trial it's x number of months and just prolongs the situation that much more
i think that that if it's if it's not a split decision go with the highest number
and let's just get on with the program
but as far as the sentencing by the judge i would have to vote against that since there is a jury because that's what the juries are for is to make the decision
uh what are your feelings
well if i
and she just has just really stiff penalties
and i saw that in in the hands of a judge that really was conscientious and really you know took the pains to give a sentence for what was deserved it could you could have a a judge that would really make a good impact
but likewise you could have the flip side and have some judge that was paid off or you know had go- a good old boy network
or for whatever reasons you know politics just let all kinds of people through
so he he would have a heck or she would have a heck of a lot of power you know if used wrongly
so at least the jury system does something to prevent that you know or help it with it anyway
but seems like the jury system does have it's advantages
but i also i've also heard on trials that sometimes they go through like three hundred jurors before they hand pick these jurors that they think are going to be the ones that are going to be the most lenient you know
and i don't know how much they're getting just a jury of their peers at that point they're really getting a select group
it almost should be the first twelve people that they you know have on a list
and that's it
i get back to price's comment when he uh was found guilty he said well he didn't have any blacks uh you know from his neck of the woods
well give me a break you know
i mean you're you're in dallas
uh like in a murder situations they look for juries who don't know anything about the system well or know anything about the the occurrence
you'd be you'd either have to be in a cave not to know what's going on or moving it to lubbock
oh they'd have to move it to taiwan for people not to know about it practically
well this has been an interesting conversation
well really this is breaks up my afternoon from changing diapers and mopping floors i mean
so you're at the house you're not at the plant
i'm at home with two little ki- preschoolers
oh that's good
but i wasn't sure
well i'll let you get
well as a matter of fact i was thinking about that the other day
and uh i really don't know the answer
uh i would sort of like to uh think about something in the way of uh uh sort of a sporty car but not any not you know a luxury type sporty one
but um something that still has a lots of amenities and you know gadgets and things
oh you do want a lot of that stuff
i like i like some of those things
what kind of uh things are you going to consider
you know what uh you said something about the about the
well what do you call them
but what about um their reputation of the company or the price
well of course i guess uh price is always the big consideration
but uh um i have preferences for uh for some uh makers over others um
and i would sort of like to buy american
but you know i'm not so totally hung up on that that
well um the last car we bought was american because of because of that reason
but have not been entirely happy with uh several things about the car
because several things minor things sort of
but still they cost us money um that we didn't feel like we should have had to pay on a car that that was that new
um well well well under two years we had to replace the clutch
and they just said well you know clutches are disposable
and i said since when
but i never thought a clutch was disposable
so that was that was kind of a shock
i i guess there's a lot to to think about when you're trying to make that decision
you know the less actually the less you spend on a car it seems like luxury cars
they're called luxury cars even though they're much more expensive like like uh uh a mercedes benz
but on the other hand i guess too uh whenever you do have to have some major work done on one of those it costs a fortune
oh i don't know
i've uh worked with a couple of people who have owned uh various years uh
and even though they do a lot of the work themself then just buying the parts and everything is is pretty expensive
but for them it's it's sort of a hobby too
or like what things are you looking at
well i haven't re- really gotten that far with it um
but uh oh i guess i really don't know
i've been kind of um
and i know that a lot of people i've i've known that have had toyotas have been just extremely happy with them that hardly had any problems at all
i think they have a really good uh quality
my uh daughter has owned two different ones
and uh you know we've had some work done on them
but it's not too bad
and the reason
one of the reasons we um bought the first one was because a friend of ours had a toyota that he just really drove for years and years and years
and he lived way out in the country
so he put a lot of miles on it
and you knew it had had been through a whole lot
and yet you know it it held up pretty doggone good
so i don't know
i'm i'm not ready to buy a new car yet
but i don't know if if the next time i'm going to try to to stay with buying something american or if i'm going to go for a little more what i would consider to be a long-term investment
and i guess you know you always have to think about things like your gas mileage and stuff like that you know
oh it's easy to get gas mileage in this car
well enjoyed it
well go ahead
and i was thinking that you needed to put some waivers in there for the handicapped and also for people that had to stay home and maybe be wage earners for their family
or they had somebody at home that was ill that they had to tend to
i mean you can't make it everybody
but then you need to make it sure that the rich people can't buy somebody off and and maybe send them in their places or get out of it some other way too
or it could be like the draft where you know before they draft you they ta- uh you get a physical anyway
so when they send you a draft notice and then they give you a physical
and if there's nothing physically wrong with you then you're drafted
and then we could maybe give physicals to the rest of the family members
and they all had to pass
uh i thought it a good idea too though would be to extend this and make people that are accepting public welfare have to do something along this line before they got any money
and uh if they did this maybe help them out in their college cost
and maybe they could pay people for doing this at least something
so they co- could subsist
well that's true
america's paying all this money to have other people give uh aid to other countries
so they could be paying their own people and training their own people at the same time
because actually when you when you do uh service overseas you end up learning something usually that's that's really useful plumbing or farming or or something like that
so you're really learning a skill
and you know all these old people they would get out of this right
so what we could do is take all the retired people that are going around in their big mobile homes and they could do public service all over the country
i i think well that's probably the idea
well i thought it would be a good idea if maybe you took some of the kids and had them go over to other countries
and children from their countries came over to ours too a trade off
and other than that i can't think of any other ideas
i like the idea of uh being uh a mandatory thing for welfare
course that's what um
or was it roosevelt
i can't remember um
oh with w p a
getting people uh
the the work program and all the all the make work jobs
and we're still using those things too
well it's real pretty
you know with all the spanish moss on the trees it's really it's eerie
i been uh
i got uh talked to someone else before that was a uh a texan
but i guess that's uh that's what we're going to have
this is uh a t i experiment to see how talk
oh that's neat
it is neat to get other people especially since you got other uh ideas about how people uh how people react to things and stuff especially when it comes to um social services
uh uh i'm glad they have a lot of uh um you know topics on social services because like this thing this is a pretty good idea
i wonder if they thought about it themselves or whether someone somewhere is really thinking that uh it would be a good idea to have everybody spend some time in public service
and i uh i can't remember who it is
but there's a really famous
politicians pushing it or uh or mitch snider or mitch snider
well see that's a d c thing
mitch snider is the the advocate for the homeless that uh he he's said it out here in washington
but he started the um uh the movement for creative nonviolence
and that that was basically a you know donate time and money to uh help the homeless
the other topic was like i said uh something about politicians
it was what meal would you cook for uh uh special dinner
another one though that was good was uh what do you think about the social changes for the last ten twenty and thirty years
and what do you think has caused some of the social problems
and we had to talk about air pollution too
and what should we do about it
well that would be sort of interesting because then you get people from other countries i mean other parts of the state you know
of course pittsburgh would say you know oh find the better cheaper ways of burning coal you know
and people in the south would say don't burn coal you know
because we don't have much coal
oh we have a lot of coal
but uh it's uh it's a dirty fuel that's for sure
well how did you get into this program
and they uh sent it out in our bulk mail so that if any engineers wanted to participate you know
so does your company have something to do with t i
um not really
i mean no more than any other company you know
but uh no no real association with t i other than being in the same industry electronics industry
they just uh they just sent out a letter to everybody they do business with saying that you know if you're interested we're doing a study
and and since
and do you know how much how long this is supposed to go on
i mean it says just keep on until
and they'll notify you
at first i was thinking it was just a week because that's all it shows you know on the schedule
but then it seems like it might be longer than a week
so what do you think we're going to get
oh i don't know
get your own you're going to get you own t i seven thirty-two or something
oh i didn't hear about that
oh your not
and she saw this on her computer and thought it might be neat
so she ran off copies of the thing
and i just signed up for it
oh oh that's a neat idea
well he's gotten a good mix
so so probably knock t i profits margin way down
so we're footing the bill on our taxes
well i enjoyed talking with you
well thanks a bunch
well i'm going to try to clean up the house after my two children for about an hour see if we can walk around
we'll i'll talk to you
last thing i saw was um i think uh sleeping with the enemy with julia roberts
oh i hadn't seen that
but i've heard that it's real good
it was a little strange you know
this woman supposedly is um being mentally abused by her husband you know
and she figures out this way to um to leave him secretly
you know she fakes her death kind of thing
and he tracks her down
so the the end scenes are are kind of suspenseful you know when she realizes he's in the house you know after her
but uh kind of had the feeling along that uh
hey look bucko
but anyhow um what have you seen
well last week as a matter of fact my children was on spring break and we went to two movies
and we went to see kindergarten cop
and i really liked both of them
awakening was it was kind of sad to me
and it would it would be to anyone because you know they really don't know that much about it
so this is where the people have been kind of
and the drugs let them come back
but the drugs didn't work for long
and they started having real bad side effects
and this is about nineteen sixty-four i believe or something like that
and there still hasn't been any you know new development in prescribed drugs that can help it
there you know
it it was a big breakthrough
but in time you know the all the side effects started showing
well how bad were the side effects
they was actually went back like they were
they wasn't mild you know
but i really enjoyed it though
well how about kindergarten cop
you know arnold schwarzenegger is getting to be uh a bit of a variety actor you know
but he's kind of branching out
as a matter of fact um sylvester stallone is that his name
i really believe schwarzenegger is really going to be a varie- variety player more so than he is because he really played the part good
you know he could be this rough tough guy and then you know this substitute teacher
well there was a movie out
and there's this thing with uh danny de vito called twins
oh i've seen that
it is it is
i even like some i mean some of the original stuff
like i like the terminator
at first you know it was kind of strange
but i still like watching him in the terminator
and and some of the other things
um total recall last year i thought was really good last summer
but i thought it was pretty good
i'm not into that you know
and i i have some
and i just keep telling her how can you do that
and i told her when she had her her little girl
and she says her little girl's into it now
oh my goodness
and she wat- she watches these really gross things you know like
and the you know that kind of
i remember when i was real little i we all went to some kind of scary movie
and it was like this ho- big house had a basement
and there was all these weird things going on in the basement you know
and i was scared to death of our house had a basement for years
and i got a lot of really weird ideas
you know they tell you that kids can you know be impressed by all that stuff
and it's true
i i had a lot of things that i i
oh i don't want to go home
but i think a lot of kids it's funny get the same kind of fears like there's somebody under the bed
i know uh
i really do because my youngest one he watches something you might as well just plan on staying up all night because you know
so they're you know
it's just a movie you know
but i remember i was with a friend of mine had uh three kids
and the little boy must have been oh maybe about ten
and we rented charlotte's web
and he just bawled at the end and just
and we were trying to say kenny it's okay
and he didn't want to listen to it
he just was beside himself you know
oh i guess that's why the actors and actresses make millions of dollars
people like us you know
well well i've enjoyed talking to you
and maybe we'll run across each other again
i've just been called you know by the switchboard
and uh well the first week i think a lot more people were doing it
but i normally get a call like every other day
well as far as
you know from where i'm at
they said it would be up friday the march the fifteenth before it was prepared
so i missed several days because i was getting quite a few calls
um how weird
and they they do have a variety of topics
i was going oh well
well my husband sometimes you know he'll receive a call
and he's at work
and if i you know if i know the topic i'll go ahead and accept it as mine
but the other day i got one about fishing
and i thought oh my
so i'm not even going to try
because when they listened to that tape they would have really had a good time
say well i know it takes a fishing pole and some bait and some water
but i'm really not for sure though if
well i'll let you go
and we'll talk to you later
um have you ever been involved in any trials
two years ago i spent some fourth of july to labor day on a jury that was uh a change of venue from columbus ohio for aggravated uh murder and kidnapping
it was quite a session that distrup- disrupted my whole summer of course
but it was an absolutely fascinating experience
oh it sounds like it
but uh my father-in-law's been involved in uh several trials including uh a couple murders and uh you know talking to other people who have been there
and so i don't have any real experience with trials
but i do you know
i i've i took a little business law in in college
and and i've you know
but uh m-
i think that the uh trial by jury is is a great idea at it's inception back two hundred years ago
um right now though it's it's so difficult because there's so few courts to to get anything really done as you know you spent you know a whole summer on one trial
and it's just that i think they're just tieing up the um whole judicial process
um there's a lot of things they could do to uh make things easier and uh you know like uh the suggestion that uh maybe be uh a judge should be the one who decides on what the sentence should be rather than the jury
well i think that there are many cases where uh the judges probably do make the decision rather than the jury
our situation was somewhat different uh in view of the fact that uh we haven't we were a landmark case
it was the first time in the state of ohio that um d n a testing was entered as evidence
and they were being
the judge was being especially careful that everything was done correctly so there couldn't be a a mistrial of any kind
uh the um uh the interesting thing was the tremendous selection of jury process uh that we experienced
that took one full week uh to get forty-three people qualified to sit on the jury
and then it was a matter of the selection of uh twelve people after that
actually it was fourteen because we had two alternates
and the judge was extremely concerned for our welfare if we were well if we were comfortable and uh things of that nature which made us feel good
uh and we were sequestered
but the makeup of the jury uh was truly a cross section of uh you might say a cross section of a country
um one was a former student of mine a few years before who was out of work uh
um a couple of them were housewives who had never worked
and then some are people who did work
so we had quite a cross section of black white and women and men
and uh it uh it was interesting just to listen to the rationale uh being proposed and the logic of some of the people uh
and we were not allowed to take any notes of any kind
uh and i thought that that was a failing because uh from the standpoint that it was difficult to try to remember everything
and and yet the judge said well um if you're taking notes you're missing something
and he was right
but uh i certainly um
i think it depends upon how the judge handles the case and if the criminal chooses to have a three panel judge uh a three judge panel i should say i think he can
uh would surprise me that uh
when i was in texas i had the uh displeasure of getting a uh traffic ticket
and um i went to court
and you can even get a trial by jury for a traffic ticket
and i thought my god talk about tieing up things for for
i mean that's extremely expensive
i mean the first thing you had to do when you came before the judge was waive your right to a jury trial
i do think that that uh
but i'd i also feel as you said that the original concept of the jury as it was originally setup uh back uh in a hundred years ago was fine but that it needs to be more refined for today's standard of living and the the uh level of education of them of so many people now uh
by the same token we had um uh some people who wanted t- had vacations planned
and one man in particular had reservations made plane tickets made everything
and the judge called and had it all canceled so he could get his money back
and then he wasn't selected on the jury
oh my god
and then another young fellow had to meet with the judge o- and the prosecutor and the defense attorneys on three different occasions before he was finally excused from the jury because his wife was about to have twins
and they had he had to go through all of that if in three days to get excused from that jury to be with his wife on the birth of the twins
and uh you know some of it just seemed rather extreme
i i think they can probably come up with some ways to insure that uh you know people would get a fair trial
i mean some things are just so cut and dry
um in the in you know the the level of evidence that they come up with now i mean you know when you start thinking about well they've got video tape and and audio tapes
and they've they've got you know they've got ways to nail people
to the point where they they really shouldn't even be going to trial
well i guess he'd have to be careful whether with entrapment or some of those things
but uh i don't
oh that was horrible
and uh you know
and that certainly uh cannot be said to be uh something that happens everywhere
but the fact that it can happen that it probably does happen in many places it's it's horrendous
and it's just a stroke of luck
that someone was able to get it on tape and then uh to listen to the tape recording uh at the police station of the whole conversation afterwards
i mean i only heard portions of that
but it's absolutely
and you know if you beat a dog like that they'll put you
well we get a few other case
uh like up at the end of last year where one police officer it was on a drug raid uh was trying to extra extricate um a confession or information from a drug dealer and did so by placing a hot a hot iron on his chest his bare chest burned him
they wound up paying him uh
but they paid the defendant uh three hundred thousand dollars or something to drop the lawsuit
and then last week someone shot and killed the former policeman
so uh as
some of those things uh are absolutely horrendous
and we do need an all- an overhaul
and we just need more discipline country wide
i i believe that too
well it's been very nice talking with you
well it's been nice talking with you
and uh good luck on on calls
well i was just looking around my house and thinking about the painting that i've done
and the last time that um we tackled it i did the kitchen
and i had gone through a period of depression at one time and painted everything a dark
anyway so the kitchen was one of the rooms that got hit with that color
and it was quite a a feat getting that dark a color covered and then just the hassles getting around the cabinets
and know if i look underneath my cabinets i'm not satisfied with the jobs i i did on it because there're splotches
but i'm glad it's done because it's brighter
well we uh
and we bought a house at the same time
and we're about halfway through the painting process
so uh the only uh
i guess the the big discussion just kind of what you were mentioning has been the color
we ended up with our our living and dining room are now uh kind of a a light peach color with uh
and it's got all the old original hardwood trim and stuff
so we've got the trim in kind of uh kind of an off-white
and this is really the first uh interior painting project that i've attacked
and it's it's been uh it's been something else to say the least
we we had the same type of situation
uh the walls were uh uh
well they weren't
but uh there was semigloss underneath and we put a flat over the top
and everywhere you'd miss there'd be this little bright spot you could see
but uh we've learned
we we uh we worked we've worked our way back into the hallway
and and we're in the middle of the bathroom now
but uh it's it's been quite an adventure
and uh we we've learned to be a little more careful about covering up the floors since the since the first
so what are you going to get it off with if you get it on and it's dried
well it's it's not too bad
it it uh
and it's really not to bad to get off
and it's not too bad to get it off once it's dried even
it it it uh comes off with like a mild abrasive pad like a scotch-brite pad or something like that and wa- and soap and water
so we got pretty lucky on that
and it's not scratching your floor
oh that's pretty good
we painted every room in this house some of them like two three times
and they just
and then i have been coloring my hair
and i'm real haphazard when i do it
so i've got dye on my bathroom door
and i haven't figured out how to get that off
and then we have a two story
i mean i i couldn't stand the back side going up that high on the ladder
we uh our house was painted as part of the purchase contract
so we didn't have to mess with that this time
but i've i i grew up on a farm
so i i've i've messed with outdoor painting a little bit uh
but most of that it was done with a sprayer and uh up in the bucket of a loader tractor or something like that
so it took a lot of the hassle out
and then they're
we're not you know you're not nearly as concerned with a barn or a grainery or something like that as you would be with your own house
uh a little bit
oh we got to do that this summer
just just the opposite of what everybody's uh working towards now
we uh we stocked up the first time around
but we've definitely got all the formulas on file
and uh we're they'll be there for a while
we're we're pretty comfortable with that
but yeah it
i'm i'm real nervous every time i i open a new can
i'm wondering if i shouldn't buy about twenty gallons at one time and keep it all in a in a washtub or something somewhere because i'm alwa- i'm always afraid that the next coat is not going to match
but uh it's gone pretty well
it it takes it takes some time
but i'm a self-proclaimed proclaimed perfectionist
and it it takes me a long time to do trim and things like that
and i'll find i'll find something as i'm going along something not related
like like uh i've gone about changing out all the outlets and switches because they they really didn't match
so i always pick up these little extra tasks as i'm doing this
and i'm always doing all this other stuff
and my wife's hollering at me and wondering what else i've come home with from work this time to to put in a ceiling fan or something strange like that
so uh it it it always
it it it gets you to look at everything real hard when yo- you start putting a coat of paint on everything
oh but i still feel good the minute i put that paint on
oh wha- what else can i tell you about painting
oh and i get it all in my hair too
it's it's been uh
we we bought this house with the idea that we were going to spend you know spend a lot of time working on it
and uh it was part you know
part of the excitement was was getting a good deal on an older house that just it really hadn't been taken care of very well
it it was actually
so we uh we ended up getting a fairly good deal on it
but uh there just isn't enough time
i i i fi- find myself going to work knowing that that there's a job about half done at home
and i really
if i would if i'd just stay home and finish it i'd feel a lot better
but uh i'm i'm starting to learn that there's always something else
and and you make up all kinds of excuses
uh not a whole lot
they're they're in pretty good condition um as far as uh major repairs you know lo- a lot of little filling holes and nicks and things like that
but uh the only
the most major things have been uh oh i guess i i moved a couple of outlets and er uh switches i should say
um that's smart
and uh yeah
and i i didn't like that very well
so i i moved that
but uh most of it most of it's in pretty good shape
so where do you live
uh live in dallas
uh i hadn't tried
in fact we were we were planting flowers this weekend
so uh i was pretty tied up
well i've never tried any other kinds of painting besides on a surface like the house like to paint a picture or anything
and it hurts your arm
i get a so- i get a sore neck from looking up all the time yeah things like that
but you're glad you're doing it
it it just
like i say th- the overall appearance of this house is what really devalued it so much
uh i you know i i don't want to put a price on it
but i just feel like we're every every gallon of paint adds a tremendous amount of value to the house
you know ev- every time i do something aside from that it just makes me feel a whole lot better to come home an you know o- the walls are clean
and they match and all those kinds of things
it uh it sometimes works
and it sometimes doesn't
it's a uh
when i start doing trim i i've gotten to where i i tend to freehand it because ther- there's so many layers of paint on this house after forty years that uh it it's so hard to tell where an edge is anymore
see we've got carpet
and i haven't figured out how you're supposed to paint it on down so that you won't see where you stopped off and still not get it on the carpet
because every time you move that edger then it gets the carpet into it
well you know um
i i've p- i've seen uh
they're they make some plastic edging stuff that comes in like three foot lengths
and you can uh you can tape them together
and and and put
what do you think about uh the way the criminal justice system handles trials
well you know they tell you that you get tried by a jury of your peers but you know it's pretty hard to try let's say the man down the street that's living on social security or somebody that's on a limited income to be tried by a jury of his peers if most of the people
like the juries that i've served on are businessmen
now they don't understand that you know maybe he needed fifty dollars
so he held up the seven eleven
so you know i think that it a trial by your peers should be exactly that someone in your own age bracket
someone that you know you can't really do it ethnically you know
but you could do it you could probably get it a little closer
but then there's another thing that i disagree with in texas is sometimes you have a jury of six
and sometimes you have a jury of twelve
and i don't know why they do that
well i think the six is called a grand jury
and that's mostly to decide whether or not the person's actually going to stand trial
whether they're acquitted or whether they're actually going to be accused of you know
in texas i noticed since i've been here in twelve years that they they break up the the trial and then the sentencing part of the trial
i i think that uh
well we know there's a few out there
it seems like if you break the sentencing away from the jury and give it you give it to one person you're letting there be a whole lot more of an opportunity for something to either go wrong
or for you know
if if if the judge is not of high moral standards he could be bought off much easier than twelve people could
well i don't think you know i don't think that if i was the criminal that i would like the judge passing sentence on me
and i think it's
then two weeks down the road we have to sente- sent- excuse me set a sentencing date so now we're back in court again
and that's more money spent
it's not so much that i that i haven't seen a lot of really bad sentences passed either by trials or by judges
what bothers me is that uh they really don't mean anything
and yet you know the the parole system it's going to let them out in in three years for good behavior
and it's not working either
but where we're at now our jails are overcrowded
oh i think they're all overcrowded
and it's overcrowded
so now they start turning them loose
i think i heard fort worth that uh they've been ordered to do something because their jail is so overcrowded
i mean they're not allowed to accept any new inmates
so what are they supposed to do with people that they need to put in jail
well the way it seems the way it's been working here's
and i i really like the system of house arrest where a a
someone's wear someone wears a bracelet like a ankle bracelet that's a monitor
and they they keep
and they are not allowed
i mean th- some of them are even allowed to work
they're instructed uh so that this this electronic monitor is turned on at at a certain time
and it connects them up to a system where they know their whereabouts
and uh they can put a
and when the parole officer calls to check on them they're instructed to turn it on and stand in front of it
and that's working rather well
to actually continue to be productive members of society while they're you know
and that way it would give you know
the probation department and parole department they've got to be overloaded with as many criminals as we have here in in lubbock
and that would give you know
i i've really
and this may sound cruel
but i do not think that they should be allowed cigarettes
i mean they're in jail for crying out loud
and there's another thing about the justice system that i don't like
and there's a lot of people that tell me that that maybe my thoughts are wrong
i came from california and when you're in jail they take you out just like they do in alabama or anywhere else what they call a chain gang
and they clean the city parks
oh i think that's a wonderful idea
and they clean the city streets
but you know we have criminals in jail that do nothing but sit on their duff all day
and here it costs us seventeen to eighteen thousand dollars a year to support a prisoner
and i know
but i know families myself that have three and four children in lubbock that don't make that much
and they're not you know they're not doing anything to support themselves
the thing that the thing that gets me is that while we're supporting them
like i don't know
some percentage like eighty-five percent of their wages should go toward their room and board figured on a whatever basis how much it costs to actually support them for a year
and when they get out they should have a i don't know you know some reasonable amount of money to start like a couple of thousand dollars
but there should be a limit over which they that it all goes back to the state
anything that they've earned while they're in prison should go back to the state except for that you know there needs to be some allowance for when someone gets out that they have some money to start with
but at least they would at least that way they would be helping pay for their own
and something else that i would and something else that i would like to see is is uh victim reimbursement you know because they you know like you say these guys are in jail
and they're working
but the guy that they messed over to get there or they stole something from or beat to death
has nothing you know
our our victims are victimized period
and the law has no no uh regulations to deal with that
they they know how to deal with the penal system
and they know how to deal with the criminal
but they don't know how to deal with the victim because we as citizens i guess haven't laid anything up there for them to deal with on that aspect
but i sure don't
i i strongly disagree with any judge passing sentence on a person himself
i think it works much better if it's if it's the actual jury
because well th- see the jury is dealing with the seriousness of the crime
but you know if if they figure there's maybe litigating circumstances or something like that whereas maybe the judge does just doesn't care you committed this crime
so i'm just going to throw the book at you
whereas the jury may have a little shall we say sympathy you know
but you know why did he do this
is there is there a basis for it
cases tha- it would work that way
in some cases where the judge says okay i'll give you you know two to three years
the jury would would slam them
and and i think that that the jury probably has more of a right to sentence than the judge all the time
well they have a stronger debate too because there's twelve people there
and then they can sit in th- at the same time and decide what his punishment would be
and you'd have more than one person's input on it
and you know we're supposed to be and i quote in a democratic society
so you know if you can find me guilty then you ought to be able to pass sentence
and a lot of jurors
but you know a lot of jurors may just sit there and say yeah he's guilty
but i don't have to deal with it from here you know
so the judge takes care of all of that
but it would be a more responsible way to deal with it
serving on the jury would be definitely more respo- you'd have to be a definitely more responsible person
the thing that i i don't really like
i i don't know if uh a lot of jury selection processes that i've seen have been a
um i think i think we should have a balanced budget even if it means that services are dramatically cut back
uh uh but bet right this moment you probably have several loans out
or you have borrowed money against your credit card or something master charge
but see our whole system is built on owing not borrowing
but that's the problem see
but uh uh without it people wouldn't be able to own automobiles
or they wouldn't be able to own a house
we might have to you know just be able to
i think if we a generation went without debt then the next generation
like if if our our generation
my husband and i we're twenty-eight if we lived our lives and didn't become you know indebted like you know our generation before us that um the budget would balance and that we became accustomed to living with what we could afford which we wouldn't be destitute
i mean we wouldn't be living on the street by any means
but just compared to how spoiled we are we would be in our own minds
but i feel like the generation after us would
oh man it would be so good
but then they could learn to live with what they could afford to save to buy
and if you want a nicer car than that well you save a little longer
well now i agree uh i agree with you one hundred percent
uh but i still go to right back to what i said
but see we made poor choices in college
both of us had twenty thousand dollars in loans for student loans and i look back on that
and i bought shoes
and it would have been a little rough
but i did not need it
and as i look back now now we're paying that back
but don't take out ten thousand dollars in loans
and i don't i hope don't think he'll have to do that
but i just feel like if we didn't have those loans we could have saved in the last five years the money for that
and i believe we would have because god's really put it in our heart not to get in debt you know
but we have friends in church that do this on a constant basis that are totally debt free
and they pay cash for everything they buy
and so so i guess i've seen it done
and i know you can do it you know
but you have to drive that old car until you get that money saved up for that new van
and that's where americans don't like to do it
and so and we don't want to cut back our services from the government because we're spoiled
well i have one way to suggest reducing the budget
and uh uh take some of those holidays away from them like columbus day president's day
i mean they they get all these days off
what a a week i think we here at t i get a total of eleven a year
and that's about uh three or four less than civil servants get
because i always think the mail never comes on these days
and you're like well what is it
well now don't forget the mail is something else again
but isn't it federal in the federal budget
but isn't it part of our income
that's why it keeps going up uh
you know i could i can remember the days when it cost only three cents to mail uh uh uh a letter
and that is a good short term thing though
that little things like that that
overall though i just think we're just going to i don't know see
i guess i'm kind of leery of this topic because i know that bush is real for the new world order the one world government and alleviating all you know national debt between all of the nations
but i see that to be a potential power problem later with um who's going to be in charge with this new world order
and i you know i'm uncomfortable with that much power being in one place
but i know we already have a new money system
and i've seen them
and so i know that the long-term vision for the u s government is to alleviate all national debts and to start over afresh
but i'm concerned with who's going to have the power over this new world order that they keep talking about you know
and so um i guess because i
i'm kind of like you know yeah the only answer is to start over or to totally change our lifestyles
and i don't think americans are willing to do it
well what about uh uh sending all this money overseas supporting other governments third world governments
i don't i don't feel we should loan them money
if i i wish our leaders were really seeking the lord on these things
and if we feel led to give a country money to help them fine
but i don't feel we should be loaning money like that
i mean it doesn't work i mean
well in so many cases it's not a loan
but it's not but it's not set up as a giveaway
and it was something that i mean our our president and our leaders could be seeking god saying god is it your will for us to bless this nation with this money
and i believe if we gave it no strings attached that god would bless our nation
but because we're our motive is interest our motive is not pure it just backfires
i mean none of these nations have paid us back
but you understand it's i guess it's a principle of giving and receiving
and they may never give you anything back
but because there's no strings attached it like gives them a freedom to give us something back
and it might not be money
it might be um no taxes on our things our computers going into their nation
but it would be come back
but because we're loaning it i think that's the problem
and i don't mean give it to everybody that asks
but i think if we gave to a few select ones that really needed it that it would work out better for us and for them
and so now we have all these nations that owe us all this money
and so i just think we're never going to get that back you know
that that's true
i i understand that france still owes us money from world war i
and uh world war two debts have never been repaid
and said well we'll cancel it just like they did to the that polish debt here uh last week
uh uh half the countries of the world simply canceled the poland debts to help them
long long term though do you think it would best to see a one world you know
or do you think it would be better for our leaders to just start seeking god on how to turn our nation around financially
well uh i've got to respect your opinion
or do you disagree
or i mean what do you think long term
well i don't believe in a single government or a single control for the world
uh that's asking for trouble
i mean you could travel from one coast to the other here in the u s and find a tremendous differences between the peoples
so therefore i don't believe there could be a single government for the whole world
there's too many societies involved uh
uh oh sure
somebody said years ago well let's make it english uh international language
we've got too many uh uh immigrants
my grandfather came over from lithuania back uh just before the turn of the century and uh as a matter of fact he's a draft dodger
he uh was supposed to serve some time
well he did serve his time in the uh in the militia
and he came back
and his father said well if
uh tell you what um i'll let you start
excuse me i uh wake up to it in the morning
this is my i guess my prime time for news first thing in the morning while i'm getting ready to go to work
oh i quite frequently glance through headlines or in the newspaper
but uh primarily mine is t v news
i have to have to agree with you um
i normally don't have time in the morning to to watch any type of t v
usually catch it going to work on the radio or when i drag the paper in from the front and it catch the head lines which is normal what you see the night before on the evening news
so i've i've kind of
so it's kind of hard sometimes to watch t v during the night
but i usually try to catch the ten o'clock or um
i have to say during the war we're the american public was probably flooded with too much information
and as far as the sub question about the was am i satisfactorily covered i have to say yes
but when it came to the war issues who's telling the truth
between the channels there was uh the casualties the amount of missiles launched were different
and it was almost too much information over communicated
well that's true
uh let's face it
today's uh means of communication we could a newscaster could very well giveaway a piece of top secret information
and uh pat himself on the back for for uh making a good scoop
um but i would have to say across-the-board i'm satisfied with the way uh the news is spread
um of course here at texas instruments uh the rumor mill runs rampant
and i check that everyday
uh i don't think much of their sports coverage
but uh that's all right
i'm not outside of pro football i'm not too interested in other games other sports anyway
but the uh t-news is a good way to keep up-to-date
uh anything else crossed your mind
um but you need to continue to read so you people learn to read you know
well i spent twenty years in profession commercial broadcasting radio and t v
and i know what it takes to get some of those little bits and pieces of news on the air
i mean there there are times where uh the reporter actually will risk is life life and limb
and uh well i remember one time up in nashville tennessee
but he was lucky he got out of it for some reason
because he was carrying a camera
uh they left him alone
well i've enjoyed speaking with you
did you get your catalog on your your gifts
so it kind of sparked me to keep calling
well i'll be looking for it then
excuse me and uh i do that
we recycle uh newspapers
we take you know the dallas morning news daily
and you know after a month of that you got a ton
newspapers and uh glass
we don't you know like we don't drink milk
and we don't have children
so we don't have you know six thousand plastic milk jugs
a month you know
with two a two year old and a
so it really builds up with us
but there is you know there is a place you can take those also you know at the same place just put them in a different uh container
and uh plano has plans
the city is going to leave uh receptacles at people's home
and they ca-
and they can separate it
and then the you know trash guys will pick it up
which would really be handy you know for people like shut ins or
people who can't or don't drive you know
or it just builds up so often
and i'm sure rather than try to uh ask someone to take them for them they probably just pitch them you know
but i think that's probably a good idea
they used to have several places um that were a little ways out in the community that did the paper and all
and they stopped doing it because they said it wasn't profitable
so finally um they the people put so much pressure on the city
and they took a big huge bin that has paper and plastic um
and th- they it just really
e- e- every time you went by there it was just over flowing
and so wal-mart complained
so they moved it behind the store
and nobody knew where it was
and so people kept piling stuff in the same place
oh it was just like a dump there
and so finally you know i called
and the- they said you know it was behind there
and i started taking my things behind there
so we do that with because we have milk cartons you know constantly
but it just builds up
it would be so nice if they had it you know at your home
where you could just turn it in so they they final had enough of a response that they decided to try a small target area
and they have pickup there
it's uh i think once or twice a week
and the first couple weeks they did it nobody got their stuff out
so they had not much participation
and they were going to cancel it
but then finally people started getting the message
and i think that you know if they can get enough going
they'll continue it you know throughout the rest of the city
but it's not
and it's not going to be
i think basically it's a good idea you know
i do to because it's amazing how much you know trash
and they gave you a little um seedling to plant
you could take the the mulch home with you you know and take buckets of that home
so that was really good idea
and there's just you know the two of us my wife and i
and it's amazing how much stuff j- just the two of us generate
you know i can imagine a family of you know four or five
as far as new stuff to recycle you know i don't really i don't really know
and now their saying that e- originally they thought the disposables were just awful
but now their saying that they're ther- really not that much in comparison to the others because you don't have to use the water to wash them
and you know all different kinds of things too
so i don't know what's the you know right thing to do
but i really would hope that they would come up
but the landfill have to do something special you know for those
but that just generates a tremendous of volume
oh i'm sure it must
you know i'm not personally involved because i don't you know i don't have any s- children that wear diapers
but i'm sure it creates a large amount of you know
and you just feel guilty if you don't
something with them you know
but on the on the other hand the alternatives aren't to great either
but i don't know about like cans that you keep vegetables and stuff
there are there is a receptacle you know at the centers also for aluminum
but again we don't we don't generate that much
so we don't really have
ninety-nine percent of ours is newspaper and uh you know uh glass
well now when we lived out in california they actually had places where you could recycle if you change the oil in your car
i don't you know i don't change my own oil
so i don't i don't uh don't have that problem
well other than that i'm not really sure
we we try to recycle old clothes
well we do to as a matter of fact
and they you know pass them on to
you know our church each year has a
one of their major fund raisers is you know a garage sale
and there's a ton of clothes always you know left over
and i take those down to the
and they distribute them to the people
that's that's real helpful
well i'm not sure i can't really think of anything else that we could recycle
i i really can't either
well it was nice talking to you
well i primarily listen to classical music when i have my druthers partly because i find it more soothing
i don't know a lot about classical music so far as uh any background in music
but it's the po- the music i enjoy the most
and i i would like to buy more classical tapes and stuff
but i'm not sure which composers or which i really like
so i kind of hesitate to buy something
i tend to listen to the classical music uh on the radio a lot
there's uh one particular well there several stations in this area that play uh classical music all the time
but there's one in particular that is on both a m and f m so i can listen to it without uh worrying
it's cute though because my children when they get in the car and i have uh the button pushed for that they always switch it to something else
because naturally that isn't their taste at this point in time anyway
are are you involved in music
but not i do uh the world a favor
and i don't sing aloud
and my daughter's quite involved and all that sort of thing
so um i think that one of these days maybe she'll get involved in classical music too because that's usually what happens if you unless you get into rock which isn't her voice style
i i don't care for rock at all
well most of it is not all that exciting in that it is terribly repetitious
um and there have been some nice folk songs over the years that you know kind of still hang around
but um but uh the more popular music i don't care for usually
um even when i was a teenager i didn't really like the music of that period so much because i found i liked um a little bit more melodious music than what was often the popular
now rock and roll seems tame compared to like the new age and all that stuff
and so much of the music that was popular at that time has come back
and you you don't hear everything all the time
but you hear much of the same music perhaps a new version of it
but it's the same stuff
um which is always kind of funny
um and i remember my older sister
and at the time that i was a teenager a late teenager i guess i can't remember the year smoke gets in your eyes became popular
and she laughed
and she said well you know when i was a teenager that had been
you know some years before she said that was a version of you know a song then
and she said it's very similar
but they've changed a little bit
well they did it again about
and i laughed again
i listen to um the christian radio station when i'm in the car
now there there's some wonderful christian music when you can find good stations
uh the pro- problem that i found um in this area is that the there there is inconsistency in the quality here
but sometimes they kind of get on a a a binge
and they play the same sort of thing over and over again without really necessarily quality
uh i live in the uh washington d c area maryland
i said oh they're playing one of their ten songs
and they just play them over and over
and i i you know
but um now my children have have sometimes
um they've gone to a few of the concerts and so on of christian musicians that come to our youth group at our church
and um and when they buy a tape or something sometimes that's fun because it's different and something i've not always heard
and you know i enjoy that
so is your husband a singer
well just an amateur singer
and he likes to do special music and stuff at church
well that's a good thing to do
uh well do you have children
you can uh you can get
and i know when my children were younger um we found a lot of really nice tapes that they that they liked
um there was an agape music group
and um i some of the songs i still find going over in my head over and over again because they were really um very memorable even though my children are now
but i still find some of the same tapes i uh some of the same songs from those tapes i enjoy
um there's one that's um a little girl singing practice makes perfect
and uh she's playing the piano
and so she she gets the wrong note every now and then
but then she keeps repeating it practice makes perfect
and then you know talking about that so far as christian life too
and it's really cute
uh i tell my husband to sing to my stomach because they say that babies can hear quite a lot while they're still in the womb
and i said then when when it's born you can hold it and sing that again
and maybe it'll comfort her you know when she's fussy and stuff
well do you know something
because i have always played classical music uh or classical style
it's not always classical as you know the official uh word might go
but um even when i was pregnant of course i listened to that
and when our first child was you know an infant um of course when i was around the house i played that music too
when he first made sounds that you could detect they were in the scale the music scale
someone else noticed it and i said well i guess that's true
and it was somewhat melodious
in other words it wasn't just you know it was really funny
well we'll have to keep up with that then
i do think there is probably an influence there because i noticed that even though popular music the the wilder stuff was around when my older children were were you know adolescents early adolescents when they first start listening to music on their own they first get ask for a radio of their own and so on
um this same child um really listened to more um ballady or um pleasant sort of songs rather than and even classical rather than the real hard rock stuff that so many other kids listen to
and i i never i didn't want to say too much for fear he would think it was wrong and wouldn't do it anymore
but uh then i must say they all kind of like a variety of music which is nice
well i guess that covers it
well it was nice talking to you
and good luck with the baby
okay charles uh gun control
what are you uh for in favor or no comment
oh you are
well this should be very interesting
i don't i don't mind people owning guns
i just think it should be a little you know a little a little more regulated
well you know uh now he- here's something that uh first occurred to me when they started having all these problems with these automatic uh weapons
uh now there always has been a federal law against fully automatic weapons
and yet their uh the gun control enthusiasts are are uh preaching about the gun control and how they should be we should have stronger laws and what not
uh for fully automatic weapons
and uh all right now for instance
in california where they passed the uh uh semiautomatic or or uh now what was it they called them
uh h- how is that going to affect the uh sports weapons i mean rifles
i really don't have any problem jack with you know uh people using firearms for sporting purposes
i would like to see that see that happen
well now uh i've got to admit i'm inclined to agree with you there uh even though i am a member of the n r a
and they are again- they their reason being that well if you let one little law get through pretty soon one's going to stack up on top of another
and you've got to admit that congress does kind of look at things that way
i i like i say i don't have any problem with people using firearms you know for sporting purposes or hunting purposes
i just think it's just may be a little too easy you know to acquire one
on on a whim of some sort
that that's true
uh now did you hear about the the control that they have up in virginia
uh it it's it's a little hard to believe
but they can uh of course
like just like just about every other state in the union they have a felony law
anyone ever convicted of a a felony is cannot purchase a weapon
uh when you go in and buy a weapon or a handgun in uh uh virginia
and if it comes up negative okay fine
and you get your gwu- your gun right then and there
uh but they are the only state that does it
hm that's interesting
and uh according to virginia it didn't cost all that much
uh uh at least uh records of of uh known felons which are available to local police departments
uh uh uh certainly those those records are available
and all they would have to do is expand it
to uh uh well connect them into a modem somehow
and they managed to fi- squeak out a few bucks to do it
and uh it's uh uh one-hundred percent successful
hm that's interesting
uh they were bragging about it
uh uh they should have have pride in this because it's it's a good system
and it's working well
and they don't need that seven-day waiting period
because the whole idea of that waiting period was
so that uh it
so anyway well we seem to be one in favor and one against
although neither one of us are are uh really uh uh dyed in the wool
but we both
i just think there should be you know shouldn't be quite so easy to do
now here in in texas uh all you need is a driver's license
and uh even felons can still get a driver's license
so i i don't think they are too
well they're not rigid enough here in texas
but don't tell the n r a i said that
i'm looking forward to it in about a just just over a year myself
i do quite a not quite a lot
i do some uh volunteer work here in plano
i i have a few uh handicapped persons that i you know try to do things for help them do
well uh i bought a motor home here f- four years ago and i have been living in it ever since
and i'm looking forward to just traveling
and a f- few grandchildren
and i'm looking forward to just traveling around visiting them
i was i was thinking about our topic for the night
and what do do you think about it
and i sort of i see perspectives on all sides
um and i've re- have no hope for solutions
but uh i do keep myself somewhat abreast of the issue
i have worked with uh uh a little bit with refugees from
southeast asia uh who've come over uh you know to escape the genocide programs that are over there
and seen you know heard about some of the problems that they've had
and i'm also fairly sensitive to the issues about how open should the borders be
because i in general like a smaller rather than a larger population
well we've got a lot too
so we're getting a large
oh gosh i don't know
i think there's like twenty-six different languages now that are spoken in i the i s d dallas innercity school district
we we're getting a lot of uh mexican americans
you know we've had
and i don't know what the solution is
i i don't either
it's a really delicate uh moral issue
because i- if you have well
i guess the one thing i do see that is is that needs to be a solution is that if you do let people into the country i do feel you have a certain obligation to to get them on their feet
because otherwise what you're doing is you're letting people in
and you're you're dooming them to being underclass people
you know you're dooming them to ghetto life or whatever
and i know that that the southeast asians the hmong people that i've done some work with uh feel very quite hurt and and unsure of themselves when here
because they're coming from you know from the slash and burn intercultural society you know
and they're being plunked down plunked down into america
and the c i a of course isn't doing that
and they don't know wh- what the heck they're doing
and they're finding themselves adrift in the big cities
and of course there are people in the big cities who would do like nothing better than to take advantage of them
and they're they're incredible victims of crime
and part of it is this lack of lack of basic information being dissimilated
and i'm not saying it's easy to do
and i know there are a few people who are trying
but but the funding isn't there for very much work to be going on
and there's a lot of graft like people trying to tell them oh giving them information that was free to them anyway if they just knew how to get it
i mean these are people who don't have the foggiest idea about what america's like
um and it's
i i couldn't really conceptualize how hard it was to understand that until i until i met with them
and i realized that they some of the information that i just you know don't even realize and know is information they don't have
and i never thought well i guess that is something you need to know you know
and so they start farming on uh available land you know like the median strips on freeways because no one's using it
but then someone comes along and says you can't do that you know
they have no idea why not some some of them you know
the ones that have been here longer and have been in you know understand now
but when they initially come over
and they're being put in the middle of the city
i mean they're nomadic farmers you know
these are people who've never seen flat ground before and people who've never seen property rights before you know these people who've never seen any machines other than those used in war
and uh they have you know
so i i i do have a lot of sympathy for them
and i feel that america could try a little bit harder to to help people adjusting to the american way
because if they don't you're just going to produce you know you're going to produce an underclass you know
and then then many of them ended up just working the same jobs they were as slaves then
and there was no
real up upward movement
and not being you know
well what did you do when you helped these people
how did you what did you do
i i wasn't helping them
i'm i'm a linguist
and i was uh doing a language trying to learn their language a little bit
and i actually um i mean helped them them in the sense that they received money for working with me
but i didn't i didn't i wasn't a social worker or anything like that
you know by explaining to people how the language
because all the models of teaching english are based on teaching english to spanish speakers or to other european language speakers
and people don't realize how different some of the languages they speak are
well i'm an e s l teacher
oh you are
but actually they did not teach us very many things about how really to go about helping people to learn another language
that's that's been my impression
i mean it's like people don't know what they say
it's it's not they're not withholding information
they they haven't the foggiest idea
but anyway i enjoy it
and spanish is
but i'm applying for
and spanish is a lot like english
like you know
but i love it
i love the culture uh the way that they uh they respect education and their teachers their parents so much more than than my children do
and i like it
and what i've been thinking about doing is volunteering for this uh asian center that a doctor falk has started that works with the school district
and doing what trying to get them set up in- inculturated
oh i'm sure it would
and i've applied at another district where many of the children are asian
and i think that would be wonderful too
and you'd be helping people i'm sure
and n- and i mean not to put not to trivialize the problems of any immigrant group but i do know the asian groups are having a lot of trouble
i mean and part of the problem is that a lot of chinese and japanese immigration from you know decades ago has been very successful because they valued education and so forth
but and but a lot of people coming over from vietnam right now coming from worn torn countries are are na- not having the same success
i think some people have just assumed well why why can't you be successful
and it's really much more complicated
well the times were different too
the times are different yeah
my neighbor let's see is jewish
and he's going through the i don't know the jewish league or something
and he spends
well right now he's down to like once a week
but he was going over there several times a week to be with the family
and he thoroughly enjoyed it
i i think it's a wonderful thing to do
and there's a lot there's a lot more
i guess another possible solution is since taxpayers aren't going to start paying more money for this and and other budgets aren't going to be cut to pay for it uh
because everyone gains from it
uh and if it's
what's so sad about this is both of the the man and the woman had a degree having to do with computers
and because they're so deficient in english they haven't been able to get jobs
so they'll have to go back and get a degree here you know almost start all over
i've known people with effectively worthless degrees in this country i mean
and they're highly educated people
but of course if you're educated and you don't speak english no one thinks anything of you
and this woman was uh stocking the shelves in a drugstore
well it's been good talking with you
well thank you
i just pressed my uh
i got one that's interesting not too not too controversial
you know not
i i do get somewhat of a kick out of
that's kind of an interesting recent thing that i could think of recently that uh
i was wondering what you thought about that making the general uh getting a general into politics
well i've i've been thinking about it
and i uh i kind of get a kick out of they always want the hero
well time magazine was saying that in essence
and they said in general generals are more familiar with training that they believe in training more
and so they really were very positive on a general's staff person having a a very much better education than the average uh corporate president
so i thought well maybe
i i think they probably have a better education than the average congressman
well that too
and uh you know they talk about the army
and why did we win and all that
and they talked about how the training was so important
so you know they're liable to be right that generals generals in the service
and schwartzkopf uh you know might make a good uh politician whether it be governor or whatever you know
he he you know we know he's a good leader
the question is you know can he be the man who's ultimately responsible
you know like what he said is you know a lot of times in his interviews he was talking about you know people asking why are you doing this why are you doing that
it's interesting how they say that when they're usually the top dogs you know
you know schwartzkopf was ordered to get iraq out of kuwait
and so he went to the president and said okay here's how i want to do it
but he wasn't the one that decided iraq needed to get out of kuwait
uh you you pick one
i just thought of that one when when they brought up about politics
that was uh pretty easy you don't have to pick democratic or republican
well the thing that i'm
well i have an easy answer for that oh i wish they would do it is that limit it you know to eight or ten years max
you know whether that's two five year terms or whatever
but i don't really like it
oh you know you're not
i think if the president can prove that he's popular you know that he can do the job then the people should be allowed to elect him as often as they want
i mean how many of these big campaign contributions that they're running on this year did they get after they were elected just you know just after they were elected two years ago
as soon as they get elected the people dump all kinds of money on them and say yeah yeah you're my friend
and two years later he remembers that
and what they done is they've bought this congressman for two years
and i think there is a needed change
i i'd lik- you know
my god it's ridiculous you know
that's what the financing rules and the uh the mailing rules and the size of the office staff and all that stuff
i think voting is is a prob- i think i had one of the subject about voting
and i think that uh the voting rules need to be changed where you have a little more time
and i i vote as often on absentee as i can because it's so easy now
but i think gee whiz you could make it a couple
well i think a lot more people could vote if they were somehow persuaded that it's something worth caring about
you know like you know the the recent election about how the dallas city council should be made up that election last december
boy i i i live in arlington
i mean i don't know if you like the mayor
but i think your mayor
what is the woman's name whose us not the mayor but the
i mean they're just awful just awful
well what get's me is this thing it went down to defeat last december by how many votes by just a few hundred votes
and if it if it had passed
and there'd be no more argument
but they're still fighting about it because of the way the election went last december
and then they don't even do that recommendation you know
i mean it's amazing the money that they spend once they get in
but but this is for supposedly to benefit the minorities
well you're right there
and all the minorities had to do was go out and get a couple more hundred people to vote and they would have had their way
uh uh people are
uh uh politics uh
uh hopefully people will get more involved
my my position is people who don't vote don't have any right to complain about the way the government's going
but those are the ones that are complaining i i think a lot
the guys that don't take any interest in and and constantly on the negative of everything
and and you ask them why they don't vote
they say well they don't want their name on the uh jury duty list
is that right ooh
that that's where they get the jury duty list is from the voter registration
i i'm a democrat
you know i mean at least i'd like to see compe-
because i like competition you know
i can not believe it you know
but they've got a pretty good lock on congress and a lot of local things
but i still think in the last ten years
you know of course that's not a recent event
i guess they we- on this uh speech thing
actually i haven't made any calls
but i received about a dozen
oh really i i i
i think yeah i have to make these
but i get distracted and get to do something else
and all of a sudden my phone rings
and go well what the heck we'll talk for a while
but i am amazed by
well i wonder why you need thirty renditions of the persons voice
but i'm not in voice synthesis
but i'd sure like to see a summary of it
we'll get to politics i'm sorry
well i think we've used up as much time as we're supposed to anyway
and that was three minutes ago
hey well thanks for the call
and i go visit a lot
and their real estate up there is i mean ridiculous absolutely ridiculous
like i live in an apartment
and my apartment is three fifteen a month
and how big is it
and it's just the one it's a one bedroom
but i prefer to live in uh in a nice part of town because i feel safe here
and i i i pay more to feel safe you know
well wha- what's included in that
i mean just nothing no microwave
we've got i have ceiling fan
it's real cute it's got a little vaulted ceiling and mirrored uh mirrored uh
it's wood uh
i i used to live in waco
far north like on lake shore where all those apartments are
uh we live in a house here
and uh it's a three bedroom two bath
and uh i it's it i don't know
actually we were talking about mortgage insurance today with my agent
and uh it's about sixteen hundred square feet
but it it you know we looked at a lot of houses that were had more square footage
but they didn't use it right you know
it was a bunch of empty you know hallway and stuff that cur-
so we've used every bit of it
and our house um we bought it for sixty-four
and uh the neighbors house next door to us sold for seventy-five
so i- you know i think we were d- you know got a good deal on it
so that looks good when you all get ready to sell you'll probably do really well
my father used to live in dallas uh
now he he went back to new jersey
he uh well actually right now he lives in rhode island
and uh he used to like to go
and we used to go just every weekend just to look at houses for no reason we weren't buying one every weekend but just to look at them
and so i got a pretty good feel of you know what i want when i do you know get my house whenever that is um
i completely lost my train of thought um
but we we enjoy going looking at houses
and and uh we now
fire a fireplace
and it was circular
and the other side was the patio and the backyard
and it had a built in uh grill
i mean it was it was just an ul- the ultimate party room you know
but that's pretty nice
but that's what we had uh uh
you know and big closet space you know
i don't like to have a lot of things out you know just all over the place
and uh so that's that's what we went for first
and and it you know we we don't we just have a big living room
an and a dining room is separate
and you know some places have
like the house next door to us that we looked at
but to stick a wall between two rooms didn't do anything for us just so we could have a living room and a den
so we opted for the just the whole wide room
my father had uh
uh he had the kitchen kind of a kitchen and a very long family room
and what he did he put uh a bar right in the center
and put some uh a glass rack down so you had like wine glasses hanging from the ceiling and then the bar
and it just kind of it kind of separated it
it was still you know together
but it just looked a lot better
because i personally don't like the combination rooms
i but i i think for where we are
um i think we got a real good deal on it
and we you know we have a
uh the backyard is just huge
and uh we really liked it
you know in uh middle of august it's it's kind of
but uh it's it's nice
and that was you know a big selling point too
and i think another thing that was really nice was that our neighbors on the other side of us bought the lot right next to us
and they've lived there and have it all built up you know
so it's not like we're uh
kind of secluded you know
well that's good
you know right up to our bathroom window or whatever it is
like a lot of the little model homes that they sh- you know throw up in three days
in fact uh we we talked about that just a little bit you know
we were joking around about uh
and steve said we'll i'll buy a bigger house
and i said no i would just fix this one
you know there's you know cause we i like where it is
and i like how it's laid out
and it took us forever to find it
but when we found it it was we knew it
i'll probably i'll probably move
but i'll probably move to another apartment or something because i'm i'm i'm really uh
like here i'll be here for like a year
and then i'll move off
i'm a i'm a news reporter
and so this is like my first job
so i won't be here very long
so i'm not even looking to buy anything as permanent as house you know
so i'm st- staying in an apartment
and i'm not married or anything
and that's and that's one thing is once you you know you get into a house it's like you get more stuff
and to put it all back into an apartment would just never work
and it actually fit you know
but it was just unreal
like i'm amazed at how much stuff i've accumulated in my apartment
and i could take all my stuff home because i didn't have a bed or a couch or any any of that
but now i could not move back home
and i just realized this you know the other day
so it was just like a weird transition out of home
so i have to move in apartments just because i have so much stuff
actually three fifteen over there's probably not real real bad
for for waco
and and for as many gosh as many as apartments and condo's are over there
oh my goodness
i mean it it's just
and and especially around lake shore area that area's picked up quite a bit since we were there
there there are tons of apartments down here i mean
because i i had lived in the
but they were lake shore apartments that are like right next to the baseball field m c c baseball field
i i think they're called lake shore villa or something
and it's a nursing
and then there's an apartment
and then there's another apartment
and we lived in those those third ones
and they we moved in when they were brand new
uh you know
we drive by now and think gosh you know
look how much it's changed an
oh every now and then
and it's not really
now that it's sixty-five it doesn't take hardly anytime to get there you know run to the mall or run to sam's or or whatever
we used to run to re- you know red lobster
but now they've got one in killeen
so that's that's about how things are
and the seems like the market here's picking up
just for the fact that the you know
it's it seemed like as soon as we bought this house we saw all these houses for sale
and i think now a lot of them are selling
and a lot of sellers are getting close to what they want instead of you know just having to give it away
waco to me seems seems like it's pretty steady
i mean i'm not a real estate person or anything
but it it's a real college town
and so you know you have these apartments
and then the the houses are all most of the houses are pretty nice
and i don't i don't you know really see a lot on sale or anything
and people are pretty stable here
you know i kind of see this as kind of a retirement community as i always call it
i i saw i see that a lot too there
and it's nice too
so i don't think i could live here much longer
okay well it was very nice talking to you
well what what kind of car
or are you in the market to buy a car
actually i'm real close to being in the market to buy a car
i've got uh a couple older cars
they're both over ten years old and uh they've served me well
but i kind of would like to get a more uh gas efficient car and a newer model something looks a little nicer
uh i've got three children at home two fourteen year olds and a twelve year old
and so i need to make sure i've got one that i can fit
and if you if you know anything about teenagers it's kind of hard to get them to sit together for any amount of time
i i seem to remember when i was young that was a problem
well uh i've kind of been leaning towards a caravan
uh now i know that that uh they've gotten quite pricey in the last couple of years
but uh i like the dodge products
and uh been uh couple times i've had a opportunity to rent one uh i've been really pleased with its performance and with the size
and because if you get the seven passenger version
and uh i think that would that would serve us well
plus it's got uh good storage capacity in it for you know taking things along
they have the commercial on tv where you can you can pull some seats out
and you can move around
is that is that the dodge caravan
uh you can take the uh uh
usually there's a uh a double seat behind the uh front buckets
and then if you get the
and then there's a three seat that goes or three person seat that goes in the back
or you can take the uh three seat out and just use the two seat
or you can take the two seat and move the two seat to the back
so it's very versatile
well the one that
i can't remember one it is if it's the it it's the toyota or or one of the other ones
i don't know if it's one of the americans or the import ones where uh they actually have like uh some bucket seats in the back
but you can actually pull them out
i mean they're really easy to pull out
uh and you can uh move them around and stuff
and it it
to me that that would be real good for us
uh my husband and i uh like to go camping and stuff
and right now we have a van which is
and we're we're thinking about buying another sedan uh probably next year
since that that's what my husband really wants right now
but uh next year we'll probably buy a new car
and we're looking at uh possibly the honda accord
uh that's kind of uh
as far as far as the interior it's got the luxury interior
but d- it doesn't really have the luxury price tag that a lot of the other cars have which is one of the things that we were looking at
you know finding something that's that's fairly affordable but yet has all the nice luxury items that we want
i think that's getting to be kind of important now that uh the price is becoming the driving factor
and then you look at
once you realize how much money you've got to spend then you start looking around at at what you can buy with it where before i think you you looked at the car you wanted
and then you looked to see how well you could afford it
or how you could afford it
well i think it's going to be a lot easier now
so i think it's going to be a lot easier to to be able to get a car now and finance it
i think banks are going to be a lot more a little bit more lenient
i know they're trying to do everything they can to uh end the recession
and dropping the prime is probably one of the things
but uh that is also effecting buying a new car
you got to kind of work work that into your budget
well that and that
and of course uh is if you buy a new car you're going to
uh two fourteen year olds will be uh fifteen on the fourth of july
are s- are they twins
you're going to have twins have them on the bicentennial is our motto july fourth seventy-six
so uh uh i've still got another full year and three months before they're going to be behind the wheel
so america's safe for another fifteen m-
and uh after that
you know they're they're they're small enough that a first time driver could handle it yet big enough that i feel s- feel safe that
it i don't get that kind of feeling with the kind of car like you talked about the honda
well the the honda's have been have been very safe
in in accidents uh more so that a lot of the american cars
matter of fact i just heard something today on on the news about those uh
automatic seat belts that are attached to the door uh they're questioning the safety of those now saying that
and they showed uh a simulation where there w- they had a dummy in the car
and the door opened
and the dummy actually fell out of the car
and the car rolled out on top of him
so they're saying they're not as safe as
but they're really not as safe as they as they uh appear to be
so uh i'm kind of concerned about that as far as you know w- the seat belts
uh i don't know if maryland has a uh a seat belt law
but they do have one in texas
and you're you're required to wear them
there's the uh door belt
and then there's one
but ninety uh probably about well i don't know about ninety
but probably fifty percent of the people that have those probably don't wear the lap portion of it
and he has one in his car
you think oh i've got one portion of my seat belt on uh
but if your door comes open you know it's not going to do you any good
so that that that's a concern of mine as far as uh what i'll be looking at with buying a new car
uh i'm not really sure if i would want the seat belts attached to the door
like behind the door
the uh the supports
and they'll give you a list of all the problems that the car's had in the past
and you can look at the uh the track record on
and you usually notice uh a lot of problems at the beginning and then things kind of iron out
and you get an idea on how well the the next car's going to be
now as long as they aren't changing the model you know like when the uh pontiac grand prix went from being a huge car to a small car they had a lot of problems
the the le mans is like that too
uh we used to have a le mans when i was in in high school uh
and it was a big car
i mean it was like the uh the grand prix
and in i think around nineteen eighty uh they changed the model
and it like went to half the size
literally i mean it got chopped in half
and it wasn't even the same car anymore
so unless they're really changing the model uh yeah chances are that it's probably going to have the the fewer mistakes than it had the year before
well everybody that i've talked to who's ever had a honda loves them
and my husband had a honda uh
and it was a lease car
and he had to turn back in uh a year and a half ago uh
and he had it for four years and never had a single problem with it
and it was great uh
and the only reason why we ended up not buying it was because we didn't feel the at the time the residual was like sixty-five hundred dollars
and it was a four year old car with seventy thousand miles on it
and we thought that was a little bit too much to pay for uh a four year old car
so so we ended up
just went just went ahead and just turned the keys back in and and got out of the lease
but some of the vans now have driver side air bags
uh you know i when i was much younger uh than i am now i i had wanted to go to the peace corps
and uh it seems like i it it was something that i i really wanted wanted to do
but uh i don't believe they accept you after you you know after you're married
and you have uh kids and all that
so i got into
and then i wasn't able to to uh participate
but they will accept you later in life also
oh they will
oh i didn't know that
uh there was a retired plumber that went to uh uh uruguay i think and helped them quite a bit with concepts in plumbing you know providing for a for better public hygiene
but so do you think that people should be required to give a couple years for the good of the country
i mean there are a lot of people who would like to do it
and there are a lot of people who get into other things
and they get all involved
and they just you know don't want to or don't have the time
well i understand
but if it were told to us that we would find the time somewhere between our seventeenth and uh twenty-sixth birthday to give a year or two to the to the country in the form of maybe building better roads or the parks service or the peace corps or somet- you know the military service or something wouldn't we have uh maybe a better class of americans
i don't see how that can can make a better class of americans to make everybody to make it mandatory for everybody to participate
a lot of these peop- a lot of our uh
but yuppies now are interested in one thing and one thing only
well i don't i don't think that
and at least if you legislated
giving for a couple years of their lives or or uh a honestly purely giving but but some sort of equitable exchange then at least the country would have gotten two years from them where um they would have given something to the country instead of take taking away all their lives
are are you suggesting then that if if uh if i have to go and and do something for the country for two years that the country will compensate me in some way
i i will be compensated for this
give them your ti- give them your entire life for two years no
i'm sure that the peace corps pays it doesn't pay well
but but it does pay
okay currently in our country especially in some regions there's an employment problem
that that that's true
but in even in our region there's an employment problem
there's a lot of uh people gotten laid off lately you know from just companies like general dynamics and and texas instruments
you know in in another time we had the w p a
i'm not i'm not familiar with that
uh that gave people pay that was halfway between relief which was welfare
and that was that was simi- that was some some program where people gave their time
in trade for
and and living
uh here in colorado you'll find a great many things
public roads that were worked on by the w p a uh dams that were built by the w p a
uh scenic overlooks parks
we are road our road system's falling apart
our air- our national road system system of highways
well then i guess there are a lot of a lot of things that people could do to contribute to the good of the country
ther- there's a lot of work to be done
i i really don't see anything wrong with it
i i can't see the problem in it for a year
what what i'm saying is that if it were mandatory
would give a year well or not give a year but but trade a year
at least one not more than say three or four then it would definitely effect unemployment
i wonder if if they didn't make it mandatory if they would actually get enough people volunteering to to do it that it you know that they would have enough
i mean i i'd probably
well you know texas new mexico colorado huge numbers of other western states have no real welfare system
but there's no real welfare system
but if we took these people off off the streets for a year there would darn sure be more hours labor available in the nation for everyone else
and who knows maybe some of our graduating high school seniors would find out a little bit more of th- what the traditional american work ethic means
you know we have had some problem with that in recent years
oh well yes
with with uh recent generations i i know exactly what you are talking about
i i mean i know several people who do not wish to work
uh they wish only for the paycheck
and they they decide that they're going to get the money anyway they can with you know without uh
without without working in the the traditional american job market
so one other thing
and they they get the money anyway they can
and maybe if we instilled the work ethic you know
i enjoy the i enjoy working
uh we have not in some years now
and i think we are going to try to have one this summer
oh that will be fun if you have not done it in a while
uh where is your family from
so you are going to have to go there
that will will be where it is uh
if if she gets it planned
so i do not know what she has been doing
but uh they are all getting very very old
so we need to see them soon
now my grandmother just passed away this last year
so you know
i think as we get older it is dif- more difficult to uh when
so it is uh
i have to uh i will probably have to take charge and do it one of these uh one of these uh days
so uh it takes a lot of effort to either get everybody called or written and settle on a date you know that
and if they are
we just did it word by mou- you know by word of mouth
you know and uh my uncle in louisiana he is the only one that you know had to travel
and now i have got a sister in germany
oh my gosh
so it is going to be hard this time
but we have got a huge family
and we need to have more and more of them
i ho- i think i hope that is not a lost art that people getting together as they do spread out all over the world
because it is so fun
we my mother has got like thirteen brothers and sisters
oh i see
and every one of them have five or six kids and most of them
sure that makes a big crowd
we just we had two baseball bleachers full of people
and there are still about eight or six eight or ten people taking pictures
and it was just
well we need to have another one
i hope my aunt is successful as uh later
well it is probably not going to be done because i have not heard from them
i it was supposed to be this june
so i do not imagine there is anything coming
well i we have always had ours in a park or something
but it has away been the same park
and there is nothing really special there
and it is open
we have it usually at this uh at this one park because there is a pavilion there in case it rains
and uh you have to have it uh fairly early in the summer or it is too hot up there
it is too mu- it is not
it is just uh very humid
and the old people cannot take it anymore
well that was part of the problem with the ones we have
now the kids would sneak off
and we were just being kids
and we found what we thought was just an old water hole
so we was going swimming
and like i said we was just big kids
we was like eight and ten years old
and our parents came and caught us
well that keeps you busy
but if we could have gotten it by a lake or something i thought that would have been much better
it would have been something for the young people to to do
there was uh i am sorry there was uh i remember now there was like uh a baby pool
oh but i love it all the different foods because that
oh i do too
and oh grand
so how long did you say it has been since you all had one
i think it has been uh four three or four years or five even uh since they have had it tried to get everybody together
and and we really need to uh no matter ho- what kind of crowd they get
well i have been married almost five
so i guess it has been seven years since we have had one
and since then we have lost oh well just our grandmother
well time flies so fast
it may have been that that long since we have one
but i think it has been about four or five years
so uh anyway i i hope both our families get to have one soon
oh if i can ever get down to kentucky
it has been like four years since i have been home
i know when we had had our
but i won't do it with the babies
because uh i have got uh a four month old and a four year old
so i am just starting
and i just quit too
oh i am telling you
that is uh
uh i won't be adding any more to the family reunion
i hope it i know it takes a lot of effort right with with that with two little ones like that
so uh i am not too upset
anyways i have enjoyed talking to you
well let's see um
i i like to go out to eat
but being from dallas um i think we have an average of six or seven restaurants that open and close every we- month
and we ave- we have a really high turn over rate
and and this is i mean there are streets just called restaurant rows
and uh you can get everything here from um a very spicy indian meal to you know the favorite barbecue and and uh just anything your little hearts desires around here
so here they have to entertain us to make us come back
and i guess it's all one big game because you you just never run out of places to go
but uh a good turn over would be sort of nice
and and we go to you know like an older part of town
and we just notice how many oh well
and oh gee there they've changed
and oh we've got to go try that one you know
and it's it's really
you have the pick of the you know the crop here
are they big into am- ambiance down there
or is it more like
uh texas to me makes
um you can get that too
they've got everything here from the uh french room which is ultra ultra to um um dean ferrings uh uh restaurant which is the mansion on turtle creek
i mean we've got beautiful places to go
you can get as dressed up or a- you know just going to the local barbecue and just doing take out
so you know
and we're always searching around for chinese
and now of course they've added the taiwanese
and and um uh various you know any any part of the country you want to hit they have got it
i mean vietnamese restaurant we went to you know last week it's great
it's good stuff you kno-
but uh it's so it's very very mixed
and uh you know i think if you like food like we do
i i don't know if that happened before or after we moved here
you know you get a lot of uh great variety of things here
but if you were going to a restaurant say um where would you go
oh well we had uh we have a lot of favorites here uh in northern virginia
and of course we've got d c to call on you know
and there's all sorts of things down there
one thing about d c is that there are a lot of traditional restaurants where you know it's the guy used to be the cook for the capitol
and so he stays in the same restaurant for twenty years you know
and he's got a big clientele
and um so there are there are some hang outs where you can go if you want to see people
you know it's it's sort of like hollywood in a way because there's there's favorite haunts for southerners and things like that
um we don't hang around with them because usually it's you know ninety dollars a plate or something silly like that
so uh but uh my wife has a a friend that w- runs one of the restaurants down there
and we've been down there and had french cuisine
and uh i don't know
i don't particularly care for that sort of thing just th- the type of food just because i do like uh you know getting a meal
and uh most french food always leaves me hungry for some reason
i i don't know what they say about chinese
i'm always hungry after a french meal uh
but the the atmosphere is just wonderful
you do feel like you've gone out you know and done something
well as out here you might have enjoyed the meal and go away feeling satisfied it's not so much a an event you know out in the suburbs when you go to a local restaurant
and there's they're starting to get a little bit different um
they're they're realizing that more of the the people with the money are coming out and living in the suburbs getting away from the city
and so there are a couple jazz houses you know that have jazz bands playing while you're eating and stuff like that
oh there you go
oh we're sort of in the middle of uh the extension of the cajun country too so we have um a lot of ambiance provided by you know the the bands and everyth- you know like you said jazz bands and things like that
and you eat your crawfish and jambalaya and stuff
you know i i really don't like that stuff
but my husband does
and they cook i mean you know like for a bunch of people
and and uh it's really
so when we do go out we really you know want to be wowed by um the presentation so to speak
and uh you know but but there are little places um
and like i said some of our very favorites are the chinese restaurants just to
and we do a lot of take out because everybody's so busy running around
and it's the fastest thing to do
and so we sort of enjoy the you know both parts because
we have two uh two very special places in northern virginia that people go to
uh one's called captain pell's which is a crab house
you know being so close to maryland
maryland is you know a big place for crabs with the with the bay pretty much taking over most of maryland
and um captain pell's is a place with the big huge wooden tables inside
and people just go in there and just pig out and everything
and then um the other place is called the vienna inn which is uh uh
and uh that place is known for the the rudest waitresses in the country are are at the vienna inn
and uh people go there to be abused
you actually go in there to be abused by the by the waitresses and the bartenders and stuff
oh that's a talent
and people come all over the country amazed at um the abuse they were seized
and then it's on the honor system
and so you know you tell them what you've eaten and what you drank or whatever
and they figure out the bill for you
and you're lucky if you get change
usually they they take your change and throw you a couple of mints in your hand and say thanks you know
because uh they
they say you need n- mints
here guy you don't get any change you know
well that's funny
i we just went to an italian restaurant this
um just wonderful
and they i mean
i mean i've never been to italy okay
but it's just this big beautiful italian restaurant
very um low key in terms of the people are from california you know
so they have their own adaptation of what italian is i mean
but it's it was a wonderful wonderful experience
you know they have uh women there going to s m u going to uh southern methodist university and and graduating in opera or something like that
and they are all singing arias to you and and just walking around the restaurant singing
and they make the food right there so it's display cooking
and and uh then they have wine casks all over the place so you're lined up waiting in line to this place
and you just take a drink of wine
and you know they don't count that really
okay you say you're going to buy a new car
and i drove a nineteen seventy-seven um b m w
and so i believe
and i'll know the answer today
but i'm not interested in having any car payments
so i actually went last weekend with
and we went and looked at used cars around town
uh and i you know i found like a nineteen eighty-four regency ninety-eight with only forty-six thousand miles on it
and that was pretty good condition uh
but i also found a nineteen eighty volvo uh station wagon that was in just super condition
i mean there's not a dent on the outside body
it it has about eighty thousand miles on it
but that's all right you know
and i think it would last me probably another fifty or sixty thousand miles
so i guess i'm kind of in limbo waiting to see what the insurance is you know company is going to do to see whether or not i can get one of these cars
i i understand that
we uh just paid off one
and so we're you know enjoying not having that that payment every every month
and but it's getting up in age uh
we're trying to hold out a little while longer uh
we've got a a y- kno- sho- a daughter who's almost two now
so i guess if we when we do buy another car it'll it'll be something that we can uh kind of grow into a little bit
it's it's tough on trips because uh
anywhe- anytime we we're getting ready to go anywhere it's uh you know it's uh try like trying to put a puzzle together to make sure you get everything in the car you know cause it's
well not only that needing the room you know we finally ended up buying a dodge caravan here about two and a half years ago
i i have one that's now
well she'll be four in september and then a little boy that's just turned two
and you know it's like you go on a trip
and you know you pull over to the side of the road throw them on the hood change a diaper and keep going
and i wanted something that i could maybe walk through and get to them
i i ideally i would like that in fact uh you know i i've i've thought of that possibly uh getti-
you know i would i'd like to do that
i i have a truck myself
and i- i'll i'll take you know
a truck's a thing that yo- you you need when you need it
but you know
the rest of the time you wonder you know could i use something else
so i i've still got a couple years payments on it
uh if we can hold out til then you know i may get get to where i need a something else maybe maybe buy a van because they are really really nice for for long trips especially
and i understand it is too expensive to have two car payments
see that was the problem my b m w was paid for
and my husband's been in business for himself for several years
and so he can depreciate cars
but you hav-
well when they did all the tax law changes you had to keep them five
so i was trying to keep my b m w in tact uh for three more years
and we'd trade my car in on a new car for his business
and so basically that's what i'm looking for in a used car something that's going to last me at least three years
well if i can pull a deal on this volvo you know it will last me longer than that
but i don't know how families afford two new car payments
it's just it's outrageous
well my wife's car is probably around five years old now
and it's it's got oh uh
i guess it must have seventy or eighty thousand miles on it you know
and so it it's getting
it's not not in bad shape
it's it's you know she's kept it up real well
but uh you know it's it's getting to the point where we really need to do something with it you know
so i'm i'm uh i'm i'm hoping we that we can work something out here
we've got other bills that kind of pre- precede or preclu- preclude us buying
and you know and you can't uh you can't afford you know a a car payment now
it's almost getting to be like the house payment you know
could find something for you know seventy-five a hundred dollars a month
but it was a decent car
and you just almost can't find that payment anymore
so i understand that it's it's kind of hard to go do
well if you do look at them i really recommend the dodge caravan
it's the only uh minivan they make that's on a car chassis instead of a truck chassis so it doesn't
you know shake you around like a tu- a truck does
oh i didn't know that
and we have had just wonderful luck with ours
i mean it's we take it everywhere
see my car was also a two door
and which drove me nuts trying to get car seats and kids
into a back seat you know
and so it's wonderful to have the room and the space
and you can haul things
and they climb in easily
and it's just been everything that we were hoping it would do for us
and it is nice on long trips
and you can take out the middle seat
and they come out fairly easily so we took out the middle seat put the car seats in the back and just had a whole area in the middle like if we were out on open road
and it was their nap time
you know i wouldn't do that if we were in a city or if there were a lot of cars around or anything
but it made it so much easier to travel
that's that's our pro- our our daughter's problem you know 'cause when you when you get out on the road like that and it's just long stretches you know where they just have to sit you know
in town she does okay you know
and even on the road she does all right for a little while because she'll sleep some
but you know i-
she she wakes up
she wants to to get up
i know uh t- coming uh right around christmas we were we were uh chris- right before christmas we had driven over to shreveport
and we were driving back
and it was when all that bad weather was was hitting
and the roads were all closed
and uh we were trying to get back
and it took us a lot longer
and she was you know she was pretty good most of the way
but then get to a point where she just had to get out of her seat and we had to stop
and and we got out and played in the snow and put here back in
and she was fine
but you know if we had if there was something to where she could kind of get up and move around like you say on on the highway or where where it wasn't wasn't as bad you know just for a little brief period of time it would be would be okay
so i'm i'm thinking maybe we can
well that would be good
well i gue-
well i appreciate talking to you
i ho- hope everything works out
well really i'm supposed to hear today
and i i hope it
i really would prefer the volvo i think jus-
but you know they're built of that unibody steel construction
and it would take a hit fairly well
and you know my b m w that my husband was going forty to forty-five miles an hour
and you know it didn't even bend the frame
but unfortunately they think if it says b m w on it that you have money
i uh i have enjoyed uh thirtysomething in the past uh now that it has gone off
but what what are your
uh we sort of got hooked on la law
uh do you ever watch that
we we wa- we try to catch that most most nights
it it was kind of interesting uh some people complained about uh uh the kind of whining or whatever on it
i i really did not think it it was
i think it had some some good uh good situations that it presented
like the problems that michael and hope had in their marriage and stuff
well i think i think a lot of people you know kind of felt that way
but they had a lot of uh uh counseling groups that use some of the episodes as as examples of things that were going on
and and uh yo- you know that they called interaction between people and sort of to use as uh as a way of getting people to talk about their problems
uh our t v viewing has uh slowed down a little bit since our
that that tends to uh put a cramp in your viewing because by the time you get through
oh it's better to spend time with your kids i think though than glued in front of the t v anyway
i just don't i don't think there's as many good things to watch as there used to be really
i i can not uh
i don't think there were uh
i have not i have not uh uh there are not as many good shows that i that i continuously like to watch as much as i used to
i uh you know ther-
i uh i used to could be able to name ten shows or so you know that i felt were worth my time to watch
but uh i uh you know very seldom like to watch you know those
i like uh home improvement shows like bob vela's uh home again on saturday morning
it's i notice it's like it's like this old house
but it's uh it's on
instead of being on pub- p b s it's on regular t v
but it's uh it's kind of interesting because they renovate an old house
so i like to watch that
if it's someb- if it's a team or something that i am really interested in i am not one to just watch a football game just just to be watching it
or or i am not a big basketball or baseball fan if it unless it's baseball if it's some if it's a team i really like i may watch
it's so slow that you just get bored you know
i i will switch between
but i usually
if if if it's a football team i really like a college team or or pro team
but uh that's the
and occasionally we will like on if we do not have anything to do or kind of bored and we just want to sit in the house or something
it's kind of like like baseball
we went to the movies a lot on weekends and watch them at home because there's just on friday and saturday nights there's nothing good on
and i think that's you know
as as t v
i think the less good shows being on t v has caused a lot of people to do to do that uh you know get more movies and watch
i know we
but uh you know we usually will we used to rent uh two or three movies on a weekend and and try to watch
the uh development we moved into was
they have it on one si- like right across the street from us
but when they built our section they did not did not put it in
and they are still still do not have it
i am hoping that that soon they will they will
and they say that well it's it's
they every year they look at uh different areas and try to determine where where uh the most houses will be
and so they uh they look
and they when they when we reach a certain number of people in that area they will put one in put
some in or they will at
well we had it for awhile
and it just seemed like we never watched it
any we did not have the movie channels
and we just never watched any of them
and it seemed like we did not watch even half an hour
so we decided to just cancel it
i have i put some put in some uh an antenna a really good antenna
and uh it's really helped you know ours
and it's not been too bad
there's certain things that i have that i want to see you know occasionally like a football game a college game or something that happens to be on cable
but the uh
i i have not been bothered by it too much
well i can not
well it was nice talking to you
uh we are to discuss air pollution and uh what we think the causes are
and i probably would uh target uh
i think uh individually uh just by the vast number of people there are there's i think cars are also a major contributor to it
because uh there's a lot of commercial vehicles out there
especially those the big rigs like the busses and um
uh eighteen wheelers and so forth
i think they would generate probably uh one of them would probably generate enough for three cars
but that's not
and i think it can be resolved if uh if they really let go with
the technology that they have at uh at their hand
and they haven't released it yet
i think there's a lot of hold back uh because
of uh oh priorities that they have
and uh it's
i have i have five in the kitchen at the moment
and they keep turning the tape recorder up besides
do you have do you watch children
or do you
and i have uh two that i'm tending for the summer
well that's interesting
um is there anything
but um i think another
you can tell when you go around cities you can smell specific things from
i i grew up in
well i know uh uh in michigan uh the way they used to take care of the trash is they would incinerate it
and the fumes from the incineration was a terrible pollutant to the air
and um of course now
well people think you burn it it's gone
but it's not gone
and when they
and you bury it
and it's not gone either because it has untold ramifications
and it gets into into people
you know which is uh the the most important um resource that we have is people
and they're and they're destroying us
so i think the cockroach will evolve uh sa- safely
i'm i'm really glad to see that there's more of that happening
but there's not enough
and we need expert cooperation
well it's a
at least they're starting you know
so at least they're moving that direction
education of the education of the people is primary i would think
and uh and we're hard to teach
it's going to it's probably going to be a generation or two before before it's really going
and the children are being taught in the schools more it'll be you know on down the road this is going to be passed on which is good
uh of course uh we would like to see it accelerated because uh of the critical nature of it
the the learning of it and the
just to um think that way we have to be in that thought pattern and able to um motivate ourselves to um uh do what is right for the atmosphere
um i think we're all contributors
i mean every human being that lives is a contributor
education is a big thing you know
and as we educate them individually what they can do
and and i think that they'll grad- they'll work towards solving those problems more too um
well hopefully it can be resolved within a shorter time frame than we have seen it done in the past
that the time frame for cleaning up our air and our and our um
you know i mean
i'll turn it up in a minute honey when i'm done
uh get that through to the people and get us educated
well i think science has come a long way to making it so that it's possible to find ways to solve the problem
i i don't know if they offer classes in uh the uh in the grade school
uh uh subjecting
would that be um perhaps
i i think they're kind of getting it in all different grades
well i mean are they starting though at at with the children that are so
and they can really
uh relate to that
they're you know they're hearing somewhat about it
they've got if you go in the entrance they've got uh stands usually where they have um little uh kind of a little newspaper thing that the kids can read
oh i see
and they can form a
oh that's wonderful
well i'm sure that uh perhaps they're the leaders you know
and other will others will pick up on their example and carry it uh further
you know because uh thoughts are
well i i know it's har- it's a hard problem to solve because you you know like mcdonald's has changed back and forth between paper and foam and that kind of thing
and they do all these studies on which ones pollute more
and then there's the paper and plastic bag question
um i guess we're supposed to talk about music
and uh let me go ahead and push one here
uh well i sing
do you sing in in a choir or a choral group
oh not right now
um are you uh are are have you have you been singing a long time
or have you studied
and i've had some classical vocal training
did did you do that in uh texas or somewhere else
in uh in germany
oh that's wonderful
um well i likewise sang in high school and in college in choirs
and then i didn't sing in a choral group um until after i was uh married
and i sang in a couple of uh community choirs and then
and now i've for about the last eight years i've sung in a church choir here
and um so i i enjoy
um are you a soprano alto or
and uh what kind of music do you like to sing
um you were saying you had classical training
i've been listening to um some uh some advertisements for madam butterfly
and i'm wondering if you if you have ever done anything like that
have you ever done any uh if if you had done madam butterfly
but um that's uh puccini i think
um madam butterfly was um
and then i went to see that
and um so
um you don't play um an instrument
uh um have you ever wanted to like guitar or piano or
uh i think it would be nice if i played the piano
that i think that's always a good instrument for anybody who sings or does you know some other kind of instrument
um i played piano all through well i guess from the time i was fi- five until i graduated from college
and uh then i was a piano teacher for a while while my husband was in graduate school
so um that was the instrument both of my children started on
but neither of them stayed with it
one of them um turned into a violist
and the other one is the boy is um guitar and and percussion
um but the
i i think that the piano background is very um useful
and um i'm sure that it for you it would have been great to be able to accompany yourself
um oh i like to listen to all different kinds of music
i used to work with a fellow who had um
although this was a computer company he had his uh p h d in musical uh i guess it was in composition actually from university of north texas
and uh yet when i would go into his his office every now and then you never knew what kind of music he'd be playing on the radio
it might be rock you know it was just he said that that just about what you said that he just liked all kinds of music
and that was that was neat for for me to hear that somebody is
there's you know some of the really totally country stuff i don't really particularly like
um do you have any plans to uh do anything with your music in the near future
i wish i could but i i don't really know how to go about it without having a degree
but i do know that some communities have
uh community choruses
uh that's often a good way to get back into it again
um it's not r- terribly demanding
but that probably wouldn't be a problem
and you get to know you know people socially as well as as in a musical setting
so that's always fun
i think that's well that's one reason why i have enjoyed my choir so much is that not only do we sing wonderful music
but we've gotten to know each other quite well um in on a a social level
and and i think we sing better because of that
i think you know
i think we sing more like uh people who trust each other
so whereabouts in
oh i'm in flower mound
well i'm in plano
so um we're just not too far apart actually
it was funny um
it's you know
i talk to people all over uh texas um and only one person outside of the coun- uh of the state
so i'm always asking where where in the state you know the person is from if they're in texas
um are do you have a family
um i'm married
i was wondering if your if your spouse
or if you know if you had uh other musical people in your family
uh if you have other people in your family who are also musical
oh a little bit
was your were your parents that musical
that often is the case um
the you know
it's it sometimes it will skip
but his mother is very musical
and um and his children are very musical
so um well i'm not sure how long we've talked
i haven't paid haven't been paying attention to the to the clock
but uh i'll bet we've done we've done at least five minutes
and um maybe we'll talk again
now now we're supposed to talk about music
why why did you check music
oh because i know a little bit about music you know
so i thought that i would put that
plus i i like uh to listen to music
um i really enjoy the oldies
like what what kind of oldies
i think it's it's a fifties sixties and seventies station that i listen to
and when i listen to music most of the time that's what i listen to
i don't know a lot of the um uh musicians' names or the singers' names
but i know a lot of the old songs
we just got a disk the other day that was a um disk of nat nat king cole's greatest hits and it is excellent
it it's about twenty of his greatest hits on it
we are we were really quite pleased with it
have you um do you listen
have you heard of nat heard of nat king cole
well um um
um i played the accordion for seven years and i played the clarinet for seven years also
at at the same time or
and then in fourth grade i started the clarinet
and i played that all through high school
like so you're in the marching band and stuff in high school
i i played the baritone horn in high school band and in college
so and my wife played flute in high school
and then in concert band i played the bass clarinet
actually that's exactly the same thing my ex-wife did
and then she played bass clarinet during concert band
so i asked him if i could play it because i was first clarinet
and they end up playing a lot of the high notes
and i don't i don't care for the sound of the high notes
so i asked him if i could play the bass clarinet
and he said sure you know
so i played it
and i really enjoyed it
um well i like it
i i like the low instruments better too
um do you go to do you go to listen to much live music
we're we're going to one here in a couple of weeks
um um i don't know if you follow broadway much
but uh michael crawford was in phantom of the opera on broadway
you know you know whom i'm talking about
and he's coming to dallas on the twenty-ninth
and we got a big group going down to hear him sing a bunch of uh andrew lloyd webber's
so that'll be good
they they my my older son is at columbia in new york city
and he's been to see phantom and les miserables and bunch of other things up there
and he does it
oh my gosh
and one of the uh
and chris didn't want to go
so the friend david went
and he went and bought one of the low priced student tickets
and they they gave him the seat that normally belongs to john bel john
and he said it was a great seat
so he he's been to they've been to see it several times
oh i would love to go see that and cats chorus line i would love to be able to go see those
do don't any of those ever come to pittsburgh
but i work
and i went to i go to college
and so i really didn't have the chance or the money to go see them
well we're kind of you know
well i saw two two road shows of les mis-
and they were both excellent
so if it comes to pittsburgh in the road shows and i think they have three different companies that tour the u s um you should go see it because it's really it's really outstanding
and he went to new york
there was like twenty students from high school that went
and he went to new york with them
and he saw it
and he said it was the best thing he'd ever seen and he doesn't even like that type of stuff
well i think it's just incredible
and then you know those um two guys who wrote les mis wrote a new show call miss saigon
and my son and his friend were in a lottery to get tickets to it
and they got tickets for the opening night
and they went to it
and they said it was it was great it was great
oh see now i like that type of stuff
but my fiancee doesn't really like it
i guess i don't know either you know
but my younger son listens to some of that kind of stuff
oh i don't know uh
really weird names like the dead milkman
or su- i don't know
oh it's you know really weird stuff he likes
and i thought oh my gosh
so he listens to new wave
and you listen to the oldies
well that's good though you know
i pretty i'll listen to anything basically except i don't like the real hard metal rock
i don't i like some country
well we don't now we don't listen to much country
but we just
we well we i've never never listened
i mean i've i've probably heard him
but i've never bought any of his music
or no wait my wife bought an album of hank williams' greatest hits
oh hank williams junior
so these are a bunch of old recordings
well those should be good albums
it's a little it's a little too country for me
it's a little too uh ronky tonk or something
i like i like the garth brooks album a lot
um i don't know
he's really country himself but uh i you know i i really enjoy listening to his music
which album which of his albums do you think is the best
oh i don't know
if i were you i would get the greatest hits album if he had one because you know that would have a mixture of all his you know top songs on it
but um we have i think four records of his
i can't you know name the names of them off hand but we have i think all his records so far
and all my brothers and sisters listen to them even the ones that like the heavy metal they really enjoy listening to him
you know maybe if you did like hank williams and garth you know maybe you would enjoy tra- uh randy travis
well i i think we'll probably get one one of his albums because we do kind of like it
but you know it's kind of different
so so it's good
um do you know any oh
i was going to say do you know any other country singers that you would you know i mean the women do you like the
uh well only my um my grandmother but for a very short time
um she uh she was just more or less in a in a nursing home for uh recovery from a broken hip because she could receive more medical attention
but um that
but i think in visiting her there um it was very obvious to see that a lot of the people in the nursing home that she was in uh weren't there mentally
uh she was probably the only person in the um whole nursing home
so that was uh that was very disheartening
well what do you think can be done about that
i mean what can we do
i i come from a family of um of uh take care of your elders i guess
uh my my dad's mother is an invalid
and she lives with my aunt and uncle
and they care for her you know all around the clock
though she's not uh she doesn't have to receive constant medical attention she because of arthritis she's just unable to get out of bed
so i guess you know there's that family commitment
um i know that my parents my mother is trying to let my grandmother stay in her house as long as she can um
well i can remembe-
we did not have to call on on someone else
and i feel
no you tell me how you feel about
well probably i think as long as the person's able to um to understand what's going on around them
and i think you know my grandmother right now is still able to walk around
and she's still able to uh to do some things for herself though she gets meals on wheels which i think is a great thing because um it saves people from having to prepare food for her because you worry a little bit about her leaving a stove on or whatever although she does most things very well it still makes a little bit easier for her
i worked with an agency in west texas that they it's where they really started this concept of meals on wheels and i think it's such a valuable thing for our elderly
if they didn't have to you know go into a kitchen my mother expired just just a little over a year ago
and we had finally
she didn't want to live with either my sister or me but we we got found a retirement center for her
and it was beautiful
and they had all these they didn't even have nursing care there
as long as mother was you know mobile and got her food
and she was with people with whom she enjoyed
i think you know it's really funny
and my one grandmother says that she wants to stay in her house for as long as possible
she's like openly told people
yes she's eighty-nine
and she said that she would really like to stay in her house as long as possible because it's her home
but when the time comes um she and she can't do things
and she has to be cared for whatever she would prefer and she's actually said this to move into some type of community where she has her own apartment uh probably with like a living space and a bedroom with maybe a kitchenette so that if she you know if she wants to fix herself something light she can do that
but if she wants to go to a meal she can go down the hallway uh to a room where there's a cafeteria and there's other people there
and she can mix with them and talk with them and enjoy their company
and i am finding it extremely hard to adjust to
so uh mother had the little kitchenette and she could do all these fine things that she just ha- had a microwave had to pop her popcorn
but when it came time for a full meal then mother was able to go with people and and enjoy
oh i think so
i think i think that probably until until they're really invalids uh the elderly are invalids i think that they should be able to interact with other people in an environment that they choose if they can if the family can afford it
i mean um see i know that my grandmother would like to stay in her house
and my parents actually said you know that they may have to take their end sometime so because you know my grandma she says who she wants to live with
she's pretty you know
uh number one i am one hundred percent for total gun t- control
and uh i just have had my fill of what is going on with the crime rate
and i really feel that we have to do something in order to uh to
i i agree something should be done
but i there i don't believe there is any way of total control over weapons because crooks and people who are going to perform things that are not correct
and that means they'll always have an advantage over us
and uh they may even get worse because they know we have nothing to support myself
now you know i i agree with a lot of the things you just said in your few moments because personally i used to be a great hunter
and in the last few years i've said no way
matter of fact if i find a uh a a fly running around in the house i pick him up and carry him outdoors
i i don't even hit him with a flyswatter
so i've uh gotten over this business of wanting to go out and shooting and and killing and that sort of thing
but i i think that uh personally that we do need some weapons available to most of the people
most of the people really are uh honest and uh worthy of carrying on their lives properly
uh i'm sort of in line thinking in terms
i mean there's nothing wrong with that
there's only one problem i have with the whole thing though th- is you know when they do it i think our biggest problem is yes the the crooks and what have you are going to get weapons if the weapons are available
i think the biggest problem we have in this country is there are just entirely too many weapons available and the types of the weapons
i mean there is no
i'm again- i'm against this uh automatic and semiautomatic stuff
there is no reason for it i mean
and you know when people say you know well my god they're they're cutting into my civil liberties and all this no i i i take a different stand that as long as they are available and they are so readily accessed out there then something is taken away from my civil liberties
and uh maybe i'm a little bit strong when i said total gun t- control
that's that's really not what i meant
but i mean we need control
and we've got to reduce the number of weapons that are out in the in the in the public
and the the people should be uh selected so that we know that they are all right and that they're they're not uh acquiring weapons for illicit use
uh that is not good
as a matter of fact uh there's a fellow out there working on my house right now who uh brought to me a target from a rifle that he uh pretty well halfway designed
and he he put together the uh the bullets in it and he was showing me that at a hundred yards he kept five shots within a quarter of an inch of each other at one hundred yards
now see from a technical point of view that is something that that our military people need to know about
so there are other interesting uh facets in in guns and weapons
this is a uh bolt action rifle i think he has
and he has done other things to the way the uh barrel sits in the uh
and uh he designed the the the bullets themselves
and he has
just just from a technical point of view that interests me not to kill anybody with it or anything with it but just the fact that a piece of mechanism like that could be made to be so accurate
you you sound like you're into the technology of it which is
yeah i agree
and you know and again i'm my entire family are they are all hunters and you know they they don't appreciate my stand
and i i have no i really have no problem with sports hunters
and the issue
uh i i think something will happen
so beverly what do you think about drug testing
i think in some professions it's uh essential things like pilots and things that involve the safety of other people particularly
we've we got a lot of mistakes here uh in the maryland baltimore area because of uh train conductors uh on drugs
and also on um just like i bet you within five days a truck where the uh a dump truck where the driver was uh high on marijuana
oh my goodness
i guess he smoked marijuana for lunch and uh drove his truck up the back of two small cars in a tunnel that goes underneath the uh a river that leads into the chesapeake bay and it would
that would tied up traffic for a long time
i i think i if it's if you're in a field
but then you know who would test all truck drivers you know
that's that is a problem and every time before they get into a vehicle i mean
yeah i think i think looking at athletes being drug tested i don't know
even i think the random drug testing i don't know in my own mind if it has reduced the athletes from taking drugs because they're still being caught that make sense
and then uh i think
uh it may make a difference for some of them because they don't want to lose that lucrative uh career
i i i think in the long run i think it's it would be good
i think in the short run they think because so many of those tested have gotten away with it you know the the test hasn't come down hard on anyone i don't i don't know
uh-huh however here in dallas uh we had a a player roy tarpley on the mavericks team and he had been suspended a couple of times because of drug testing
and was to the point he was on probation
and they wouldn't have to pay him
and the mavericks wanted to get rid of him
but they couldn't afford to replace him and still pay his contract and uh just recently he was uh missing from practice
and whenever he missed like that usually he had some kind of problem
and so a mandatory drug test was done was positive
so they were able to get rid of him and not have to pay his contract
and so in his case he lost his whole career
and it's just been awful and talk about a terrible role model
i i think that that that's a terrible thi- you know
it's really funny though um
oh my goodness
i guess my dad was hit by a a drunk driver who was also high um when i was probably eighteen my senior year in high school and um though he's alive today and everything worked out fine it it it happened about two blocks from the high school
and a friend came and got me
and i was there
and i could smell the dope
and i could see the beer cans from the guy that hit him and nothing ever happened
oh that's terrible
and from from that point on i became so anti drunk driving now i think people should be allowed to drink i think that's an adult responsibility whatever
but i really uh
and and drugs have uh long lasting effects and i guess when i younger i was um probably a little more liberal on the subject
but as i've as soon as that happened
i guess when i was eighteen years old if you'd have asked me i'd have thought it was fine but by the time i was nineteen my opinion had totally changed
for example we have uh some friends whose son was driving home from work was hit head on by a drunk driver the drunk and his wife in the car were killed
um traction and all that terrible stuff
and uh bobby missed his whole junior year of high school he went through surgery after surgery and for a long time they didn't even know whether he'd be normal again
as far as his ath- athletics he's lost all of that
he uh has been tutored
and he'll catch up in school and everything
but he's still not back where he was
you don't you don't you don't have the right to interfere in somebody else's life
i can't even say you know i wouldn't even say ruin somebody's life
another thing that we saw here recently one of some of our high school kids were out goofing around in a park area that a a train track ran through and one boy who had been drinking decided for some stupid reason to try to play with the train
well he the train missed him
but uh a big mirror type thing sticking out like a metal thing sticking out hit him in the head he was in a coma for four months
and eventually they think he will come back
but you don't know that
and but he's lost
so what kind of a house do you live in
i'm in a uh in a ranch
it was about uh sixteen hundred square feet when i bought it
and uh it's about two thousand square feet now
but it's one of those typical
oh it's uh built in the probably built in the late fifties
so it's not um what you would find uh where you live
but uh for the older uh ranch homes it's pretty typical i guess
well our home is uh probably for our area it's probably one of the lower income homes out here
well i shouldn't say all of them
but most of them now are up in the millions of dollars
we have got about uh twenty i'd say about twenty-four hundred
uh we've got five bedrooms
a a bedroom for my mother
i made a i made a fourth bedroom out of uh a made a fourth bedroom out of one of our out of our living room and then added a uh what we call a sunroom to get the you know
oh that's great
when when we added four hundred square feet to our house so that
well this this house is very comfortable
and that that's the thing i probably like the most about it
um we've been real happy with it
they could probably come in and say gee this is not straight
and this is under something
but i mean it doesn't give you trouble
and is it um a natural gas and
i sur- i sure wish they could build basements in homes in texas
i i've heard a lot of people say that
uh we have an attic that we've just put you know plywood ove- over the beams and things up in the attic
and so that
but certainly not
uh in parts
i mean you couldn't you really couldn't use it for a room
so you have a probably a more pitched roof than is typical around here
ours is pitched so shallow that you uh don't get much room in the attic
we uh we've got you know
so five bedrooms and two living two family t-
and then we have a the uh family room kitchen and playroom at the rear of the house which has been really nice
in fact i really enjoy the playroom that
y- you would think that would not be a real bonus you know to a house
but of all the rooms in the house i'd say that was that was the one that's been really nice to have
probably our family room is the the biggest uh
some people i mean
families seem to migrate towards one one room and carry on most of their activities there
and uh uh some rooms we have one room that we never use
i mean might as well not even heat and cool it
well that's kind of the way our living room and dining room is
but it is nice to have it because there's uh with our size of family it's nice to know that there's one that's always straight and clean if you have
so you've been fairly happy with it
boy it doesn't seem that long
but it is because we uh came to this area about the same time
we've been fifteen fifteen years in the in the house that we're living in
and we the the principal feature i like about ours is that it's pier and beam
i've done a lot of electrical and plumbing and other work that
well that's interesting
but that's because it's so old
well my husband wouldn't do that anyway
that's his that's his
i on the other hand se-
uh do a lot too much of it
and uh i've gotten good at it which in a in a way is bad because then you uh you start to take pleasure in it
well uh that's great
we just kind of save everything for when al uh for for when his dad comes to visit
and then he does all the repairing you know
my dad is actually uh
i guess tonight's subject is to discuss current events and how we keep up on current events and if we're satisfied with with the uh um thinking about it some of the ways i try and keep up on current events is uh i enjoy reading the newspaper but uh quite often don't have time to read all of the newspaper
and so uh i enjoy watching some of the t v highlights and also uh some of the news periodicals uh weekly magazines
and uh at work i also have uh management summary reports that uh give basically a lot of the current events
uh how about yourself
well i'm like you
i don't i don't i like to read the paper
but i basically don't do it every day
and i um i usually watch uh either good morning america or the today show every morning while i'm you know
i usually watch the news either at you know early evening or at ten o'clock so i get it from t v a lot
i get time ma- i read time magazine
um that's one i read pretty regularly
you think that that's uh pretty adequate coverage
and you get
the thing about it you know now that i've fo- found is that we get such good coverage on t v or at least such i don't know attempted thoroughness of coverage by the time you get the time mag- magazine
then you can just sort of have pictures to go along with it or something because really i've thought lately there's nothing new in the time magazine
you know it's it's basically you've heard everything and uh you might you might get a little more thorough uh account of something
but really um i don't know
so i get most of mine from television i would say
um i found out too that uh quite often if i see something on television that i want more in-depth uh understanding or or get want to know more about it that the the newspaper or uh i read newsweek can give you a better and more thorough coverage of what i've heard on t v
but uh um i found out that also on on t v that you can scan through a whole lot of different things on c n n
and and like you said the the news shows that are that are happening
and you can read some more about it if you want to
um i found out though that
or i feel that a lot of the stuff on t v and the newspapers is negative
there's an awful lot of negative news or bad news or or bad news
and it'd be refreshing once in a while to hear some good news
right and i i think there's an attempt to do that
you know i think people
but i think basically we basically associate news with bad news or or catastrophes or problems or crises or uh you know
but i think people try to on on t v i think they try to throw in good stuff
but it doesn't uh it doesn't sway the vote
i've heard an interes- interesting comment also that uh with budget cuts and uh expenses the way they are that it's affected the news media whereas before they would be able to have a in-depth analysis or uh investigative reporting on certain topics and issues
but that takes time
and and quite often it's a lot easier to listen to the police scanners or what they call ambulance chasing and go after you know it's lot easy to go after and follow a fire department or a police officer and uh find out news from that as opposed to going out and finding good things
so i don't know
i guess the economy is is effecting also the news media and we have to pay that price
but uh i don't know
and i think that nowadays with communications the way they are also that we can see global events happening as as they occur all over the world like the
you know the war last winter was certainly a good example of that because we saw every single thing practically
you know twenty years ago thirty years ago we wouldn't have been able to have that privilege or or luxury to to view that
i mean you know i remember well just the things that are covered
i mean you know that was just so phenomenal to see this stadium shake and the and the announcers you know grabbing
i mean it's like that was just something because that was like live and real like you said
and then of course one thing i think too is with tele-
any kind of recent painting you've done uh yourself
well we uh remodeled a bathroom
and which required uh completely repainting the bathroom
that's that's quite a chore
and the other project we've done around here is uh we've remodeled all our all our closets which required quite a bit of painting
or did you do that yourself
oh that's that's fun
we just recently uh had our boys' room
and they're uh the paint has uh kind of faded and deteriorated
and so we decided to paint their room and put up wallpaper and border and so forth
and uh looks quite good
it's a project uh that i did
and and uh
what what brought about the fading of the paint
well i don't think it's sun exposure
but uh boys will be boys
and there there were crayon marks on there
and we had to to scrub the crayon marks off of course try and get it clean
and that's uh what we put back on there was a latex paint
plus uh they had bunk beds
and the boy one of the younger boys when he was younger about three years old got a uh got a nice marker and got up on the ceiling and decided to draw pictures
and uh you scrub and you scrub
but you can't it all off
and so that's one of the reasons why we painted
did you go what kind of paint did you use on the ceiling
we used a flat latex paint and in the bedroom as i understand that's uh one of the better type of paints to have because it's not so reflective and and glassy colored
and it uh turned out real real well
seems like uh i've we've done some remodeling of some uh rental houses that we have and it appears as though that uh oh in the fifties or sixties when some of these houses were built uh they used a lot of uh semigloss type enamel for ceiling paints and that was a little difficult to cover with today's paints
we had an occasion uh where we had to do some sealing of uh the se- of the this type of paint before we could paint it
oh you had to prime it and and se- cover over it
well i like to use this this sears uh the ten year guarantee or the fifteen year guarantee
and the reason being is once i painted i don't want to have to go and do it another five or seven years later but uh
and uh we're quite satisfied with that and and occasionally you can watch for it and get it on sale
and we do do that
i read an article recently that uh you have to be very careful on the kind of paint you put on the ceiling in your bathroom because it does tend to to peel or come off because of the moisture high moisture content in your bath bathroom
it's a lot like uh wall paper
and uh did you have any problems with that
well the particular bathroom that we did is a half bath
so we didn't have a problem with that
uh i have had i've uh have never experienced that type of a problem uh with a latex paint
nei- neither have i
so you shouldn't have a you shouldn't have a problem with it
they're they're pretty well refined today a lot of the paints
and sears is one of the better ones
i've used uh many a gallon of them myself
do you uh have you ever used an oil base paint
uh used oil base paints for trim you know like around doors and and on doors things like that
wh- why do you use that
i'm i'm kind of learning at this new at this
uh primarily because it it seems to be a little more uh well let's say well not so much that
it seems to hold up a little bit better towards the nicks and dings as opposed to uh a latex type paint
and uh it just you know it it gives you a a variance even though it's the same color
well that's good
so it's worked out pretty well for us
uh have you ever done any painting outside
uh quite a bit
uh recently this summer we painted a uh out building which is a shed that we have on the
uh on rutherford
it's uh corner of new york uh just west of mayfield
it's oh oh south and okay
i know where you i know the area
so our kids probably never went to school together or anything
oh well i've got one in college
i i don't think under the way the system is right now it is
i i think
uh even if people have good intentions i think
the ultimate power ultimately re-
it seems like uh maybe more of them come in with good intentions
but it's just so enticing
and a lot of corners being cut and the special deals available because they're in on the know you know
i just i just don't uh
i mean you even see people on a small scale cheating when they have certain positions
little bitty little bitty positions in your own home town and they'll cheat somehow or you know bend the rules use their power
so maybe it's just man's nature
we had uh here in oklahoma we had a few years ago a major uh corruption on on our county commissioners and there were several counties uh including the one i was in that lost every one of their county commissioners
oh my word
i mean it was to the point of not just losing their job but going to jail
oh they were taking kickbacks
but i think there was something like you know thirty or forty commissioners that ended up going to jail
um we haven't had that big a scandal in arlington
but we do have the people that work for the convention center were falsifying records
but that person wasn't even anywhere near there you know
one of them had had cancer and died
uh that's that's small scale
i don't know you know
i really don't know what could be done uh
i don't i don't either uh to make it totally honest
uh i think there's there's always going to be some way somebody can cut a corner uh
however the things that have gone gone on in the last couple of years we can't afford too many of those you know the the hud mess or the s and l
i think that uh reagan and bush were up to their necks in that iran contra thing
and it kind of makes you feel bad that the top people in your country would be lying to you like that
i uh i don't know
i just uh i'd like to believe that there is some way that our political people would really go there and look out for our interests
i think that's what upsets me worse than that they're getting a little you know uh on the side that that
but they stay there
it seems that when they get up there it's it's what if i vote your way what it'll do for me rather
and this would be for the best for the nation overall
i guess that's where they stay in uh in
but they always please the money people too
and then you think well if it was longer terms then they would never have to try to please the people at home
boy it is a big problem
but i think most people are kind of depressed and cynical about government now
i don't think that they anyone has a lot of respect or faith in the government
i mean there was a time i mean where i remember when i was real young i just loved harry truman
oh you know i had
some of them seemed like kind of uh heroic people
jerry the topic was favorite t v shows and what kind are you interested in and how they and do they differ from like mine
well okay uh
most of most of the uh commercial television these days i'm just a little bit sick of
uh in fact i don't watch hardly any uh television at all with uh my other activities
uh between my family and my church et cetera et cetera well i don't have time i hardly any time to sit down and watch the news
now i do watch the discover channel and some on channel thirteen
oh do you
but uh aside from aside from that i pretty well uh turn it off
oh i'm sort of a well
i'm sort of a a movie buff
but honestly i'm i'm self-employed
and a lot of times i will uh go out and take a lunch hour go to lunch from like twelve to two go to a movie and just come back to my office
but uh i do it
and i'm pretty much of a a junk movie watcher by myself
if i take my wife then we see something a little nicer you know
and my kids are all sort of movie watchers
you know we we've always been to a lot of we've always gone to a lot of movies in our life
so but i would just as soon uh be doing something else
and and my wife's a school teacher
and sometimes and she doesn't get home until about seven o'clock
so you know i'll come in like five thirty or six
and i'll turn on the tube set there and have my coffee or coke or whatever and a little t v
and sometimes i set there all evening
i well it
sometimes if if it's real good
like there's more there's been more than one evening that i've uh caught uh every animal show that evening on uh on the discover channel
and uh because they're uh they're they're you know they're documentaries and they're
well that's an interesting channel
oh you bet
in fact i'm glad that it's part of our uh basic cable package
you know i've i've just never spent any time watching it
and you know i like my sports and everything
oh oh me too
and i left at halftime and started dri- driving
well they they who- they whooped up on them
and they're in the playoffs
and i'm not sure that the eagles are not
but uh he's uh he's brought the pokes uh from a a one and something team to uh playoffs in what three years now
as much as everyone you know used the word love tom landry i'm glad that jimmy johnson's there
well it's uh you know it was the time for the passing of the guard i mean
and i think tom knew it
it's you know he earned his stripes
and i wouldn't i wouldn't have blamed him one bit because yeah
but see nobody remembers him as a loser because he's too he's too far he's far too much of a gentleman and a and a practicing christian to uh to ever be thought of as anything but a lo- you know but a winner
oh he is
he's a he's a winner in anyone's book and i hope he's a winner in his own book you know because that's the key there
he is because he has to like himself before he can like other people uh
and i know he's being a little hardnosed about it
but uh you know this ring of honor thing you know he needs to be there because he's earned it
and he was the dallas cowboys
and he won't do that yet
oh he will
so i hope he makes up his mind to do it because he needs to be remembered
well nobody's going to forget tom landry
but he needs to be honored
i mean i'd not a you betcha
but uh i guess if i uh length of length of time i'm in the state now is what after you're here twenty years you're considered native
and i feel like a native
well let's see
oh did you
so uh i haven't looked back yet either
we came we came down from new york state in seventy-four and uh never had any regrets at all
especially looking at some of the weather new york state has had and then look at the weather we have down here
and i've got my last kid graduating from college this next december she's getting married the month before in november
so i will have finished be finished
well we're well we're finished with all but the last one and trying to get him through his technical school and uh we're uh he's over halfway
but i'm really not too concerned
i'm enjoying the chat uh
well i enjoy my t v programs
uh this is a a question that hit pretty close to home
he was his health was failing and uh he was adamant about two things
and we talked uh about some length
and i respected his wishes
he uh stayed at home as long as he could
and then uh he died in a hospital
but um i think that my position wa- is that uh you need to find one that you can really have confidence that they are taking care of the of the uh of their clients and um because i've heard about the many abuses and because he had heard of so many abuses he just didn't want that
and uh so so uh i've thought about this more than once uh you know dealing with
almost thirty all over thirty percent isn't it
and and in talking with uh some of my fellow students it looks as though um nursing homes are not going to be the only option any more
uh it's it's difficult for many families especially in the case of uh of alzheimer's and and uh some of the more degenerative diseases to uh say uh uh leave them to have them at home because then the family becomes completely uh exactly
and and did did you experience that with your with your father or not
uh we had a at one stage we had care somewhat like like what you're talking about
we had the visiting nurses program and they sent somebody in
and it it was a a nominal charge that this uh it started out that the lady would come in i think three times a week and eventually got up to the point where they were coming by every day
they would try to uh you know
they would check him over to to you know the basic checks
try to get him to talk and be motivated and uh that's what we went through
uh up to a point things seemed to be working
and then uh i think he he became discouraged and they did not know how to take care of that
and then um at that point i think it's mostly a psychological problem
and uh but yes
i think it's time that uh we decide to do something about it
you know one of the other subjects on the switchboard and this is one that i've been thinking applies here uh
this would be an excellent example of some where uh some place where um the community could be more involved you know more than just leaving it only to professionals
there is a lot the community the community can do to uh enhance the or or assist the lives of those who are keeping a loved one at home
but in today's large metropolitan areas or even in most even even the rural areas now people are not quite as close as they once were
uh the mobility factor the factor that uh oh we're living longer and people are less trusting all these things tend to destroy this type of system
but i agree with you
that's a that's a good point
uh let's see
so do you use them
um we own one
uh its an emerson eighty eighty-six um two low density floppy drives and no hard drive yet
but uh you know it's it comes in mighty handy
and uh so there's a fair amount of programming getting done on it
but uh uh the uh
right now we got a project going where we're trying to put uh all my wife's stray recipes on the disk
uh it came with a menus program
but uh that doesn't
it it basi-
both excuse me
mostly kind of a pain in the neck without a hard drive and hopefully sometime this spring we'll be able to get one and get it configured
oh gosh it's worth your time to just upgrade
uh impoverished college student
and we got a way out while to pay it off yet
oh that's sounds nice
and yeah it's fun
my job is uh e d p auditor
and so i'm into computers all the time
and it treats me well
uh what are you studying in college computers
well computer engineering technology uh which uh all i can understand is it's a slightly more hands on version of computer engineering
but i've got a ways to go yet
so far most of what i've done is getting gotten core classes out of the way
taken some electronics classes and one class in um with computer logic
the uh lab for that uh computer logic class was a lot of fun
we got to hook up a few uh counters and uh deco- encoders
hardware stuff huh
i've not had a chance to work with it although um my uh data structures teacher was telling us something about how fuz- fuzzy logic works as far as the concept behind it
now how you'd implement that software wise or mechanically i don't know
but uh it sounds like a very impressive piece of piece of work
uh i've written a couple of programs for commercially uh and it's a fun field
just regular uh
but you have to take into account you know with any computer program all the type of things people can do to you to make your program crash or things you normally don't consider
uh messing up your files and things like that
and you're going to be an engineer computer engineer type
well what the computer what the c e t program seems to be so far is just a broad based specialized from
you get programming a fair amount of programming
you get uh more or less uh you get basic electronics courses that uh deal with you know not only the digital circuitry but uh you know power supplies and and uh just the whole gambit but mostly towards uh computer electronics
so the idea is that um you can go in a variety of direction from c e t major
but i sa- i have more with the hardware than i do with the software
i pretty much plan on i mean so far i'm planning to go in the engineering direction
that's good uh
you you got the topic right
uh well where in dallas are you
so you do re- do recycling there
richardson has uh well they have a newspaper pick up once a week supposedly if it's not raining
and they also have a couple of areas where you can take uh cans plastic and paper to uh you know dump them off there if you don't uh want to wait and have a pick up least of paper
but they don't pick up the other items
well i'm i'm in dallas proper in the city of dallas
and i know they do have you know a pilot program going on
but it's not here
so they're not picking up anything
so i mean we we collect everything
we've got all these boxes in our garage for you know green glass and clear glass and plastic and everything
well there's there's a couple places
uh there's a lot of places to take like the plastic uh shopping bags like most of the grocery stores
and there's a wal-mart nearby that takes almost everything
and the library will take glass
so we end up you know
and and as we go places
but uh and it's kind of disappointing i mean
i would even be happy if they just had one you know one place where you could do everything
you know it would still be more convenient than what we have now
uh she's not here anymore but uh yeah
i'm not i'm i'm i'm just i'm north of addison actually
so i'm i'm really
well sometimes we take our uh we always keep our aluminum cans
and a lot of times they take them over to one of these can banks
but normally i collect oh like three trash bags full and i take them over to that can bank
and it's more fun just to kind of like crunch the cans
well you get something
but again that's another stop and it doesn't take plastic bags and and all that sort of thing
but uh i think that you know i heard that it was going well in the pilot area wherever that is
and so hopefully they'll do it soon
that would be good because we have two trash pick ups a week and where i grew up we only had one a week
and that was certainly sufficient
so if they just do
and the alternate time would be recyclables
uh i'm disappointed sometimes they're not always consistent in picking up those papers you know
and like sometimes they come by
but i could certainly have uh three bins out there for you know plastic and and tin and paper whatever they were going to uh separate into and and have them pick it up on on one of the two days per week
do you have to uh sort the paper and take out the glossy pages and that that sort of thing
or do they take the whole thing
you're not supposed to have like the coupons in there
uh or you're not supposed to put magazines in there and you can't take newspapers
now at work uh you know we have changed our recycling
and not too long ago they finally decided if it's anything that's paper and tears you can throw it in there because at first they said
at first they said they said no telephone books
you know well that's stupid
and then they said no newspapers
well in the my department everybody gets the wall street journal
there was like a lot of paper coming out of our department that wasn't recyclable
so i thought that was pretty good to expand upon it
well and they take cans now too
i mean i don't want it with paper
in fact we got this past year we got all of our money for the christmas tree because we saved cans for the entire year
and it worked out really well
well we had the one person who used to take things to the dallas shelter
she collected she used to collect from the whole department
but she took them all down to that dallas shelter place
but it's a charity for the benefit of this shelter
she u- she used to collect them from everybody in the department
because we would get it
well i uh don't seem to have as much spare time as i used to
but i guess i'll have to say my computer has probably taken the place of most of my hobbies
well i sit and design cards and uh oh i i'm really into graphics
so it it just i sit and learn new programs
and i play
and i do this
and i do that
did you have uh your own business
or you do that as just on the side or what
i'm i'm starting a side business in desk top publishing and uh it's just getting going
i i'm teaching in the daytime and uh
oh that's good
well i guess
it's uh to high school kids it's uh alternative learning and uh it's it's really a challenge
but what hobbies do you have
well i uh play trombone in the plano community band
and i uh like to do a lot of bicycling when the weather allows and during summer when there's daylight savings time's when i get out and bike
well i hope you all had as pretty a day today as we did
well it wasn't too bad other than the cowboys didn't do so hot
oh well now yes
just a crummy well actually
the lions are pretty good i'm afraid they pro- a lot better team than the cowboys were today
uh i haven't i haven't played in a while but i do when i get time and it's pretty weather and it's summer i like to play golf
i i play that about six times a year
and every year i hang my bag up if i get that five or six
and i swear swear that game off for another year
but i always go back to it
oh i uh oh i take spells
i'm i'm kind of a compulsive obsessive person
and when i start something i i go into it a thousand percent and then i get i get burned out on it
but uh i do some counted cross-stitch and some painting on shirts
well you do lots of stuff
well it doesn't seem like i get anything done
but i guess i do
i i like to bake
so when i bake it's usually to take out for something
i come up there i'll have to stop by and have try some of your baking
my business is uh machine tool sales
and i have some
i i cover texas and oklahoma
so i what i said that i wasn't being real facetious about that
oh how neat
i got customers in oklahoma city and tulsa and perry oklahoma and eda and all that all that way
so you do quite a bit of traveling then
ooh well that doesn't leave a lot of time for hobbies
see we we have our our band practice is on monday night
and during the summer we uh we have concerts every monday night in the park
and uh we we have you know some concerts during the year
and you know various people in the communities want us to play for things
but those are usually on the weekend
so that isn't too bad
well we got uh pretty good size band
but if everyone did we'd probably have over a hundred
but we only average about forty to fifty people a you know usually
well that's still a pretty bi- good size band
and uh we have a lot of
i i don't pretend to be that good
but there's a lot of people that uh you know are band directors at schools or have been
or uh you know there some people that are actually music majors
they don't necessarily follow that any more you know
but uh we have some extremely good talent in there
and uh as a rule it sounds pretty decent
i i have absolutely no musical ability whatsoever
and i'm always very envious of people who do
i i've always enjoyed it
well i'm probably one of the few people that the
tell me about your ideas on this uh the u s government supporting health insurance and so forth
well i think it's inevitable that we are going to see national health care
and the reason is because the market place doesn't seem to have performed adequately uh the invisible hand that which adam smith wrote has uh provided some very good health care and uh much i think inadequate health care uh
and in some cases the absence of health care has resulted from market place forces
and i think uh it's inevitable
it is just a matter of uh time and mistakes
and they're both inevitable
well what is this going to do the insurance companies who are supporting this work now and hopefully are doing uh a good job
well it's going to make it tough for them
and it's going to be a difficult transition
i don't know uh how it's going to uh play out in terms of the particulars
but i don't think that society will be willing to tolerate the current health care crisis for too long
our uh physical and mental and spiritual health uh it's really uh very costly
and uh as a society
well this is what's bothering me lee another question
do you think that there should be some control uh innovated such that the doctors are not allowed to charge ridiculously over priced things
uh matter of fact in some respects their life might depend on it
but by the same token some of these charges they make for well minor endeavors shall we say on the parts the doctors are really out of line
there are abus- they're abusive of privileges
and that is what is giving the local uh insurance companies hard times
and you get something done
and they want to charge twenty thousand dollars for it
well this i think is one of the things that national health care of some sort of evolutionary process over the next ten or twenty or thirty years will address
because i know this is addressed by uh in canada
i i have a good friend who is uh a physician practicing in canada
and they made the transition uh
and i think that the uh
for example the duplication of magnetic resonance imageries uh
i've i've had one myself
and uh they're wonderful technology
but cities have three or four more than they need or three or four times the number they need
so i think that what the market place doesn't do because of the way the system has worked
and it doesn't allocate resources oftenly because there is a tendency uh at least there has been a tendency to drive up the price of medical care primarily because the insurance companies could pass on the bills
but it's begun to change all of that
the people paying the bills uh
so i think the evolution will be interesting
uh hawaii has a system that is apparently working
and uh it will be interesting to see how how uh much more attention we pay to that
uh i believe that it will contribute to something that we would at this point call national health care whether it's subsidized by the government and and operated by private insurers uh
uh i we would be a lot better off if we if we contracted our national defense to a group who rather that operated as a government entity because we would probably have much less waste
see that that bothers me about the government see
well that's that's the problem with government uh administration of these programs
and that is one of the things that we as society are going to have to deal with
you know that is really a tough one for me to answer
i don't uh i would like to see the greatest improvement in management
my my my field is the cognitive sciences
and i recognize that a lot of these things that are done
and those operating systems have to change
and and as we become more efficient in developing machine operating systems we're going to develop more efficient human operating systems
and so a state or federal application uh could work
uh it all depends upon the way you structure the environment
well in atlanta georgia you probably have a lot more crime than we have here in patterson california
uh this little city is only about eight thousand people
is is crime a problem there
like a major problem minor problem or
well in patterson there's
but like uh i lived in oakland uh until just recently and uh oakland california god they've had like uh sixty-seven murders so far this year compared to like uh forty at this time last year
so it's really bad there
and and it's all related to drugs it seems like
i've only been here for like uh
probably just over six months i start i started school here
but we had a problem there
but here there's just no comparison that much more crime
uh every night the news is very depressing because it just they run down the list of how many people were shot you know drive by shootings or whatever
and it's it it's pretty bad
they've they've actually taken steps to try to make it better
but it still it still is a problem
like i don't know what they can do to make it better unless they just hire more policemen
well that's that seems to be what they were doing
and it has and they've started stepped up more patrols in certain areas
and it has has made some places safer
but you know it's very difficult
i mean if you don't have an infinite amount of money to to try to stop the problem although most people wish you could as it is a it's definitely a problem
and you know the more more less that's done about it the more it seems it tends to spread into smaller areas unfortunately
well i i think that if they would do something to these people that they do catch instead of just slapping their little hands and you know then maybe those other people would be kind of scared
and they would not do these bad things you know
i think i think that uh it's uh seems to be that i don't know some people they te- they do something you know
sentenced to jail for like thirty years they're out in five
and they're back on the street
and then they shoot someone else
and just a a cycle
and it seems seems as though the the system doesn't cha- tend to stop them unless something is drastic is done
i just don't understand our our laws here
because you know like in other countries man i mean they're really a lot stricter than we are
it seems seems as though we try to play humanitarian i think to a little to much
and maybe some of the people don't deserve the the humanitarian treatment that they get
but i don't know
and some something has to be done because i definitely think it's it it really plays reeks havoc with your quality of life when you know you can see it's going on around you
but then when once it finally affects you then then it really starts to bother you
but it seems i mean
people have moved like out of the city because they want to get away from the crime
and so they tend to spread the cities farther and farther out
but you know it's only a matter of time before you know it still catches up with them
you can't really run away from the problem and something you know something has to be done but just that too many people argue about how to fix it
i know when i lived in oakland it was just that uh like i definitely wouldn't go into certain areas of of the city by myself
and uh and then then again some areas i wouldn't go by myself after dark you know
but down here in patterson well like i say it's so small that you can go anywhere
but just uh like twenty miles away see in modesto they have uh those gangs and things over there
and it it's bad
in sacramento also they have uh drive by shootings it seems like all the time
so i don't know
i just i just don't know what what they can do you know
it's it's to bad because it's uh i mean th- just even the random occurrences where you know it's unsafe for a woman just to walk from the car to the some in certain areas like from the car from their car to the mall or something
and it's dangerous
and it's just that's just ridiculous
and you know it's just that's just not right
something you know
i mean like even even going to the grocery store
i know we've had this one lady that was attacked you know
i mean just
and some of the times it's happening in the daytime too you know
so it's not always happening at dark
so i don't know
uh let me see
but uh it seems like i get most of my news from television
i'm we only get the paper on the weekends
and so i'm not much of a of a paper reader
or but i
so i get most of my news like from documentaries like forty-eight hours twenty twenty you know the news at night
well i get a
and uh in addition to that i get a local weekly
i i live in suburb of milwaukee and they get they have community newspapers around here so the local their extremely local
and then i get the sunday uh milwaukee journal because i don't have time to read a paper
uh mostly that's my difficulty
i uh i get my news pretty much from the same sources as you do although i do listen to n p r
i'm not actually uh
but i can run my radio in my office
i i teach at the university
and when i'm not teaching if i choose to have the radio on i can listen to that station
oh i see uh
how are you are you satisfied with the twenty twenty and forty-eight hours and the things that you do watch
i i i pretty much am
and i watch the news at least twice a day
so uh if i've missed something and and i've just recently decided to stay home with my children
and that's so that that's different for me
so i usually find out exactly when it happens and that kind of thing
is that the aspect of the news that you're most interested in is is the timely yo- noting of the events as they happen
it just seems like since i've recently stayed home that is what's happened you know
it's just that uh now that i've stayed home i'm i'm usually aware of when these things occurred and it happened
well i myself uh th- the reason why i listen to n p r and the reason why i watch macneil lehrer
rather than the than the network news shows at night although i do o- watch a local ten o'clock in the evening news which carries over a lot of the national news stories uh is that quite often it seems to me
but i feel that macneil lehrer get a little more deeply into some some of the issues that are really current
and perhaps newspapers do that
but as i said i don't have time to sit down and read a newspaper
and frankly when i have
so uh there's there is some danger to that of course too
because if the analysis is inaccurate or biased or whatever then you know how good is it
but uh i like a little more indepth coverage
and i think that's what you're maybe appealing to you too on something like twenty twenty or forty-eight hours
i'm more interested in trying to understand what's going on in the world rather than simply being aware that you know there that an event has occurred
i i like to stand back and get a slightly bigger picture
but i try and catch most of those programs
and if i miss them i try
and it's pretty interesting
so those evening shows are probably also at a time when you're at liberty to take some time off and be in front of the t v set for awhile without interruption
plus i find that i have to video tape quite a bit of things
oh you do
if i don't want any interruptions you know
uh it seems like ten o'clock at night
but that that's what it seems like ten o'clock at night
and i was
and uh i i ju- i i'm probably one that has to agree with it too
uh there a-
some things that go on that i just feel that i i just feel that that
but i just feel that
but california we just put somebody to death uh for i think it was a double murder
uh to be honest i didn't pay that much attention uh to the details of it uh
but it had a lot of controversy out here
uh basically because in california people like to protest about everything
uh but i agree
i believe that that there are a number of crimes that capital punishment is the best way to go
uh the big disagreement i have is that
and i mean that's that's ridiculous
i mean if you can you know y- y- the trial is supposed to prove you know within a reasonable doubt that the person is guilty
and then they have appeals
well that's fine
but it shouldn't take more
i mean i should think two or three years maximum you should be able to know
and you should be able to either put the guy to death
or he's innocent
i mean it's if he's guilty for for you know multiple murders or whatever the case may be you know
well maybe that's something that needs to be worked on
but i i just feel that that capital punishment needs to stay within the system
was that the man that that claimed he was abused
he was like uh
and that he had he
the the defense the defense they're were giving given was that uh like his mother had had been an alcoholic when when she was pregnant with him
and so he he wasn't you know mentally competent or anything else
and and the court found him competent uh
and he knew what he was doing and everything else
i mean you know it was it was the best defense they could come up with
and how long had he been a- appealing
it was it was something really outrageous
and it seems like it it rarely does happen
you know it's not it's not used that often you know at least here in texas
but i think it's something that needs to stay
i think in general uh
i mean it needs to be you know
and you wait three months
and then you put his nose in it and spank him for it
i mean there there's no connection between the two
i mean you take these you know most of the people who are committing violent crimes most of them not all by any means
but you know a large percentage are the kind of people who are living very much day to day in the first place
uh they don't really see past next week much less next year
and to say you know well if i kill somebody then a decade from now i might face the punishment
my sister and i were wondering about this recently because a an old friend of ours in california
uh her husband just killed her
and we're wondering if that has an effect
if that if something does capital punishment you know does it happen with that within that uh
uh you mean would he be put to death for that
and generally you know from what i understand it's it's only the most
where it's multiple you know
if if they can say things like you know well he was just you know temporarily insane because of
some domestic squabble then you know they'll they'll give him you know twenty years with with parole in in twelve or something like that
and uh i have an uncle that is an attorney that defends people
uh i guess our topic today is air pollution
and we are to just discuss what substances do you think that contribute most to air pollution as well as what society can do to improve the air quality of the atmosphere around us
um does your work entitle uh anything of environmental along these lines
me i'm in the legal department
and um we do have uh a group of attorneys who handle our environmental issues
and i don't know too much about the air pollution thing
i do know for other types of pollution like the toxic waste and such that t i has to dispose of that we normally put in the ground you know we're coming up with a uh a new solution
and we just transport to these places
but after awhile it always seems that the um oh the site starts to leak
and then you have to clean it up and such
but the new idea is to take everything up to sherman
and we're going have that you know incineration place up there and
and supposedly that facility will not generate air pollutants from what i've heard that everything would be in in you know a confined kind of incinerator and just burn it all up
i'm sure we have to have uh permits you know for that place and that there's you know limits as to what we can uh let you know go into the air
it's uh hav- uh uh well
i work in i work in environmentals uh projects right now
and so the sherman deal is um uh
uh what we run into um is we have the texas air control board t a c b that send out uh jurisdictions under which we have to uh uh reply to
and a lot of their rules and regulation aren't real clear so we have our manager of environmental who assist the t a c b which is located in austin in writing
and uh we are presently uh in receipt of a site permit which will allow us to um
this is our side a- allow to have certain emissions up to a certain tonnage
it's in in in tons per year um
and so w- w- you know what we do to make contributions so that basically we go and do things like put in high-tech scrubber systems uh that uh scrub out the n o x and uh v o c's and and ammonia compounds uh like all the acids to a certain level
are very um aware of the opacity which is the thickness of a stack emissions
so if you don't see anything coming out of a stack the opacity is zero or twenty or thereabouts
and so what we go through is uh if you see it smoking there's a problem
and having worked with some of the legal folks very closely uh it becomes a real issue especially when it's smoking
and you have to get it fixed el pronto
as you know they they're allowed to come on site the federaldes anytime they want drive through and see and inspect
so it's a full time uh everybody has their home phone number type of job um
or you're still on the makings of it
the sherman facility we are still in the closer too but still have a little bit of um finalization to do
it's been pitched to the sherman city council with um
and and uh uh tom jones our environmental corporate environmental guys handle the project
and uh its real uh going real well
i think it's matter just a matter of fund funds right now as i understand it uh
but it's uh it's something else
they're they're they're in the same issue
uh because the the system is setup where it won't have any emissions
it will have something coming out of the stackhouse it was it was human nature
but it won't have can any uh any bad stuff
so uh i think t i we spend of all the major semiconductor firms we probably put safety and environmental on the utmost foremost uh uh first thing we always look at
and we probably put more money into the systems and engineering behind the system of any other firm i know of
and uh it's an interesting job
well i know from some of the sites that we've had uh quite a list of cites that have gone bad
and you have to clean up
and you know the law now is the super fund
and anybody who's contributed toxic waste no matter if you were somebody that eventually you know uh damaged the ground or not
uh everybody has to contribute
and it's been a lot of big bucks when we've gotten uh gotten pulled into these super fund deals to clean it up and you know mega bucks to uh you know take everything out and redo it and you know fill in some other area
and um certainly it would to have a better solution like the sherman facility than um just letting it go in the ground
because eventually you know it it seems that no matter what they do if they put it in oil drums and then seal it in some kind of cement lined uh dump area
there there was one site that they cleaned up
and then the new place leaked again
we have we have stuff that's very interesting uh
we have duckwork and all those type of interesting pieces of equipment where um they have um that we sample and it may have over uh a certain emission levels
and so we take it
and uh we can't deep well inject something like that because it's a solid
and we mix it with concrete and actually um potash per se and concrete and then actually put it in the ground but not so not in a hazardous waste location because it's basically a concrete slab
but the cost of doing this is astronomical
and so we were uh very very uh cognizance of and aware of all these types of uh expenditures because it could get very expensive
but i think we uh you know we do all kinds of things to make the the world a better place to live you know
oh you were
so uh i hope you like your office
and we used to be really embarrassed about the gray metal desk
place in you know t i that had the gray metal desk
people used to come and laugh and go gee i hadn't seen one of those ten fifteen years
well the uh i think what changed everything and uh is uh y'all were y'all were the only ones that make any money for ti here in the last ten years
and that's um when when you start when you start paying your way uh you know jerry takes a different outlook towards you guys
in order to make the uh curried chicken i just fried the chicken
until it was nice and brown you know
and then you take it out of the fat
and you you let the chicken you fried kind of drain so that a lot of the oil comes out of it
and then you you uh pour most of the all of the oil out of the pan
and you kind of clean it out
and you put back maybe two tablespoons full of the oil and saute some um bell peppers and onions in in that little bit of oil
and then you uh mix flour and a cup of water maybe uh one tablespoon of flour and a cup of water
then you uh pour that in there you know to make the gravy
and you let it come to a boil again
and then you let it simmer
and you add uh about a tablespoon of what i'm using now is jamaican curry powder
and that's going to it's going to be really good
i mean these bell peppers and curry
and then if you like it really hot you can add some hot hot peppers and hot sauce and all that kind of stuff
oh that sounds really good
uh well it will be in a little while
i'm trying to get it get it ready early
but i was single until i was thirty
so i did cook a little you know
uh and i cook a little bit now
and my wife normally says oh tom why why don't you make a stir fry tonight
and so we even we just were recently married so we have a stir fry pan sort of like a big wok
and we do a lot of um stir fry vegetables
is it is it a real chinese wok
it's it's called a stir fry pan
and it and it fits right on your uh st- it fits right on your burner whether it's gas or electric
so it's it has a flatter bottom than a normal wok does
and um normally what happ- what we do is um just you know like two tablespoons of oil maybe sesame oil or some other type of oil than just regular oi- vegetable oil
but i will use peanut peanut oil or things
and then we just stir fry broccoli and carrots and um green peppers and um maybe put in a little bit of um garlic and ginger uh beforehand
that gives uh uh uh spicier flavor
and then after the stir fry is over just mix in um a little bit of uh sometimes chicken broth
and that sort of makes a uh a glaze
that sticks to the the vegetables
cause i guess we're i'm not
but uh she likes to watch all the how much red meat and things
so we'll do a lot of times vegetarian
but it's a real good meal because you have squash and broccoli and uh carrots and celery and green peppers and um oh gee mushrooms
it's it's a pretty big
and we put that over rice
oh that's that sounds real good except the squash
oh you don't
and she'd have squash and corn bread
and maybe some she'd have chicken or something
and i'd just be
see we never in fact i never had squash growing up
my my wife eats more vegetables ate more vegetable than i did growing up
i'm i'm from pittsburgh
and pittsburgh is a very meat and potato town
oh that sounds good
we we were from north carolina
and we had a garden
and my mother would would uh grow the squash
and she'd grow white potatoes and onions and cabbage and collards and all kinds of
oh she had all of those types of vegetables
see never no vegetables in my family
but i i've i've heard stories uh
and they put the head under a tin tub and chop the head off
and then you hear the chicken jumping around under the tub
and finally it dies down
and then it
oh this is ter-
you shouldn't be talking about this right before while you're fixing dinner
but my dad used to tell stories you know about the way they eat chickens
but i never we never we lived in the suburbs
we we bought everything in a grocery store
but it was funny you know
but when we got married you know a lot more vegetables a lot more you know a lot of changes
well that's good
but we just went shopping
and we came back with uh with uh sweets you know chocolate covered peanuts
and uh we came back with sweets
i'm trying to learn how to cook um deserts without without all of the sweets you know maybe use honey or something
well that's that's supposed to be um the trend of the future
but uh the cut back
i uh recently was over a friends house that's indian
and uh she had brought indian sweets into the office
and it was really funny because they were made from yogurt and carrots
and i was like ugh
oh it is it's a candy
i'm like ugh you know
but everything was and everything
but everything was sort of hot
but then after a couple of minutes you could taste it
you know it had that that after taste that very it was a very indian flavor
they were very yogurt and carrots and pin- pistachios pistachio nuts and yogurt
and it wasn't very good
well i might have liked some of that
i i like hot stuff
well have we done our ten minutes
oh is it ten minutes
nor- normally they just come in
and they say you've overextended your your conversation
oh well this is my first one
you'll see it will normally it will come on
and it'll say you've over extended your conversation you now have fifteen minutes to compl- fifteen seconds to complete it
but uh i've been cut off twice
so i just thought
i'm hearing a siren outside i think my my neighbors car must have got bumped you know
one of the the neighbor has an alarm on a car
and it's going off
so i was going to go out and see what they were doing
hey thanks so much
and you said this was your fi-
well you'll you'll get a couple more probably
i uh i called yesterday i or friday
maybe i talked to somebody that uh i got them on uh during the day
and she was home with two kids
and while we're talking the kids are screaming in the background you know that they wanted something
and they were arguing back and forth
and she just kept talking the whole time
hey thanks a lot
so uh do you own a p c
but you have one at work
and now because um
see i'm i'm doing my uh master's in computer science and computer engineering
and um and i i don't have one
but i have to use them
like during especially during my undergrad
you you use um
like your first couple of years you use personal computers because uh you know the software
you know like it's easier for you to go to and run a program
you know through the disk
because um the grader can do it at home
then as the you know as you go up higher like in your senior level you're doing projects which are are so big
and you have to have so many people sharing the same data
that you can't use personal computers so you have to use you know a main frame
i know i uh i do have a uh you know a computer at home
but it's one that the company has loaned me
and that that's been my situation is that uh that way i can get in access our uh computers that i have up here and you know do work from home
but does it have uh like a disk drive
because uh the ones that we use yo- you know are like unix base systems
and so they don't have a disk drive
you know so you can't
and you you know you just do it that way
but that's uh that's the only way that you can get to through to the system
i um i i have both because that that's what i use all the time is unix systems um versus the dos
but then i teach dos classes uh at night
and then you also have to do all your grading on the p c
well that that's the really neat thing i teach in the continuing education classes so i don't uh i don't have to have grad- any grades no grade books so that's great
i find that i use the the personal computer a lot though for my wordperfect
um so i think it's extremely helpful and very useful
well uh for us it's uh uh you know it's like for doing like you know like resumes
um um uh-huh
we use like for example a mackintosh which is a lot easier for graphics
than the p- than you know the i b m p c's or anything compatible with that
due due to the fact that well you know i i haven't tested the the p s two yet
um um uh-huh
but i don't know if the software is as easily you know like you can manage it a lot easier than than the old one
you know with the mouse you do it you know like a hundred times faster
and uh you also get you know
when you see it on the mackintosh with you know the one i have
and that's the way it's going to print out
and especially if you have a laser printer it's going to print out the same way as it's on the screen
and so with you know with the i b m what would happen is uh since the software that i had was it was basically you know you only see part of the page
and so the whole page you you never can actually see it
and they have to zoom out and zoom in
and you know it's like every time that you have to do something is it's really a pain
and also you know it's like for for presentations
it's like if you have to do any statistical data it can be easily represented on a on a p c
it can be easily represented on a on a p c
you know like years back when you didn't have that you would have to map out all this all these numbers
and get a graph which you weren't sure if it was okay or not you know
but with a with a new system i can calculate everything so fast
you know like for spread sheets
and i love all the windows that they have out now too
i i had a i had a program due
and uh one one window i had the program
and the other one i had the program running
so if there was ever a mistake i could easily check you know
you know go back and forth
and and you know you always you know
the old ones you had to go out of your program load up um uh well load up the program again
run uh-huh as long as it took
but with windows you can have the program
and say it messed up in line fifty-four
so you take a look at line fifty-four
and you can see that where it messed up because you know it's like in the old computers the ones that uh we're using here a couple of years ago you would always have to have a printout
i know i uh i remember my college days
di- did did you learn it in computer science
and when was this
uh i graduated in eighty-six
so it's been fairly recent
i know because uh all i know is that when i came here in eighty-seven they still had uh
it was the last year to to put all your punch cards in
oh oh dear
but it it was just sensational because i walked in
and they go oh my god they're still using this
and you know
and that's about it
so but i mean the price of computers has gone down
they said that um if the auto industry would have kept the same trend as the computer industry has ever since you know it started
they said that uh cars would cost two dollars
and they would run forever
oh that would be great
so i mean it's like you know the the joke with the yugo you know
it's like yeah yo- you know like when your uh car runs out of gas just throw it away
and that that's the way it would be
it's like yeah i think i'll buy a new car today you know
but i mean the price has really gone down
i mean i b m which uh
an i b m p c in like in nineteen eighty-one it would cost you five thousand dollars
and now you can get it you know like for one thousand dollars because you know because of the parts basically
and the two eighty-six too
they're not charging you you know over pricing
it because it's like if we sell it for less you know it's like we're losing money you know
and i think they stopped producing the i b m p c
and uh and the uh p c junior was a total failure
they had uh
but the only problem was that when they took that one out the small computer was the i b m p c
and so you couldn't you know
it's like sure bring out n- into the market something that's smaller when no- nobody uses anything that's smaller than you know this you know
but over the past years it's like i b m has been producing like
you know like the p c x t a t and the p s one p s two things you know
and so it's just that you have to always compete
and uh mackintosh took a lot of the market from a lot of schools
because of of their you know
so that's what they're trying to do
and uh have a good lunch
now we used to be big time campers
but now we're not quite so much since the kids are involved so much in sports
w- we went like twenty or thirty at a time
we took uh just our little tents
and we did it that way
and we did it that way
oh how neat
so we've always enjoyed camping
well i know i have um i just have a tent
and the kids and i like to go out and camp in the tent
and then i bought a van
and that way i can sleep in the van and be more comfortable
and when they go on vacation a lot of times they'll just sleep in the van you know
like one night
and the next night they'll stay at the motel you know or something like that
and they enjoy it
i don't i don't think i'm a real true trooper you know when it comes
but i i try
but but i try
you know to uh to get out there and enjoy everything
but what was so fun though is that i had to take my son to the doctor this morning because he went out camping with some friends
and he got poison ivy
and it's all over him
the poor thing you know
so there's definitely hazards to going camping if you don't know what you're looking at
but now i enjoy it every once in a while
i mean it's not something i'd want to do real often
well have you done much camping around texas
well not really because usually it's when we go off
you know like for a couple weeks or so
well have you camped all over the united states
see now i haven't so that
oh it really is
well i know my parents like to camp a lot
and they uh they've been going to gulf shores alabama
and uh which is really really neat
and it's not real populated so they can they feel like they're in the outdoors and still close to the ocean
and uh from what i understand from them it's really really pretty there
you know i just like to go
well have you done much camping up in kentucky and and those parts
um we've been well we've been to wyoming you know and kentucky and montana and you know places like that
but usually if we're with a group of people we really don't stay any one place very long
you know like if we're just going through and they camp one night and then head on
but now that we have children and we go every blue moon
yeah that's that's my idea of camping
but we're uh we're getting more into it
and we've done uh we've done quite a bit
and uh uh the kids like to go out you know as often as they can
um so that's good
you know they're they're becoming enthusiasts then of camping
but by the time we really get a chance to it's july you know
and it's so hot
and our camper do- doesn't have an air conditioner
but we hadn't did that
well that's really neat
and they're you know they're in like and scouts and stuff like that you know
oh that's neat
well how old is your boys your children
well i well i have um a son that's uh going to be eleven here pretty soon
so they're they're getting old enough to where they can help out with a campfire and
cooking and and all that kind of stuff too
so that's that's really neat
so they really enjoy it too
i i agree with you
and but this wasn't so fun this last time for nathan to to get out there
and he didn't realize he was touching poison ivy
and it got all into his eye
and it was really swollen
and uh so they had to give him shots and everything
or what bushes whatever they are
but i have uh brother-in-law and a sister you know that just really just camp
you know they love to go camping
they could they would all the time they wanted you know
but i'm just not that involved in it
now i like to go out like several times a year
but not on a on the regular basis
when you know in the season
uh and and i just couldn't do that
me i haven't really as far as entertainment
but i guess my entertainment's
see i see they just want to get away
but every friday night they'll go home you know straight from work
and they'll pack up
and you know and then they'll leave
and i'm just going you know
by friday night i just want to crash you know
and i want to go home and you know do all that
oh i don't either
and then uh get out on the road to boot
but anyway that's their life
but they probably live in a city also
well see we're in a real small county area
and you know that makes a big difference
because if we want to go camping we can just go just a few miles you know
well it was nice talking with you
and we'll probably be talking to you again
well take care
so do you have any credit cards
i keep uh i have an american express and a visa card that i keep you know kind of for emergency purposes
and i have you know i use a gasoline credit card which i you know pay off every every month
but i've i've gotten rid of all of the credit cards you know that i possibly could
and my balances are practically zero on the ones that i have
especially since you know it's no longer after this year
or after tax year nineteen ninety there's no deductions for you know credit card interest that you pay
so it's a you know gosh
credit cards run what anywhere from up to eighteen nineteen percent i guess
course there are emergencies you know that you you know probably need to have a card
that's that's probably enough
and i try not to use it
but right now it's maxed out
it's it's very easy to you know to do that or you know to abuse it
but we're trying our best not to not to add any you know credit card debt to our structure here
um i have uh
the thing that bothers me worse than the credit cards i think is uh you mentioned the gasoline credit card
but i've got you know one of the tex- the the instant teller cards that you can use for point of sale purchases
and we use that usually to buy gasoline
and it's just it's really amazing how quickly that goes
i don't i don't i don't participate in that
but you know a lot of folks do
at least with the uh
but you know the instant thing may be may may be the way of the future to you know to replace checks and every other thing
that's what they've they've talked about it
oh it was well
they consider it to be the same as cash well cause it actually is
i i understand it's becoming you know the popular thing to do
and i don't really perceive doing it unless we absolutely have to
but uh i have in times past gotten into a bit of trouble with credit cards
it's just you know too easy to do
but i'm so glad he told me that when that they they got to such a point with their credit cards they didn't want to cut them up because they were afraid sometime they might actually need them
and then they stuck them in a thing of water and froze them
i mean that's funny
well that's a novel idea
now there are times when you'd at least think you do anyway
i i want to still have just one just in case
but i'd sure want to get the get it paid down and not use it for a while
we're really not compulsive shoppers you know
we we plan purchases you know pretty well you know watch for the best buys things like that
but uh some people have a real problem with it
well our our limit is you know fairly low and uh so that's that's one thing that's good
oh i'm sorry
well um we lived
and i was used to the heat
and i was used to what couldn't grow
and we had a small um farm house out in castroville which is just uh to the west of san antonio and we
and when we came up here uh to california uh we're in the monterrey area
and it's very uh nice sandy soil rich soil
and the weather is perfect for growing just about anything you want to grow so we've been out here well really in the house since december
and we've been uh planting flowers that we could never plant
in san antonio because the heat would just dry them up after you know about three
and uh we're at the edge of a forest area so there's a lot of pine mulch
uh it's been raining pretty much continually now uh off and on maybe one day of break for about a month
and so there is
and now with all the rain everything is just gorgeous lush and green and beautiful
and i hope that it holds out here after the summer
but uh that has been the major change that we have noticed in gardening
and that's about the extent of what we've done just a little bit on the patio and waiting for the rain to subside so we can
we after about a month we finally got to mow this weekend
but um we're just so happy to see green
um well we just moved to our first home
and we had lived in a condominium before
so we didn't have any lawn and garden type duties
so we're just learning the ropes here
but when we moved in um
our backyard has so many bi- tall trees in it that there jus- there wasn't even a blade of grass in the backyard
so we're you know going talking to some of our friends that are landscapers and things and learning about different kinds of grass
and it just seems so funny to me that when i grew up in missouri
and you didn't have to worry about growing grass there
so do you have to get a shade tolerant grass
we tried we planted
it stayed pretty pretty green throughout the winter
and it's pretty goo-
it doesn't look like it can withstand too much you know
it's supposed to die off like in august
and then you replant it in september
so but we don't
and um so mostly you know we're not even to the point where we're getting into flowers
let's get grass so that the kids can play in the yard and not have to be worried about the dirt so much you know
well when we
and uh and eventually well especially when it was so bad last year well i guess it was the year before now uh it was so hot that year
um we were just watering all the time
and so when we left you know the back yard had some um
but primarily once the weeds
but i don't know
or you would spend so much money trying to keep a large lawn alive
and we were sitting there wondering there must be a better way to landscape so that you don't have to spend so much money trying to keep the lawn alive and green and the weeds out
and we never
and um so it's been real fun here to see
and so there's a lot of market up here since it's kind of the area that people are moving into in the dallas area and big market for for yards yard work
so well everybody it seems like everyone is so particular especially in the dallas area
there there's so much money
and everyone can afford
and another thing i've noticed is that the lawns in some of the homes
i noticed that they're really putting in small back yards because they have these most of the houses have the alleys that run behind
and so that really cuts into your backyard space
and but we don't do our work here out of enjoyment so much as
right now we're just this is we just moved in in september
so we're just still at the point where we're talking about
oh it's awful the first house
and we had no idea the expense that lawns and gardening
and then when it comes to fertilize then it would come to raking
and then when it comes to making sure that somebody had put the timer on the water
and the one thing that i did notice is that people that have the underground irrigation systems the sprinkler systems just that was the way to go if you could do it
people that were building the new homes that put those in that was that was the only way to go because it was just so convenient
and the timer would run
and it would water their lawn
and they didn't have to worry about it at all
and that was so nice
but we didn't have that luxury
so we were dragging th- the sprinkler around everywhere
and so i hope you can find uh
i remember the guy that was on the radio um
i had this one well i've still got the book
it's um i think it's just called texas gardening
and it talks about the different grasses to use for the shady areas versus the really sunny areas
but there is a grass that you can use that is shade tolerant
but i don't remember what it is
but it's got like a boot on the front of the book
it's like texas gardening
and it talks about you know different problems that your lawn can have and how to recognize it
and it goes into the full gamut of gardening you know everything from flowers to bulbs to perennials to grass to weeds to trees and to uh how to prune
but one of the things i do remember was when it talked about the grass
and i think one of them was a blend of two types of grass that they had used
but i don't remem- i don't remember if it was raleigh and saint augustine or or what
but i do remember they had used a blend
well we're going to have to do that because we have the shade the trees
and um the trees are just so tall
and there must be ten or twelve big tall trees out there so that like even if its raining you can
oh but that's so neat because so many homes don't have that
so you'll be cool all year around
well that's what we're looking forward to
and that's what they say the payoff is
well we ha-
and the people that moved in next to us they built a new house on the empty lot
and they just had their brand new little trees
they any time they had people over they had to do it on the patio because it just got too hot during the day
so oh that's great that you have them
well there are all different kinds
oh that's even better
there are some oaks magnolias and like plum trees peach trees
uh so you have children i take it
so it's not a very valid topic
well i have two dogs
oh we have one
rather rather odd personality
he he's fun
anyway uh time we spend with our children
time spent with mom and dad is
especially when they get like into the teenage stage
they you know
but we do spend time driving in the mountains
oh how nice
and i thought if i do that i might not have a job
it's it's better to be employed
and that creates family tensions
i don't have any an- children
so how does she feel about going out and doing stuff with you all
you know they they'd much rather be with friends
well i remember
well i'm sure part of it is a male female thing you know
i i remember whenever i was growing up often times spent with my dad was oh just wonderful you know go go hunting or go to the races
or or oh any number of things
and we'd have um great times
and it seems that well now the bank's not available
but you know we do have our trips
and we do have our fun
hunting and and
and i said well you can take a little girl hunting and fishing just as easily
uh but they don't like it
there there there is a difference there
and i enjoy it
well girls at that age
and that's a little tough for fathers
so is that quality time
but there is camping
and we both enjoy that
well that's good
so what do you think about child rearing
how how would you spend time with kids
probably doing outdoorsie stuff and keeping trying to keep them away from the t v i guess
i i always said that if i had a kid they wouldn't know what mcdonald's is
but they learn from their friends
and amazingly a lot of times it's real easy
you know a lot of times whenever we head out of town on a trip or something
and breakfast is a kind of a funny meal anyway
and uh kids eat funny
and she was talking about her daughter said one week her daughter will uh be on a no meat kick
and one week she'll eat nothing but twix candy bars you know
and little girls are worse about it than little boys
or or something yeah
go on a diet or they they have a well
you know like it's really morally wrong to eat meat or something
i i'm not sure
oh is that where you're from
so i understand about bass
but it but it is interesting
i i will tell you
every person out there should have kids at least once or or have some they can borrow for a time
uh but jenny is a sweet kid
and it it's funny
you know we were talking about how much it cost to go to disney land
you know for just for just a day not in- you know a day or two not including lodging and food and all that
and i understand six flags is real expensive now
but at least once you pay your way in there
you know disney world or disney land
well our problem is that you know a trip to six flags or disney world or uh disney land or god forbid disney world would take forever
or you'd have to pay air fare
and ooh for a family you know for a family it gets pretty expensive pretty quick
my dad worked for braniff when i was a kid so we got you know our air fare free
and we got
my hobby is uh sewing
i i've just uh started learning how to sew
and uh i've taken some classes
and i've made a few few garments
i used to uh
i i sewed you know in high school
and when i went to college i think everything in my closet i had made
but i haven't sewed since then
and that's been fifteen years
so uh you know i didn't have access to a machine the whole time i was in college
and uh my sister sewed
and she needed the money so i would pay her
and she'd make my clothes
and uh and then just in the last you know ten or twe- i just haven't sewn anything
i would love to i would like to get back to it
uh clothes are getting so expensive now in in the stores
and the the quality is is sometimes so poor that
uh it it really is worth while to sew
it is you know an even back then
i remember you could make something for you know half what it cost to buy
and of course the quality was just exceptional
uh now it's a little more expensive to make it because y- you know you start paying the price for the patterns and the material
but it's still such better quality that i think it's worth it
and the patterns have gone up tremendously too the prices for them you used to could get you know a pattern for two or three dollars now they're like you know five six seven eight
see i can remember paying seventy-five cents for a pattern
the the cheapest ones now are like maybe f- uh four or fiv- five dollars
and then you get into the vogues
they get up t- into twelve and fifteen and
well do you have kids and a husband
uh right now i'm just sewing for myself
i i do have two daughters that you know out they're they're grown now though
i wish that i had started sewing you know when they were younger
and uh it would have helped me out tremendously
but um oh i guess i i just you know i always i have always tried to sew
and uh i didn't like the way it looked so i'd never wear anything
but now i i r- have bought some uh new sewing equipment
uh it really makes it look professional
and i've taken some classes here in in uh dallas
well and that always is helpful for starters
it's just there's just so many people sewing now days
well do you do anything el-
do you knit or crochet like for sweaters or anything like that
see i'm n- i've not ever been a real craft type person
i have a sister-in-law that i mean if it can be done with your hands she does it
and i look at them
and i think god you know i i should be able to do things like this
i have a sister that can can uh crochet real well
or or knit i i guess i mean knit
and she knits things like hats
and uh sweaters an you know
well when my sister oh when my sister had her first uh child my niece
and this is we're talking fifteen years ago i was it was my last year of college
and i asked my roommate if she would teach me how to crochet granny squares
so she did
and i crocheted a blanket for my sister's baby
and i started crocheting a king size bedspread for a guy that i was dating at the time
and when we broke things off
actually we were supposed to get married when i got out of college
so when we broke things off i quit crocheting it
and i've never picked up a needle since then
oh my goodness
now now they have the uh knitting machines that will do it for you
my problem i guess is time you know
i i talk to my husband
we kind of planning for the time eventually when you know maybe i can quit work while my kids because i my kids are young
and he says
but bev i think you'll be so bored because you know all you've ever done is work
and i said but there's so many things i want to do
i'd like to learn how to do this cross stitch and these you know knit these things
and i think that would be fascinating
are you familiar with what a serger is uh the serger sewing machine
well you know in when we used to sew we'd sew the seam
and then we'd finish the edges
and we we would uh trim the seams and finish the edges
well this machine does it all in one step
so like as you're sewing the seam it's finishing off the inside edge
and it's cutting off the uh
the there there are two knives
and it cuts off the uh you know excess seam allowance
well that takes all the work out of it
well how neat
especially on you know i mean from the inside you know how you look under under something that you've made
and it doesn't really
but uh the serger really makes it look professional
well that's neat
i paid like about eight hundred dollars for mine
so since i bought it and paid that much for it i guess i'd be- might as well get some use out of it
well that sounds really good
i i play the piano
oh so do i
oh you do
well i have one here
and my folks gave it to me
and uh a couple years ago when they they sail
and so they sold their home
and they they've been sailing
and uh so it's here
but i haven't touched one like since college so i kind of am picking it all out again and trying to remember how to do it again
and of course my kids jump in the middle of it and want to pound on it
and i'd love to teach them to play too
so i'm not great
but i remember it
well i'm not that great either
i i have played for uh the church choir
and but i you know i don't practice a lot anymore
and uh you know you get rusty
but i'm rusty now
well i i figure it takes practice
and i i don't i say i don't have the time
i you know i've worked all day
and i come home
and i do that
i and you know even hobbies and crafts and sewing things like that i i think gee i could do this or that
so i try to save that for the weekend
well sewing does take up take an awful lot of time takes an awful lot of time
if if somebody would lay it out for me then i didn't mind cutting it out and sewing it
and i i can remember once in high school i wanted some extra money
and my mom wanted some pants
so she laid out the material
and i cut it and sewed it
and she paid me i think like two dollars a pair
but i i hate laying out material and trying to get the most out of the material and
on the on the right on the straight grain
that that's that's the part that i don't like too
i i like sewing sewing up the garment itself
but the the cutting and the all the
well what are some of the other features on this machine
well that's about it really
it's it has four uh four threads instead of the the regular basic two threads
and uh it
or is that for the regular seam in the fabric
you you can either use three or four of the threads
uh it's kind of it the stitch is kind of like a knitting machine like the they're loopers under the bottom
and then the there's a seam stitch
and it's the loopers that form the the edge you know that edge finish
and uh that's what really makes it look professional
you can make uh piping and cording
and uh you can use all kinds of different uh textures of thread
so it has the ability to do just about any type of sewing you want to do
but you you have to use it in combination with a sewing machine
y- you you need it to do things like button holes
and uh seams that need to be really strong need to be done on the sewing machine
so the serger is not a sewing machine itself
it's it's a it's a it's a machine
but it do- it does sew the seam and trim the edges and all that stuff
but there are oth- are other things that a regular sewing machine does that it doesn't do like you can't top stitch with it
you know you can't do top stitching
it will also do a rolled edge um
gee it's just so versatile
i rem- uh
well i'm going to have to go check it out
so uh what do you think
i mean we're we're taxed on taxes
and um uh most all government entities are just trying to give us a state income tax for those who don't have it that is
i mean we don't have one yet
but eventually they may try to push it through
so they have n-
no no state income tax
oh that's great because they don't have it in florida
i mean you know like i say i'm in new york
and we have a state tax as well
so that just cuts even more
i i think that i
i mean i wouldn't be so upset about the amount of taxes paid if it weren't for the fact that they don't they don't go to any place
you know y- you don't see it going to any place where it belongs
i think if it were to be uh if it were to be um if it were to be
but given that it that it's not spent properly i think it's a major problem
well we're really overburdened from federal state and local
well that's certainly true
well what is it they were just talking about um sort of middle income you know how how middle income people
what winds up happening is for instance having kids you know they wind up having kids as a deduction
and after but the deduction is so little for kids that they wind up having to pay more in taxes than it costs to raise a kid for the year or something
so they want to you know try an- i think they're trying
i think tha- i think that most of the politicians understand this
they just don't they're just not very good at doing what they're supposed to be doing
well they're kind of put into a trap of being out there to please the special interest groups as well
and uh i think the only way that can be changed for us to get a a better tax revenue that's fairness and all is for us to limit their terms
and by doing so they're not obligated to anybody
and uh i don't know how we're going to do that right away though
but what what in general though that taxes are doing to us is it's just taking uh a bite out of our savings
and then and then uh i'm i'm just not sure if i see you know if i see it going like i say to the right places
i mean it'd be it'd be one thing if it were taking a bite out of your savings and then you were getting it all back when you got older
you know but i'm not convinced that's a- tha- that social security is doing as well as it should and you know and and and uh and and that you know those people who need it for welfare and so forth who really need it for welfare not the eighty-five to ninety percent of them who don't need it but i mean the real people who really need it you know should be getting it
but instead i think it's going to the wrong places
and i believe the social security tax is a great scheme
it's uh you know
and that scares the hell out of me
tha- that's illegal see
if uh most company uh c e o were to do that within their private company they'd be in jail
i don't i don't
well becau- because they're the ones who make the laws
so who's going to yell at them you know
and and uh and an performed a citizens arrest i guess
and you know but i don't know if we can do that or not
a lot of people have become too complacent and believe everything is just the norm as to the way things are going and feel absolutely helpless to oppose a lot of the situations going on
but um yeah
like like you said i wonder you know if if it's certainly not going to be a slow change process
and i wonder if it'll ever be a change process
i sort of i sort of get discouraged when i think about all the things that i think are wrong
you know all those things that really could be changed that aren't you know that that aren't
and tax is one of those things that just sort of sits way up there on the list
so i don't kno-
i i i have no idea what to do about it
well there's no quick solution or no sure fire easy answer
it's just going to take uh uh really uh uh uh a combination effort i think of the majority of the american people to come to a decisive answer
see we we're we have no say so as to where the money goes in the first place
i mean the only say so we have is supposedly by electing people who we think are going to vote one way of another
and they are controlled or pretty much do what they want to do
i've never quite understood that i've never uh you know even though um i i've never been uh sort of politically minded
but it's never been clear to me as to sort of um you know how congressmen an can can just sort of go ahead and vote their own conscience as their own ideas when clearly their constituency doe- doesn't back them up on anything you know
and often times that will happen
well they feel invu- invulnerable to uh any wrath
uh it's it's occurred so many times that they figure people will usually forget and don't think about it when the election time arises
and generally it does work out that way
they do forget it's true coul- because everybody
think of what happens is whenever the politici- whenever th- the one who made that supposed mistake turns around
and uh his his or her opponent can say well look they did this
and they can turn around and say well my opponent did this
so it becomes uh a general battle of the w- sort of the election of the lesser of two evils i think
i just uh i'm unhappy with it
and well i'm i'm sort of semifortunate right now
so i don't make that much
and what i make isn't taxed very highly because i'm still in school
well when you get out into the real world then you'll know
but it's my my my wife has a real job
and you know when i get her job um you know we we look at her paycheck i'm just floored when i see how little of it we're actually allowed to keep
my my wife does
so you're taxed on the bonuses too
my my wife is taxed on her bonus as well
and that's a that's usually a big chunk of her bonus check actually
i mean her bonus isn't that much
but they tax it as
i i guess they tax it as if that were her weekly check or something
so she gets destroyed on her bonus check
so she works with in in in sales
so a good portion of her you know her salary is is quarterly bonuses
uh sales is lucrative
but then you're paying really high taxes when you're doing a lucrative job
she's not entirely sales so it isn't it isn't as lucrative as one would hope
but it it keeps us supported temporarily
so i don't know
i d- i guess i guess at this point in time we're just sort of going to have to live with it
well i have i guess about said what a- all i can think of to say
it's re- a rather touchy topic at that
i i i do agree with you most most wholeheartedly
well that's great
and it was a very difficult choice
and he well he must know is he interested in law or medicine
but that's one of the reasons why he chose williams that it has solid liberal arts
while they're east coast i mean i don't know anything about their football
but there you go
well they're they're they're really very strong academic rather than you know big sports
where where you at
we're outside of uh washington in maryland
i'm in uh suburban dallas
about all i can say is i guess about picking schools um i guess uh if you don't know what you're going to do liberal arts program is a good idea
well i i
one of the the advices we've given our children is that you can always learn a job uh but what you can't learn uh on a job is a good solid well- well-rounded education
that's right you know
the renaissance man and uh and if you get that you can
and if you do well you can you can learn a job
but they you know if they learn the job and they can go into graduate school usually a company it will if it's worth it's weight will subsidize
this this is true
and if you want to go away
so the advice we gave to them was number one visit the colleges that you're thinking about describe first of all the size school that you might be interested in do you want to go away
now my son is a national level competitive swimmer so he wanted to swim in school
but he did not want to be in a swim factory
so he wouldn't have gone to something like where we're at they'd in austin texas university of texas
well that's i think the other thing is too um i know i went to a uh city high school in chicago and a lot of the kids weren't as fortunate as say my brother and i were
and economics was the choice um sounds like your son has academically the standing to get into that type of school
so we've just
but you know he had to look to see what kind of environment he liked
and yet he he did wind up having to make a choice
he did apply to a large you know large group
pennsyl- university of pennsylvania
i mean that's you know and it's it's well it's a little bit i don't want to use the word wilder that's not the word i want um more diverse
and it but it does have the under you know
that's total undergraduate with five hundred graduate school so that the uh the college of arts and sciences is you know i guess about four thousand
well how large is williams
williams is an undergraduate school only um and it's a total of two thousand
well that's not bad
so he knew the feeling because my other son is at amherst which is fifteen hundred and he had visited his brother at amherst and knew that he liked the environment but he did go on college visits
and he liked
i mean i not having any children my husband was an ohio state person
and uh that has something like either the first or second largest student population like fifty thousand
and they both boys had decided no that they did not want that
and i mean i um i can only say it's strange your son picked those kinds of college because i spent a year at bennington in vermont
um and that was this was twenty years ago
and did you ever eat at the blue bin diner
well let's not talk about that
but we've been there when whose gone up there
it's um in that area
i mean i just can't say enough about it
oh it's it
and he was you know impressed by the clean air
and he he met the students at both schools
and he liked them
well you know um my husband's an engineer and a strong a strong liberal arts background with uh a graduate degree in a technical field will get him much further than say like a a strong um business administration degree than with another m b a on top of it
and they usually
but they usually don't
the thing is if if a person really knows very early on that they want to go in a technical field than you're not then it's probably good to go to you know to apply to a school with a good technical program
but uh for if you're going into
if you know engineering is the thing if then you've got to at least take engineering
but who does
i mean i think i think all i think the majority of people just don't know
he looked at criteria such as location size of school uh
i mean a lot of kids just don't even want to go
and williams is about seven
oh that's not too bad
so well i mean he so it wasn't
he you know
then the university of pennsylvania is like two hours from here by train
and he will
and if it came down i mean as he he came
and and he came down
and one of the things that he said is he went to pennsylvania this weekend
and he had an absolutely marvelous time he had a great time
but then he said you know it was such a good time that i almost got the feeling that their emphasis is on having fun
and he said it almost back-
so he's developing his his uh internal instincts right now
that's good because i mean i'm sure what he said was true that uh you
well actually that's one of the reasons i went to
kenyon he we- he made a good choice
i well i was supposed to
but i spent a year in vermont my freshman year
it was too different uh the level of income of lot of the students
and their attitudes was just um beyond my
um in terms of drugs et cetera which i thought was shocking
but then i went
but i did uh
and my hus- was that uh he had to really decide what he wanted out of college
uh in a larger school he had to realize that if he was going to screw around it he could probably slip
and it wouldn't be caught up until it was too late where in a smaller school where especially in a kenyon or a williams where you see the professors around town all the time you skip class in the morning and they see you
and you're going to get a little bit more input
and a swim coach is going to be right on top of you uh so that
and he will know the professors in a small
well i don't know how to put this either in this way
and then it doesn't sound like your sons would need this
but i just think the other thing is with the way a lot of the youth is today i think the refinement that they get i don't mean specifically or culture but just what you're saying just a solid background because i just don't think at that age i just don't think that young people know what they want to do
and um and it's just the personal contact where if you need help he had
are you the kind of person that will go into a large college and if the professor says i've got office hours but you really don't feel that you know him because you're in a class of a hundred that you're really going to look him up but if it's a class of fifteen and you need help you know that it's much easier to do it and especially in the large schools they have lectures and even though they may break it up into smaller groups penn is known for having graduate assistance teaching
and i mean that is very ironic too that your son just made the
he made the decision uh i'd say about uh an hour and a half ago
i mean that's so funny i mean
and and in fact he had just an hour before that two uh recent graduates from kenyon spent close to two hours talking with him and uh i mean and he they were really nice
and but he said is that they didn't tell him anything that he didn't know
but they helped confirm his decision that a smaller school was better
i mean we're talking about what you think
but obviously you're experiencing it uh
did your other son um
the moment he knew he he decided early on that amherst was the school
he's a classical guitarist and he decided he also got into the graduate school of music as an undergraduate for classical guitar
but he decided he was going to go to the um the smaller now and then graduate school later
and they'll do fine in their studies
and i'm sure they'll go on to graduate school
well he's really my older boy's real happy
and he's minoring in english
and he had thought about economics
and he took a couple of courses in economics and decided that wasn't
and now he's a sen- he's a senior
or is this early admissions
he's um he's going to be a junior
he'll be he's finishing his sophomore year so he's double majoring
so he's so he's yeah
well sounds like you have two talented sons
well you know see the advice we give is to not limit yourself especially this you know go to a school where you're not forced to make too many irrevocable decisions your first year or two
and it's not the economics i solely zeroed in on
but i think a lot of people think a lot of people think about the tuition level and what exactly are you getting in return and i think that a lot of people shy away from the smaller coll- colleges because of that
and i think it's rather sad
well one of the things we said is that they should pick the college
well we place a real high priority on education in our family
and i agree
i mean my husband and i
in fact i'm taking my l s a t um
oh that's great
the point being and your sons will learn this from you i'm sure that uh no matter what age you are you can learn and it sounds like they're going to you know they're
well let's see
oh that's great
i we just bought uh a seventy-three mercedes that we have restored and it
i'm i'm a hobbyist too
uh we found some guys that actually you know worked for a mercedes dealership
oh that's good
and uh they also repair them for other the people on their off time so have we we have redone that thing from stem to stern i mean inside outside you know we've redone the body repainted it detailed it so you know i really haven't thought much past that
why they they didn't
what would you buy you know
i i don't know it just seems like uh you know for what we've put into it i feel like that's something that might retain it's value a little bit more
than you know
vehicle is is great
we the one thing that uh we did decide as it's it's
but we did break down and put a c d player in it
well that's great
but at any rate that that was one thing that i one of the features that i did want
well of course we do it ourselves
like i said we were just lucky to find these guys that do it you know
they're they just weren't really expensive
oh that is good
and uh yeah you know
and they work on it
so the things that can be done here they just come here to our home and and work on it or work on it
it's you know it's really it's really been nice
i i do all my own work uh
so i i have chevies
i'm uh i'm uh a chevy i'm an american car person
but i do like mercedes
i i have always had an american american car
and uh i had a real real bad experience with the cougar that i had
and uh i don't know
you know i i thought what the heck you know
well i'm not a ford person and never have been as a kid
and uh i do like the v eight engines
and i think the
i to me the american cars are far superior to the japanese in styling engines
right now i mean
i would that that there's
you know as far as uh what i've heard about performance and such you know so uh uh hopefully it'll stay that way i mean you know
i'd i'd i would hate to see the american car industry suffering more than it already has you know even though right now i'm not driving an american car
but uh i think
uh you know they said they said what do we want to buy
i i'm uh seri- not seriously thinking
but i i would like to
put it in that category uh by a cadillac
but i wouldn't
and you know of course if i had the money i'd be happy to by a new one
but uh i do look for a one year old vehicle
well that's what my parents are avid cadillac freaks
they had uh
and i think my my mother drives the seville now that's uh i guess it's a couple of years old
and uh she had a seville before that that had the odd backs that was that was so uh
and she it final just wore out
they had they had purchased it
i don't can't remember how many years they had that car
but she loved the styling of it
that she may want to save if she she doesn't have it anymore
she that could be turned into a classic
in in ten fifteen years uh
and it's sort of a bone of contention between she and my dad because my dad said well just let me take it down there and find out what's wrong with it
i mean he came back with a new car
he could just see you know dollar signs starting to flip by as far as repairs went
but uh they they really are nice cars there there
and i like a full size cadillac
i i want one of those
i think they are i don't know a classic
they haven't changed in about uh twenty years
and and they'll eventually phase them out
and i sure would like one ever those uh uh within the next five years
it seems funny you how within the last couple of years cars have gotten bigger again you know
they had they've scaled everything down so much
and uh i have i don't i've never owned a really large car
well even the japanese cars are bigger too
i i've had friends who had them
and i think they're a lot over ra-
and they're is just no styling to them
you know i don't mean that as a joke
i don't have any idea what which car it is
and i think they have not uh lead the field in styling
they do have sports cars but the price is way more
i know that uh
i've i've sort of always felt like with buicks it seems like all buicks to me look alike
i guess it just uh it seems to me they're all the same shape
and she she's had she's got way offer a hundred thousand miles on it
and that's what she's going to buy again
and i'm like oh please it looks exactly the same as this old one
so i guess it's in the eyes of the beholder
well if if you're interested you ought to go to the next auto show
i i look at the cadillacs
and boy there were some cadillacs that i didn't even realize they made
but they were
but they really looked beautiful
what they have out for like the next year is everything still pretty square
it seems like the cadillacs is one of the few makers that are still making really i i can't think of a car that they make are the than maybe the alliance
they have they have convertibles now in the cadillac
and they have that new uh
it's not the big uh fleetwood the one i want
now when when was this
because i have
well they have it every year
and that's usually when i see anything
now this was uh in it was downtown in the uh convention center
oh i see
and they had some they had some new cars that weren't even out
they had uh a new chevy suburban
truck you know
that big big one that was uh
oh my word
and you think that can't possibly be done
i mean it just that's just too weird
and i like engines
they had a lot of broken down engin-
not broken down i mean you know cut uh
displayed engines you know
so you could tell
but uh that that sold me in buying a new car you know
i mean certainly interested in buying a new car
but again the yeah the american cars were for superior in styling and
somebody's finally woken up you know
i think that i i would definitely buy
again there's the question are we in the market uh
and i could buy anything you know
you know if i could fine
i i was really crazy about jags for a while
and the convertible had a is it x j s or something like that
you know thought that's a dream car
and and you really would have to be a dream car because the repair bills are supposedly just constant you know
well i haven't work on them myself so i don't that you know my cars don't go to the shop you know
and i've always done it myself
well that's good that you can
and uh i've got three of them
and uh i can't remember one
like i said i don't do that you know
i think it takes a talent to do that you know
my my husband is uh engineer
but he cannot i mean
or maybe he's just doesn't want to mess with it
but uh you know we just i just say forget it we'll just take it in
he drives drives a honda
noticed that when i was a kid uh
but i worked my way through college as a mechanic
and dropped it for a long time when when after i got out of college and
and now again i've got three vehicles
and i don't i never get in them and just go to the shop at you will you know
well that's to that's one thing that when you would consider
see when i go out to think about a new car or buy another car i don't think about well is this engine that i can work on
my husband can work on or whatever you know
so you're you're pretty lucky in that respect that
i'm keeping v eight v eight chevy engines
and in fact i stock the same part
i'm like a little stock
brought your chevy to me i could i'd probably have some parts
for it right now you knows
it's really been funny because we have like been you are own contractors kind of with this car
and when i say we have redone everything i mean we have done everything
oh that's great
and it's it's really been so interesting the people you meet because uh my husband carl has called all over the country you know
oh i can imagination
well i guess um i'll start out
and that is um i don't know what section of the public school system they're talking about whether it's the first eight grades the high school or colleges
what do you think about what do you think about the the lower grades you know k through seven
well i i i should imagine the lower grades
what would what what's what's certainly drawn everyone's attention to that is the fact that uh many of the inner city and uh i guess what we'd call uh ghetto or poorer districts
including rural districts don't seem to be able to produce the students that ind- indeed many uh manufacturing and other
they can't seem to they can't seem to read properly do math
so that's got everybody excited
it seems that high schools at least produce candidates a- a- although i have great misgivings about the s a t that go on to a variety of colleges
it seems a great deal of our public colleges have foreign students in them uh from um a myriad of nations
and uh and also um uh i think that uh a certain percentage of uh the colleges produce a fairly de- uh public colleges produce a fairly decent student
i i i just read some things recently where um
oh i didn't realize it was that high
oh just about f-
but when you consider um
when you consider uh
well that's what i was going to point out i think it mostly is that technical
especially in those areas it's um
and that involves both canadian
and uh uh european middle eastern and and far eastern
i i think um i think i have similar views
that's you know where our elementary grades um
i- it's amazing
i have a friend who's an e- who's an elementary school teacher
and she said that they recently you know they have to go through they have to they have to pat the kids down because they bring guns to school
i just read a an
amazing article i guess
in this month's ne- this week's new yorker about baltimore
uh which uh went on to talk about
i thought it was rather slanted in favor of the mayor or or or the politicians in the in there
i d- i do i do know a few people and have been have done some business up in baltimore
but it seemed to me that the inner school system there was the one thing that didn't s- the inner city school system was the one thing that didn't flower too well
but it was very difficult
i i i i think if i was going to fault it now
if i'm i'm looking to carry on a conversation
that way i thi- there's a couple of things that really bother me
i think when i learned the other day uh uh that uh the average american the average american
and that school children a- a- are not far off that mark with six point eight
now i don't know what school children what year that is
i mean that's a hell of a lot time to be sitting in front of the tube
a- and it's uh uh it's really
you know kids can't read um
my wife teaches uh middle school
an- and they can't
oh so you're close to the subject
the- they they can't read anything
and yet you know i have grandchildren
i have ten uh nine grandchildren in various parts of the country
and of course you know i can't speak to the rural or poorer inner city schools
and they seem to be doing extraordinarily well
i i i mean i quiz them
and i talk to them
and they they read well
but i i i mean i think that's a f- that's part of the environment
i think it's it's probably the work that your your children your children are doing uh um
that that that that could be very well true
she she's yeah she can tell she can tell you know when they have kids come in for
and she can tell before a parent comes in normally
you know give or take eighty ninety
per cent you know what the parents are going to be like when they come in and the responses the parents will give back
oh i i i
i guess i could i can understand that
uh maybe not that long ago
and um and so i i always felt i didn't get a real good education in the pu- in the grammar schools and part of high school
so i lived in new england at the time
i w- i didn't have that much money
but we struggled
and we did it and i thought it i thought a great deal of it was a great deal of the success that they had in their education was due to the low student teacher ratio
i think i think it's probably very true
and i i i think that could that's a formula that could be applied everywhere
but you know surprisingly i i because you put such a commitment on education
um your children probably could have gone to schools with uh uh a higher student teacher ratio
would say you know what did you do today
if we let's sit down and read together
well that that that's that that must be
then then if that's uh
i think we both agree on that then then then then a parent
oh it's parental
and i guess you got to take them away from the tube also
another thing that i have another problem i have is uh i don't really know how to resolve this
but is the incredible at least in the high school and college level emphasis on sports where enormous amounts of money are spent
and it seems to me that mo- money could be more well well spent somewhere else
but you kn- you know what's really funny is that they there's been some research because i'm a i'm a college professor
endowment to the university in other words money that could to everything everything and normally gets directed away from sports realistically a lot of the was uh was probably two-thirds i guess it's now two-thirds of what it was when they were national champions
but i mean
send big bucks like couple hundreds of dollars
but thousands of people
to to what uh to
bec- normally it's because of the sports
but i mean they don't just send it to the new stadium
but see the sports brings in the money
because when georgetown was number one
i well i guess they're
their their their money that was donated to them from companies
from from l- from business people from graduates whatever
was up into you know like twenty million dollars
and now it's down to like fourteen million
well i never thought of that benefit yeah
their income has slow- their their al- alumni giving and other funds have slowly dropped since then
well i i never thought
but the consequence
i my i guess what i'd have to say about that is
it's it's amazing the way
but now that's big time
but but uh smaller schools aren't like that uh
only only the big time schools show that
but you're right
i i think the emphasis on sports
and as a
see i'm a i'm a i'm a former athlete in a sense
i swam um
but swimming never gets much glory so it really doesn't matter
well mark spitz made a lot of money on it
but you know they still
and he di- and he came back this year
but he didn't make it
i i would have liked it if he if he would have though
but i think uh realistically you know you read the the research studies
and uh i don't think he would have made it simply because the w- the event he was trying to swim they even the research shows that distance running
and he was good at distance spitz as a swimmer you know
but the distance um
were in their l- early thirties
and but he's was trying to make it in the sprinter's event
and most of them
i read i i also read i
but i i do want to add this to that because i i was quite interested in that myself
but i read where the reason that he had to do this in the sprint events is that national television wouldn't pay for the l- distance events
and they didn't think they could capture the excitement to get sponsors
oh you're kidding
so it had to be it had to be
and g- and and i guess capture the whole thing for some sponsor
and that as as an athlete i just hate that
what were say- what were you saying
well i- if you teach c- uh college
and and i know when i went to college i i went to summer school
and i thought that uh in fact that my idea of it was uh rather than rather than finish early i just enjoyed some of the subjects that i was taking
and i had the ability to to go in summer school
and i i did n-
so what that leads me
i think i think
well how do you think that would work in grammar schools
i think uh in in some sense um
and something you have to consider too um because i know a- as a as a as a former high school teacher
okay um where do you work at
or do you you wish to discuss that
i i'm in uh well
i live in uh richardson
and uh but grew up in uh iowa on a farm with a considerably different philosophy in terms of
uh and uh
don't do any uh
any gardening in the sense of uh vegetable gardening
tr- tr- tried some tried some different
flowers and and uh bushes and stuff
and uh uh have a have a lawn service
there was one when
and we just continued with them for a long time and then switched to a different one
but in terms of the fertilizing and uh
and i thought phooey i'm going to do it myself because i figured up the cost
and i said huh-uh
and so what i did i switched to liquid
and i do it with an applicator with my hose
and it's so much easier than taking that lawn spreader and walking all over the territory
and i- i thought well i'm going to do this all the time
so i found you know
and i've got some problems with uh two trees in my front yard
and i took them to a certified uh nurseryman the other day
and do you know what he told me i h- needed to do
and the tree is fifteen feet high
and it probably has about ten thousand leaves on it
and he told me i needed to pull every leaf off and then spray it with this chemical that he said i should purchase
and i thought uh-huh
so uh i think i'll get my son-in-law
or is it a pest
and i don't know
what happened to it uh
and then it it um
what well what kind what kind of trees are they
well one is a maple
one is um
but i would much prefer
and uh the one that the ones that really do well are the ones that are on the city property
and they don't
and they're cedar elm
and they're just beautiful
so i mean it it's you know these things that you pamper
and you know
and um although i don't have too serious a problem
but i don't know if it was from the the the late freezes that were or the early freezes we had that caused this tree damage
and you know sperry said you know that's what happened to the crepe myrtles
the last two years that you we are looking at all the freeze damage from the prior two years
so i kind of think that maybe that uh happened to these large trees that i have
and i really hate to lose them
well that's that's one thing that we a- we've had very poor luck with with is in in our yard is is trees but the uh
uh uh were had been put in by the developer when he built the house
and he just put in whatever was cheapest
and they and he
and uh figured
there were seven different trees of of various kinds and sizes in the yard when we moved in
and we got one left at this point
three we three we've lost to to uh freezes between uh eighty-three and uh and then uh a year ago we lost uh another one
did you cut them down at the at the ground level
or did you pull them
or how did you get rid of them
because if i i i don't know how to get rid of these big trees because one has a circumference of about ten inches
we- we didn't ha- we didn't have any that were that that big when they uh went
two o- two of them uh
because i don't want stubs in my lawn
because you still have to
now th- the one that the one that we lost the last one that we lost a a year ago uh u- up until then they do- hadn't been big enough
but what i just used a hand saw and sawed them off at at as close
and then uh got s-
got some chemical that drill holes and pour in that helps
uh a stump killer
stump ki- yeah
stump killer and stump stump rotter
but uh this last one had a fair sized root
and some guy was doing a job in the neighborhood uh
and and saw it and stopped in and asked
and i said fine
he had he had a trailer with a machine on it that was specifically for that
and they get that saw
and i think it's a k- some kind of a s- a screwing thing that just rips it right out
and it yeah
and it it just it just ripped it right out
and uh i
i- it left the it left he left the chips
used those for uh mulch
and i put them up mulch ar- around around the other shrubs
and uh uh had had a pile of dirt from various things uh back by the garage that i filled in with
and and it's filling in with with grass uh nicely this year so that that was that was worth it
i mean y- two fold purpose
do you do your own uh
lawn in terms of uh mowing
i have a i have a self-propelled uh snapper
and it uh
and it's very difficult to address
i i i we just got a a old push uh uh sears mower
i it's been fifteen years now since we first moved to texas we've had it
and i keep waiting for it to die
but every year it just seems to hang on
well that's good
but uh yeah
and they said no it's it's too old
and i took it back home
but my son's uh o- one of my sons and a couple of his friends this year have
we well we have quite a few
but we don't really use them a lot
we have well we like a lot of gasoline credit cards
because we like to be able to stop you know when we're traveling and stuff wherever there's a station
but as far as like mastercard and visa we don't use those too often
and now i have one or two of them
but i think i've even let some of them expire
but i was living out of the country for a while
so i wasn't using them too much and i don't drive that much
but i have you know mastercard and visa as you know
but as long as
like my mastercard is um free as long as you spend about i don't know three thousand dollars a year or something like that
and so i tend to buy almost all major purchases on a credit card
and um i used to even use it for my grocery shopping and stuff
and so i don't
but i was living in france
and there you pay for everything by credit card
but it's not really a credit card
oh is it like an automatic debit
it's a it's a debit card
and um just you know it's sha- many times
because they're just so well set up with it
but we always have the money set aside already to
and then we just pay it off the next
we never pay we don't like to pay interest on the
i i never pay finance charges on them except when i screw up which i occasionally
and you know i'll forget to pay the bill by the due date
or this last month i mailed a check to them on the twenty-second
and they didn't get it until the thirtieth
and it was
and you know so i thought i
and so i got hit up with a cre- uh finance charge on it which pissed me off because um you know i really did mail it in time
but they have no proof of that
i don't i don't want to probably talk to them some more discuss it
but i i never um usually never pay
we we screwed up one time like that too
and they just never did get it
and we had to finally mail them another check
and i- that went on for months and months and months because
and they eventually found the check and deposited it and months later they were still telling me that i owed them finance charges and um late fees and things like that
and i said well i mailed you a check
and you eventually did deposit it
so you know i guess i don't know who the the burden of proof is on
you know kind of the
because you never d-
or i don't um
or i don't get a i don't mail them all a signed receipt whatever i
you know at the bank to have a proof of when i mailed it
and i mean you can't do that
i like to use my card if i buy something through the mail which i don't do real often or something from out of state you know where if something is wrong
well you can
a couple times i've had to write big credit card companies and say you know i didn't really get this
or i don't know what this is
or i returned it
so don't charge it
well that's basically what happened with us is we bought a computer
and the computer um d- wasn't didn't do what these people said it would do
and it wouldn't do that
so he brought it back to them
and they're supposed to modify it
and so i called the credit card company and said well we haven't really taken possession because it's not useful for us
and then they said well then don't pay it
and then a month later i had to dispute it in writing
and i was out of the country and got back
and i took care of it as soo- as soon as we got the computer back
and it was okay
but then it was too late
so now they're hitting me up there
but it's sort of you know
it's it's half our fault
and so w-
so i learned that for the next time
i don't uh i don't like to pay the yearly fee for a card
and since we don't pay the interest it doesn't really matter what the interest rate
now we had american express cards
and my husband had always had that before we got married
and those got so high we finally decided for him and me both to have a card it was like ninety dollars
but we decided let that one go
well my husband and i both have that
and i don't know what we pay for his card
i think it's like seventy-five dollars for me and i'm not quite sure what it is for him
but i had really like w-
nowadays i'm not su- so sure that it's worth it
but um in the past there you know there are some places that only take american express and then they don't have the credit limit because i've over done the credit limit on the other card
it you know a couple of plain tickets and a little bit more and you're over the limit on the credit card
and um with the american express they say there is no limit
but then that was one advantage
but th- that's like
like you said if you really if you need that extra for charging tickets and stuff
we should probably get another um visa card
ye- one another one that's free
because there are some
like i think a t and t has one that's free if you make two purchases a year
and so that's easy enough to do
and if that's true that's um it might be better off to have that as a second card just to have the credit
and i don't under- i mean i guess i do understand the mentality of people doing it
but i don't understand
because people think it doesn't really cost them anything to pay
i have had months where i was shocked at how much had come in because like i thought i would buy a big expense and think that it would take one or two months to process and sometimes it comes in right away
and it's like oh well guess
because like many times i'll tr- i'll buy some things towards the end of the month thinking hey i won't get that bill until the next bill
and it will come in on the next one
but sometimes the is long
like i've had things that i didn't get billed on for two or three months
but that's what happened with us
like we bought a washing machine seven months ago
and that i got billed like the next day
but we prefer g-
like with the credit card you get the automatic um one year guarantee so if something breaks things like that
you can uh return it so like the washing machine we bought it in october
and you know if something goes wrong with it within the first year we've got an automatic guarantee on it besides the manufacturer's guarantee
and somethings like that are
and the insur- like if you break it yourself even you know
or if it gets stolen or if you lose it or whatever it might be and so so that's you know another advantage and then even things like airline tickets you automatically get flight insurance which um you hopefully you never use
but like if your bagga-
but things like if your baggage gets lost you get money for that to buy new bags and things like that
oh i didn't know that
and sometimes you get discounts with the cards
well i usually keep up with news by watching a b c news on television and reading the papers here the local dallas morning news
and then i also take the wall street journal
or do you mostly like catch up while you're at work
well i well i d-
i use part of my lunch period to uh read the wall street journal
then uh i read the the newspaper at home generally in the evening
well and you have a little bit better newspaper
and the a j uh kind of dominant
and i finally quit taking it because it stacked up
and so i try to take you know weekend papers
and then during the week i catch up you know on the radio on the way to work or if i'm traveling around at lunch or on the way home
and hopefully i'm sitting down by the ten o'clock news to where i can kind of get a recap on t v uh
that's uh what we do to
it we're never in home in time to really watch the six o'clock news on television
so we catch the ten o'clock news
but i catch the news on the radio coming to and from work
but radio news is is rather short uh
most of the news stations most of the stations here that are not all news stations you get about five minutes on the hour
and if you catch the news stations uh you don't catch that much in the car
oh i see
we- uh it's frustrating to me because i really wish that i did have more
and i haven't found anything yet that keeps me there on a constant basis
somebody will say oh did you hear about this that happened last week
and it might be local
and it might be national
and i'm like no i missed that one
and they'd just stack up
you have to have time to sit down and concentrate on on the stories
all of a sudden you look and there's three uh three weeks worth laying on the coffee table
and you wind up throwing them out without reading them
because it's too much trouble to try and catch up
so have to depend
i guess we're becoming more of a television oriented nation in that i don't think that uh my children even read newspapers other than the t v guide section
uh oh no
there's is all uh strictly television news
but you know it's an
and i wish they would just report the incident and then leave the commentaries out
but so many times you get well uh this is my opinion of what he meant by that
and i'm like who are you to judge you know
thing with the news magazines like time and and the other magazines
it's hard to celebr- uh to celebrate to separate the news from the comment because
and so then you have to try and sort out what really is the news
and i feel like they sensationalize things that shouldn't be sensationalized
i feel like they focus too much on things that i don't know you know
so much during the gulf war they would ask questions that uh you wouldn't want broadcast
but they keep asking these questions
and i thought it was really well i don't know asinine actually
well so many of them also come through
and they have discovered that this is the most popular issue of the time whether it be the homeless or uh cancer or whatever
and then they devote uh an inordinate amount of time on the news cast to their personal ax to grind
and uh uh
particularly the local television uh i know the the wednesday's child bit
and they'll take up ten minutes of a newscast and leave out something
but they leave out a real news issue to devote to one of their local pet projects
and it's frustrating
so i guess i guess when i get to listen to the news it's it's probably television or radio
but i i don't get to see that as much as i want
and when i do i'm wondering why i wanted to see it so bad
we uh again
like i say by the time i read the newspaper it's the the it's that morning's news from the day before
and i'm reading it in the evening
i'm a i'm about a day behind most of the time anyway
well i'm glad tha-
i i used to think that i was probably the only one that just i don't know was running around so much
i look at other uh women workers or men at work
and i'm like how do they seem so together all the time
so i guess news is just part of that rat race for me
it's always there's something going on all the time uh
you don't really have time to sit down and and thoroughly read a newspaper
well that's about all then
well i appreciate talking to you
so do you play golf at all
i'm kind of embarrassed i'm talking to a man cause i'm sure that you are you play a lot more than i do
actually i don't
uh i uh when i was younger i played a little bit
and i was horrible
so i just stopped playing
oh well my husband is is a very good golfer
he has got like a six handicap
and he has been playing since we have been married for twenty two years
so i had to start playing because he was you know such an avid golfer
so i have been playing now
well i have had clubs for twenty years you know
so you have been playing
but but i really enjoy it
so i had to check that and and uh talk about it
well have you played recently
actually i don't even know if i checked that or not to be perfectly honest um
i don't know um
oh that's okay
um when i was
and and i basically um i had a horrible slice or hook
and the hook goes to the left
i was slicing actually
as it turns out uh i went and took some lessons for awhile because i just i would lose so many balls and uh make it a horrible time for everybody
and a i got a little bit better
but i st- but then i sort of you know went went back to school and did not have time and this and that
and and the only thing i do now is i occasionally go out to a driving range and hit a couple of balls and see what i can do
and i and i still have this slice
i mean are you in school
as a matter of fact um so i don't have time to do much else except for graduate work
so i hang around this way
occasionally uh uh
a bunch of us were pretty avid golfers golfers so we will go out
and we will we will we will play you know
and you don't you don't have the length of the playing time that we do
i have i have very litt- at the moment i have very little playing time
when i when i go on vacation my father and i uh play a little bit
but i don't you know
we play a par a par three nine hole course
oh that's my favorite kind to play
because for a woman it's really nice to play a par three course because
that's my i can't hit a driver very far
and in fact i don't even like to use a driver
and i can i can just have better contact with the ball that way
so i'm still using a three iron
and my husband is trying to get me into using a you
know like a high number wood instead
but those are uh still not you favorite huh
but i i uh i enjoy
i i really do
i we have three teenage daughters
and and during the year i don't play much golf
but but when i'm we are on vacation i love to play just like you said
and we got to play in monterrey in california right you know along the pacific ocean this past spring
and that was i told my husband that was the way to play you know
if i could play there every time i want it was it was great
miniature golf there's my game uh
well that's the thing my kids like to do that with you know on dates and stuff
but golf is um
we we probably are talking about golf because i did check it you know
i don't i don't i don't
i don't i don't recall anymore
i mean i feel like anybody that's ever played golf can talk about it
and maybe if you can even talk about it if you if you have uh watched it on t v
actually we have a very very um
we had the uh
well we had
there uh the l-
and then we had a p g a actually a very big p g a uh tour stop here last year
and actually um they say the the
but they say the course is very is is is pretty tough pretty challenging
and it's um not only that
but it's exceedingly well kept apparently
because th- those are the comments i kept hearing from the pros you know
they kept saying we hear you know on on television i
but they keep saying it's just wonderful uh
and you know it it it rained through half the um tournament so people had to
but they still
actually when when the um when the l p g a came here i guess that was about a week and a half ago it was just it it takes over the whole town
you know it's all over the news
and lots and lots of people take off work
to go to go an watch the the uh ladies
so i mean i think it's actually it's absolutely wonderful to see
i mean a lot of people are just crazy about it
it seems a lot of people are really you know
either um either you have not played it or or you you have played it
and you sort of play every now and then
it's it's just such a difficult thing
i mean it's i just i watch my husband
and he's he was a professional athlete
he he's a very good athlete
and he's got the coordination that god given coordination
and he just struggles
you know all the time to um to master this game
well same here i mean i'm a brown belt in karate at this point in time
oh my really
and and i can not and i can not hit a golf ball
you know i
well i watch my husband swing
and his swing you know like compared to the pros is so it's ridged
or how far he's going to hit it i think you know
and i worry about that
i have just got to get this drive you know really far
i have this nasty habit of of turning my head at the last second or or just keeping my arm wrong
and you are always so anxious to see where it goes
it's just like i i don't watch the ball die
i have to that especially even more so with a short iron than a long ir- you know
because those short irons it's just you want to look up cause you are getting close to the green
and you want to see it hit the green
and you know that's why
that that is certainly true
i ca- i don't know what i'm supposed to ask questions about
well uh when i
do you get get um reimbursed for the calls you make or the calls you talk on too
well i really did not know so i
i i i actually don't know
i get a random reimbursement every now and then and don't really don't really figure it out
cause this is only my second day doing it
and i just did not i did not know
and that was
we i just started yesterday
i have been doing this for awhile actually
and they just i just
and we both just sort of get these random checks in the mail
to be honest i i really have not been accounting
i just sort of figured well it's going to work
you know if it works it works
well my uh
do you uh think we should go metric
well i i oh i don't know
it's kind of a tricky question because i think it's it's a practical system
obviously if it's all compatible and it you know tens
and things make sense
um it's it's a switch
i think that the i think what
i mean i don't know what happened last time
and we all we all learned that metric
and they were ready
and and i don't quite know why it failed
um i would bet the push i it i bet the push just wasn't big enough
you know they didn't sort of encourage i mean businesses and things to use it
so you know what what i think they'd have to do would be to have both things on there for a while and then and then start phasing things out
so i think that's what they did at first
and and i mean and there's things that we've gone metric
and you can
so that you know so that we have little things that are metric
but no one talks about you know uh
and and and even though the car says miles and kilometers
i would i would be total loss
i think i think though if there were some you know sort of government incentive program or something people would begin to switch over you know
and i think there would be the hard core older people who would get really pissed
and pardon my expression there but uh
who would get really you know upset and start to complain and get all cranky and stuff
but i think in the end it would make life a lot easier for people coming up
it's i i it's because i think they had a good try there when they started with us in the elementary schools trying to
because i think our generation could make a change
but it would not be as difficult for people say fifty years old now who are have never been exposed to the metric system other than you know buying a two liter coke
well what i think i think the difference between now and then might be this is just a might is we were the first generation that was in elementary school
and if they kept it up
so let's say imagine they had kept going
you'd have you know two or three more generations that all now are are familiar with the metric system
but i could convert you know
i could handle it for a while and then and then eventually i'd learn
and i think that before it was just you know just a bunch of little kids using it
and now i think there are enough people
you know sort of as we get older i think others that will bring more generations in on it eventually they'll be able to make the switch
and we're not going to start going crazy and yelling and saying
we'll say oh it's a pain in the neck
but it's for the better
and we'll sort of deal with it i think
i i i would hope it would uh
i mean everything seems to be based on the same thing
well i was trying to think of what kind of things you'd have to change
and you'd have to change your height on your driver's license
when you wouldn't be five foot eight anymore uh you'd be
and then you'd be lighter in kilograms than you were in in pounds
but i wonder if if
so all the dieters would be happy
but i wonder if that's even something that you know they they have to change immediately
they could just you know sort of phase that in
so start you know from now
like from now on all licenses would have that
rather than going back and changing everything you know all new licenses as of nineteen ninety-two would have it or something
and they'd have to change that little ruler that's on the door of the seven eleven that
to hold it up
and oh yeah
i know though at the uh at the amusement parks they say if you're under forty-two
well i guess what what i bet what they do in that case they uh
see what some of them is like you know they say if you're not taller than this line
but that would be good that i don't know
it would be a neat case where like where kids taught the parents i think you know
because isn't it pretty much everywhere in the world
but i don't know
eng- eng- england is not
i i don't think they are because our um our measurements started in england
and i think they're the only part of the continent that hasn't changed over to metric
but i mean
but but virtually the rest of the world is
i mean it seems like like like like sort of stupid
i mean we are of course we are americans
and we're supposed to be you know
and and now we're backwards
i don't know why we we haven't changed to the sensible system
i i i would think i mean a a a base ten system as compared to a base twelve system makes a lot more sense
well and it's not even base twelve for everything
um let's see
i i always forget
see and i don't understand liquid ounces and fluid ounces
i mean i don't know that i have that much concrete knowledge in the current
those those wouldn't be a problem
it's not like it's really entrenched other you know
i i have no idea
i just uh
i know things like you know a pint is a pound the world around or something
i don't i didn't even know that
i i learned that because uh a friend of mine
i i had two friends
and i had more friends than that
but two friends of mine in college
well that's good
um we opened a jelly bean business
and we sold jelly beans
and we had uh no idea how many you know
we we didn't bo- we didn't bother buying a scale
we'd go out and just buy you know five pound bags of sixteen different flavors put it in plastic shoe boxes and and and then sell them for x amount per pound or quarter pound or something
and we we didn't bother buying a scale
and one of my friends was a physics one of these guys was a physics major
and he said well just remember a pint is a pound the world around
and he got the measuring cup and just measured i think a cup or two cup whatever is a pint
gee i think wh- i think he the calculation at home
and it turns out that he was actually pretty close
so so we were giving them a little too much
but that was our general tendency anyway
well we were you know we were in
it was it was almost like we did it for the hell of it in school
make you know
you know after after an entire semester
but we had a hell of a lot of fun doing it
we we we tended to eat a lot
and our friends would just sort of walk by and just put their hands in it
and we had another friend um the physics major again he wasn't he wasn't aware of jelly bean physiology i guess
and he got into a snowball fight
and he just
and and some snow fell into one of the cartons
so he brought them into the bathroom to wash them off
and basically what we had sort of non coated beans at that point
uh it's just uh it's just the the same
and there's just sort of th- this stuff you see you know it's sort of like glorified sugar
but when you rinse them off all you get is uh is uh the coating
i guess we are just to discuss trials and and punishment if it's to be given by the judge or not
did you did you catch your explanation of that
it's it's uh
but i think that there should be some preset penalties in criminal cases rather than uh degrees of sentencing
uh again having participated in jury duty myself i know
of the p- person
um i think what you have is the way the the justice system works is they bend over backwards trying to protect the guilty
oh it's insane
had came up with the maximum sentence in the jury form they found out that uh the gentleman involved had a long history of the same type offense which was theft of uh property
and yet the as- the attorney
for the prosecution could not enter these uh the good man's background into it
and there's too much leniency
there's too much uh um underhanded uh things going on that the public are not aware of
and it seems as though we are uh giving the criminal the benefit more than the victim
well i think this is one of the reasons that also that attorneys have such a a unsavory reputation
i do not have any i don't have an ounce in my body of credibility toward the the judicial system in the united states
well what you got is the situation wherein uh if you ever get in trouble you want to hire the smartest crookedest lawyer you can find
and uh that's not the idea
it's the idea is not to get the guy off of the crime
well to punish him for the crime but also to try and reeducate the man's thinking
to get him out of that uh uh criminal mind that he has and to direct
well we have uh a situation again that i am familiar with where uh the son of an acquaintance of mine was killed while trying to stop a robbery
and the person that killed him was a young woman
but then due to technicalities she was going to be out of jail within eighteen months after she was sentenced
of course it took eighteen months for the thing the trial to happen
so then uh
and the parole board received approximately a thousand letters protesting putting this person back on the street within eighteen months after killing someone
and uh fortunately it worked
they uh elimi- they corrected the technicality
and the person now will have to serve three to four years of the seven or eight they were sentenced to
responded to uh the dir- the uh parties that are involved and if enough
but we our priorities are a bit backward
well they again the
and i'm not knocking the civil rights program or anything like that
but we've gone
overboard to uh protect persons from being having their civil rights
well i am too
i mean i i just can't
i you know i served on a jury for a lady that was having a mental problem
and we found her not guilty because the lady obviously was not in their right mind
so if the person is not in the right mind i mean they had to uh
but for her own safety and for because she didn't know what she was doing
and we couldn't we just dismissed the case
and and she was uh taken care of
well another side of the coin that with our justice system there are a lot of frivolous cases that go to court
there are a lot of things that could be settled out of court which uh or should never have gone to court
and then the amazing thing of course is how uh some cases can come to trial in thirty days
and others it takes eighteen months
carolyn i have a little schnauzer little miniature schnauzer
well it's kind of a mixed breed that we got from the humane society
you know those make the best animals uh pe- best pets
my uh son has a uh oh
it's part uh doberman and part husky
and they gentlest dog you ever met
and they got him from the uh humane society here in oklahoma city and she's just turned out to be a jewel
my my little
and being single she's become very important in my life it's so nice to have come home and find something or someone who's really so happy to see you
well my children are the ones that wanted our pet
and this one is probably the best one that we have had
um as i say we got it from the humane society
and uh we had lost a pet
and we really went there looking for the one that we had lost
and we just looked all over for it and couldn't find it
but uh when we walked in to the to the humane society this little dog was uh in the office and would sit up and beg
and just oh he was so cute
and the kids just fell in love with it
but it's um whoever had it before must have trained it real well because it's just you know it's uh a good house dog
and i'm not home and unfortunately she's not as well trained as as i would like her to be and i realize it's my fault
she's you know she's real good
and and not one mess does she make and then we go outside
and she'll stay outside for oh thirty minutes to an hour come inside and use the restroom
but she's a doll
well i shouldn't say the only time
but most of the time when we have problems with restroom is in the night
and uh she usually stays inside at night
but uh sometimes it doesn't work
you know i i we always had a pet when i was growing up oh always had a dog
so we always had a dog
and and then course when my children were growing up we always had a dog and always said it was because the children wanted the pet and i find that i'm enjoying this one far more than i ever did when it was the children's dog
i uh in fact my children gave me this this little puppy for christmas
well we got one one year for christmas
oh my goodness
and uh i had a baby the next day and uh so that one wasn't really well trained
oh i just didn't have time to take care of baby and train puppy at the same time
that that is really probably bad timing
and you know we thought well that would be a fun time for them to have it you know get it at christmas time
it was a little spitz wi- a little white fluffy and you know looked like it came right from the north pole
and that was fun
but um i i sure wasn't good at training it i think you have to have time you know to do those things
do you and patience and you have to you really have to be just like your children
when you set a rule you have to stand by it and be consistent and
well um since i'm in college uh i mean uh i haven't seen that much change
i don't know how much it changed in the last uh twenty years anyway
but i don't know
do you do you have an idea of of how much
so social changes
well i can remember are from from my childhood were the disco days
and maybe that's changed a lot uh the way the way people dress
maybe a people are a little o- more open-minded than maybe they used to be
and a lot
i think people are are used to now saying what's what's on their minds more more up front than they used to be
especially with like a lot of the different organizations now like you know pro-life and and pro- uh choice in in the special interest groups maybe um like amnesty
maybe people are a little a little more uh free to express their opinions socially free
i think women have come out more too on on like child abuse and and the wife beatings
and and like you said pro cho- pro-choice and whatnot
i think that's become more out- outstanding than it used to be where women i think used to be a little bit afraid of coming out and saying something
uh maybe maybe too a big social change that's that's maybe for the worst is uh is is how um the people's uh views on on relationships has changed you know
and now we have now we have several you know we have to worry about aids
and we have to worry about uh maybe people are becoming more aware more more afraid of relationships
well i know like when i was in high school and junior high and stuff and sitting down and having the sex talk with mom you know and all that stuff
and you know we didn't have to talk about
well basically her thing was just don't do it you know but i'm not i'm not naive
and i've got a ten year old
and you know he thought he knows about condoms
and and he knows about aids
and it's just different things you have to talk to them about now that you would never even have dreamt to have to say anything about
it used to be that we were th- that we were trying to protect morality
it's a it's a much different
we have you know
you can't just just hope for abstinence
i don't i think that's stupidity on parents' part
i mean that's sex is rampant
and it always will be
and and i think too noticing the kids that the fourth and fifth graders which is what my son is and stuff they they're just they're more they're very open
i mean the boys are very open because that's that's all i have is boys so that's all i'm around basically is boys
but they talk about things that i my brother didn't talk about until he was in college you know
and and they sit down
and they look at you right in the face
and they expect a truthful answer
you can't get them give them the oh you know cabbage patch answers and stuff
and they can tell me basically some things that i don't know
but it it's interesting listening to them
i think i think the social changes in them i think i see it more with that generation than i do with like our generation
i i i imagine you're right
i i teach swim lessons a lot
and and to see what see what kids talk about when uh you know they're they're open about well you know
kids are a lot more educated now than i think that that like we were uh at that age um about a lot of things
you know besides what besides what they learn uh from from our social environment is uh their education is just amazing
kids are kids are learning uh you know
every year uh algebra goes down a grade you know
and and uh students learn it earlier
well my son the my fourth grader he is
uh which ones have you seen lately
oh i just sort of blanking tonight
i just got done saying i just saw one uh fairly recently
uh oh gosh oh i know uh uh the one with the two girls that take off from uh uh a- across across the country on a crime spree
it's it's interesting
i was going to go see uh the billy crystal movie also which was
i i'm not familiar
which which billy crystal movie
oh this is the
uh just the one oh
it was the uh
oh city slickers
uh it says a lot about uh uh you know
i i'm young
but it says a lot about middle life you know
and uh uh it's a really good show
i i i've heard lots of good things about it
and i would have would have liked to have seen it
but i was with my wife
and i figured she'd like thelma and louise better
and i'd heard it was really good too
uh has jeff bridges and and uh
uh really really good
there's there's been a a fair number of of pretty good movies out recently
i mean it kind of runs in
i mean for a while sometimes they come in a whole bunch of them that just i don't even you know doesn't even sound like something i want to see
what what kind of movies in general do you like to watch
but i i really enjoy watching a movie that uh where they don't really try and attract the you know the great audience but rather put out a a real good movie
uh it always
my my favorite movie of all time has been uh uh the mission
uh it's a a
uh it's a it's a
uh he plays one of the main characters
and uh it's about uh jesuit community in uh
uh really really good show
in fact i i i'll i'll look for it because i
it's it's something that you know
it's it's really stirring
the cinematography is just beautiful and really beautiful scenes and real good music
my wife's from down in that region around the s- the called the the seven missions which are which are right down in this where i'm sure where it was filmed at
i'm sure that that would make it worth worth her watching
my my uh my movie watching has has severely uh has has changed a lot since i got married
she she likes uh action movies and uh and and comedies
and so anything that's has anything little is a little little bit less than sort of mainstream hollywood is is boring to her
and and so i i i i really i used to watch a fair number of foreign films
i used to watch a lot of sort of the less the less popular films
and i find i don't do it anymore or else i have to watch them on my own
i i i i have a fiance
and it it gets very difficult to uh uh
i'll watch them you know
i don't seem to get you know as much variety these days lately as i used to
i found when when i get when i get with my uh old college buddy we we usually rent uh good gladiator movie or two
uh i still enjoy watching those
but it's it's fun to
on the other hand you know given that my wife likes those i i say i occasionally like to watch them
and and so uh you know so it's you can always count on her to watch something like that
and she'll even watch things like karate movies and stuff like that
you know which most most women now
all the all the ya
uh uh on foreign films did uh did you did you watch
are you uh fluent in another language
i speak several uh
but i i don't mind watching subtitle movies uh
oh you don't
i i feel foolish sometimes because i i don't speak another language fluently
but i do enjoy watching you know subtitles
i mean for some people that's just you know that's out of the question you know
lucille i'm on on
and our top- okay our topic was
well i certainly am too
well unfortunately i don't expect a great deal out of them
you know when roy tarpley just now he messed up on them it just hurt them so bad
it just seems like they were just getting themselves in a position where they could possibly be a final a final team playing for all of it
well do you think it's time that we go for new uh coaches
i think at this time we're just in a a rebuilding type of phase you know
i think that probably be evident with the more and more the more and more young guys they draft
well it just it's so discouraging that they can't really
i mean they're entitled to more than they've been able to do so far
i i'm awfully sorry that the mavericks can't come on and and do
or who do you like after the mavericks
i'm so much a maverick maverick fan i don't know
they have a they have a similar situation in that a lot of old guys on the team
and but they're still playing good ball
but i'm i've always been a boston celtic fan too
but you know i've lived in texas since seventy-four
so being a transplanted texan in in the dallas area i have to stick with those dallas mavericks
we do you know
and when my kids got to a certain age and went off to school and college and doing their own thing sort of gets boring going by yourself
oh you bet
but um maybe next maybe they can do some
well i don't know
it seems like rolando blackman and and harper sort of carry the team
but and that can really help the team
but they do that
i course i don't know any of the newer ones that they have
and i'm not well versed on their capabilities
but we really need to do something
well you know i feel like uh the best they can hope for this year is probably an opportunity to make the playoffs
and i just i think he deserves a good break
i think donald carter the owner i think with all he's invested he deserves a a healthy team for one year and a good break also
and they have just done as much as they can for that man
and he apparently can't straighten his act out
so we need to to build on something more positive than that
oh i do too
well it um
i mean you can't give
there's an old saying you can you can lead a horse to water
but you can't make him drink
and i think tarpley's just a sad case
but to be making a a million dollars a year that's pretty sad
i don't um
i mean we're going to have to do something about all of these fabulous salaries they're paying to all of our athletes i think
oh i think you're right
you know you take a a young kid roy tarpley's age i'd say he was twenty-one when he came into the league
and now he's probably an old age of uh twenty-five or six and making all that money
well that's uh that's quite a that's a little more of a challenge for a young man than they they need at that point in their life i think
i think you know it's created by
um are you from this area
but i live in garland
um well i don't know if you know
but garland has got a real big recycling center that in fact we went to it yesterday
and you take the stuff out of your trunk
and they have different bins for the different materials like clear
and uh they have all the different plastics separated by those little symbols on the bottom
my my daughter is four
and she's real interested in
so we're we're trying to promote that because she thought we just put them in a special trash can and threw them away
but we went to the recycling center to show her what we actually did with them
uh does dallas have a curbside recycling program yet
um well i don't know dallas
in richardson does
um they started with newspapers and uh of course aluminum cans and and bottles and plastic
um like soda bottles are one kin- one type of plastic
and milk jugs are one type of plastic
most of the recyclable containers have the little symbol on the bottom with the with the arrows around it that tells whether it's a one or a two or a three
it's it's just different kinds of plastics like the clear plastic is different from that milky looking plastic
and that's that's what the different types are
yes i i know there's a long scientific name
but it's like polytechnochloride and all that fun stuff
um i i don't know if they do it all over
but our kroger does a newspaper recycling every saturday
and they have one of the clerks up there no the bag boys out there um that will take the papers newspaper out of your car
and they'll put it in their little bin
and they do the recycling
i mean they collect the newspapers and their pla- their plastic grocery bags which i think is pretty neat
or th- one of their articles was on recycling
and uh it was actually on a town that has a dump that they charge other cities or towns to come in and dump their trash there
they have made so much money from that that they built they bought a brand new fire engine
and when the fire engine was delivered the fire house wasn't big enough so they bo- bought a new or built a new one and paid for it in cash with the money that they've earned from this landfill
and in the winter they put snow on it
and they charge to ski on it
so the city gets the money from that
and they get the money from that
it's a it's riverview ohio or some place up there
but it was i thought it was a pretty neat idea
they i mean their city hall looked better
and they only have fourteen thousand people in the city
and they like the trash
but i thought it was pretty neat
it it would be nice if more communities could do that
but you have to know from beginning
and you have to have the space to do it
well they're already planning a second mountain
so they're going to get going to be called the twin peaks
i was like uh-huh go back two t v shows
this it would be nice if more communities could get really involved in recycling
so it's like well no honey
so that like
so that was one reason we went to show her what people did with their their stuff when they recycled it and try to explain well yeah you melt down the cans
and you make them into new things
and you get the paper all wet
and you make it into new paper
um so do you all go ahead
was like well from trees um that's why you have to cut down trees and why you have to plant more trees
and how do you grow aluminum
well let's see um
but and then she was like well what do you do with the glass
well you crunch it up real small
and then you melt it down
well what if it breaks
it it it was an interesting weekend trying to explain all that fun stuff to her
but at least she knows that that is something that people need to be doing
and she got our baby-sitter to start recycling her newspapers and cans because that's all she talked about
so i guess what
so what are your feelings on the topic today as far as crime in america today
well i think some of the blame can be placed on plea bargaining and people getting less time and not serving any of the or a lot less of the
time than they're given by the court system
but i don't know
i have to i have to agree with you
i had occasion a couple years ago to hear the r- s- chief of police of richardson texas speak
and you know it's a shame
and then when he gets caught he'll be sentenced to something like five to seven years
but he gets five days credit for every day he serves
i mean it's like a bonus to go to jail
subsequently a five year sentence means he's going to be out in uh a year on probation
i mean what he does the chief said is he just merely goes back to his his stash where he has it hidden and continues to operate
and uh when he s- uses up all that and spends all that money then he uh starts robbing houses again or whatever and gets caught again and goes through the same thing
well there was an article in our paper sunday that the average person sentenced to seven to ten years in north carolina the average serves six weeks
now see that's a you talk about that's a crime right there
well see we don't have any room in our prisons
well we don't either in texas
they shu- they shuttle them in and shuttle them out
and they get them get them early parole in order to make rooms for the new criminals who stay there for their six weeks
and then they're they're paroled uh to make room for the newest criminals
and it just it it's just really absurd
well it it certainly is
and uh that would be a huge concern
you know i don't think the general public really realizes this as far as what goes on with our criminal system our judiciary system and everything else
it's just uh it's terrible the way it is right now
or they think that there's absolutely nothing they can do about it
as far as steps to reduce crime if it's uh crimes like we're just been discussing
but i don't think that's going to happen because just like you said
and our state's a good example
and it's just not going to happen
but i know it
and you know to i'm sure he gets to watch a lot of t v
and i'm sure they have uh exercise facilities and movies
and and everything else you know they can have a good time in
well i don't know what the answer is
but i know that asking the question over and over and over again isn't working
and hopefully something will come out of it
so i don't know
i'm uh i'm pretty much of a hard person
uh i believe in capital punishment
i mean you know a person rapes a kid or shoots someone or kills someone
i mean you know if it's just downright outright
oh i definitely believe in capital punishment
i mean that's the only way to
it's when they it's when they're in on death row for nineteen years that i don't i'm kind of c- curious about
and you spend thousands hundreds of thousands of dollars to uh take care of them and all you know
i think the i think it's uh the average is eight to ten years to get in to the north carolina supreme court and then uh after that it goes to the supreme court of the united states
and that usually takes another four to six years
oh i know
meanwhile you're living in a country club situation perhaps you know
i guess they're what they're h- they're trying to prolong their lives and hoping people will forget what they did
but it's just a
and and the the thing is the the thing
the fundamental problem is the is
and now i'm sort of don't know if this an advantage or disadvantage
well then i'll uh i'll walk softly
and you know there is a lot of serious things wrong with the school system today and the teaching system
but uh for example my wife she has kids that are on drugs
and of course like everyone she has kids that get pregnant even even in the seventh grade
but to give you an example uh you know one of her kids will come in and he's you could tell he was just bombed out on drugs
and uh she sends him to the principal's office
and the principal sends him right back or her right back and says hey your problem you take care of it
you know if you do that then your allocation's cut from the state or the feds or whatever
and it's it's it's a numbers game
i don't think that's right if they're especially if they're interrupting the class and preventing other kids from learning
well i think it's more of a
there's a bigger problem here than uh than discipline in the schools
i think it gets back to the uh parental participation into the program
um to give you an example both of my children are in the academy system in the garland school district
and it's a public system however you'd think that it was a private school because i take it the best teachers and the best students
they're taking top three percent that have tested out you know in the district and uh put them in this academy system
and to get into the system's very difficult
but once you're in uh they have they have self-paced programs
and so you have students that want to learn
and uh you have teachers that want to teach
and you have parents that are really interested in the children
and basically uh there's probably some discrimination if you want to say that
and most of
but i'm saying a large percentage of them are
and also the other large percentage is is that all the parents just about of these kids uh have college degrees at least one parent does
and so there's
i think that uh that's my justification for saying that the parents that are that are pushing their children at home even if they don't know what their children are learning they're they're saying do your homework let me see it don't get in trouble at school or we're going to be all over you
my son had such a tough time in uh the school he went to
but there was through
but we put him in a private school in richardson
and that that cost more
that was more than his college tuition was but uh it had to be done
at least it took care of him and uh threw him in a good learning situation where he did participate and uh want to learn something
but i'll tell you what there's a there there are a few faults to say the least in the school systems today
i think what we've done is um um especially looking at um the south dallas area is that we're trying to bring the education level down to the lowest level so that the lowest level can succeed
and um that also probably crosses over into business because now businesses also say that if you're not don't have the proper education uh including uh exposure to high tech fields such as computer technology if you can't use a computer today and do word processing and do uh data base management and do i forget all the other stuff financial management and all this other kind of stuff in your regular job uh you can't function you know
so i think that the school system proliferates over to the business world
and the business world then says we're not going to pay you unless you have the education
and then educ-
and then then we what we've done is caused a big problem that proliferates itself
well teachers you know they have a a tough row to hoe so to speak they just always fighting the system
you know we came down to texas from the uh new york area
but my wife is from new york
and she was born and raised there and educated there college and everything
and i think you know the schools in the east are really a whole lot better than the schools in the south i don't care where you're from
and they they
but they certainly uh they have a tendency to learn more
and in that part of the country there is all nationalities
uh the questions is concerning the changes in the roles of american women in the past several generations and you know in their the society we live in
well i think one of the major changes is the whole attitude towards women in the work place and the role of women in doing jobs outside of the home
but are are they being given the full honor for the work they are doing and for the uh oh my gosh i can't think of the word but for the what they have to accept that's they are responsible for
uh responsibilities is what i am trying to say
oh i don't think so
by the same token most in most cases women have the jobs with the same responsibility of men who have been there before but at lower salaries
and i think that's what we really ought to look at that going is if they are going to do equal work they ought to get equal pay
and that uh they ought to have equal opportunities to advance to those positions and i don't think that we have gotten there yet
well what changes do you think are most significant over the past few years
any individual thing or is it just a general switch over
and and i think that switch over has been more in the work force
so they have one and three quarters jobs now whereas the husbands have one and a quarter
in that uh the the lady needs to stand up for what she has made and her own rights and has a right to do so
and this upsets the man because we have always been built to think that we were sort of head of the household
so do you think that is going to be uh difficult saying as far as marriages and people enjoying each other in the future years
and i am not sure they are becoming more skilled at it
so i think it really has put some additional stresses on the family units
well do you have any opinion of potential changes that may occur in the next generation
well i i think one of the things that always happens is i think is when the one end wh- you know were moving out to the end where a lot of women will be at work and then i think we are starting to see now some tendency of women at mid thirties
and so the opinion of this career thing isn't all that it is cracked up to be
and i want to go back and do something else
i think we will probably see the sw- pendulum in terms of the work force swing back a little bit
well i actually mo-
and the people
well how do you feel about women in uh armed services
well i think they ought to have the right
i have some problems with my own family thinking about my wife going to com- or my wife and my daughter going into combat but i have problems with men doing that
and i guess if they want to they ought to have the right to do it
and the men went out and took responsibility of earning the money bringing in whatever they needed and protected the household
and it it really still bothers me
but it still bothers me to see ladies out in combat or actually out in places where there is two or three of them there and five hundred men around
i mean how are they going to protect themselves so to speak
i i really don't go for that
i think one of the other things that concern has concerned me a little bit
and i think i see some change in attitudes there
my wife happens to be a wife who has chosen to stay at home and there's uh has been a tendency over the past few years to treat her as though she was somebody who didn't have much intelligence because if she did she would be out in the work force uh fulfilling herself
well that's not fair because i can tell you one thing stay home sometime and start doing some of those jobs that she's been handling
and you're going to learn there is a lot of responsibility just keeping the home going
and i hope we reach the point where whatever women chose to do that's acceptable
and if they go into the work force they should be treated as nicely as as well as a man or any other person
and uh not
so what do you think of the giants
uh i like the giants
they got uh
i probably didn't get into baseball until maybe maybe three years ago really so uh but i i just like the giants
i don't i don't know why
i read uh dave dreveki's book his autobiography and
that that was incredible
really proud of him though the way he's you know
really you know
but i just think the giants have a good team
they they got all you know
they're they're they're real balanced out
and they got the hitting to go along with it
i just don't understand why they're not right up there on the top you know
they just they need that i think they just need that one one element to push them over the top you know
but but every team that's that's really good seems
you know like the a had they had they just had it all that one year
um i was mostly an a fan you know
i had been to more games at the a than i have in the giants because uh i lived in oakland you know for some time
but uh i still like the giants though you know
if you're a fan you got to stay with the team any way you know you good and the bad
but it's it's kind of hard
i still basically the the
i mean we can go to the astros or the rangers teams
but since no-
me none of me and my friends are really really like either one of those teams
so we uh about about the most baseball we get is either t v or we play it on nintendo
so so that's just you know that's small town trying to make it through the not being around it really
well i prefer ba- uh football over baseball
but baseball is still you got you got to do something when football ain't on
so hot dogs baseball and apple pie huh
so what do you think is going to happen this year to the teams
uh i don't know it's hard to say
i haven't really really
at least you know you have to read the paper and sports illustrated and everything to keep up with who they traded and who they picked up and and all that
but like i say if they can if they can get that one element that they were missing i think the giants can do it
well the giants are
i don't like the a uh matter of fact i can't stand the oakland a
just because they have uh you know they've got their jose canseco and and all the attitude that goes along with that you know
you hear what you hear what you hear what he did
and i was like yeah
he's like a little bitty kid huh
he's just a a a little boy with a lot of money
you know but
well i guess the giants or might move away from san francisco it sounds like
i've heard i've heard talk about that
you know uh they won't be that far away
but san francisco will be hurting anyhow
but i hope they can do good
i mean that's just
i think they're a good team that just need that one one little thing to push them over
it just might be the drive you know more than anything else
they just they probably just need something to push them because i that's that's the only thing i can see that's holding them back is the ambition to do it
or somebody basically
maybe that's what you know that's what some teams need
i know isn't that something i couldn't believe that huh
my roommate my roommate's a twins fan for forever
so he had his year this year
we got pre- we we got into that a whole bunch
that was a that was a series to remember for sure
so i saw all seven games of that
i couldn't believe that you know
i don't uh
well you're right
you have to figure out why they're all doing that i'm like it's doesn't work it's obvious it doesn't work because the you know the braves braves didn't win
so uh why keep on doing something that didn't work
but i don't know
i was i was kind of surprised that we were going to talk about baseball
and i get a woman's voice
i was i was i was thinking uh-huh
i got i called got a call the other night about uh fixing your automobile up
well baseball's baseball
uh they give you a list of things that you want
uh i i'm not familiar
i think uh you guys in indiana don't you have the the death penalty
but we do have it
i can't even remember the last execution we had here actually
uh personally i'm in favor of capital punishment
i know there's a lot of lot of problems with it
but uh seems to me that some crimes are just so heinous that that the person just i feel doesn't deserve to live doesn't deserve for the tax payers to spend however many thousands of dollars it costs a year to keep them in in prison for life
but i know there's a lot of problems with that like well they say okay if you declare someone put them on death row and execute them well then ten years later you find out that he really didn't do it then that life was wasted
but just seems like in some cases that it's a it's a good policy
uh i i tend to agree with you
you know that
and i uh
that's a that's a thought that i had never really had on that which seems pretty sensible
i i uh i don't
you know not completely failsafe
but if a man's convicted of two murders uh you know there's a pretty good chance that something's wrong
to tell you how liberal i have turned uh toward this or or or whatever side that is i've kind of chosen uh i believe it that uh big time drug importers like uh say noriega for example that these people need to be uh eliminated uh from society
and i think i think the death penalty is the best choice for those people because uh really any kind of uh uh jail sentence for them is just another chance to uh create another power structure
you're you're right there
uh i gue-
basically my views i guess they tend to be more economically oriented in that i just you know they come out with these figures that it costs fifty thousand dollars taxpayer dollars a year to keep someone alive in jail when they're going to be there for life they're never going to be rehabilitated
i mean i don't believe that the prison system that we have today does much towards rehabilitation to begin with so to me i'm paying taxes you know twenty percent of my check or whatever to keep somebody alive who i in my mind shouldn't be there in the first place and is never going to be a valuable or worthwhile part of society
so i i'm all in favor of it
are there cases where you think that that uh the capital the capital punishment shouldn't be uh uh sentenced
well i i really don't know on that question
for instance the jeffrey dahlmer case i mean i don't really think that this person is going to ever be a worthwhile part of society
i hope the guy never gets back out on the streets and in that case wisconsin doesn't have a death penalty
so he's going to be sentenced to life imprisonment
and i think that that he should not be allowed to live
but you know then you're kind of playing god
but cases where i think the death penalty should be withheld uh not really that i can think of
i i would i would be in favor of the death penalty in things like you know murders and like you said repeat murders or serial killers uh i don't really agree with the uh death penalty for people like noriega and such as that
i think that they're they're operating on a more
i mean i know that they're causing massive problems in society up here
but i don't really think that that it's it's in our power to take these people from a sovereign state and say you don't deserve to live because they're feeding our consumer needs
i understand i understand your point
uh of course you know with uh with with dahlmer now uh you you realize that ohi- i think it's ohio uh gets to try him next
and they do have the death penalty
uh uh something is sort of nightmarish to say the least
that's that's right
uh well here in texas we uh
i think even even this last week last week they had another they uh
you know they use their capital punishment by lethal injection uh uh
uh do you have any experience in uh finding child care
we i guess we were in a situation where we didn't need to be looking at uh two family income at the time
and our kids were older
but i've had to deal with uh you know friends of ours that have used child care and that kind of thing
uh so it
but still have been you know certainly exposed to criteria people are using
well uh we're kind of lucky
i i'm uh i'm working
and she is taking care of the kids also
and and so we haven't had to look for child care either which has been very nice
but i do have like you mentioned a lot of friends a lot of uh co-workers and associates that are looking for child care
and some of the things that they're very critical about is the number of kids that are in the child care uh what kind of you know uh guidance counselor to student or you know uh adult to child relationship
how many you know you don't want to have thirty or forty
then uh something happens and the adult wouldn't be able to uh accommodate or take care of the kids very well
and uh they also want to make sure that the kids are being taught and not just playing around all the time
so you know depends also upon the the level of the child
we uh we uh take a very close look at finding a a preschool a good preschool for our kid
and i kind of relate that to that in in making sure that the the uh teachers are very well educated themselves they have a good curriculum and that they're willing to teach the kids and have a fun time with them
and it's very important i feel uh that the kids interact with other children also
it's a it's a good way to develop relationships with other kids their age and uh get to know and work with kids
so i don't know i i guess we're kind of in the same boat
but even you know here i guess we have
and that will be groups of anywhere
and then otherwise there will be
uh people form a co-op and uh parents will work in the co-op and put a fair number of hours
and the emphasis is primarily uh someplace for the children to be
but at the same time there's some fairly good training programs and and some of them formal two year programs
uh so that
you know there is some definite uh creative play good social interaction that kind of thing
i think it's uh important like you mentioned that's a good idea on the uh parent co-op because uh
and i don't want to just take them to somebody i pick out of the yellow pages or out of some ad somewhere
and uh you know you hear in the newspa- you hear on the t v and you read the newspaper quite often of of people that you know don't treat or take care of your kids the way you think they ought to be taken care of
so and hope to never get into that situation where we have to have to find somebody and we have to trust someone with the welfare of our children
and hope that we can stay in this situation
you know we've even had some of those kinds of situations publicized here and
it's uh typically uh whether it's been child care in a home
and you've actually got children that most people would consider problem children
and it's not and it's more of a group home rather than actually day-care s- type of facility
well steven it's been
i'm sure that i probably uh prescribe to different magazines ones that you do
uh i also take better homes and gardens
and then uh my husband he just uh subscribed to a wood
so he just sent away to get some woodworking books
so what kind do you uh get
well i have a bunch of computer journals because i'm in computer science
but beyond that uh lately i've been reading
and lately i've been picking up some of the travel uh both trade magazines and just the general travel magazines
uh trying to keep up on what's going on
and she still likes to get time which i've never liked very much
but she seems to
if i you know if i happen to find it i'll go ahead and read it someplace you know if i'm in a doctor's office or something like that
but other than that i never i never liked that really
i can hardly wait in the mornings for the newspaper to get here you know
so i do like to read the newspaper uh even this little newspaper that patterson puts out
but uh other than that magazines i don't know there's so much advertising in them anymore
but when i used to get it it was about five hundred pages about three hundred of them advertising
because that was interesting i think a lot of the trade magazines are like that
that that half the fun is finding out what all the products are
but you know some of the get ridiculous
travel and leisure all of the american express magazines so travel and leisure food and wine and i think they have some others uh certainly half the pages and maybe more are pure ads plus they have the advertising supplement sections that are supposed to look like articles but are paid for
and they don't care if they make any money on the magazine subscription they're making everything on ads
well i i only you know subscribe to the things i'm interested in
so i used to get the coin magazine the paper actually is what it was you know
so now that i'm into dolls that's about all i really really want you know
have you ever uh read or subscribe to consumer reports for any length of time
uh i think they're interesting
i i've always had this
so i've always had this problem with consumer reports that in the areas that i know a lot about i disagree with them
and i always wonder whether there are people who know a lot about every area disagreeing with them on everything
or or what's going on
so i like i've picked up now a subscription to one of the travel agent uh organization magazines
and it's a ridiculous difference when you start reading from their perspective
uh you know their major interest is in commissions
and you know there's very little talk about the quality of places or airlines
their major talk is about you know commissions and commission rebates and how they won't suggest hotels to people if the commission's not a the full ten percent or whatever it is
and it gives you a different
well those travel magazines are that more or less show you different countries that you could go to
uh some of them
the the general travel magazines do
because i don't expect to be traveling overseas in in the future for quite awhile
but i i usually just read through the sections on on domestic stuff
well i don't know any other magazines i could talk to you about
uh i don't take anymore than that
you know so
well i guess that will be it then
uh but i know what it is
i i i i i'm kind of
you know i'm i'm kind of in the
