i think it's a great idea when it comes to me it's almost an insult
i've come from the teaching field
it's just like i don't know i guess i'd have to go with
i'd be for it
i don't know it's just kind of a delicate subject i guess
i would probably go for going ahead and doing it if it's got to be done for everyone
when they answer the company i think it'll make it a lot easier they'd run into less problems
it sort of
i'm more or less if they told me i had to then fine
if they made me then i'd probably
if i had my druthers i'd probably say no
i guess if they
there's
i guess there's some companies that are doing it
it seems to be working out
i think it's what they're basically trying to do i don't know up here in massachusetts anyhow what they're basically trying to do is any people who had tested positively getting them into a drug program
anybody who is doesn't accept the rehab program then they're more or less getting laid off
i think that's really hard to because you never know i don't know it
that's what's they're coming across as is some of the companies anyhow
we can get you into a drug program
you wear that stigma
where a lot of people are saying i only smoked a joint last night i don't have any problems
then i kind of hear it goes into
this is just something i've heard that it kind of goes into just your off the counter medication that you could be taking for a cold that it kind of affects that too
anything with a
if you drink a lot of caffeine or
i didn't know that
somebody was telling me if you drink it in
an awful lot of caffeine that that can show up as a positive test
things like that
i'd probably test positive
a lot of times those are the things i don't like to disclose to an employer because then they don't want to have anything to do with you
it's very personal
i wouldn't want to have it disclosed because then i'd always wonder if they fired me why did you fire me
it kind of gets into your personal life
what's kind of next
it hits me as the orwell thing big brother is watching
his book big brother is watching
you're being controlled
i sh-
i don't know seems awful strange
i can understand why they need it with all the train accidents and everything else
do you think they'll kind of push into the teaching field eventually
i think they will too because it's just going to follow
i don't know we haven't had any of it in our school system
hopefully we won't
i just kind of think it's heading that way though it's just
i just kind of think it's going to eventually head that way
eventually it's going to be not only the tea-
the kids are going to be under scrutiny it's going to be the teachers
if they can test the teachers that gives them the full right to test the kids
they caught everybody
i haven't been in this situation yet
my parents are not quite at that age yet
i haven't
i haven't really been in that situation although they are thinking about my grandmother
not for my parents
i was around two sets of grandparents quite a bit
we i put one grandfather in a rest home that killed him
did it
there was some other things involved
he lost his drivers license
i couldn't get around and wasn't able to do some things
we ended up just having to put him in a rest home
he just kind of became a vegetable and died
that was a long time ago
that was back in like seventy-three
i think the way they did things were a lot different back then
my grandmother his wife we also put her in a rest home
she was back out because she didn't really need to be there
they worked with her and got her walking and got her kind of taking care of herself
she was able to come back home
she had to go back in a couple of times
mostly it was just because she kind of gave up
they got her going again
i guess as far as looking
i said as what you're looking for i think you need to look for an
somebody who is willing to work with a patients and do things with them and treat them like they're
i'm sure it's expensive
it is
my grandmother is not in a nursing home
she's in a
she really does love that
she's just concerned about in the future
that she knows it's not going to be like that all the time
she's just wondering what's going to happen to me
i
i guess it's so normal to start to wonder about that even if she doesn't need that
she's kind of asking questions about what's going to happen this can't last forever
is it like a kitchenette type apartment where she can fix her own food if she wants to she can go down to the cafeteria
i think it is also cafeteria style because i doubt if she rarely cooks for herself
because i remember in her letters telling me she'll go downstairs for coffee or something to eat
i'm assuming it's something like that too
i really like that concept
they have quite a few of those places like that here in utah
couples can
husband and wife can live there too or whatever
yet they have their friendships and relationships and the
i think it really takes looking more at the people than even really the facilities
she lives by herself too
my husband's grandmother is
she lives in a house on her own
she doesn't really need the care or anything like that
she has her own home
she's doing really well
we haven't had to do anything
then again she has a lot of support
she's got her mother in town too and things like that
i think that that's the thing that's a little bit scary a little bit tough about putting them in a rest home is it's almost like
that they say putting them out to pasture
some of the people that were there with my grandmother were really active
they wanted to do things
they didn't want to go down and play bingo or play with the oranges
talking about latin america i consider latin america to include central and south america
i did live in san polo brazil for four years
do you think that we should have given up the panama canal
realistically i
i don't see the panama canal that hasn't had a whole lot of usefulness to us recently since it's not really big enough to accommodate the shipping that it once did
maybe it would be better that we let the panamanians run it however i think we're certainly justified in our actions dealing with noriega in this
there are those that think that the panama canal has some considerable strategic importance particularly for the military
interestingly enough my father who was in world war one and as a civil engineer they offered him a commission as a captain if he would go in and help with the defenses of the panama canal
in fact they had
this was in the late twenties
they in fact used some of the equipment that had been left over
he turned them down
it's interesting that most people don't realize how small the canal is
it's really
i haven't been there
in fact we went back to visit some friends of my fathers that we went in fifty-seven i guess
interestingly enough the canal is quite small and and realistically could be sabotaged quite easily
the thing i find interesting though is the whole colonial approach
do we support the sandinistas or do we support
they thought that nicaragua if you gave them a free election they would vote for the
will you
did you ever studied the political makeup there in nicaragua
i have a little bit
i can't say that i would be an expert on on the region
certainly it gets there
you've got this toss up betw-
not so much a toss up but a dilemma when you want a country to have its own dominion or its free rein over its own people
on the other hand the government in power that under what seems to be popular support the sandinistas had to a given extent popular support starts making overtures to the soviet union and into what we consider our sphere of influence
we're in this dilemma over united states believes in democracy and self determination where
on the other hand we believe in self preservation and not so much agree with but are terribly concerned about soviet influence in what's considered to be the united states sphere of the world which is not only we used to see spheres
now we're in a situation where the united states looks like we're it now
the interesting part about it is that if realistically it was economic
there was an option to build it across nicaragua
there's a big lake
from a technical standpoint it wouldn't have been a lot more difficult to have built it in nicaragua
the united states had some
i've forgotten what the political influence was
there were economic ties then
the issue of
if it's in the economic interest of the united states do we go in and prevail
in other words do we make the world safe for democracy
if there's no economic benefit
i think particularly if you're looking at the peasant whether he's in central america regardless of where he is is his life better off under communism or democratic government
he doesn't care as long as he's feeding his family
the question is does the government make a difference
if they'll mostly leave him alone
i think that's the difficulty that we have that it reality doesn't make any difference if he has no income
apparently even some of our alleged central american leaders that are mostly democratic have done some pretty terrible things
it's
if you look at the region in
to their detriment they came from this hundreds of years of spanish control
the spaniards have horrible history of corrupt government greedy rulers who have been manipulating their public for their own good
if you go back to the kings and the conquistadors coming in and the incredibly horrible things they did to the native tribes
they make the things that custer did look trivial
you get
it is interesting that we look at the exploitation
we accuse some other people of exploiting them
americans have a pretty good reputation of exploiting
basically the panama canal we went in took it
we set up
we stole it fair and square
i think is
teddy roosevelt didn't have the reputation speak softly and carry a big stick for nothing
what's going to be interesting is to the see what the economic impact of the region at the moment the tremendous drug traffic through there
the idea of
what's america's role there
it
with other things going on it seems to have lessened
you've still got cuba that exerts some influence
the only thing i see about cuba though is after fidel castro dies i don't think they'll be a communist power anymore
i can't see communism in that country carrying on past him
when you take a situation where i think in particular in salvador where there is a significant under class
that
having a lot of difficulty surviving the question is would they be better off under communism
i don't know that i would advocate communism
the question is can a democracy afford the
it's like the street people that are starting to show up all other the u s
when you get enough of them communism would feed them all
i don't know if maybe communism is the right word for it
what we would
there may be a point at which you might want to consider some kind of socialistic organization or socialistic set up to deal with the problem and then be able to gradually transform back to a democracy
if he's got
if he can raise enough coffee and bananas to where he's got something to protect
other
whether he can export or at least set up trade and all then democracy of a considerable interest
cocoa leaves sell real well right now it seems
it's going to be hard to
if you
that's where your absolutely right is we've got to do something in that region to encourage or
the question is if somebody offered a thousand dollars a day to grow something in your backyard would you do it
not that we could be bought
i never know when the d i a may be listening on my phone
of course everything we're saying is being recorded
it's got to be horribly tempting for those peasants
it's not just a matter of having an extra car or having a better car this is a matter for them of feeding themselves their wife and their family
you
there's dishonor in not being able to do it
starving to death is not a whole lot of fun either
None
when somebody comes in an offers i think that's one of the real problems particularly when the religious organizations the catholic church has been accused of a lot of things
i'm not sure the catholic church is particularly political
if
i was wondering whether you were in favor of statehood independence or the status quo for puerto rico
i was a resident although very young of what is now the state of alaska in nineteen fifty-nine when alaska stopped being a territory and became a state
i guess i have a left over positive feeling about the question even though i don't know very much about puerto rico
i know that all the things that happened relative to that territory in alaska have been very positive
i have a suspicion that i believe that the statehood is a good idea whenever you have a territory the size of puerto rico one ought to make it a full-fledged state let it go one or the other
i guess i don't have such close experience with an area becoming a state as you do
my concern is the economy because as i understand it puerto rico has a very low standard of living or at least annual average income
part of this i suppose is justified in that the climate they don't need perhaps the heating and the housing that some of the more northern territories need
i have been to puerto rico and found it very very interesting
that's very interesting
i saw it also as a young student
it was very foreign in a certain sense although i had grown up in california
the spanish was no problem
it was very lovely
the people seemed very friendly and nice
i work with a girl from puerto rico
i guess i have never thought to ask her what she favors
your concern on the economy was one in terms of if it became a state would that put even more pressures on puerto rico or pressures on the u s in terms of aid
probably more in terms of the u s
i'm not quite sure how the u s copes with this sort of thing
i've live abroad most of my life
i guess i've been very cut off
i was very cut off from the press as i was becoming an adult
i don't know how the u s would cope with a new state that is so very very poor
i guess we'd have a lot of aid if you consider the inner cities of new york and how much aid it needs
i suppose the whole new state would require such aid
i guess we're assuming that puerto rico would be per capita significantly more poor perhaps than mississippi
that's something that i guess i have not much of an image of other than puerto rico as a tropical island and consequently large numbers of barefoot natives or something not in a perjuritive sense but in a in a carefree sense i guess
although i'm aware of the political problems and unrest and also difficulties they have i don't know whether statehood would improve their economy
i don't know that the act of being a state would have any impact on them
i guess they would have the ability to do some taxing that they don't have now
of course if their economy is weak there is not much of a base on which to tax
i guess it's to their advantage to be a territory
i wonder how having been in a territory but only as a young student
my parents were in the military at the time
they didn't have ready negative feelings about being in alaska at the time since they voted absentee
i would imagine that it must be a little bit of a feeling of second class citizenry to be in a territory that large and not being able to vote
those are good points which obviously i had never thought about
i don't know i suppose they also not being a state are probably freer to determine their own ways of life than they would if
i see what you mean
and taxes
frequently the laws in a territory are in some ways as stringent as they are in other states
i'm thinking in terms of education
then again each state sets its own
i don't know how a territorial governor takes care of something like puerto rico
it's interesting because i haven't thought of them in terms of the problems relative to economy i had thought of it more in terms of political realization
i guess i had automatically made the assumption that anyone would rather be a state of the u s than an independent country
i thin-
if they've just taken such action it would seem to indicate to me they're doing it because they're afraid they might become a state and want to declare this before they become a state maybe because they don't want to become a state for fear of losing the spanish or hispanic heritage
that's interesting too
it sounds as though you are in favor of status quo
i believe i would probably tend towards that
i think having listened to you relative to the economy thing i think if i were being forced to make a decision i would plead ignorance and wait to do more research before picking one of these
None
that's interesting
what about if they demanded to have spanish as the official language as a condition for statehood
i believe that any of our states
constitutionally i don't think there are any prescriptions against that decision even if louisiana chose to go with creole or something
i don't think there is any prohibitions
i'm bothered by any tendency to resist what i think was one of america's strengths
that's the melting pot
i am particularly fond of a number of ethnic cuisines
i'm troubled by too close a clinging to the past
i'm also realizing that a common language i think is the ultimate bond of a country
canada i guess comes to my mind as they're going through the throes up there relative to french quebec and whatever
that i think that would be a negative step to make
i think that that they would need to reassess that
i'm troubled even in by bilingualism in so far that it gets in the way of the melting pot aspect
that's interesting because although i tend to be bilingual spanish based on experience i was in bilingual education in california
i didn't have any problem with my students
i noticed my brother who was quite a bit younger was learning spanish in elementary school
he can't speak a word
obviously it didn't work in california
i'm rather in favor of people being bilingual
i'd be quite happy to see a national law in which every student was required to learn english and a second language
i'm disturbed by a country that attempts to be functionally bilingual at the official level
i see
i'm concerned about whether or not that causes fractiousness i guess
i think we have gone to time
i appreciate your having called
thank you very much
what are your opinions on it
let me preface it
i was a staff officer in vietnam in sixty-nine and seventy i'm in active reserve now
i'm probably not going to have the you think i would have
i was an interesting in that i think that he gave the american people a sense of the fact that wars are really run by politicians it
when did it end
december seventy-two was when we bombed north vietnam and then they released the prisoners in early seventy-three
in that time frame
i was ten
i don't remember a lot about anything at that time in my life very much in
the significant thing is today did you see barbara walters interview with schwartzkopf
i did read the book
i did read and study about the vietnam war though
i am pretty fa-
i'm more
what's your perspective on it
i think that there was a lot of rebellion in our nation and that i think it was the right thing to do to try and not to take away to just leave their freedoms there
i don't know i don't really
on the other hand i'm a pac-
i believe that the real warfare is not with saddam hussein or the north vietnamese
it's in spiritual kingdoms and that the real warfare is done in your prayer closet on your knees
in a way in a sense i'm a pacifist
i'm really not you know what i'm saying
let's go to war praying
let's go to war for that way
the difficulty i have is that are we our neighbor's keepers
this is what i find particularly difficult in that if we see injustice and weather it's in chicago
or or dallas i think if we see it we see john wiley price hollering injustice i think that's wrong
the question is was there injustice in vietnam
i think that's the part i have difficulty
the the other part is when your looking at vietnam and you say is fifty-eight thousand lives worth it you're
still have a problem with
i haven't come to an absolute conclusion on my opinion on this
i know other christians would disagree with me
we don't fight over it or anything
how can
the bible says bless your enemies and bless those that curse you
it's like be gentle unto all men apt to teach patient kind
it's like how can you
i don't know i can't say that i agree with vietnam because how can you be gentle unto all men and then shoot them
other issue is how do you allow injustice just like the policeman in los angeles how could
in some cases we would
i think that's what makes it so difficult
vengeance is mine sayeth the lord
i will pay
i think god is ultimately in charge of what goes on
i know like now in china he did all these terrible things
they were terrible
he was going to be accountable for them
if you look back and you say wait a minute while he was in power he built roads he put in all the temples he unified the chinese language
it was impossible for missionaries to accomplish anything in china because of all that
even in north and south vietnam i bet you'd see the same thing and that now he builds roads
it
he dropped dead twenty-five years premature he dropped dead
something good did come out of that in that now you see what i mean if like now
the other difficulty is that it's just if you take the to feed my sheep and the question is who are my sheep
the idea do we go out and feed these people when they're hungry
bless your enemies if your enemy is hungry feed him
if he asks for your shirt give him your coat also
if the south vietnamese they asked us to help them
they did
i think the biggest difficulty is that when your at an economy like south vietnam then reality the the poor rice farmer was going to pay taxes you're
the question is who was he going to pay it to
the communists are all alleged democrats
i think that's a little difficult part there
i
we couldn't
we had a young lady that was fourteen that worked in the unit i was commander of that appeared to be eight or nine years old
the people looked like children you couldn't imagine that one would conceal a bomb and do these kind of things
i think socially it really destroyed a lot of the people that went over and saw these people
you just couldn't believe that they would be mean and drop bombs and kill people
we would turn around and nay palm them
if i think there was a lot of tearing of emotions
i think that if anything that when he was saying the idea that we learned we learned a lot from vietnam it was in general bad
i don't know the problem is now
i'm concerned a little bit
it was okay to go beat up on people
i think we need a little more justice at home
again yeah
i'm not saying president bush made the wrong decision
i've kind of always
i've kind of avoided those the war things and how god approaches that because i think it's just now coming up to where i really feel like i need to decide
the difficulty is if you look in the old test meat and in the numbers of places that the lord went out and just simply struck down
that was part of the problem when they went into the promise land
they didn't destroy everybody
they left a woman and a child and
that
you
again though jesus the grace pushes you beyond the law you know what i'm saying
he didn't just say don't kill your enemies
not only don't kill them bless them
therefore when we have an enemy come against us i really feel like i know i do feel this strongly that when if we had someone come and attack us the best way to handle it would be to bless them and humbly go to their other king or the other ruler and say what have we done to offend you
that god would move in that sovereignly
he would get the glory though no king no
it would work out because if you follow the scriptural principals it's going to work out because that's the best way to do it
the thing is that then god gets the glory not a president not a king
i think that's a problem for a lot of politicians is they want the glory
i
even at the local level when somebody's assaulted what do you do turn the other cheek
i believe personally
if somebody broke in my house i would pray that i would have this faith to take authority over that
i know people that have done that
i know that there have been people who have had people break in their homes and just say i bind you in jesus name
rebuke any enemy because i believe it's a spiritual war that's going on
it's not normal for someone to come into someone elses home
the same in vietnam you wouldn't handle vietnam the same way you would handle saddam houssein
i have a problem with all the killing
i'm not a new ager i don't believe
i don't have a problem with national identity
i'm an american
having different nations and all of this
i'm concerned about the killing that went on there because i just feel like god has a better way to handle it than that
do you have any favorite teams
i kind of like them all
i played for about eighteen years all the way through college and then kind of hung them up after college
i was going to say you played pro ball
not quite
being in rochester you probably like the mets
i'm a met
i'm one of these people who's actually a die hard mets fan
i think it's one or the other isn't it
i find it very strange
more people
real met fans don't like the yankees
real yankee fans don't like the mets for some reason
i never quite found a new york fan
i always found a fan of one the other
that of course means that when it comes to the american league my favorite team is the red sox by default because i went to college also in boston
i like the
i guess if i had to pick a favorite team any more as well as
that's sort of close enough
we were thirty miles south of them
you were pretty close
what are the mets going to do this year without strawberry
i don't know there's a part of me that says that i'm sort of glad strawberry went away
when he sort of went away i started thinking he was performing fairly well
he really wasn't worth the baggage
i think they're okay
i think they have enough people who are still in their prime
certainly if you look at them compared to let's say eight years ago or something they're sort of in good standing whereas
i was going to talk to you about that eighty-six team
that was the year they beat houston in extra innings
they won the series bye-bye sort of a sneaky route against boston when there was the ball that was sort of hit to buckner
what can you do
the guy's making millions
he was supposedly
there was something wrong with him at the time
his knees were bothering him
i understand that
i say if the guy can't play you don't blame that
hit it to him
you blame the team for putting him in
i was in school at boston at the time
it was actually wonderful because where i was they were half met fans and half sox fans
i think we were all pretty much astros fans in the national league championship series there's two fellows from brooklyn
they were pretty much without having to say they were pretty much mets fans
i guess they must have been scared
they weren't scared very much
that's good
they're brooklyn boys i guess
you don't expect them to be much of anything but thugs
i know i was born there
i was also born in brooklyn
i can call myself a brooklyn thug although i'm really not
i'm not to say that all folks from brooklyn are thugs
they were from brooklyn
i'm kind of hoping
i guess any more
None
i think i make something because i think
in as much as sort of fan support helps
it's good to have
they have plans
the owner tried to move them to florida they ended up sticking around in arlington
they're going to build a new stadium in arlington as a matter of fact not even in dallas
that's great
that's something that we're looking forward to
that i think tends to keep
case in point toronto
i haven't been to any toronto games yet
boy i saw it i was up there on business last june and watched a game in the sky dome
that's probably the pattern for the future of stadiums i think
to get up there
the best i've been up here so far in up state new york is is rochester red wings game
is rochester
where is cornell university
cornell is in ithaca
cornell is about somewhere about two and a half hours south and east of us
if you know where lake ontario is sort of
rochester is right on the shores isn't it
whoever built the city was an idiot in my opinion
because they built it far enough from the city that it actually couldn't be a port city
they
they say that from that space needle up in toronto you can see the lights of rochester on a clear night
i hadn't actually known that
we have our own triple a team here the redwings they're a farm team for the orioles
everybody hopes that they go all the way around here
you watch those games
we make a point of going to a bunch of them every year because they're fun
lots of local fans small stadium
they'll get a crowd of less than ten thousand sometimes especially
i'll make a day game or something
they really seem to
again i can't make any predictions about them
i suspect they'll go they'll go fly
my folks lived down in beaumont
on the campus of lamar university they used to house the beaumont golden gators who were a double a team for the padres i think
they were fun games to watch
i think those are more fun than major league games sometimes
there's definitely a lot more hitting
one of the advantages of not having pitchers who are i guess when you start pitching real well move them up
as far as the major league teams
every year they always knock on the door early and then just go into their skid about the end of june
they've got so much young raw talent
they just haven't been able to put anything together
the way i see it is
i can use a met analogy here
back to maybe eighty eighty-four or eighty-three or eighty-five when they weren't quite the eighty-six team that they were
that probably gives the readers a good shot for you this year or next year if i think the young talent really just has to build itself up
they've been young for a while
they're almost starting to age a little bit here
i just
they really hurting pitching wise
they've got ryan
who knows what he'll be able to do
it'll be interesting to watch
we usually try to get to opening day game
that must be nice
i guess we're maybe a hundred fifty miles south of dallas
that isn't too bad just a couple of hours
it takes about two hours two and a half hours to get there
it takes me a good seven hours to get to shay stadium
i don't know
we've just got a freeway
i can take a highway the whole way down
it's so crowded up there
it's almost four hundred hou-
it's almost four hundred
barring traffic it's four hundred hours
four hundred mil-
it's a heck of a drive
we are substantially north of new york enough that we don't get to go play too often
you're like a boat ride from
toronto's only about two hours
toronto i want to go see
do you drive there
do you take the ferry or what
i can
i've driven
i've heard about the ferry as well
it's a beautiful city
i really love
i think that's one of the most enjoyable things about being up here
you go back to new york after school
i'm not a big cold fan
what kind of weather are you having right now
right now we're actually having
it was in the high fifties today
three and a half weeks ago we had an ice storm
we've been up in the seventies eighties even up in the nineties a couple of weeks ago
that's great
about that same time branches were falling off everywhere
we were actually in a state of emergency for two weeks
it didn't make the national news too much which i find really weird we were
all schools were closed for a week
they had so many power lines down many things like that
they were
we can be recorded while we talk about it
is your
does your city have mandatory recycling
we're kind of slow up here
we've just started doing recycling probably last summer
it's all voluntary
that's interesting
there're some places that are strongly encouraging it
that they city will pick it up
we have to carry it some distance
some places you can sell your recyclables
for example our church was collecting newspapers
it turns out that so much
the problem in texas is that they've got so much paper now from people recycling that they've got no way to reprocess it
it requires essentially a paper mill to recycle it
the value has gone down
i didn't realize
now up here i suppose they send it all back to the mill
there are paper mills within a couple of hundred miles of
there is one in northern vermont
there's probably a paper mill that's sixty miles from here
in the large city that if the next mill is more like five hundred miles away it's a lot of money to transport
that's
in dallas there no plan to build
i think there's some in east texas there's some pulp mills
you have to go to houston
it's interesting
there's places that will buy metal
they still buy aluminum can and likes that cans likes
copper is a very good one to collect
do you do recycling
we do the recycling
our city will pick up our recyclables
i don't recycle personally
i'm saying i want to do it
i don't get a lot of magazines
i do have a lot of
my trash has a lot of tin cans and a lot of different papers and cardboards
do you drink soda and such in aluminum cans
we have a bottle return
it's worth taking them back
we don't have
we have most of our soft drinks are in plastic liter or two liter bottles
they should definitely get the nickel returnable
a lot of the kids get the money from it
it's great for the boy scouts running around they knock door to door and the collect the bottles sometimes
that's it
there is a down side to all this about no good deed going unpunished
that my mother sells trees that they make paper out of
every time i recycle newspapers in fact there's a
kimberly and clark the makers of kleenex and such has a big paper mill
it's a question should i be diligent and recycle and put my mother out of her livelihood
it's an interesting point though that everybody's so anxious to recycle
i suppose it does provide some gainful employment
it takes away employment from the resource
in general i think it's a good idea because like the glass you can't argue that the glass
it doesn't biodegrade and the plastics obviously
we might as well recycle those
personally i don't want to clean my
i'd just rather get rid of that thing and throw it in the trash
that's what we've got
we took one load over there
now we've got these containers filling up with stuff
it's not a very high priority thing to go haul these containers over there
i get a whole bunch of them and bring them over
if i had a recycling center and i kept it clean like if i washed all the cans and things i wouldn't mind if it sat around too much
if it stunk or something i wouldn't like doing it
i produce quite a bit of trash
my house
i see it
i don't see so much that i can recycle
i'm not a real plastic person user but a lot of paper pretty much
i don't know how they sort that
if i used a lot of can goods and i do use a lot of laundry detergent and a lot of plastic bottles i would think that i would have a recycling center
now it's just me and my husband
i don't know
every little bit helps
we have a very aggressive recycling at work
i'm the one who will pick the newspaper out of the trash and bring it to the recycle bin
some people the recycle bin is on their way out
do you have separate trash cans at your desk
other offices do
we have one that's recyclable and then for lunch sacks and waste food
they gave us a list of things that aren't re-
it turns out it's not so bad
i get a lot of reports that are covered in plastic or like saran wrap or something
cardboard there's a few
it's interesting that we're recycling computer type paper
one day they'll pick up
the next day they'll pick up the other
there's a lot of it works pretty well
we have a waste cans for aluminum in the break areas at work
that's a really good idea because our fruit juices for some reason when they're in a can don't come with a deposit
they're thinking about putting a deposit on them because you're having a whole separate recyclable bin just for these fruit cans where they're so much easier just to put a deposit on it because probably ninety percent of the aluminum cans do have deposits because they're beer and soda
when they sell juice it's some strange quirk in the law you don't have to have a deposit on it
even like a very fine juice jar does not have to have a deposit on it
if it's got soda in it it does
it's a strange
they should clear that up
it wouldn't take them much to put a stamp on the juice cans as easily as the soda
redemption centers are a big thing up here
i think they get a penny two pennies a can
those of us that don't have state income taxes
it's interesting what people get upset about
it really is
is bottle return down there a heated debate
the big issue when we moved here a few years ago is whether it was okay for you to drink beer while you were driving your pickup truck
and throw it out at the in
here you can't drink
we're not civilized now you cannot drink beer and drive
it was actually legal
i know i was in atlanta
you could walk out the bar with your drink in your hand
here let me put that in a paper cup for you
that was strange
i think
they say we're not going to start a can deposit because you have to get all the recycle center you have to deal with the can and then you have to recycle it
their problem's already solved because they can just come to states that do have bottle deposits see how they handle it
see if it's a good way
do it that way because like i say people are making money on it
the cans are worth something
the other thing is it also is a good habit to just to conserve resources because you get in the habit of that you think in terms of things like saving
do you exercise regularly judy
i try to ride the stationary bicycle every day about five miles uh-huh
i love to walk
if i have a lunch hour with nice weather i get out and walk
i exercise regularly
very good
i swim almost every day upwards of a mile
washington is one of my favorite places to visit
my daughter lives in arlington
when i go to visit her i love to get out on that bike trail and ride the bike
you can ride a bike
washington's a great place to do that
there are lots of bike paths
he's done the whole canal i think it's a hundred and eighty miles with the scouts
that somehow takes
it's at home i can do some of my reading
i think there're so many parts of the district
that's it
at work we have a nice campus
i'm able to take advantage of the environment here
the neighborhood also
we're within walking distance of stores and shops
i do
i think
basically is your motive simply health or because you enjoy it
it's really both
most of the time i enjoy it
i feel that the discipline it affords me when i do it when i don't want to is also worth something
i think pretty much you summed up my motivations also
i often find that even when i don't feel that much like exercising
i'll start swimming
i'll actually get energy
i'll have much more energy when i'm done than when i started
i just feel great
that's great
that's really a terrific feeling because you just go there at the end of the day and you figure i'm ready for bed and you exercise and then it's sort of painful for a while
by the time you get done you feeling really terrific
in summer i like to swim
that's true when i go home from work at the end of the day if i go up for an hour in the pool i'm much much more awake
can i just ask you are you canadian
i'm trying to because you have one funny vowel that's probably going to drive the t i people crazy
i must say that when i did do a linguistics course in school ages ago the professor had a lot of trouble with my accent
it's probably because i was born in the chicago area and grew up in california
at that point that was sort of the limit since then i've been abroad a lot
where did you grow up in california
i see
i grew up in north hollywood california went to u c l a and all that
very good
i think we've probably know each other's exercise habits it was nice talking to you
same here
i'll tell you my situation is i have an elderly grandmother that we did just recently put in a nursing home
her son which is my father is also elderly
this is one of the reasons why she had to go to the nursing home is that she was literally driving him nuts in his later years
my father's almost eighty
it's strange because it hit so close to home that my father's an only child
really me and my sister are the only ones that will deal with my grandmother
a couple of them took care of her
one her last sister died
it was probably seven or eight months after that she had to go in a nursing home because i was pretty much giving up my life my sister was and plus she was driving my father crazy
she went through three live-in housekeepers
she's kind of cranky to get along with
her personality is very grating
i have some great concerns about my parents and my relatives reaching that age
around here where i live in maryland in the washington area there's
i used to live down in dallas there was just so many stories about rest homes where the people are being abused where the people are being kept in filthy conditions
in fact here in baltimore they've actually shut a couple of them down and taken all the people out of them because they were so bug infested and rat infested
i
it really concerns me that first of all that anyone could let someone live like that
if you have to how do you make sure
i'm sure when you make your appointment and go by everybody puts on a happy face
how are you sure that the home is really as good as it is because once you put someone into there they may not like the fact that they've been put in there
they might complain about the place all the time even though it's the best place in the whole world they could be just because they want to make you feel guilty for putting them in there
None
we don't have that problem up here
we might maybe in a rural
maybe there's a bad home in a rural area
it would be a very small one
the one my grandmother's in is very hospital like
this one is more or less for someone who's poor and can't go there
my father's he's no by no means wealthy
he's quite well off
he could easily have put her into a nicer home
up here there's waiting lists
that was the first one that opened
i suggested to him why don't you change
he said these people they are very nice to her
he was saying his excuses if you move her some place else the people might not be so nice
the professionals in the nursing homes really have to want to do what their doing because it's a really trying job
i go up twice a week to see my grandmother
i know the staff very well
they can't hide anything on you or anything like that
i have heard of really awful conditions especially down the southern part of the the country
that's true
my grandmother's
last time my mother went down there to visit the place where my grandmother was staying at was so overrun with roaches that they went in and she had roaches crawling on her
there were roaches even in her alarm clock
that's terrible
they just threw everything away that she had from there
they wouldn't even take the the dresser that she had that was her own dresser because it was just full of bugs
they just left everything and bought her all brand new stuff
they had called a home where they were on a waiting list to get into there and explained to the person that was in charge what had happened and that they had to take her out of the home because of the conditions
amazingly enough the very next day they had an opening
they put her into that opening
that's good
is your grandmother impaired
i'm not sure what exactly is wrong with her
up until nineteen eighty-two
i'm sorry not until
apparently what had happened was that i had a grandfather who put her into a mental institution
that does happen
it was a real hush-hush thing i was wondering why my mother always referred to his second wife as that hussy
my neighbors across the street their mother was sick at times
they couldn't handle her
they put her in a home
the old frenchman he'd get a little drunk look round at his kids you still need your mother
that happens a lot when people are sick or they just real manic-depressants they end up being put in homes
it's like
i'm really glad that i come from an area where there's good people in the homes
it's just as
my grandmother's real there
she cries every day
she tries to make me feel really guilty
i have to put my foot down where my life begins
if that was my mother i would really feel a lot more responsible
i don't really
hopefully that he can get along with in-house help
he's going to probably hopefully set it up so that he will be able to pay someone to come in and stay with him probably for sixteen hours a day because i think that's the best situation is when you get that old and you've been independent your whole life you don't want to go into a home because like i say my father's eighty
he's really active
you wouldn't believe what he does
as the years go on the tow trucks got better more easier
he went out and bought himself a flat bed one
he won't have to do very much work
someone like that i really don't want to see them go in a home
he always replaces them
over the past thirty years i've had about seven or eight different dogs all the time
it's like
it's
the old dies
the young one goes for a while
he gets another one
i can't see him without his animals
when you get on in your years it's the only thing you really have
i'm thinking when i get older i think if brought all my precious belongings with me i think i could live in a home
i don't want to be selfish a burden on anyone
i'm saying that when i get older i could probably make the best of this place
of course it's institutional food
everybody hates it
it's so ironic is that they go in there and they lose weight
it's a bad thing
when they go into the homes they lose weight and because of the institutional food
my taste buds are pretty flexible
here they're always used to these old fashioned foods
now they're feeding them quiche and all kinds of strange food that we would eat
that's the thing my grandmother really misses really growls about
just put me out to pasture shoot me or something
i tell her no problem mom always got a place for you
i know if people would think ahead of time and do things like that like build the in-law apartment and have it on one floor and really easy access
that's what i'm telling my father now
i says now is the time redo your whole bathroom
you can get in and out
the books i read are business related
i've got a small company on the side that i do things with
a lot of the reading that i do has to do with how can i do better at my small-time business important issues such as a
taxes and
that sounds fun
i've got a small distributorship
i sell a healthy cookie on the side
i have a few health food stores that i send it to
i can get a deal from the supplier
that's interesting
i distributed them
i can sell them at a cheaper price
plus i've got a drinking water system business that i've had on the side for years that i've done
that sounds interesting
i'm not really into it
i don't know that much about it
that's interesting
personally i like mostly
if i had a book of my choice i go to the library a lot
it seems like i always i never go to the fiction section
that to me is just ridiculous
i always get books like
i'm not into quilting
i check a lot of books out to learn how
i like to can and do food preservation
mostly canning just for fun to go pick the things and just to have fun doing it and to give them as gifts and stuff
i like to check books out like that
i always come away with
i enjoy reading books about
that's just where my heart is
i read a lot of books on that
christian books written by people to help you out and stuff
i read the bible
i think i would always think that no matter what i did
i do enjoy reading that
he likes to run down the street with it
you can probably hear him
do you enjoy reading anything like that
i haven't really read anything like that in years
i had my own garden
i did canning all those kind of things
that was when i was about ten years younger
i had
ten years younger
that's funny
the problem that i've had in the past with my children growing up and moving out of the house and still having three left at home
i've tried to devote more time to them and trying to get them interested in reading more and spending more time at the library
with my daughter and with my son they both have different interests in books
they do read them
maureen solomon i a friend of mine has a book by her right now called foods that heal
you can take your vitamins
she was telling me to take zinc
there's a couple called
i'm going to forgot his name now dirkson
there's a book called life extensions
there's also a book called the life extension companion
dirk pearson and
it's a couple
i've seen them on t v
they are pretty down to earth about
life extensions
on johnny carson show i was pretty impressed
before he started out on his experiments he had a battery of tests done on his body to determine the age of each one of his organs based on how well it was performing
he embarked on this vitamin treatment
every year he had the same tests run
at the age of thirty-two i think it was his heart was that of a fourteen year old all the rest of his organs were all tested out greatly below his actual age
of course sally isn't a very big woman
she appeared to me to be very petite
she took a horse shoe and turned it into an s
it was all from taking the right vitamins and things that give you the strength
of course doing isometric exercises together they both exercised about five minutes a day
doing isometrics rather than physical strenuous exercises
it's grown on good soil hardly anymore
i know my husband's uncle owns some acreage in eastland texas which is in west texas
owns he owns a lot of acreage that's been farmed properly we get black-eyed peas off of it and stuff
i know that the further we go from adam the worse the food is for you
god still somehow makes us all be able to still live
the last couple of processed foods
None
i like to
None
i guess i'm going to have to wait for the millennium i think though because i don't think we're going to restore the earth to
i think
in the meantime we pray over our food because i'm always looking down my plate
i think this stuff was probably grown in who knows what kind of environment
i do take some vitamins on the side
i do like reading books like that i have a hard time a lot of the books are real new age oriented like mother earth
we're going to restore the earth
i think to think that is almost
i think god's in charge
god's going to restore it when he wants to
sometimes i get bogged down
there's a balance in it sometimes i read stuff like that
i just chunk off like water off your back some of it
try and do what i can do out of it that's practical
i've read a lot of things since i got involved in the water business back in eighty-three
it's amazing that the legislation they have for food that doesn't apply to water
they don't consider water a food the basics premise is that if water was a food they wouldn't be able to sell it to you through your pipes because it's toxic
yet their saying we're putting such low doses in there that
the problem is that i've read books that
have proven that
if you look at the history of hear attacks heart attacks were nonexistent prior to nineteen twenty heart
we started doing large quantities of chlorination of water starting around where we experimented with it in nineteen oh three and nineteen thirteen
i bet that's why we have some friends that eat only
it's going to be good
i had a friend that read a book on that
i've
you probably read back to eden or something
the
they drilled a well i don't know how many feet
it's three or four times deeper than it needed to be
their water comes out
they live kind of in the planes go right over from d f w
it's not real developed
they have
they drilled this well
the water comes out at thirty-two degrees
would that be healthier to do that to drill your own fresh water well like that
it depends a lot of things were thought
the farmers thought we got chemicals we're putting chemicals on the field
the ground will naturally filter out the
what kind of house do you live in
we live in a one story just like a style home the standard texas fox and jacobs
with a yard and fence
are you in a apartment or a home
i'm in an apartment in plano
they say those are difficult to find
they are if
it's hard for me to tell because i haven't rented in probably twenty twenty-five years just
what's a one bedroom
are you in a plano
most complexes in plano are pretty nice
you're probably in a
they vary from place to place
it's hard to tell how well they've been kept up how old they are
these are probably one of the nicest that i found
they're almost five hundred a month for a one bedroom place
that does get high
it does considering that house payments are
our mortgage is between depending on
it drops
seems like in the last six months we got lucky
we refinanced
it was like eight hundred and something
it went down to like seven hundred and twenty that's really not
that's a lot for a townhouse
they're near plano in north dallas too
i couldn't believe it
None
that's what happens when you get up in this area you got all these companies are up here
these i guess they know they're going to get it
i think that nobody was really buying houses there for a long time there because of just
we've been in ours for about ten years
there's no investment in it
all it allows you to do is itemize
you just take off your mortgage interest that's about it
on your taxes yeah
i've owned several built several
you know what it's like
it's not
it's not that exciting after a while
we lived out of state for a while and came back
we lived in a smaller city
now we say dallas really is big and polluted
i can remember coming to work from
i used to live in wylie i could see downtown dallas
now there's this brown haze over it
it's moving north
it's really sad because they're not doing anything
we're getting off the subject i guess
just like with housing they're not doing anything about pollution
i used to think that dallas was better than houston because their zoning for where you can put a house next to a
we've got some investment in it
you really don't get anything out of it
you said you were out of state for a while was that a smaller town than dallas area
the prices a lot better because pittsburgh is about the size like a louisville or minneapolis that type of size
the prices what you get here for about a hundred thousand you could get there for about seventy-five eighty
we didn't think it was that clean
after you're gone for a while
yeah a lot of these people that i've talked to that are coming down from what i call the back east especially from j c penney are selling two and three hundred thousand dollar houses up there and buying a hundred and fifty hundred and seventy-five thousand dollar houses down here
they've wound up getting better houses here than they had there in a way i guess it works both ways
here i guess it depends on what you want
here i got a lot of people that work for j c penney in marketing a lot of the people that came from that area probably like what you're talking about they had a lot of property but not a lot of house
now they have a lot of house and hardly any yardage around it they love it
they think they're getting
you say sun room to them and you enclose and you can sell it
they don't have to worry about yard upkeep if they don't hardly have any
a lot of them i know a couple women that work there
they don't miss in public relations
they don't miss having a basement to run up and down to
not too many basements in texas
i said you haven't heard about tornados
how about those
i remember when i was little we didn't have a
i grew up in southern oklahoma people across the street had a cellar
we never did
it's just like dallas area it was tornado alley up there
every spring mom would drag me up at three o'clock four o'clock in the morning and pajamas and teddy bear across the street
we'd go into the cellar
i to this day i don't care if i go or not
if it's going to get me it's get me
that's exactly
we used to call the basements actual cellars
it's funny to hear that word because i never hear it
it's like the back porch used to be a stoop the housing is just
i don't know if we're going to stay here or not depends
None
when we were up north
some family things changed
we ended up come back down here and all that because it helped my husband's work
we really would like to
we don't know if we're going to do it unless we stay here
with t i it's like anybody else you never know how long you're going to be in one place
the economy any more
i think everybody just lives under an umbrella the uncertainty with housing and everything
it's
how do you handle
you got
how do we take care of the house
i don't have a mexi-
i shouldn't say that
they have like a four thousand square foot home
she's got a live out nanny
any rate i don't have any of that
it's really not too difficult with no children and just two people
we're pretty
we're not fanatically neat
we keep things up not like where there is three feet of weeds or anything in the yard by the time you need to get around to fertilizing and cutting in the spring
we're pretty much
you too
we've been around long enough as a couple that we learned a long time ago not to wall paper together
we pretty much hire
we subcontract mostly everything other than anything that's not a
i know how to fix a running toilet he does what he needs to
mostly if it's something major cleaning out the air conditioning ducts or something like that we just hire out to do that
you sound like you may have been a couple one time
how'd that go
the building process was a lot of fun puts a lot of strain on things
i also think that once you get to be certain
i think people that own homes a lot in north dallas are very materialistic
you bet
the people that own them are the homes themselves
spending sixteen dollars a yard for custom draperies for custom drapes just doesn't
to some of them i guess it doesn't matter that maybe they've got enough coming in to take care of it
you see a lot of these people that came west from new york with exxon or j c penney
it's just a hoot to watch them
are they
they've got it made
was it hard to adjust living in an apartment after being in a house
you're confined by space
i had a
my goodness yeah
i had room for everything
i don't know just seems like stuff always expands to fill available space
in a way you can travel light
you lear- you adjust you figure out
how is apartment dwelling living in terms of general privacy and noise and things like that
there seems to be more a mature crowd in apartments at least where i am even though there's kids all around
there's traffic
there's people running up and down the sidewalks and stuff like that
still
everybody pretty much keeps to their own turf so to speak
there's never really any
i remember in school
seem like there was a fight or a party or something going on every night you don't run into that up here i think because there's so many professional people if you want to call them that that go spend all day at work
they want to come home
they want some quiet
they're doing this and that
they're trying to unwind
it's gotten so big it's almost a town in it's own right
we paid about seventy-eight nine for our house like i said about a decade ago not even about nine years ago
i'd say they appraised it
gone up maybe like five percent it's an investment
it's something that
when you're first married or starting out you think if you really have something
you really
you bet
the thing that gets me is you never really catch up you never really finish doing things
you're always paying for something
we had i called them prefabs just a tract home
we had one of their homes that was nicer in pennsylvania
it was an older home
you buy an older home and you're always fixing things up
you are constantly
None
tell me about changes from say twenty years ago since you were an adult twenty years ago
let's see we assume i was an adult twenty years ago
you're able to vote and go to war and things like that
that's right
nineteen seventy i had been married two years
we had all the great civil rights legislation of nineteen sixty-eight
around here on the east coast
that was a great shock for a lot of people
i was gainfully employed by safeway stores incorporated
and trying desperately to get ahead with the company
the problem was that my hair was too long
you weren't allowed to have a mustache or a beard
jeans just flat out weren't allowed
if you were a black female you were destined to be store manager in six to nine months
that's basically where i ended up
i just flat out couldn't get ahead with the company because they were dead in affirmative action
on other fronts
is the company now well represented demographically at the higher echelons
i stopped working for them in seventy-eight seventy-nine
i think they're like all companies well represented
everything seems to be fine
i've kind of lost touch with the company
as far as their management goes i'm not sure they're any better off than they were before management wise
other changes just people seem to be more outspoken now individually rather than collectively
back in the seventies we had a lot of protests against the war and bring our troops home
things were more organized
i've noticed that now more and more individual people are speaking out for their own rights rather than massing together
less you think now there's less of a social movement and lots of individual movements
i'm not sure if that was because eighties was the me decade
everybody was into me
we are getting back into us
it's
i've seen a great deal of change as far as corporate responsibility and things
people's response to that at first not trusting and now expecting more
what about the last ten years that you've been aware
that i've been aware of i've
half generation off i guess
i've noticed a certain increase pessimism with america no longer being sort of on top
it was right around that time when i started becoming a socially conscious adult
i realize that people of my age have no major success in the sense that you saw the passage of the civil rights act and major social change in that sense
all the changes that have happened in the last even during my adulthood have been more incremental
there hasn't been the same sort of fiery speeches of martin luther king or whatever that has really galvanized the population
there's just
instead there's been sort of an increasing i don't know japan bashing and things like that
a lot of
i see among some of my friends and even more among some of my students who are maybe twenty a real sense of america's losing it
losing it in the competitive market
a real knowl-
our former enemies and things like that
i see a lot of pessimism growing
at the same time i think there's a growing environmentalist movement and sense of corporate respon- increased corporate responsible towards environmental safety and things like that
that might potentially be sort of the civil right the equivalent of the civil rights act in the near future in terms of some real landmark bills passing and things like that
such that people
my generation can't rest on the glow of having achieved civil rights because we were born into an assumption that there's still some racism
basically things are
there's a notion of fairness
even i think along the line of the goals of civil rights
there always seems to be some prejudice to someone by anyone
of course
None
don't like the way you look don't like the way you dress don't like your hair don't like it's just something that always sets people off
you like someone you don't like someone you're just completely indifferent
the problem is that ideally the world would like you to be completely indifferent
i understand what you say about the environmental movement
it's been a long time coming
being a a very old hippie
if you had long hair in high school in the sixties you got labeled a hippie
you keep that image your whole life
i just
i've seen a lot of changes from the original earth day i'm heavily involved in my own personal recycling
i do the newspaper and cardboard and paper and
all that stuff at home
i'm starting to see more and more recycling centers
that's a real change except it sort of brings back to the nineteen forties more than anything else
all this recycling used to be in tact
much of it did
recycling was a wartime thing
they turned around and called them junkyards and
now we got to the point where the junkyards you've got to pay them to take something there
things have really changed a lot
i think the other part about america's decline i think has to do with
the perceived decline has to do with the attitudes and the educational system
i have three children in school right now
i'm not impressed with the teachers that are teaching them
i had
when i was down in dallas for two years i had my children come home from school with papers that were corrected by the teacher that had words spelled correctly marked wrong
this person's teaching my children
i had a real problem with that
i'd say as someone who's involved in education i'd say that maybe one of the changes is that the role of the teacher has incrementally gotten lower and lower value and society
relative pay which is a major way we value people has been poorer and poorer over the years
that
not quite in proportion to cost of living
it's just more and more a real low income sort of job and very low prestige
there's that old saying those who can do it and those who can't teach
if you have that kind of social attitude it's hard to get sufficient numbers of people who are going to overlook all of that work for lower pay work for low social prestige just because they care about good education
you get more and more people and up there because it's the safety net of those of average intelligence or something they can always teach
i'm not sure if your familiar with the movement they have here in maryland
they're trying to get a merit system here in maryland rather than a tenure system
for all the elementary middle school and high schools
jan how do they recycle in texas
they've just got different barrels
they've got them set outside
is it all voluntary
they do have some places where you can take things and get cash
they just want to help recycle which is
what we do
probably the only thing sometimes we'll take the cans in
we let the kids get the money for that
a lot of projects where the boy scouts and things that will
that's really the biggest thing around here is the grocery stores participating
None
i guess it depends on your landfill space
my parents are forced recycling
all plastic has to go into a recycling bin all cans have to be recycled all newspapers has to be recycled
because
pennsylvania ohio and new york are some of the
it's really hard on them
up here in maryland though we're just in a voluntary recycling stage right now
my wife and i we save our bottles
we save our newspapers
we save all our plastic and all of our tin cans
just like you say we go to a community area where they have it set up
we dump them off
it's vol-
though i think we're supposed to have something implemented by nineteen ninety-three though where some aspects will be mandatory
is it all
is it all
most of the time like i said that's a sort of fund raiser things that
they do have places around here where you can get money for your newspapers
i think a lot of people like i said are more concerned
with right now the aspects of saving the earth
we
as soon as the community said we're going to put up bins for recycling we automatically started
it's one of those things
just going and taking the time to go and read the signs and the brochures on what they accept and how it should be
separated
i tell you it's kind of funny now even at t i i don't
at t i they're doing recycling
for a long time they didn't do this
now they're recycling cans and paper
we have separate bins separate wastebaskets
they
it's tremendous how much money they have saved and even saving all these trees
it's really
how well they're doing
at a college
we do basically the same thing
the state of maryland has asked all the colleges and universities and some of the large organizations if they would definitely recycle their office paper
the same thing almost every college in maryland is recycling office paper
in the giant bins around
it's surprising how much you never realize because that janitor comes around and empties your garbage
they don't pick up your recycling until
you just can't believe how much paper that you
you think about
cost wise and saving trees and stuff like
it's just amazing
i think
i guess a lot of the large organizations
that doesn't mean that they don't
i haven't really seen anything advertise publicly
and like i said they do a lot of internal
i haven't seen anything
i don't see a lot of t i advertisements on t v anyway
i think they advertise more other places where they're not located
i don't see a lot of advertisements for t i
i know that some of the large industries here will advertise on television
they'll come up and say
they'll show you
here those of us that dumavra power which is our power company
i think we're probably reaching a successful stage and just with voluntary
even in the kid's schools
they do things to try and recycle
i know my kids if they see litter on the ground they pick it up and say look at that somebody is not saving the earth
the kids they really try to educate all ages
it's good to start the kids real young on
because when i was a kid they never did stuff like that
it's like nobody was concerned about it
it's like
it's like all of a sudden when there's noticeable things saying
now everybody is doing something about which is good
i think really probably what hit peoples i know that here up in the
they're saying we estimate this landfill be ov- will be full in two years unless we cut back
even then we're really running out of space
i think that that became
no other state
they're not going to voluntarily say ship your garbage here
None
realistically we have to start recycling in some geographic areas
that it really surprises me because of the cost savings
this is such a tremendous
why
i even the aspects of not saving the earth
so cost
in some ways i guess it doesn't become really cost saving until you have an industry around it because
i know that in
to take the ink out of the newspaper so it can be reused is very expensive
also it produces a
even some aspects of recycling they still have cost efficient yet
others like tin cans and plastics
are really efficient
they melt on quickly just because of the
i noticed that a lot of gas stations are telling you to recycle your oil
that kind of surprises me
because once oil gets so thick and yucky you'd wonder how they could clean that up
they can
i don't know how cost efficient that would be i guess
i don't know either
i know that though all those petroleum products though are so terrible for
they really pollute quickly
one
i was reading some place the brake fluid normally comes in just small little pint containers
like hundreds of gallons of water
it's one of those things that they really
how terrible that is
we'll have to keep our eyes on all that i guess
i think that they really are doing a good thing now
i hope it keeps
i'm sure we'll keep up
i think that
because we were asking some people that live in north dakota
they said we're not forced to do it yet
i don't know
i think that if the people are not forced to do it they may not
i don't know
if they're forced to do it
i know that it's really funny
i personally don't have any problem with drug testing employees or potential employees do you
basically
i
the policy that t i has i think is very fair
they first had a policy where they would test new employees
since i've been with them the last four years there's been in the last year year and a half they're doing random testing of all employees
junkins all the way down
it is
from what i understand it is jerry junkins all the way down
the program was still fairly new
i was not ever called upon to do a drug test
i think random is probably the only really fair way to do it
i like it because
i grew up in the sixties
i saw
i know my friends who were druggies and
i think it's a real problem
i think it's causing us a lot of trouble and a lot of problems
i'm hoping that a lot of other companies will follow the same path
probably not
especially if they have anything do with government contracts or anything
as matter of fact i want to believe that the defense department more or less mandated that people who work on defense contracts
do some sort of drug testing
i was in the defense electronic division when i retired
i know it was a real hot hot item there
i want to think maybe they really got some nudging from d o d to do this sort of thing
a p d as a matter of fact
you know the atmosphere then
i really like the idea
in fact i would like to see a lot more people adopt it
like school systems and that kind of thing
i'd like to know that my child's being taught by a teacher who's not on drugs or who might be at a point where they're trying to sell my kid drugs
i just can't disagree with you with the basic premise
as far as i know it's seems to be a fairly accurate program as far as the testing goes
i like the idea that they have a system where they allow you to be retested if for
offer you help if you need help
rather than just put you out on the street and let you fend for yourself
i believe it is a medical problem
of course i also think smoking is the most addictive thing in the world too
there's a lot of things out there
things that
i'm just glad that they decided not to tax drugs otherwise they'd be legal
they'd be getting tax money off it the same way
it's a real problem
and stuff
i moved to a t i facility that had never had random drug sampling before
it was an industrial company that t i purchased
the people here a lot of them are real opposed to it
they were really opposed to it
there was a few of them that obviously were doing drugs
that's why they were opposed to it
it resulted in a few people leaving
because they just flat out weren't going to put up with the policy
they had a life-style
they weren't going to change it
at least began was in the talking sta-
everybody knew it was coming
it just a matter of time everybody was screaming invasion of privacy and all this stuff
a lot of people i think after they thought about it for awhile weighed the pros and cons decided it's really not a bad idea unless you're doing drugs of course
you should have no objection to it
it's like going down to get your license and checking your eyes
why do i need my eyes checked
you know it's
so you don't kill people on the road
it's a ba-
it's the basic premise with
drug testing
especially some of the jobs
it's very little that anyone could do in the engineering sector as far as hurting someone
in the manufacturing sectors and over in semiconductor
if i'd want somebody down there that i'm working with side by side that could kill me
there's a lot of sectors where i think that would would help out
i think in the long run we all benefit
if you have
if you're not working with someone on drugs then you're going to have less accidents
you have less accidents
you spend less money on medical
you spend less money on medical then the company's more profitable
it
it goes around
to everywhere
trickles up and down
i just hope that more and more companies get on the ball
and start it up
if they
a lot of companies are coming down in price
i think that the insurance companies are starting to give benefits
reduction in medical costs if they
i think everybody will benefit from the program
i think if a lot more insurance companies get on the bandwagon and say
if you impose
twenty per cent
of course the company's not going to reduce the employee's cost of insurance twenty per cent they're going to reduce their own
it'll save in some areas
that'll cover it
maybe some insurance companies might start offering it as part of the package
that's a very very very competitive business
i think all around it's going to help out a lot
it's nice to talk to you
you take care
the topic is vacations
that's a good topic
the last was back down to lubbock to visit parents
that's not the tradition for us
what's your out of the state type
we enjoyed yellow stone real well last year
what kind of vacation spots are there in colorado
rocky mountain national park
it's just like any of the other national parks
there's camping and fishing and hiking and wildlife watching
we went to colorado springs and rocky mountain national park
we usually try and drive up there once every year or two
that's tough
i don't think i could do that
it's not bad at all
it's a beautiful drive
i admit up there the altitude is kind of
you get a little lightheaded and giddy
it's fun take along a picnic lunch
we love it
they're only to the west of us
it's right there at the very foot of the rockies
once a week we drive up into the mountains usually once a week once every other week
i enjoy hills in texas too
have you ever been out of the united states for vacation
once to mexico city
just a little day thing on business
i went to the bahamas last year on a cruise for my honeymoon
that's nice
i had never been out of texas or out of indiana much out of the united states
got to eat some different kinds of foods and meet people from a different culture
in fact one family that
they had never been to the united states
they were really enjoying it
they were telling us about all their trips
it was neat to meet different people
the place that we've gone on vacation that i think i enjoyed the most
we
somehow we picked the right time and walked down on the wharf
i think we ate seafood every meal for not quite every meal but most meals for a week
it was wonderful
the pacific science museum the little girl really enjoyed
it was super
went to the seattle aquarium
it's right there on the ocean and
you walk down in a dome a glass dome
the bay is circulating over your head
you can watch the fish swim by and sharks
it's
there's walrus and sea lion and porpoises it's amazing
that's the vacation you recommend
the mountains to the east of seattle
up there
you drive your car on
you have a beer
your car is on a ferry
it goes across with you
there are people literally that everyday take the ferry and drive
live on an island off shore from seattle
you
take for the twenty to hour and ten minutes that it takes to get across and depending on where it is
None
in some areas depends on how far they are commuting
it's strict
i'm a west texan
to think that people live on the water daily is kind of odd to me
it's a different life style than we are used to
i haven't really seen much
what are some good things in texas to go visit
it's a bird sanctuary
it's very pretty
i like the rio grande valley
of course you haven't lived until you have been to san antone to the alamo
you need to go in the spring when all the flowers are in bloom all up and down through there
it's just simply beautiful
of course always when i lived in west texas had to annually go down to san antone just
go to lone star
make my annual pilgrimage to the lone star brewery
el paso is kind of neat in kind of a funny way
go across the border and all
the davis mountains are interesting
the right time of year to go there is in the middle of winter
whenever you've been kind of cold where you are at it's most enjoyable
to get warm
down there in the lower rio grande valley closer to where the rio grande empties into the gulf that's interesting
austin is neat for an occasional visit
it's a fun few days
u t is real pretty
there's a lot of little limestone lakes and caverns around that area marble falls and all
i'd say go to midland once just for the heck of it
i don't know why
find out when they are holding
currently i'm not doing a whole lot of exercise in any type of program
the best thing we found to do with him is to walk around
my wife and i kind of take turns
in the last couple of months i've changed to a new residence and everything has gotten kind of turned a little upside down
what did you do when you did exercise regularly
i had a little routine that i did for warm ups
i did some very mild light weight lifting
i try to
i like to cycle a lot
my husband and i we have entered a few rallies that's pretty popular in texas
every weekend a small town will sponsor a rally
thousands of people come with their bikes and ride over hilly terrain for thirty or forty miles which that's a lot of fun
we try to ride during the week to try and stay in shape for that
t i where i work has a fitness center
a lot of time after work or maybe on the weekends we'd go over there and lift weights and do the tread mill
they have stair masters and all kinds of new machine that are fun to ride and workout on
i try to
i used to get into it and get out of it based on my schedule
i'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis now
it's a big commitment
that's a part of it
i have a total of five children
they do take up a big part of my evening and weekend
it's tough being a parent and doing all the things that you should do for yourself too
that's why at t i they really stress staying in shape stay in overall fitness no smoking and all that
it's hard to find an actual exercise regimen that work for you because i know a lot of people that cycle they take their kids behind them on the bikes
i don't know if that would work for me because i don't know i wouldn't want to pull a kid over hilly terrain
it's really hard to find something that works and to find time to do it and stay committed to it three days a week or whatever
you can use what ever rationale you want
basically the healthier you stay the longer you'll live
if i spend a little bit of time each day or a little bit of time every other day doing something for me to make me live longer then i'll around a lot longer
those people that i'm taking the ten minutes or twenty minutes away from now get the enjoyment of me years past where i would have been if i wouldn't have taken it
i've been learning a lot lately about
i don't know if you're familiar with him he was the pioneer of aerobics and all of health
he's pretty much the innovator of the whole exercise thing
he was talking about the three things that cause aging smoking are inactivity
what was the other one i think was obesity
if you can control those three areas then are you going to live longer cause those are risk factors
i've done a lot of study over the years
i found that probably one of the worst things that anybody can ingest is chlorinated water
the research that i've done
i've actually been in the drinking watering business since eighty-three
it's amazing that prior to nineteen-twenty there were very few heart attacks
in nineteen-three they started experimenting with chlorinating the water in nineteen-thirteen most of the major cities
after that we started having the hearts attacks
dr price wrote a book coronary cholesterol and chlorine
dr price
it's amazing
it's a very small book
the guys very opinionated
he makes a very good case against chlorine
he points out that people in england
even diets that quadrupled the amount of cholesterol that we're ingesting now
they weren't dropping dead of heart attacks
and proved that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis which is the
he's
now they're saying what's cholesterol
there's good cholesterol and there's bad cholesterol
it's amazing what he points out in that book
in fact everyone there was a toxicologist for the environmental protection agency who did work back in nineteen eighty-six who wrote a letter to dr price in nineteen eighty-seven in this letter he praised dr price for the work he did back in the sixties on this and said that e p a had been doing experiments on nonhuman primates and proving that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis
e p a never published that report
what's the name of this book again
he's really interested in the heart
in fact he's a heart too
he's done a lot of research on how your heart reacts to exercise
None
there is a lot of good information out there about health
a lot of the myths they've been passing around people are starting to realize aren't true
i'm all for having a diet high in fiber and all that because that's good for you
to believe some of the things
i don't think anybody should be going out there and eating a high fat diet
to think that solely alone is going to cause something like arteriosclerosis is just hard to believe
he talks about that
i've had my cholesterol checked a few times
i've never been above one-hundred and fifty
i
what they tell me
everything is within five to ten percent and all that kind of thing
they leave themselves wide open so they can't be sued
we've
we've had a few of the health fairs up here
i've always come out aces
i'm not really that big on watching what i eat
i do eat some health cookies that are high in fiber
i mean as far as really being concerned about ingesting too much chlorine i'm not worried about it
okay do you like to cook
i love to cook as a matter of fact i'm making dinner right now
i'm making some
i have a little turkey left from a passover which was in april
i had frozen it
i'm defrosting that and making some dressing and gravy and making corn and wheat stuff that you can buy at a store which is like rice pilaf
with wheat kernel that
do you cook
are you single do you cook every night for yourself
i'm married
the
this isn't for her
this is for our friends that came over and helped me do some stuff
she's having
i do cook virtually
if you were having a dinner party what would you cook a variety of things vegetarian and nonvegetarian
we consistently
if we have a dinner party we usually make it vegetarian just to make life easier
we'll make some sort of pasta or something
homemade pasta or lasagna or something
that's something that's really easy
that is what i'm having is pasta
good idea
for christmas i got a pasta machine
all my friends are really anxious to have the homemade noodles
electric or
that's
we bought one in italy
i kind of still having in put that not everything's being done for me
yeah
that's what i'm going to be cooking
pasta salad first
just something for desert bread and wine and cheese stuff like that
that it's a lot of fun
a lot of people think though that i've talked to about it think that it's a lot of hard work
i said
it actually is if you have a food processor
it turns out that if you really want to be nice and easy about it you can make the dough in the food processor really simply
with that it becomes really easy to make colorful pasta
what other kinds of dinner parties
i don't entertain that often
when i do though i have some friends that i always
i see a recipe and think i'd really like to try this cause i'm single
i live by myself
it's not necessarily something that i would cook just for myself
i'll say you guys are experimental i want say how this is going to turn out
usually i'm pretty good about it
i have this really good recipe for this pork chop and apple casserole kind of thing
you put stuffing and put poached apples and everything
my girlfriend and her husband loved it
i was quite impressed with myself if i should say so
i'm the kind of cook that i don't normally measure things
i don't to the point of measuring down to the exact amount that they say
if you've ever watched the ones on television like jeff schmidt the super gourmet
he just takes stuff he says about an ounce of this
we do middle eastern dinner quite a bit
we have people other that have never experienced it before and haven't had much middle eastern food
we make cause we're my wife is syrian
her families always have this food she grew up in
i've made some of it before as well
we make four or five middle eastern dishes that are just all real simple
that's always a real big kick for people who've never tried it before
that's a fun idea if you ever want something different to try
i've been wanting to take an oriental cooking class
i just haven't gotten around to it yet
do you have a wok though
i'd like to know more about more elaborate things like guess
it's easy
the food just comes out
if you do it right i think the food comes out very tasty not very mushy
it doesn't taste like a million calories of oil
we live in our wok
we like to eat even when we eat out stuff we eat a lot of chinese food
or japanese food or
that seems to
wok food seems to be our thing
anything else you cook
i just kind of cook here cook there
i'm always willing to try anything usually
that's good
i think it's
i especially like baking and making deserts
the wilson course
it was a private course
through a com-
it's neat it takes a long time
i'm elected to always bring cakes into work
it's like you bake the cakes
i guess just because i don't have the expertise to just hurry up and do it
like a professional would i go real slow
it's a little time consuming
it's really worth your effort once you see how you do
we have
he's got a degree in business management
he learned how to do this
he does that a lot
he cooks a lot
he bakes a lot whenever he
when my wife and i got married the night before we had a party
he made a real big cake himself
new years our friend made a baby
i get the mold i put it on the frosting always melts
it's just horrible
you learn helpful hints in the classes at least
the instructor told us certain things about don't follow what's really necessarily on the box if you're making just a cake from a box do this cause make it a variety
that you mean about the
yeah
that helps
some different hints the different kinds of frostings you can make
i have a book an it
all of the different decorating tips an things like that
most frostings are sort of butter cream to aren't they
those kill me
it's like i'm eating sugar
they're good sugar
that's about it
it was a pleasure chatting with you
have a good time cooking for your dinner party next week
i've had time to think about it because we've had
okay
i was thinking about a couple things and whether they are serious
some aren't
i guess the biggest thing that bothers me is not the biggest thing
one of the things that bothers me is the credit information situation
that you find yourself almost compromised into giving if you want any sort of credit
extensive checks and things of that nature
i don't know if that's an invasion of privacy simply i do feel it is
i don't know whether
some of the questions they ask are legitimate because they are the ones who are making the profit out of your
what's scary is about two three four months ago in the sunday edition of what is called the morning paper here the dallas morning news
they showed a reporter and a copy editor how they went out
they just took a fellow in john q public in dallas
all they had was
let's see they had something like his birth date the street address
they weren't even sure of the correct spelling of his last name
it was very scary to see what they found out
they were able to find out what liens he still had against two or three houses through two divorces children's names locations
it was really frightening
i guess then it's just the big brother concept of the fact
that once you give your social security number there are people i guess who are actually collecting all this all the time
profiles are given
i understand
i read the other day that these telemarketeers when someone talks to you on the phone all they need now is your telephone number which i guess is involved in this controversy of whether they can reveal your telephone number or not
i feel that is an invasion of privacy
the other thing i don't like is in terms of
we just moved here from minneapolis
to get the very nice townhouse that we're in
husband and wife owners who had never done this before
they asked us for again an astounding amount of information
what we really didn't have the same opportunity
i guess that's when i also get upset that if you're going to do it then i want to do it too
in terms of the credit
i know we're also going through adoption now
after we gave our fingerprints to the f b i
look at each other you look at each other and say
it's a matter of anybody can get it any way and how if they really try
i have a particular subject that not everyone agrees with me b-
i make my living by flying airplanes for a company
as an airline pilot i have to take random drug testing
it seems to me the public outcry was for that at the time
when i finish a certain flight on a random basis i have to
have a drug test
that's without probably cause
a-
in the end now they've spent forty million dollars
they've found i think in pilots anyway of something like eighty-six thousand tests there's only been three guys have come up positive
one of them was a bad test
i just started working for an electronics firm down here
now i'm in corporate communications
part of that
i had never been asked that
i thought i really didn't like it
i have very mixed feelings about it
i think that it's well
you're in that field
i don't know
we lived in minneapolis when the northwest airlines pilot in the dakotas
that hit the fan like
you're obviously aware of that
if they're going to do random
i don't agree with random
in terms of maybe at set intervals so that everybody knows what's going on
i don't see a problem with that
i do think i see some level of necessity
the reason i feel that way even to a low degree is because it's the old story the minority make it bad for the majority
i can understand the public's alarm to it
i guess having done this all my life i knew that there wasn't a problem
indeed it has proved out that way
now try to get the damn thing repealed
i know it's
not only that
in some of the instances you just cited where you have to give your fingerprints what happens if you say no
that's exactly what it is
that kind of screening in general is a matter of exclusion
if we didn't give it we wouldn't go to romania
if
that's the way it is
it's my feeling also that although
i don't know if it's that serious
that was part of the question
i do feel the courts have held up a great deal of our privacy particularly look in some of the
i notice in some of the sexual cases they've held up a great deal of privacy
it i guess with our fear with crime and maybe airline crashes and things like that it does seem that we've slipped and that's eroded
at least those in the market place their everyday life seemed to take that as a signal that it's fair game
you have to answer these questions of course
i don't know
i feel there has been an erosion
i don't really know how serious it is except i don't like it
also i agree with that
in terms of the question in terms
that was pre-aids and all the other things
i have a real problem with medical professionals
it goes back to the things like drug screening
if it's in any level even with the potential to endangerment
i think this is much stronger than pilots or train engineers being screened
the transmission of the aids virus
i don't have the answer
i think of the young girl in florida who
was she from
the young girl that contracted aids through her dentist allegedly
they proved it
i don't know if it's the old story that we are killing ourselves in general or what
it
just take that step where now we feel there's a need to do that
the next thing you know then
there's always the need to go and inspect lockers of high school students
i guess the question is
the thing for me is who sets the parameters or who has the control
good luck to you
i don't hold out much hope for you
i was based there a lot several times in the service
i was absolutely flabbergasted at the
in at least in criminal law some of the
it's ter-
the things i'm finding out are
it's no better than journalism
except in journalism it's words
this is very frightening in that
in texas they do not require for instance for prospective adoptive parents
let's just say that somebody who's in ne-
somebody who's need of carting aluminum beer cans around
they want to take them to a recycling resource for money or whatever
they've been going through a lot of bad publicity here in the last three or four months again because they've been arresting people like that
i don't understand
if you don't
in our case one is at the state and the other one is at the federal level because you have to deal with the i n
because you have to deal with the imi- immigration service
i see
the state doesn't require it
that's rather unusual isn't it
again there's no consistency
in your
in terms of you being a pilot and being tested randomly i can't see why after a certain number of years or after a certain time frame they can't do it at an interval
None
i guess the extension of that is why not
if we really think that drugs are a problem we can randomly stop anybody on the street
they do that in texas
they do
what they do is they check to see if you've got current insurance
they check to see if you're permits are
there's all sorts of scare tactics i guess to to invade our privacy
it's kind of
to me it's just frightening
the old
way past time
is come and gone
it's here
i
the computers of course helps that
look at what we're talking now
it's
you wonder ultimately what a network of stranger
what kind of music did you all listen to
my goodness
we think of classic rock that they have on all the easy listening stations now as our heart and soul
it was
we were there
then you was in the
i am sorry
i was in seventh grade when the beatles came out
i wanted to go
i guess i was close to eighteen or something
it was like i think the summer between my high school and college somewhere around in there
i kind of would have liked to have been there
we could not get it together to drive
we had never driven outside of
here we were all hep to go to woodstock
that would have been such a great memory
i think of all the social changes that were going on around that time and the sixties as being so revolutionary in a lot of ways in terms of raising people's consciousness everything from
i remember we had the first earth day back then
we got out of school at the university
we celebrated earth day
we did not realize the implications of all that then
to me it doesn't seem like we have got much
you do
there was no name to it
you had to fight for racial equality
i do remember demonstrations over busing
busing themsel-
it was just a continuum
everything sort of had a seed in the sixties
women's rights things for women were totally different for you by that time
by the time i was born even now women's rights
i saw something on t v last night on twenty-twenty
men's fathers or daddies
wait a minute
it is about a lot of men going through divorces
the judge will usually give custody to the mother ninety-seven percent of the time because they go through the female
we learned from kramer versus kramer didn't we
it does seem
men are coming into their own now too
they are
i thought now men have to fight to be equal
i think that is only right though
one guy said the judge looked at him and said mister so and so he says i have never seen calves follow a bull
he said that is why i always give custody to the mama
he said does that mean you are going to shoot them if they break a leg and
butcher them if they get fat
that is the way most people feel that women should get custody
are you married
do you have children
i have got two kids
how does your husband respond to all the new
social changes
bless his heart
flared pants he
i do not like them
to him
he is his own person
he does stay with it as far as music and stuff goes
he wears what clothes he wants to which we are both that way
my husband is not a conformist at all
that is the spirit of the sixties
whether we are talking about the rain forests
the situation you have right now
all of our generations is what to do with the children because both mother and father have to work now
we are trying to keep away from that
i have got a four month old baby
i do not want to work
that is your commitment
when he grew up he grew up with his
my mom had six kids
she had to work
i was raised by my sisters and stuff
i can't see the difference
i know that it would have been better had mom been able to stay home with us
my husband was the same way
we just
they need guidance
they do need parental guidance twenty-four hours a day
if i had some i would
i have not
i am
it is not going to happen that way
my friends are having babies right and left
i get to see the different ways that they
all raise them
one gal she started a business
she hired an au pair which is a college kid to come in and take care of her two boys while she works in the other end of the house
None
the guy lives in with her
it is a family sort of unit sort of thing
i think that's neat
that is a different way
my other girlfriend just tears her hair out and goes at it twenty-four hours a day watching both kids all the time
i think there is a point where you just have to get away
it is good for the kid
it is good for you to develop your interest so you do not stop growing at the same time
i know the family is really going through changes
now we are trying to go back to about the sixties when the mother was staying at home
do you have any
my family is kentucky
one of my sisters is down here
my husband was in the service when i met him
we've been all over
he is itching
i am keep having to scratch his back
outside of going
that is
that is the sort of the thing of the nineties is women working out of their own home
they are bringing big businesses into their home
i think the more we try to shape that the more input we
have into what that whole system is going to look like because that is our choice now too
that is our cause
i think one that would be
it is
kids could see their parents how hard they work
when we first moved down here i was working
it was three and four days a week
my little boy he went wild mean because he had been used to me being there all the time
he is just now
when i got pregnant i went ahead and quit work and decided just to stay at home
it was costing too much at home i was bringing in
the economic situation on the whole thing
it is
we do have things that we are
i think we have taken a big leap in the last twenty thirty years
nothing is the same
we passed them on to you
you what
it takes a lot of hard work
it takes writing letters to congressmen and just being very very politically astute about how to shape and mold the future
did we make the right choices
i think we made a wrong choice when i look at the children of today
i think business got in the way
i like it just for the noise
do you actually watch it
is it more of a company
i have my favorite things that i do
some fun thing to do sometime
what about you
i work full time
when i am not working i am running
i do not watch a lot of television
i am very selective in what i watch
that's great
None
if i do not find something that i really want or really want to watch then i just do not turn it on
part of it is that i think we need to be very selective about the kinds of things that come to us on a subliminal basis
i think that if we are doing other things and these programs come in sometimes they influence us
we do not know where that influence came from
i think that's partially true too
i think it
you would be susceptible to stuff
of course i
it has to be reinforced at another level too
what would you watch if you had this week to watch
last night for example i really would have liked to have watched unsolved mysteries
i would prefer to find
we have cable also
sometimes you can get the h b o specials
sometimes those are really
some of those are fine programs
i like to watch comedy
that's something
i enjoy comedy
i guess i have my old favorites
i am
hooked on
something on that level
i also enjoy
of thirteen the mclaughlin group
i just laugh
i think that's so hysterical
it's just a lot of fun
i do not agree with a whole lot of the stuff the they say
i also watch it for cultural impact
i watch for special programs that have a special play a special concert
that was fabulous
it was fabulous
that
i was just
i may or may not even look at the t v guide
if i have time i may flip through and say this looks good if i finish this task i can watch that in an hour
there's certain thin-
i have got my t v in the kitchen here
if there's something like cooking shows
i really do
i eat
i get fat
i just let other people watch
there's some
in fact one of the water color shows i know has inspired me to take water color lessons
i think that's
i think
at least i saw a very bad example of having television influence your life
i want you to know that became the most suspicious cantankerous contrary old
she just got to the point where you could almost hear those soaps being echoed in her voice
that's
she was probably depressed to begin with
i do not know
she was grumpy to begin with
you could clearly see those influences
in my youngsters
i know that one day my youngsters were watching the three stooges
i always thought that was just casual slap stick
when one tries to lift the other one up with a pipe wrench i decided that was not funny
i really feel very strong about the bart simpson show
that's absolutely the mouthiest kid i ever saw
i do not like it
i have grandchildren
for a four year old to think bart simpson is a hero is tragic
it's just my husband and i
so i do not have that influence
i don't know
i was very careful even when my kids were at home
when they were young i really did watch what they watched
i watched it
if i did not like it i changed the channel for them
i distracted them changed their interest
we get it at school too
you might as well not
they are mouthy enough anyway
i remember going to sch-
of course
we did not have any of the variety
all the watch rawhide and all those shows
my parents never let me watch anything like that
i could watch yogi bear
i remember going to school the next day
everybody would be asking did you see that
did you see
i could never participate
it always made me feel a little bit a loner
i
then my parents
i did
i said i think that's enough television for awhile
we need to go out and play and enjoy some company
i would go out with them
there's the problem parents do not do that
you go rent a video up at
we went on field trips
we did other things
i think that was
that's something people do not do
here we are talking on that subject
that's an interesting concept
i have got to stick in my
work with kids
i guess the suggestion is that we maybe talk about a menu for a dinner party if we wanted to do something like that or
share recipes or something
i do them
they are a lot of work
i usually have them when
i make a big deal out of it for them
i think i am most happiest with my most
i make my own pies and pie crust
i can make my pies from scratch
that's great
i bake pies too
my mother was always the famous pie baker in the family
i guess after many years of doing it you just
she said make me one
i made her one
when she gave me back the plate she said i did not share this with anybody
she enjoyed it
there is a woman in our choir who is nearly famous for her apple pies
we had
i think i have had it once
it has been a few years ago
i do recall that it was quite good
that is her specialty
i like to bake also
i do enjoy baking
i guess i always liked making cookies and bars and things like that
they seem to last longer than pies around here
they are meant for that evening's
it has got to be gone or daddy gets into the leftovers
he is
it is interesting that
she was telling me that she had a dinner party over the weekend
for
they invited two other couples over
there were seven of them that
i said what did you have
she said what she had just mexican food
she had guacamole
i cannot remember all she had
she also had made flan which is actually spanish i think
it's
it's like an egg custard in a caramelized sugar
it's not very difficult to make
it's very very high in cholesterol i am sure with all the eggs that are in it
she said that she and her husband had traveled in spain a couple years ago
flan is almost a basic with every meal that you get
if you ever run into that
i would never have thought of making that as part of a mexican dinner
sopapillas i guess would be another kind of a dessert if you decided to do something like that
make ahead and have ready
i would have been thinking i would like to have a dinner party sometime soon
i tell you it
it's one of those things where it does require some real planning
it's
you have the house to clean and the whole business that goes with it
when i have a dinner party that is my motivation for getting the
we are catering a wedding in august
this lady that is
she has got to hire this crew
there
she must have found some jewels
we have
until last year i had never had another person clean my house
i had a woman come in once a month
it was not just very often
for me it was wonderful
that is nice to have that
it buys you time to do other things like have a dinner party i guess
it is just a real gift of time as far as i am concerned
i have a pie crust recipe that is unique
i have never tried it
i should say i have heard of one that has vinegar in it
i think it would be too hazy because the
the liquid is like
you mix that together
None
it makes five pie crusts at once
quite large
a tablespoon of salt and a tablespoon of sugar
you combine your dry ingredients
you put in your liquid
what is it about the the vinegar that makes
it just makes it very pliable and very flaky
you are still going to have a flaky pie crust
that's the real secret
it's not mine
it was from one of the magazines probably
it said you can throw this on the floor and step on it
i thought quite a statement for them to make
it makes me think of years ago when i was visiting my mother-in-law in michigan
we just had
according to the owners
talk about working with big amounts of pie crust and having it be tough
i could have used that recipe
we lived in plymouth for four years
in fact we were there from seventy three to seventy seven
how neat
i worked for the weekly newspaper there the plymouth crier
he was born and
are you originally from michigan
some of the books i've read lately have to do with crafty type things where i've learned things that i'm going to do for my children for christmas they were really helpful because i didn't know how to do this one stitching
that was very helpful to me as far as books
otherwise i like to read children's books and things like that
i was an english major
i like to read period
lately i've been on the whole very practical
i'm trying to furnish a home i've been looking at books on antiques and paintings and interior decoration hints and lots of books on plants and gardens because we started a garden and things like that
i've been doing very little reading except i did finally dip into a couple of biographies all of sort of literary figures of this century
my husband and i had took a book out of the library about gardening too and started a garden a fall garden
our cantaloupes and peppers and tomatoes are on right now
it's been really fun
we learned that some of the gardening skills we had were before
some of them we learned from a book that was helpful to us
i've read two books
one was nonfiction and one was fiction
the fiction one was about a boy during the time of adolf hitler he grew up and lived through a concentration camp that was not enjoyment
that was too realistic and really a real eye opener
i guess it's good to read those things too
i didn't enjoy it necessarily the other one was quite enjoyable
it was about a chinese lady and her generations down what happened to her family through the years that one was good
even if they're not enjoyable they bring you some kind of learning
even if it's the country that they're from or anything like that
i like to read the children's books
i like those a lot
what are your favorite children's books
there are a couple of newberry award winners
a wrinkle in time is one i don't know if you've ever read that there's one about an indian girl
i can't think of that
island of the blue dolphins is another that's a good one
some of the ones that have just received the awards this year i haven't read
i would like to read those it's funny because i've read some from like nineteen twenty-three and nineteen forty-five and things like that i didn't enjoy those as much
i don't know if it's just because they didn't come from my era or what
i
you can't be an english major unless you like reading things from the past
i've read a great deal of old things
i tend to go back
i don't have any children i don't read the new ones
i occasionally if no one's looking dip into something like winnie the pooh
or the grimm's fairy tales or something like that just because it's sheer magic
my children and i started a thing where i read a book with them before they went to bed at night
there was one called the pig princess
it was a princess from a long long time ago
she came through a spell kind of thing and ended up in a pig sty
the people that she came to were just farm people she didn't understand them
they didn't understand her
it came together in this book
it was really a lot of fun
i think that we
i'm wondering what camping means to you
when i think of camping i think of bugs
very good
that's sort of the same thing that i do
i don't think of trailers and campers and all this stuff
do you do much camping
you've never been camping
yes and no
the
up until maybe five or six years ago i did a lot of it
i bet
i camped a lot in the middle east i was able to camp right in ruins which was always very exciting
when i used to come back to the states in summer we'd often go up to the lake country in new york with my brother's family and do camping there
my husband and his uncle especially grew up camping together
they just love it
they're planning a trip into canada i guess in about a year
they're going to spend about a week and a half camping up there
you're not going
this is a man's trip
that's too bad
they're really looking forward to that
i was never exposed to it
i feel like i'm a little bit too much of a city mouse to try doing it
that's too bad
i think there's certainly a lot of aspects you would like
maybe not the canada men's trip but some other
a nice tent on the shore of a lake
what's the best part about it to you the quiet the getting away
the no telephone the
you go to bed when it gets dark
you get up when it gets light
i guess just the change
do you usually go and there's lots of other people around
is it pretty much isolated
it's pretty isolated
to me i like that i guess too although there are people
it's really hard to get away
we didn't even have tents there
good grief
that does sound neat
i don't think i've got quite enough nerve to do that
i know my husband's gone for several days on the appalachian trail before
he said that a lot of times you can go for a good day before you'll see or meet anybody else on the trail
it's not for the faint of heart i don't think
i just joined the appalachian trail walking club or whatever they call it
i'm very eager to start
i love to walk i'm going to start with day trips though because i don't know the territory and all
i'm not sure
that sounds really neat
i'm going to try
gee whiz
i don't know
we talk about sometimes going up to chincoteague i
maybe like you said start out slow and kind of get used to it and find out that maybe it's not as bad as i fear it might be
i think that
the only site left when we got there was in the middle of a field
i said for twenty dollars we can go down the road and get a motel which we did
that
if the setting was right and it's great
if it's
i've been
we have two cars right now
we're still paying on them
i would love to have one of these new mini vans
i think that would be just the perfect family car
right now my car is terminally ill i am really facing the purchase of a car
what i would like to have is so totally impractical for me that
i would like for one time in my life to have a convertible
i don't even like the wind blowing in on me
i don't know why i think i want one
i do
i will probably stay with a foreign make
we have
we bought a chevy nova about three years ago
we opened up the hood
it said toyota made in japan right across the front of all the engine parts
the chevy nova is the same car as the toyota camry
at that time was the same car
they just put different names on them depending on who they're being shipped to
i didn't realize it
i knew that nissan which is toyota had a plant over here
i
i i never thought of
i know
that's why we were so surprised to see toyota imprinted on the engine
i
there's so many different options and so many different prices and who has this cash back and whatever
that's minimum
it's a major purchase
i heard a commercial or something about a sixty thousand dollar car about how
i thought i don't think i'd find that exciting
i'd be wondering here i am buying this expensive of a car and my house isn't worth that much money
when you consider that when you drive them off of the show lot
that
i don't know that i'll buy a brand new one again
we had a pretty
we bought a used car
then we bought our next car used
we had better luck with our used car
i like it more
we got more features and air-conditioning and whatever on it then we did on our brand new one for twice as much money
i'm seriously considering going that route instead of a brand new car
if you can find one that's reliable
some people have to have a new car every year
i wouldn't
or at the most every two years
they don't drive them that much
your foreign cars
like a honda or a toyota
if i can find one or a repossession
with the banks being in such financial problems now that people
it was in real nice condition because apparently whatever the bank get
a very good afternoon to you
good afternoon to you
do you do most of your cooking at home
do you have a lot of people come in and have to prepare for them
i could safely say that i have never cooked for a dinner party
what would you like to cook
what is your favorite recipes that you would like to have for a dinner party
you're in dallas is it
of course dinner parties down here probably turn out to be more things like barbecues
i was thinking in terms of mexican almost
tex-mex
mexican food probably a little bit different than what you serve up in pennsylvania for a dinner party
that's a very interesting food though
when i go out to eat dinner sometimes that's the type of foods i like to find
we have
in these different restaurants in this area that have all this fine mexican foods
if i were to cook a dinner party it may be standard to you
i never get too much fried chicken
i would have fried chicken with reasonably hot sauce on it
i love twice cooked potatoes
with a cream made of the sour cream and cream cheese and a little oleo and i use oregano and maybe dill weed mixed in with it
i like broccoli casseroles which would include onion and cheese and more dill weed and some medium hot peppers
i would probably have some quiet and gentle fried onion rings mixed in there with it too
how would you improve upon that
green beans and carrots and things like that
i just get fresh green beans from the grocery store and snap off the ends and put them in water and steam them for about ten minutes
you h-
i like to put a little mrs dash in with them
what you use and in herbs and so forth
i like to just put a tablespoon or so of mrs dash in there
it makes them pretty tasty
you might be interested in that
you have a soy sauce taste
you also have a little cream sauce in there because you would use the water and
it does make a nice thick creamy sauce with the green beans you have a nice soy sauce taste under it with a few onions in there with it
if it does it brings out so much different things in the string beans
i like it to try them differently
you might think about that
chinese cooking has a lot of very delicious tastes to them
north african cooking is good when you use something called couscous
that's made from i think they call it beans
that's the type of something that whatever you mix with it this couscous absorbs the taste of whatever else you put in it where that makes a very delicious dish
that's a north african dish
it is very very flexible
it makes a fantastic salad with cucumbers and
i've enjoyed talking with you
i hope i've i've enjoyed talking with you
given you some ideas that's one thing we can enjoy is good delicious food
are you reading the papers about the middle east summit
i think i was worn out from middle east after the war
i think it didn't really take over the first page quite as much as it did i think during the war
we definitely need something there with all the hostages and what all
that's i think
i think that's really really important
i guess we grew up in such a different world i could never even imagine taking hostages
i think they just have a whole different world than we do
i don't know what do you think some of the long term repercussions might be
i see the middle east as being the real
i guess i view it as being the prime importance as far as trying to wind down some of the tensions and everything that are there
i think
i don't know i just have this civil rights mentality i guess
should we
None
i guess that's what i hope for them
some of them don't want those freedoms i think
their religious beliefs may not
i think that's something that has to be considered too
i think that's really a long term type thing
i know that the
i was just thinking peace is peace
that really is the nicest thing
it depends on the country
if you look at iraq for example and the recent thing with the u n going in there and the bomb development and all this kind of stuff
i think we should have got him while we
i think so
i think
i think there's a certain mentality to that's in the middle east the constant fighting
i think they realized we would probably never push him out
i think the other
i think they look at force as a way of their means to their ends
i don't know so much if these peace talks are going to
even if we say that we're going to do stuff i don't know how they'll stick to that
i think the thing is though i guess the arab countries that used to argue with us or not support any ideas that coincide with the u s ideas or whatever used to probably receive money from the soviet union
i guess that's all gone
i think that's really probably what started the whole process
that's probably a bonus on our part
i think that they're so much more vulnerable now because they don't receive support from the soviet union
i guess they're saying we can eat two ways or we can get this aid free from these countries two ways
we can act like we're going to be pro-communist act like we're going to be pro-democracy
whatever gets us the most honor that's what we'll act like we're going to do
we really won't change in the long run
i think that's the way i sort of see them all working
i think they have in mind what they want to do
i think a lot of times their might make right
it
kind of the forceful
i just don't think peace is uppermost in their minds
it's really funny as an american and always being an ally with the israelis
i always find it very hard in my heart to align with the israelis because they seem to be just as bad as the arabs
then again they have to live in that environment
then you think to yourself in your heart you don't want to be aligned with somebody that's mean and cruel to someone else
if that's the environment that they have to live in and survive in then you have to sort of
i don't know
i am a golfer
that's about the way i am
i do enjoy it
i haven't been out all year
i enjoy both watching it and playing it
lately it's been just about that
i do enjoy
i think one of the things i enjoy the most is the beauty of the golf courses
the peacefulness
the little critters that are around
it's such a personal challenge
it's a competitiveness against yourself
you're doing a whole lot better
all of a sudden you go back out
it's just terrible
you'll hear thirty and think i got my game together
you quadruple bogey
being down there do you get to see the colonial or any of those
i've never been to a major golf tournament
i watch them on t v a lot
we've had the p g a up here
tulsa
i've been to both of them
it's like a bullet going by
i'll bet
to see their concentration and yet to see how friendly they are when they're walk by you and how good they are to their spectators
i've only been playing about three years now
i just took it up about three years ago
we play in a lot of couple's scramble tournaments
we have developed a tremendous number of friends that couples do this
it's fun to go on vacations and things and go to golf courses
it's fun because it's so uncompetitive
on those you really go out for fun
you won't
you know you're stroke is just one of one or two or three or four that's going to make any difference
you just do your own thing and be relaxed and enjoy it
when i worked at kerr mcgee i used to play in their tournaments
now that was very competitive
i enjoyed it tremendously
i think i get more enjoyment just couple friends going out
if it takes one of us ten shots to get up to the green so be it
we just think the next time has got to be better
they have a lot of them there at the club
they have the club championships and everything with the women's slots as well
i don't know
my husband and all the men they love the real competitiveness of playing for money
i'm not good enough for that
i don't do much with it since most of theirs
most of their meetings and all are during the week
i don't get to play except on the weekend
someday when i get where i live closer to the club and partially retired maybe i'll be able to play a little more
it's a good game
i wish i had more time to play
i felt had more energy to play it too
i've got two children
they're
one is just turned to be a teenager
the other one is on his way
i think it makes it more difficult for me to find time with my children since i work
of course take care of the house all this good kind of stuff
it's a real problem for me
the thing that we like to do the most is to watch t v together
the kids like to play nintendo
i'm no good at it
you just watch them play
i tried it once or twice
i didn't feel like i was very good at it either
i've never got off of level one
i don't even know what they're talking about
i know
that's a neat thing
i guess we're all movie fanatics or whatever around here
we like to do those kind of things
i know when our kids were growing up we were big into water sports
they all skied
in the summer we spent most weekends on the lake with them skiing
they always took other friends with them
we had a lot of fun doing that
how neat
i had all girls we didn't do too much sports wise
i find my grandchildren are very involved in soccer and baseball little boys do all of those things
i have a son
it's football in the fall and baseball in the spring
it's one activity after another
i'm constantly going back and forth
my daughter has tennis
it's between tennis and bowling
we're pretty active as a sports in the family
it's really neat
when mine were real little they all played soccer
that was just for a couple of years when they were pretty small for girls
they got more interested in other things
i think that's probably what it was
i know that my daughter even though she goes out with the sports and everything she likes to watch the football for the kids
that was a cat that hit the telephone
yeah
my kids are starting to grow up
it's not going to be too many more years before they'll be gone
there won't be as many activities
do you
you enjoy them
i agree with you
i do
i'm so glad they're out of that real young age
the babies
i didn't
the older they got i enjoyed them as teenagers
now that they're each
of course three girls they've all become women in themselves that it's been neat to watch them
what kind of wives
do your daughters live close where you can go out
we spend a lot
we play with the kids
where d-
they camp out we spend weekends in the country with them quite a bit
as far as doing any activity now that the grand kids are here we all just stay around the house mostly
i know especially when they grow up like that
these last five or six years i'm trying to make them really special and very precious since that's about the only time we've got left
i think so too
i hear mine saying i remember mother and daddy used to take us to do so and so
i need to take my boys to do this or that
i remember the year we went to disneyworld as quick as my kids are big enough we're going to go to disneyworld
i know they can't wait
i still got a few more years
i'm hanging onto those and doing as much activity as i can with them
i work full time
it
vacations are very special for us and activities
i imagine that they have a lot of homework too
this being a school night and stuff
it's in the same old routine of doing homework and trying to talk between all of that and the other activities that we all have
there's just so many things to do with them nowadays though
especially if they're active kids
i
i want to believe that they really are trying to change that maybe they are headed for a more democratic society
i want to believe it's all okay
then there's that side of me that says
they've put on faces before
and never to this extent though
it's like there is a struggle within me going do i
i trust people
do i keep on going we'll wait and see
i think there's a struggle within the soviet union
i think the people are just fed up
i think it's showing
all the republic is trying to gain their independence
i think that's making gorbachev and others realize that maybe this communist thing isn't working
that's it's not just a western society telling you it doesn't work
they've always said the soviet people were united
maybe they are seeing that we don't believe this
it's still
i don't know i want to trust them
maybe it's because we've had our own propaganda over the years
that could be
we think of the k g b and we think such bad things
i wouldn't doubt if the soviet people think c i a and they think such bad things
they probably do the same things
they do
the difference is i don't think we take people and kill them just because they don't believe what we believe
i think to that extent we don't go as far
i'm sure they lie
i think if we can get away from that or if we can keep that out of our minds
i've got a cold today
i think if we can get that propaganda thing because i'm sure both countries are thinking k g b and c i a and all that
just on an economic point of view if the soviet union doesn't do something fast they ain't going to be able to feed their people this winter
on the other hand i'm kind of getting fed up with our own country and presidency always concerning themselves with other nations' problems when we have so many at home yet
i feel like we ought to be spending maybe the same time and effort and energy into trying to solve our own or resolve our own
any country that wants to be democratic i'm all for helping them because i understand that you are looking at the united states as the biggest and longest supporter of that type of government
at the same time i agree
i don't think we can do it and just turn our backs or be ignorant per se to the things that are happening here
we've got quite a few domestic problems that i feel we ought to be concentrating more on
i think the problem is
on the international scope maybe the president feels that for long-term relations with all these countries it's important
we'll always have the united states
we need to solve these international problems
i think i heard in the news about last week sometime that the president ended up canceling one of his international trips so he could spend more time on a domestic issue because the american public is kind of getting fed up with it
we believe in what he's doing abroad
like you said there's issues here too
i am encouraged by what is happening in the soviet union
i'm encouraged by what's happened in the iron curtain countries
in that block
i think it's moved in the right direction
i think sometimes people expect it to happen overnight
it's not going to
it didn't happen here without a struggle
think sometimes we forget that
i have to say i'm encouraged by the way it's going
think i think in the long
i'd like to know what do you do in lawn and garden
what's of interest to you
how do you go about it
i have a town home
i don't do a lot of regular maintenance
i do have a large garden out in back
we do a lot of
every year i grow a garden
you do grow a garden to produce food
how much room do you have
we have virtually no room out in front
in the back i'd say we have about an eighth of an acre we pretty much fill it up with like i said perennials things that don't have to fool with every year
then i've got a twenty-five by twenty area that i do gardening
that's what i was curious about
i was wondering whether you had actually some of the flowers that you had planted were bulb type that you would dig up and then put down your garden and then put them back in later or something like that
last year was the first year we tried two new things
we tried a watermelon
tell me this lowell
do you enjoy doing that kind of work
do you have the time to relax so that you can take advantage of it
i don't mow grass or anything like that
i think if i had a big home and a big lawn i don't believe i would enjoy it
just on the limited basis that i do it i do enjoy it very much
i'm a little more fortunate i think from that point of view
i moved here in state college quite a while ago and was fortunate to get some land
i have nine acres
for many years i grew sweet corn
my kids were there
we set up a shop there
i would collect the corn very carefully ear by ear
it was never more than one to two hours old
people came from miles and miles around to get that corn because they knew it was individually picked and very very fresh
we had a nice thing going there
it was delicious
i really enjoyed that
i also have a garden
it's probably twenty-five by thirty or forty something like that that i put in my normal food garden things each year
i have a whole lot of everything in the
i love broccoli brussels sprouts
i have all kinds of tomatoes kale and all those good things
i rent out my field that i used to plant in sweet corn to a local farmer
he plants about a quarter of an acre of sweet corn for me to use
i get out of that amount of work at any rate
that's nice
it is very very nice
i really enjoy it
i had a pony there for twenty-five years
he had two acres that he had for his own grazing
he had his own backyard garden too
that worked out very nicely too
i built him a barn back there in the part of my corn field
he lived in that
as far as gardening is concerned we do enjoy it
we have an acre and a half that the house is sitting in the middle of
she has flower gardens and bulbs perennials and things
i have two or three apple trees
my neighbor has pear trees and blueberries all kinds of food around there if we just had time to take advantage of it
i have been totally engulfed with golden delicious apples
i just couldn't handle the amount of them we got this year
i bet you could answer a question for me
they make delicious pies
i keep forgetting to make these calls
i just got mine last week
i haven't started yet because i wanted to get one first see how it worked
there are some kind of nice prizes
it's worth doing it
i've made four calls
lot of times we don't answer the phone probably when i get mine early in the evening
we're supposed to talk about movies
i was trying to think of the one i went to a couple of weeks ago
i forgot it already
i haven't really seen one since probably august because every weekend in the fall we go to our high school football game on friday then we go out with friends after
that's kind of the our social for the
i saw robin hood which i didn't care for
my husband dragged me to it
i think kevin costner's a nice fellow
he's nice looking
he just to me is not a very dynamic actor
i did see that i really enjoyed that
i do too
i really enjoyed that
my daughter went to see that one too
it was fine for her yeah
that's right
they've probably seen about everything at this point
my daughter is twelve we had a sleep over one night
they wanted to watch pretty woman which i have i was hesitant
they all had seen it anyway
we can see some pretty raunchy stuff on just regular t v without cable or anything
there's no way to protect them any more
i love julia roberts movies
i didn't think they were great for my daughter
it was a fun movie to watch
i love pretty woman
i like that one after that where
the scary one
i didn't see that
that was so good
i like scary ones that are realistic
None
i don't know
they say it's really horrifyingly scary i'd never get my husband to that
my kids both saw that
i watched it at a friend's house on video
i was just
it was still scary
he likes mary poppins and things
i like scary movies
i really like a variety
i was going to s-
my husband's from new jersey
we lived there for five years when we first got married it sound kind of nice
i'm from long island that's close
that's more related to new jersey than it is to like rochester new york that kind of thing
it's different
the accents up there fascinated me because even in his family alone there were several different accents the way they would pronounce words differently
his family they lived in the same house there
they were all from new jersey
they lived
they went in the service
they were together for all that time
they still
their accents differed a little in the family it
in the sixties
i just thought life would be
sort of
i was real familiar with texas
i just thought we could probably get a better house
life is a little slower a little easier
it is
he really would never want to leave
it worked out
i like
it was because we're here eighteen years you can imagine what plano was like eighteen years ago
i know
compared to new york
they were
i alternate between danielle steele
i try to go into one of the self improvement books
we take books every once in a while in our sunday school class and go through them
i love scott peck and his road less traveled
it is wonderful
i thoroughly enjoyed that
i'm a tom clancy fan
i read
i just finished a book on novelle netware
i'm just finishing another one up on statistical sampling
i do more work kind of related reading than just for enjoyment
i try to keep a book going all the time
i try to read when i first wake up in the morning and then before i go to sleep
i probably get thirty to fifty pages a day read
that's pretty good
i just
i didn't want to put it down
i like mysteries
i like
he wrote the bourne ultimatum
i like jeffrey archer
what does he write
i guess they're a type of mystery
he's a lawyer who no longer practices
his have some part of the law enveloped in them
you kind of learn something as well as enjoy yourself
the new author that came out with the one that harrison ford starred in
it was the
what time is it there ten thirty
it's nine thirty here
it was his first book
it was on the top of the list
presumed innocent
i haven't seen the movie or read the book
he came out with the second one
a sequel to it
both of those i've enjoyed real well
i like that
if i want to get a fantasy and
is she kind of racy
her books
it's always good for good tears
one book that she wrote that's good for both men and women is fine things
my mother-in-law's a real fan of hers
it's one that's
it's always going to make you have a good cry
you know it's going it turn out good
you're going to be happy in the end
that's nice
i said
i want happy fantasy
you mentioned sunday school ladonna
do you
i do my share of it
i certainly can't say that i understand a lot of it
that's always a challenge
do you do
i guess tonight's topic is about personal computers and level of interest and your expertise
let's fire away
brian
first of all
why don't you do about thirty seconds
i'll do thirty seconds
we can work off of there
real fine
first of all yes
i do own a p c here at home
i also have one at the office
my level of interest is quite high with p c
i am really interested in them however not to the extent as i was about two years ago when i basically knew about everything there was to know about different things
that was the time when we were shopping for one
i think we got a top of the line at that time
as you know p c change quite rapidly
the technological advances kind of outdated our p c where i can get the same p c i got two years ago at the fraction of the cost
i also enjoy using ours at home
we use it for a number of different things
plus i get in an awful lot of good use of one at where i work
lot of analytical testing reviews lot of different things i use it at work
i enjoy p c
they make my life and my work a lot easier
since
i guess since this time last year i've changed jobs within the firm i'm with
these are the big mamas i e sons hewlett packards
we have two p c here
we have an x t
recently we made command decision to go ahead and get the absolute top of the line because spouse is a programmer
we got one that could do enough and hold three different o s
as far as dos unix and o s two
i'm learning to be one who knows what's he's doing expert
None
i frown on that term because too many people misuse the word
i'd rather say i am continually learning
my level of expertise is increasing almost daily
that's great be-
yeah
i've got a p c and a work station at work
i we have two p c here at home
a lot of the new mama we're
i've got aldus and micrographics on it as far as technical publishing
we do quite a bit of church work with ours
some
i've found that the more we do with it
the lord's just pleased that we're kind of
this is part of giving back a portion of what he's given to us
i don't mind because seems like the more we do there's the more stuff that's available that comes along and so forth
rather than being niggardly and chintzy we've just said you bet boss seeing as he was the one that
the top of the line we've got
we've got a compatible
eight meg of ram and two hundred and eleven hard drives
like i said we bought a real steam burner
mainly because of spouse's unix because unix takes four megs minimum of ram
it likes to live on about a hundred and fifty megabyte hard drive
the next size up was a two hundred and eleven
rather than just have one we went ahead and got two
at some point in time i'm going to do the mirroring experiment to where one disk mirrors the other for fault tolerance
speak of the angel she just walked in
good for her
None
she's a squirrel for contractor out at american airlines
she probably needs that kind of a powerful type of a machine to do her work
you ready to discuss the topic
one that i think is quite fascinating because couple of years ago i guess
not very long ago seemed like the whole world not just the united states but the whole world was kind of in a standstill where everyone was basically in a very comfortable position so to say even though the cold war was in full swing
in the last couple of years things have changed dramatically not only on the political front but also on the economic front where couple of years ago america was one of the leading powers and one of the strongest nations in the world as far as economics were concerned
now we're having a very tough time in a recessionary period
that's kind of frightening
also a couple of years ago ten fifteen years ago an individual going into a career could expect to have that career basically throughout their whole life
thirty years ago that was basically it whereas now we're expected to have a career change every couple of years and possibly four to five career changes throughout our lifetime
i think things
of course i look at the economic problems in the united states right now
i think the other kind of changes like job changes and those kinds of things i think it's great to even have three or four different careers in your life
some of that opportunity for job change in the fact that aspects changing
the uncertainty of whether you're going to have a job is not as good
the fact that you really can make major changes in your life and jobs
do you think that's good or bad
they're very comfortable
they in a sense become unteachable
they think they know all there is to know in the area set path and
when that's over with that's it without even giving a second thought to advancing their education or getting extracurricular education
i think that's an excellent opportunity for us to expand ourselves also
i think one of the problems with education as it relates to this though is that i don't know that education is prepared to help people make those changes
i believe that an individual should really learn how to learn
learn how to grow in their college or whatever education they might take
that's good
there probably needs to be some training on how to adjust to these changes as they come about
if you look at the high unemployment rate right now
it seems to me that while those changes are taking place maybe we're not well preparing people to make the changes with them
i read a few articles off in the newspaper and some publications
it affects
nancy what do you think some of the changes in roles of women are in american society in the past generation or two
of course working
what do you think it is
i also think that there are more
i know my mother and her sister were both married by the time they were twenty i waited until i was thirty-two
i know that
i really do see what you're saying there
now our care plans look more like thirty-two thirty-three if we get somebody twenty-one we go look how young
we have a lot of first time moms in their late thirties and even forties
it's true
again i guess it probably does go back to the same thing of women having careers
it just seems like there are more single mothers too
that's
there're a lot of divorced never been married
what do you think have been the most significant changes in the past generation or so
just that
the role in the family
the mother doesn't stay home and cook the dinner take care of the children
i know that there's a lot more participation by the fathers
i still think the mothers have the major role
i think they're not doing very much less
i don't think as far as the kids and the house and everything are concerned not from what i see they're contributing to the income besides
i think that we're really putting a lot of stress on ourselves
it is
it's affecting the families for mothers not to be home yet
i don't blame anybody when they have to work
it's difficult
i think that
it's a very wealthy town
we're not part of that
i think what i see a lot of parents a lot of mothers working just for bigger and better i really hate that
i've been here for a very long time i don't know
i don't have a choice any more i used to just work occasionally for extra money
now i have to work all the time that's really hard i don't know how a mother does just choose to go out to work and leave the kids
in a way it's very good to get out with adults
i think that's a good thing if you can do it part time
to just go out there forty hours a week at least and work and leave your kids to get home from school alone and that kind of thing i think that's not very smart
what do you think's going to happen in the next generation
it's going to be interesting
i'm not sure how it's going to because you see young people today and wonder how in the world they'll ever afford to buy a home and to raise a family
i don't know how it can change to where the mother can get back into the home again
i don't that ever will go backwards i don't know what effect it's going to have on these kids now when they grow up how they're going to feel about it
it could lead to another woodstock
maybe these kids will really resent that their parents are out there working for things they might want to do without things rather than do that to their families
i don't know what percentage but some will move back toward more traditional lifestyle of staying home with the children
they get
people chide them for it
i've pressed the button
that is where i want to go
is it
she couldn't stand it any more
she moved out because she said the whole island was being taken over by the japanese
there is a lot of japanese over there
they are
she also told me that
not her necessarily other people that have been there have said that it is too commercialized
yeah
there is still a lot of beautiful places to go and see
on all of the islands
it is still beautiful
i will
what is the nicest island
i like maui
i think that is what usually people say they do like the best
i like it because the beach is nice and white
it is like oahu
it is really nice
kauai
the beaches are nice
i don't know just not nice as maui
where have you been
you have
eighty-six
that is right near piedmont
she was in berkley also
she lets see i went when she was living
when i went out there she was in lafayette
they moved to
i haven't seen her house in piedmont
i loved san francisco
we did the whole bit
we went to carmel
we took the eighteen mile drive
it is beautiful
they wanted to take that drive
they had closed the whole road because of fog
the weather
i have also been to the carribean
i haven't been there either
i have been there a couple of times
that is nice
we really had a good time
they had this cruise director dress up like santa claus
we went to the beach
they had put a christmas tree on the beach decorated it up
it was a lot of fun
that's nice
is a cruise nicer than if you just go to a hotel
you don't have to worry about unpacking or anything like that
you will have to go on one
there was
some people did on that last cruise that we took because they was having a storm come in that is unusual
one of my sisters got sick
the other one didn't
i didn't
it is really nice
they just do so many things for you to make you enjoy the trip and everything
you will have to do that once
i want to go to alaska
someone i know was on a cruise to alaska
i was thinking cruise i am thinking
she is laying on the beach
i said you are not very tan for someone who has been on a cruise
that i would like to go
hawaii is number one
get a
i think i would like to too
i keep hoping to win the lottery where i can do all these things
i am just in the publisher's clearing house and the reader's digest because we don't
okay what do you think about the government providing health insurance for everybody
they closed
for me to try to get it now it would cost me over three hundred dollars a month with the same company that was providing health insurance at p i e
i think
the government should come up with some kind of a health plan or stop these doctors and hospitals from having their prices so high
i wonder if they couldn't just provide interim health insurance for people who are between jobs like that
the thing is jobs are so hard to find
in the valley where i live at now they don't want to pay anything for health insurance at all
no benefits
you mean the the employers
you get a job now and the wages are really low
they don't want
you just pray to god that you don't get sick
i used to think that universal health insurance was probably the right thing to do
i have to think about it some more now because my doctor he's canadian he told me that there're a lot of counts against the canadian system which is basically the one people are talking about for here
he says it restricts your choice of doctors and so forth
we're on a private insurance plan right now i have my own business
we
every year we get another list of what doctor's we can go to and where we can buy our medicine
it changes every year
i know the plan that i had with p i e i could go to any doctor
i could go to any drug store and get my prescriptions filled
then i just sent cards in they would have like a ten dollar deductible per year for my medicine
they would just send me a check for what was ever over that
of course the restricted choice in this case is because only certain doctors agree to accept the limits of compensation
of course that is restricted choice
i don't think that the restricted choice really has to do with the difference between public and private health insurance
i think it has to do with the attempt to limit cost doesn't it everybody agrees that we need to limit cost some way
i guess the most sensible thing i've heard about this is they say people are trying
you have to recognize that if you're going to
if you want to pay less then you're going to have to settle for a health system that is not quite that lavish
there's just so many people that can't afford to pay anything
it does seem to be a big problem
i sure wish they would come up with something
like i say
i'm at the age too where the
the people don't want to hire people this age any more
they'll be needing you in a couple of years because they're running out of kids down the other end
they'll be calling at my door
if they're smart
i do think the government though is going to have to do something with this problem because even to go to a little doctor out here just to
he
then that's not counting what medicine you're going to buy and everything else
he might tell you you're going to have to come back in a week
that's another forty bucks plus whatever else he decides to do to you
okay bill
i own the company
i guess i determine what the benefits are
what are you asking me
what benefits i think are most important
what do you think of the
what do you think are the most important benefits for those working for you other than their present salary
i'd say in today's economy besides basic benefits such as health insurance and life insurance and some type of retirement plan i'd say that most of the employees that we have really like a profit sharing plan
they like to participate in the profits of the company like they're
because they feel like we're contributing to it
we'd like to participate in it
that means i make a little bit less
the thing is that really you make a little more because everybody has a interest in it working
i think most people don't want money
it's been my experience most people want to feel like they're participating in something that is not a drudgery that they enjoy and that they can get some benefits out of
it's a contribution
bill that idea fits me exactly
i just retired from the university here
that's been the goal in my life was to contribute to the work that i was doing in my research
that's what made me happy
that's the type of goal i think most people ought to look for
i'm sure a lot of them don't
our people get a lot of satisfaction
we're a financial planning firm
how many
we deal with a lot of people that are retired or trying to retire
they like to have enough to be comfortable
what changes have you considered in doing it to your company that might benefit the employees or perhaps the company itself better
we considering instead of tying a profit sharing plan to a salary is tie a percentage of business that a person would participate and bring into the company
pay them based on the percentage of business they bring instead of based on their salary
the re-
when you say bring in do you mean that they negotiated with people to come in and ask for your support
it can be in-house people who help you handle x amount of dollars
we have marketing people
we have financial planners
we have staff secretaries and administrative assistants
these secretaries and administrative assistants if we don't have their cooperation and they're not participating in the profit of the company they can get very dissatisfied very quickly
we're thinking about paying them instead of a percentage on salary paying them a percentage on the business they handle
administrative assistant that would handle two million dollars worth of business is a lot more valuable than a person that handles a hundred thousand dollars worth of business
it might not be necessarily because he did a good or bad job
it might be whether the locality there those people want that kind of support
to
the thing is that they give support to the financial planner that they're the assistant to or that they usually have several people they report to that they work together with it encourages them not to complain when they realize that they get a part of the action based on their efforts and not based on being sitting back saying make me do it
we don't want anybody around here that says make me do it
i don't think any i think most people want to be lack of better terminology they want to be self-employed
they don't want to take the risk
they also want to be somewhat content to go and come as they please without some real strict adherence
i'm in
the big thing up here of course is the twins
it's pretty pervasive
i don't know how much of the world series you caught last year
that was a lot of fun
of course it was fun for you
i'm going back at the end of next month
orlando florida
i'm not exactly a real twins fan from birth or anything
i was born and raised near miami and spent the last twenty years in dallas where the rangers played
for the last roughly year i've been in san francisco where there are two teams the oakland a and the san francisco giants
honestly i do my duty and watch the sports on
the newscasts that's about all the exposure i have to sports
i haven't followed it real closely at all except like i said last year when the world series rolled around i did follow that pretty religiously
went out into the bars drank a beer watched the game had a good time that way
i guess the san francisco giants and the oakland a were the leading teams a couple of years ago
i th-
i don't know
i don't know
what is the prognosis for this year
real good as far as i can tell
i assume that means good for the minnesota
as far as the twins are concerned it seems to be real good
my roommate went and saw them play on their season opener a couple of nights ago
they won that one seven to one
that's pretty good i guess
i think it probably was the train
i don't know
i don't even know who has been winning as far as the san francisco giants and the oakland a
i think they both won their opener
i sort of gathered that in my subliminal memory
i've got a friend that's living in san francisco right now
he's doing the same thing i'm doing which is basically an internship
we're both doctoral students
he's doing his with i b m
i'm doing mine with honeywell
i think he kind of follows the sports
i think he's mentioned
he may have watched them and seemed to think that they were pretty good
in the major leagues i guess there is a couple of different divisions
of course there's the minors
i don't know
i guess i'm one of those people that if i really made a concentrated effort i could really probably get into baseball
i was talking to my roommate a couple of nights ago right after that game
he offered to take me to one of the games because apparently he and four other people from honeywell had bought a row of seats for the home games
the thing is there's like eighty-six home games per year
there's no way that you can ever use them all
that's just the home games
i thought it was a mistake
he goes no
they must play every day then
that's
that's over five months worth
if you consider it the season starts
it ends with the world series which usually takes place i believe in december or january
it did last year didn't it
was it november
i know it was doggone cold up here
i think you don't know all that much more than i do about baseball
i know for sure it was
it was at least two months after i got up here
it had to be november anyway
i know the super bowl
you want salary too plus what
as far as tangible benefits go i would say that health insurance of all forms is probably my next most important concern
i feel that a company that can provide good health benefits such as health care dental and vision as well as good long-term and short-term disability plans goes a long way toward satisfying my needs
i'll tell you
i'm not working right at the moment
the company that i did work for
i think those medical benefits are the most important
you really don't realize how important they are until you find yourself on the other side of the fence without them and having to cover your own medical
you can quickly see where they become a very important part of your compensation package
i should knock on wood
i haven't had any serious health problems or anything
it was only for a cold
they can't really do anything for you anyhow
you might as well not even go
they look at you you're still breathing so
you've got a cold
go home and take liquids and rest
that is definitely the most important
pension i guess is next
thank god that i had one
i don't know what happened to the salary employees when the company went bankrupt
mine was being put into like a trust fund
i don't know if they ever got anything or if they lost all of theirs
i really feel sorry for all those people that spent all that time there
i work for a little start-up company here in pittsburgh called trans ark
we do distributive system software for unix based workstations
i worked for a trucking company p i e nation wide
does she really
how about that
i see
after the merger you see a lot of ryder pie stuff on the road
you did
did ryder get out of the business
ryder and p i e went together
that ended it
it started i think a little bit before that
when p i e and ryder went together why that was downhill from then on
the problem with that is when you leave a job you can continue your benefits for some finite period of time
when the company goes bankrupt they're just cut off completely
you're responsible for your own
that's exceedingly expensive
three hundred and fifty dollars a month
that's terrible
jobs aren't that hard to find to get another one that does pay your benefits
a lot of them that
they're starting to cut back especially start-ups
i know here at trans ark we get health care
that's it
there's no dental or vision
the short-term disability policy is a ninety day policy
there is no long-term disability policy
at least in the case of this particular company they tend to scrimp a little bit there
of course they can use the excuse
we're start-up
there's been big articles in the paper about that
they claim a back injury
someone goes out and spies on them
they're lifting refrigerators into trucks and everything else
i don't know what's happening and what's going to happen
that certainly doesn't help matters any
you get people who are willing to put their neck on the line to get these additional benefits
no
i don't get as much exercise as i should as or as i would like to these days
i have in the past jogged and and run
every january and every september i start out again
it tapers off
what about you
i started about two years ago because i gained some weight over the past few years
i wanted to get it back off i was going through a divorce
i just found that running really made me feel good
i ran on the treadmill and rode the bike
i felt really good
it was really helpful at the time
when i do those things they're boring
i just recently discovered jazzercise about two months ago
i'm getting to be a good dancer from it
i'm just feeling really good
i'm really into that
that's related to the aerobic
it's aerobics
it's with dance steps
it's an hour straight
it's a lot of fun
i'm getting much better
okay
i've been doing a lot of bike riding outside with the nice weather we've been having
i just enjoy that much more too than inside
do you like to do it with other people
like the jazzercise would be
we go bike riding
it's nice
i've enjoyed that part of it
at the gym even in the class i
everybody's on their way to someplace i do have one friend who goes occasionally
basically i do it by myself in a group of maybe forty
still there are other people there doing the same thing
there are
that makes a difference doesn't it
when i have
kno-
not with the sense that it was chore or something that i was having to do
i've really enjoyed just the activity
getting out and being active helps out
the change of pace and just getting out and around
i find that i can often
often when i get around to doing it then i feel better when i get back to work also that my subconscious is working on things while i'm working i go back
i've got new ideas
i think that it's just is good for your self-esteem for everything because when you look better you feel better
it's just
i've learned to do that i think it just benefits you all around
i think that's a good term demanding the time for yourself
that you've just got to prior-
i don't demand a lot for myself
i just feel entitled to it
i take it
have you done any jogging
i tell you you said you did on the bike and on the treadmill in the club
i find that when you do that you do more chatting than you do exercise
that's not really beneficial
i don't have time like that
i spend enough time chatting around
read any good books lately
i've read several good books lately
lot of them related to business and financial matters since that's what i do for a living
i'm in graduate school
i read a lot of books
i don't know if i consider very many of them good
i haven't read a book for enjoyment since i guess around christmas
at christmas break i read sarum by a fellow named rutherford
it's the history of
it's sort of the historical fiction about the salisbury area in england
i really enjoyed that book a lot
he's not quite as good as michener or some of the other historical writers
he did this job well
that sounds good
do you find you have much chance to read for just pleasure or mostly for business
it's a book about
greek gods and and greek mythology as well as man and interacting with other men and a book about men and how they mature through life
how they deal with life itself
it's all revolved around mythology
as far as traditions from other cultures and our culture
and how we interact with one another
did it have something to mention about sort of cultural rituals of manhood
i have someone suggested that i read it
it's a very interesting book
what are your favorite
do you have a favorite subject to read whether it be science fiction or history
it depends again if we're talking about
just because i have an interest in that area
i read a lot of books in the area of psychology and self-help type materials
always trying to understand people better and understand myself in relation to other people and try to understand where the people are coming from because i'm in a people business
that's
who is your favorite religious author
i don't know if i have a favorite religious author
i would have to say that some of the ones that consistently put out good materials
None
that's difficult because
i had to stop here and think a second
i thought that each one of his books were good
he's a great man
i've met him several times
i'd say another which is a local writer here in plano is
that is
i can't
i see him
i can't see his name
he talks about a lot of different topics
what kind of hobbies do you have
i do cross-stitch
i enjoy reading and playing softball
i started knitting awhile ago
i didn't even know what the stitch is called
i just had this piece of yarn
i wanted to start something
i remembered something i learned i think when i was five years old
now i have a little blanket
that's all i've done
i know that i learned how to knit one time and made a few things
i haven't done it in so long that i probably wouldn't remember how
if i remember i think we made some christmas stockings
you could make the granny squares or whatever
she makes a lot of afghans and all that kind of stuff
i like to sing
that's good
right now my actual job is a news reporter
if i could do anything i wanted to do it would be to sing professionally
are you on the t v then
i'm in
i do little news reports and things
you don't have too much time for hobbies
my day is usually pretty full
i could be at work from anytime from nine until nine at night or ten or whatever
it's hard to make plans much less have a hobby
even if i had a hobby like knitting or something and i wanted to take it to work i'd probably never get to it
what do you do
unless the kids are asleep i don't usually get much done either
i've made a few things cross-stitch things
i made stockings for both my children and a christmas tree shirt and that
it just takes a long time to get it done
once you've done something like that it kind of makes you feel good to see it
i showed mine to my boyfriend
he was like you didn't make that
it looks halfway decent
have you sang at any weddings yet
it was my first wedding
i've done little commercials and background singing
i sang all through college and things like that
i really haven't done anything really professional per se
i did one wedding last year
i just now got some business cards that say
what does it say a song makes beautiful wedding or something
i've been passing them out to different wedding shops
when someone comes in
that's a good place
for a wedding dress
they might ask about it
this one woman even wanted me to bring my tape in because i have a demo tape if any one wants to listen
she wanted me to bring it in
that's good
i only just put them out this week
hopefully i'll get some calls in especially now since it's spring
it's the wedding season i guess
that's true
make your hobby into a business that would be pretty good
i'd love it
i've never had formal training
i try
when i was at u t i was in a group called ensemble one oh nine just twelve singers
we did little conventions and like dinner parties and things like that
that's nice
that's what got me really really interested in it
i'm trying to be sensible too at the same time
i think
i have a call
i think we are suppose to talk for ten minutes
i thought that the man told me five minutes
i don't know
okay
it was nice talking to you
good luck with your hobbies
you want to start by telling me what camping is to you
a little bit
nothing overly strenuous
the majority of my camping experience is a tent by the lake type situation or maybe a canoe trip or something like that
it's
we've had a lot of fun
i moved to dallas about five years ago
we've made three different trips since i've been here of varying degrees of difficulty
the last one we did was a canoe trip in arkansas
the river it was up about three feet
it was pretty challenging
i imagine
we
as far as the camping part of that we just drag along all our tents and sleeping bags and find a clearing in the woods and go for it
they'll fit in the canoe
you go for days at a time
that particular one was a two day trip
what
there's a outfitter
they haul you up to the headwaters come down about halfway and then you spend the night
the second day head on down to the pool at the end of the river
that sounds like fun
it really is
the camping i grew up with was like tents and coleman stove type
that just out in the woods
i grew up water skiing
i was from california
we would go up to the sacramento river sloughs the delta there
you just pick a campground on the river
if it got over a hundred and ten degrees you went over the levee and jumped in the water
when i got married my husband had always backpacked
we did that
i guess we haven't done it since my kids were born about three years ago
that was a new experience for me
i enjoyed it
i bet
or where the trail didn't necessarily lead and where you couldn't necessarily pitch a tent
that was interesting
i have always wanted to do some white water rafting
your canoeing kind of made me think of that
that's always been our next step
our little group of friends here we've been kind of getting married off and what not
it just puts a damper on things for a little while
we're starting to get everybody back together
we'd like to do a float trip down like big bend area or something like that
you haven't done that before
my parents were sailing this last year down off costa rica
they took about two weeks and went into
they went white water rafting
mom said it was absolutely just a wonderful experience
i
there's that sense of it you're kind of scared that risk of what could happen and then the thrill of the excitement of doing it
do you have anything planned for this summer
not really just yet
i do have a little bit of property
i've got a piece of property in minnesota that is completely undeveloped as of yet
there's a little lake up there
a group of friends that i went to college with got together
we basically own all the land around this little lake there
i imagine
we've got a private lake
it's completely undeveloped at this point
that's a possibility
the weather is typically always nice up there in the summertime
it's about two hours north of minneapolis
that sounds good
yeah
in fact
i got married last summer
that's
we ended up there for a couple days on our honeymoon
we kind of took a tour of the united states for about a week
and up through that area
my wife's real excited about it
we're going to hope to get up there sometime early eno-
it was a little too late for the fish
hopefully get up there early enough to get into some of the fish and the the good weather and what not
my oldest child is a girl was born three years ago three and a half
i have a little one that just turned two
we are in the process of potty training
i didn't want to go camping with diapers
at a time when they're afraid of their shadow all they need is some skunk or something to rub up the outside of the tent
i think with him almost potty trained and she's not afraid of her shadow anymore i'm hoping and crossing my fingers that we'll be able to go this summer even if it's like over to rio dosa for a couple of days
or something to get them used to it and get them started with little back packs of their own
and things like that
we'll that
there's a lot of places with nature trails
that's true
it's like this is what a pheasant looks like
now we'll go look for one
i would need that before i could teach them
everybody might learn something that way
yeah
there's an awful lot of things set up just anything you want to do
like you say it can be a water ski trip or fishing trip or just a sightseeing bird watching hunt with a camera type of thing
there's a lot of different opportunities for things like that
this is
education in public schools
i have a son who's graduating in may
there's some interesting problems of how do you challenge the kids today
i have some real hang-ups
i think that if your kid's not ambitious he can sure get lost
i teach in dallas
i have a daughter that's
my husband teaches with plano
do your kids go to garland high you said
there's a
over to north garland for ninth grade
at north garland the difficulty i see with the education system is that you can get some masses
unless if the kid's really dedicated it seems like they do all right
if your child is just pressing along
the thing that i don't see and maybe you would take issue with it is that if there was an opportunity for teachers to teach year around
i know when you get the kids that have gone the summer being out of school then it's like they've lost so much ground we spend at least the first six weeks just backing up reteaching what they had the year before
how do we get that
we're starting pilot schools
richardson's supposed to start some pilot schools going to school year around
we investigated this by flying some people out from dallas to observe some of the schools in california that already had it
one thing it'll save us money because we've got the buildings sitting there
we might as well use them
what about the issue of air conditioning
isn't that an area of concern in the cost of air conditioning
air conditioning and heating
if we get in the thirties we raise it up to the seventies
it's less degree days
i think
it's not like the kids are going to go a lot longer
if you go year around there's not thirty days difference
how do they do it
do they put long
i think going two six weeks having two two weeks off each after a two six weeks period is one way
from what you've seen is that the desirable way to do it
i don't know because i've never seen it in action
you said you had some people from california
i thought you
you didn't go
i think i'd like it
i know a lot of teachers that would like to try it
the other issue that i hear that the local commentator i listen to some the idea that the numbers of administration and the fact that the principal
the principal's hands are tied by all the administrators
i heard that in dallas it's one out of every three is actually in the classroom of the educators that were hired
i had heard that one of the comments when they brought it
then why the
the one they brought in the new superintendent for dallas schools the admini-
the idea that he had suggested that maybe they could reduce the number of administrators and some of the people who were administrators saying that's not what he was hired for
they resented the fact that he would try to save some costs there
he did supposedly cut administrators
what they've done is create other offices for those same people and just renamed their jobs and opened up other things
they've hired all these administrators in on that
the other thing that bothers me is the amount of money that it took to contest the football issue
the i can't think of the name of the school
that
in any event they kept arguing
they went to court
i-
guess i'm sympathetic with the kids
how much money did that cost dallas to fight that in court
all the things that dallas fights costs thousands probably millions of dollars i bet you
just think of all the all the lawyers you've kept employed
all these other people are out running around
you need to keep all these people employed
you mean we need a little more of our tax money like maybe
that's sad when there's supposed to be what one thousand sixty-five dollars something like that spent on each pupil
it's wrong
i was thinking about
i think in nineteen ninety-three we're supposed to begin that
if a child is a visual learner we're supposed to present him with all these visual things
if he has to learn just by kinesthetic we're supposed to teach whatever way that that child has to have it learns the best way
that's going to be quite a problem
if we could do something like that i'm sure it would certainly help
that's interesting
how many administrators is that going to take
at nongraded schools
i teach chapter one
it's for kids that have fallen behind in their reading according to i t b s scores
some of the kids really they shouldn't be in there
they're not being challenged
they're not being challenged in their home
we always have to teach toward the middle of the road
that's part of where my son would like to go to rice
i don't think he's
the difficulty is the people that get in are overachievers
he's not an overachiever
the same time everybody can't go
the question of how far should you take a kid in the motivation
i had a friend that was administrator in richardson said if the parents read books then the kids probably would read books
that a lot of the schools i would think the kids you're talking to question of how much reading do those kids' parents do
that's the point as i would say that's what makes
i'm trying to think how much longer
we got carried away
they cut
i didn't know that there was even a cut off or anything
another things that's wrong with schools
we're going to do that until at least the first part of may
that's in the garland schools
i don't think they have to do that because most everybody passes
that
unfortunately that's tough
what we're doing is we're turning these kids off to school even more than they are
we're not teaching toward the test
we're teaching
i always objected
it's like there's not a whole lot of fun time like we used to have in school
our principal says i want every child to be on task all the time
you can't do that as adults
we're expecting kids to
after recess play we don't get that
if they finish before their thirty minutes is up then they can go out and play for maybe five or ten minutes probably be the most
we always got that
our son had that
he had an attention deficit disorder
they were keeping him from recess
in reality that's one of those really tough situations
if more people like you though that understand the problems get in and change some education
i got some background noise there
i guess
before i was married i used to play a lot of sports
when i got married
i haven't done a lot of exercise on purpose
it's funny
i found a bathing suit that i had bought
yesterday i went to a spa
i belong to a private spa and went in and got with a trainer
he checked body fat content we set up a program for me to work on
i went back tonight also
that's good
i've been two nights in a row
i'm going to take it pretty seriously
i'm going to start going every night just
even if i
tonight i only went for thirty minutes
i at least did something
is it the weight machines or aerobics or what is it
last night i did about thirty minutes of riding a bike and three different types of weight lifting for my legs and my hips i did a hour of aerobics
that was really tough
i bet
i was sore this morning when i got up
then tonight i got into a
it's sort of like an aerobics class it's only thirty minutes
it's for your abdominals your thighs and your butt
that was
that's good
are you moti-
i am undisciplined in the sense that i can't just go and do exercise
i like to play tennis and play racquetball i like to get exercise when i'm playing a game of some sort
that's always been the way that i have kept myself in the shape that i was satisfied with at least
then i have given that up
i would really like to start that again because i am now not in a position that i like myself
i get
you're easily tired that has made me
i'm not the kind of person that could go to a spa and work out
if something like
i have so many chores and so many obligations every day for to add another obligation would make me feel stressed
i wouldn't enjoy it
if i have something some team sport or some activity then it's kind of like having fun
you get some of the good exercise and some of the desired results
you're doing it for fun
i really admire people who can go and work out
i don't
i have a girlfriend that goes for the social aspect of it she walks around talks to people
naturally i'm married my husband goes a lot
we'll go and just do what we want to do and then leave
that's nice
swimming is a part that i'd like to get into as far as my
i'd like to try that as well
that's probably something that you could do family included
it's fun
kids enjoy that
also the nice thing about belonging to a club is that you can have some of the relaxation like saunas or
they have that kind of makes it fun and stuff
i guess it's getting late
i should take off
i appreciate that
that helped motivate me
try it
maybe just exercise at home
i'm going to try doing that
i haven't done it
i'm going to try it
you have a good night
what do you think about our involvement in the middle east
i hope that we get a chance to promote peace out there because i think without peace we're not going to get stable oil prices
i'd really like to see stability in that area because i'm always afraid that's where another big war is going to start not that desert storm was a small one
i suspect that if any world war is coming at this point in time they're going to come from there i would think anyway
i saw just recently where the u s is supposedly going to be putting pressure on all the the israelis supposedly to come to a bargaining table to
i heard that the israelis at least mentioned about giving up some of the golan heights
that would be interesting because i'm jewish
i'm actually sort of not really a zionist per se
i have a lot of friends who are sort of adamant israel
do whatever they want
i think they've been sort of hard nosed about the entire thing
in some sense the moderates may be right
they may be better if they give up just a little bit to settle things down
i guess it's one of those things that if it's going to really promote a lasting peace if there is not going to be a peace
then is it worth it at all
i could the way
the only way to think about it is they won
they sort of took over the
i don't know what to do about it
i think that in general the region is really in bad shape
do you think the u s is going to wind up keeping military bases over there
probably
isn't there a plan now to make a command center there or something
i haven't heard that
i haven't specifically heard anything about that
i just heard something recently about moving
there's some central command post in tampa i think that they now want to move to somewhere in the middle east
there was a small country or small city i think not actually in saudi arabia or anything but a little bit off to the east of it i think
they want to keep something over there so that they don't have to
i guess it's sort of so they don't have to move troops out so quickly or something
they want to keep some sort of central command post there
what i thought was interesting is that apparently the formal cease fire has not actually been signed yet
why only
you note it's only a small number of people have actually come back yet
i think that's actually the scariest part because what's happening in iraq right now in itself it being so crazy there
what do you know
it's going to be worse
i don't know
i have some friends in israel
coincidently my wife is syrian
i am
we are the middle east peace talks at home
we
i have some friends in israel
we talk a bit about it
we try and keep it out of the home life
do you
she is
i think it's for her not really relevant because she is second generation american
they recognize that syria's not the place that one wants to visit right about now
something about the place makes it not quite enjoyable
i've actually been there
i was there a couple of years ago when it wasn't sort of dangerous to be out there i guess
i do like it
i think i'm too americanized and
i do like the food
if that amounts for anything
who-
my house is kosher
it turns out that one of the strangest things about israel is that most folks don't realize that for all the food people think of as sort of jewish food and so forth
in general it really isn't the food that is eaten in israel
you typically think of it like bagels
right
turns out you don't really find bagels in israel
the same foods that you find in syria and egypt and everything else
you don't see a lot of
it's very different
i was very amazed when i sort of figured out for myself that everything i grew up with really wasn't israeli
it was more jewish
it is very strange
that starts tomorrow night
i a nice jewish girl for many years up in chicago
i was the only goyim at all the seder dinners and everything
i used to have to go with pocketful of change to buy all this bread the kids would see me
you've really got a handle on this stuff i've noticed
not
that makes you real good
we have the reverse situation
turned out that most of my friends aren't jewish
my wife's not
i sort of do a lot of these things
that
our first seder is tomorrow night
this is a rare exception
two years ago we had a seder
i was the only jew both nights
which to me is wonderful because it means that people who never would get to see this get to see it
my view is passover should sort of be
in my mind passover is sort of a generic holiday anyway because it sort of predates christ
they had the
matter of fact i just watched charles heston this weekend in the ten commandments
that's what always amazes me is that
my wife and i always sort of bring this up about her being syrian and my being jewish
not totally alike
it's amazing to think that people in the middle east sort of all hate each other
to me it's really
i guess i can intellectually kind of come to grips with all of that
emotionally i have a real difficult time believing that people that believe in god and love not war and to forgive can't get together
i mea-
even within the muslim religions different sects they can't get together
that's the part that i find really strange
i sort of understand somewhat
i
knowing the history i understand that the hatred of the muslims for the israelis or whatever
i can sort of handle that
i sort of think about the muslims sort of running around have jihad against themselves
that seems really weird
the catholics and the protestants up in ireland
None
same thing
i'll never understand it
didn't hurt me at the moment
i don't know
there's something about
everything i ever wanted to know i learned in kindergarten
it talks about how if we could just all get toge-
in the mi-
we all took naps
we all held hands and hugged
that's what kindergarten was like
wouldn't it be nice if we could solve all our problems by just sort of getting together and everyone in the world sat down and took a nap together
woke up and had snack time and then hugged each other as we left
it sounds like a john lennon type
my daughter talked to a student
in general most people doing this are t i
i guess customers too
i think a great number of students who got word of it and participated in general and voiced who heard about the program
t i got a lot of advances in it really
hopefully this will turn out to be a good program for us
we sure need the business
you've got the question you can go first there since i called
i rely primarily on newspaper combined with television
if i just use time
not say one which quality is the best
newspapers and t v would be tied after that because maybe i'll catch the evening news like ten o'clock on t v
that's a half an hour roughly the same with newspaper
of course you're in a different part of the country
i really listen to a lot of the talk shows i don't mean the gossip ones
there's a lot
on the weekends when i do chores or whatever
turn on
they have everything from lawn work lawyers news veterinarians all kinds of items
a real radio buff especially when i'm doing chores
i find it surprising because a lot of times it here
i'll mention some talk host
i'll expect them to have an opinion on why i don't like him and don't listen
what the guys name is bruce williams who does financial work all over the united states
i'd have to say i haven't either
he has it
it's five seventy here
he is again national and talks about a lot of financial things
the here i just get a kick out of
we do a lot of gardening here
i am kind of a radio buff
i listen to the radio probably five or six hours a week
almost inevitably to a station that is a classical station here
we have a television connected to a electronic alarm
system that kicks in
it comes on with c n n in the morning
we wake up to television news and shower and dress and whatever to that
because of the fact that my wife and i ride to work together in a car
that's good
we chat at each other rather than something else
occasionally what we'll each do depending on whoever is driving is have the newspaper sort of on our lap on the way in the car
we have the advantage of being able to read and drive although there seems to be from what i've seen on the freeway recently that a fair number of people are reading and driving
i also use newsweek magazine
we tend to alternate between newsweek and time and whatever happens to be the news magazine of the year for us
we get
i read sporadically of commentary and a couple of other trade magazines such as that where i might read the the occasional social and even current event commentaries and everything as diverse as a c m to some of the other tabloids i get
i guess i use about eighty percent written is probably my input and twenty percent television
i think i respect from a journalistic perspective current events
i've always said that it's really not interesting unless it's three weeks old and found its way into a news weekly headline
other than that it was a at best
we're probably not thrilled with our only newspaper that we have in raleigh
there are other
i'm not sure what you would call them the small competing independent sort of newspapers
there's only one daily called the news and observer fondly referred to here by some as the sometimes the noise and observer
it depends
it has decent national coverage but has an extremely focused political coverage probably steeped in
consequently everything is filtered through that republican democratic sort of
are you into any of that what's going on in the city council and the school boards and all that
we have
that is
we pay it sort of glancing nod
we have a very good friend who is tapped into the city planning structure our developer architect friend
i think we find out what's happening in the city on a fairly frequent basis over a gin and tonic sort of thing
that probably gives us a better insight as to the city of raleigh than the paper would have anyway
my wife and i as mentioned
the question was do you get it from people too
i can say the same thing you do that my wife she reads the paper from front to back
she'll tell me some stuff
she'll always get mad and say you didn't read the
i always read the sports
what am i thinking of the commentaries
she's always reading something
she says why haven't you read that
i say i never have time to read it like you do
i always get a lot of my information from the
i guess we do get it from people too
you mentioned c n n of course i mentioned radio and the c n n t v news
heard there was some stuff on the radio that was equivalent to c n n
it is c n n exactly
because
the reason i say that is on the radio they'll say look at this
when i first heard c n n it only started about since the war or right before that
they would always say look at this
there would be a pause
i realized that it's the exact commentary that you have on the the news
that didn't
it's still good
it's still
i do enjoy since the gulf war listening to c n n radio too as well as watching c n n on t v here at work
i'm at work right now believe it or not
where was i
your turn
we probably were listening to c n n fairly heavily before the war broadcasts began
we almost live and breathed it because during the war itself to the point where we began to sort of have household pact of lets turn the war off and get something done
i've heard that
almost an addition
we could equate or relate relay well to some of the newspaper and television articles about the fact that people where having this problem in uncoupling from the events and going on with their
instead of watching the missiles and being glued to the tube or whatever
because of that we began towards the middle of the war i guess about two and a half or three weeks in we began to restrict our news almost deliberately where we would watch fifteen minutes before fifteen minutes after six our time which would be national news or our local news
we would watch c n n until six thirty then we would watch a rotating network news of a b c c b s n b c
we sort of just rotated around the dial each night a different one
we would turn the television off
we were sort of limiting or dieting ourselves on news that way
we would do a similar thing at ten forty-five because c n n would be wrapping their hourly coverage up
we would get the local coverage
i think the local coverage we would tend to watch the same station that would have better state coverage rather than local coverage
three of the networks here on their local news
if you wish to listen at eleven o'clock you can find out who raped who murdered who or stole what
that was the sort of thing that i would say is the best
not news unless there's some trend or something that says this neighborhood has been hit forty-seven times or whatever that's sort of more of a pattern news
tell me about your home
it's our first home
it looks like it's going to be the last
they have scraped the plaster off the walls with riding their little toys through it and stuff
even places
it's past the dent stage
we're talking some of it's been peeled away
we talking from dents in the holes
i've got a daughter
one of them's seven
the carpet
it sounds like it's just the pits
it's not all that bad i guess
they're just real hard on it
i can see why people wait until they get in high school or maybe junior high
they get another one
we live in a mobile home
that's probably not typical america
seems like we're always working on it as i'm sure
because they're always ruining something
just like yours ours is always
something else goes wrong always
who knows it's always something with homes
you said you were in colorado springs
is that what you're in
i work for t i
then that's why you're doing this then isn't it
she saw this come up on the computer screen and ran it off and passed it to the people that were interested
it's not a hobby
i know i've been talking to people in ohio and virginia and i think california
the gal i talked to in maryland didn't own a car
she
she didn't understand
she lives on campus
buses and public transportation
her parents live by the public transportation
i wish we could down here
it would be nice
i kind of like the freedom too don't you
i tell you i'd sure like to be able to get on a bus or something and get to work
if i did it it would take me an hour and fifteen minutes
i would have to get on one and drive or walk to a bu-
they'd drive me to the main terminal here
if it's anything like
that's too much
there sure are a lot of people that work down there
i went down there a couple maybe three weeks ago for a trial
all these people were standing up that was during the workday all along the streets
just all around these vacant buildings just a lot of vacant buildings
they're just being demolished
they stink
that's terrible
garland how nice is it now
i think it might be up to two hundred and fifty thousand
i didn't realize when i moved here that it was a separate town from dallas
i didn't
where you from
i'm originally from lubbock
why did you move up to colorado
it's real pretty up there
i love it
back to the topic
it seems that more and more people are not owning traditional homes these days
everyone says
strange it seems that
they're doing some back pedaling
have you got land
we all taught
it was a two bedroom
we took turns
sharing the bedroom
we had two baths
it was just the little bathroom were the thing that really bothered me because i felt real closed in
mobile homes have changed a lot probably since you had one
ours is wood sided
it has a traditional v top
it's nine hundred and eighty square foot
you can imagine nine hundred eighty square foot broke up into two bedrooms one bath
it's comfy
i bet it's not bad
it's quieter than you remember mobile homes to be
how much is yours
when we bought ours we were paying three hundred twenty-nine dollars
our payments are like two twenty
it was still a lot cheaper
what
it was still a lot cheaper than what we gave because ours is thirty years
we bought one of the cheapest houses a tract house
whenever we got ours we picked it up used three or four years used
nice
there's not that much time left on the loan
if the economy gets better are you going to get another house
to tell you the truth right now it feels kind of comfy to have our mobile home and have it so close to paid for
it's like me to pickup and move somewhere else is easy
you wouldn't take that mobile home
when you talk about the deal i got it would be cheaper
especially if it were a paid move or something
there's some paid moves occasionally
they did
when i moved up here
they might want to move away
how many years you been up there
six or seven
a little bit
that's exciting
i'm a real scaredy when it comes to heights
once we got on top of the rocks it was quite
thanks for being home on the weekend
i'm actually working at night
there very few people that are on the list for calls on the weekends nights
sometimes i'm home
sometimes i'm not
if i am it's always fun to talk
are you part of the school system out there
i'm at north carolina state
the reason i said that because i've had about three calls and my daughter had one too from different students out of north carolina
i think i was the one who did that
is that ri-
i had a
is that right
i know about this project
i got my students to sign up
apparently a number of them have been participating
he had way more twice as many calls as as i've made
i'm
of course we at t i just hoping it works out that the new products that they come out will sell like gang busters
what do you think about latin america
let's see
i was planning a trip to latin america
i got warned off by some people
the crime rate in brazil makes it not a pleasant place to go and so on and so forth
i guess we were selling parts to the automotive industry or whatever
they had quite a few locations
i think the one in brazil is closed
i don't know why that is a problem down there
i guess the crime rate is terrible up here too
an
i don't have an answer to the crime rate
i'd like to go down to mexico
i keep hearing that the government and the crime rates pretty high too
that is sad
not that we can sell any great program we have with crime
i think i'm kind of like you
i guess maybe that's our biggest problem we have with our neighbors down there is that we don't have any
we don't really aren't that close to everyone in south america
i don't understand it either although i think a lot of south americans regard the united states as bullying
that's certainly from a historical point of view would be true
i was reading a spanish book not that i read spanish
i just reading some spanish words
there was a comment in there about the mexicans don't really want us to say we're americans
they would like to say that we're north americans because they're americans too
i guess that's true
i guess we're kind of the smart asses in the world i suppose or of america anyway
i think they're going to have
they can stand on their heads if they want too
i don't think that they're going to change that
north americans i think when you say that even i tend to think of americans and canadians
they were saying that of us that we're the north americans and they're americans
they want us to say we're the north americans
i see
they're south americans
i don't want to make
it's so interesting i just don't think mexico's problems are going to be cured by semantics
they were lucky enough to have some oil ten years ago
they blew all that and borrowed more money than they can pay back now
they're not exactly business men
i do have a lot of sympathy in that we're here in texas
for the language is very foolish
i'm relatively familiar with texas school system
we should teach spanish at least in grammar school four or five grades of it so that we can speak spanish
i think that helps when you certainly can speak their language
there are problems with the wet back problem
we should somehow
i think the governments are working on that to try to have some businesses at the borders of both sides so that you don't have this problem of them trying to come up here to get the jobs
i do feel for them
they are very envious of us or they wouldn't be coming up here risking a lot
not that they're risking their lives of course but risking a lot
getting thrown back i guess is all that happens
we see it once a month i'm sure in san antonio they see it more often than that
i grew up in los angeles
you saw it out there then too
in fact i drove a cab when i was a graduate student
i knew the hispanic part of l a pretty well
certainly knew that problem
knew about apartment houses that would have eight or ten or twelve people living in them sleeping in the same bed in shifts and all that
it was pretty wild
i think a common factor to a lot of problems whether it be crime if you want to jump on that is mostly poverty
i think a lot of their problems is poverty
if we could
the problems we have in this country is a lot of it's poverty
whether it's the people aren't trying hard enough to get out of poverty that's another story
it is sad
there's so much down in all of south america so much potential
t i of course is really pushing world markets in their products
they're mostly in europe now and in the orient japan and singapore now just announced building a plant in singapore
they haven't had that much luck in south america
there's got to be a lot of potential for business down there for the products certainly that we make and everything
there's got to be trade
i guess that's some of the answer i guess is business
i try to be an optimist and say well that's one way is to help any problem whether it be crime or certainly poverty obviously is to get some business going between each other
we need to do more of that somehow and encourage more business
they've got to have a lot of resources i would think an enormous amount of potential that way
there's got to be a lot of potential down there
what are you taking in school
i am
you're an instructor
i'm the teacher
very interested in voice systems and in speech recognition
of course this project is really one to collect a data base of casual speech in an attempt to get some kind of a model of what speech is like
of course i work at t i
i'm a little puzzled as to why when they get my voice one time why that isn't enough
i'm getting a kick out of the whole program
there's going to be i guess thousands i don't know how many thousands or tens of thousands of these recordings
i wonder how they're going to analyze them whether it would be listening to them or analyzing
they've got to be analyzing with a voice recorder some how
they record these
somebody transcribes them so that they have a speech signal
what is said
they're able to average it over a number of different occasions because peoples voices change a lot even from morning to evening
that's a big problem in speech recognition
i know mine has changed
although you never found
your voice echoes in your own head which makes it different than what it really sounds to other people
i'm sure singers and professional people know that
you always hear your own voice in recordings and say that's obviously that's not me
i know your voice in your own head resonates a different way
go ahead
you comment on it
i'm sure they have some of that now
not in computers but a lot of potential of course for handicapped people
my first thoughts on capital punishment i-
the first thing i want to say is no just simply because we as human beings don't have the right to take another human being's life
we are punishing someone for taking someone's life
in some cases we are punishing a person for taking someone's life
in effect we are committing that same crime
it sounds like you have really strong views on it
i can see that point
i also have this
i question
just to play devil's advocate
it never seems right to me that we take in people that are criminals and people that are low income or even middle income that are struggling to provide for their families
it just
that i find very difficult to swallow
one thing i don't understand is the whole concept of death row
there are thousands upon thousands of people on death row
i'm not saying that
i guess i am kind of saying what are we doing
i guess that's the same thing you were saying
what are we doing with these people
we should take some kind of action
take enough go a different route
they're just
when you think of the thousands and thousands of dollars that get burned in court costs
we could be poor people and
prison is such a waste of a human being
i do agree with your statement that to take a human life is wrong
None
locking someone up and not getting any benefit from that for the person or for society to me is wrong too
i guess i see both sides in that at the same time that i'm saying that we're committing the same crime
exactly w-
i also agree that if there is somebody out there that's crazy and cruel enough to kill somebody or in some cases kill several people at one time
i'm sure they haven't gone to court yet
apparently two teenage boys held up a taco bell
to me that is inhumane
for two people to be out in the world like that i don't want them in my world
i'm not for killing anyone
i don't want these people around
we want to remove them
i think that the whole crux of the problem is
that does basically
i think that the whole idea of the death penalty was invented for two reasons
it removes them from society
number two it's the ultimate punishment
because they've harmed someone
you want to appease the people that have suffered
it really doesn't take their pain away
at the same time like you said it drains society
it's a
the same money that we're using to build more prisons and make more prison space and keep these people in prison that same money or half of that money could be used towards rehabilitation programs of some sort
something to put these people back in society
prepare them first
the problem is so incredibly complex
i have a friend who works on the pardon and paroles
she interviews
she says it is just really frightening how easy it is to have the prisons release people because they're overcrowded
these people have not benefited from the stay there
she says just their emotional state and their way of thinking is so incredibly wrong there's not anything she can do to keep them in
those guidelines keep getting lessened and lessened because they have to do it to make the system work
you want people out of prison
you want people to get jobs and live happy lives
they can't just walk out of prison and do that
they can't just walk out of prison and say i'm going to go a different route
i know this costs money
it couldn't cost any more money than we're already spending
i would like to see the money that's been budgeted for new prisons being put into the research of alternate solutions to the problem
everyone's trying to make it in their own little world
i'm trying to make it with my job and make myself okay and make my family okay
it's so hard to try and be one of the movers and shakers i guess you would call them
it sounds like you are
when you have a voice you do contribute
i guess that's what we're meant to do
i'm a broadcast journalist
i feel like one day i probably will write a book or something
some of these views will be able to come out
you do
i'm a news reporter
i guess i'm pretty emotional about crime things like that now
i get to see pretty much close up a lot of things that happen that people don't see
i get to see a lot of crimes
i get to see people's pain and things
when we talk about
most of us are so sheltered
a few people in the news that bring it to us and make us see what's out there
you're really performing a benefit to society in doing that
still we can't
i guess i would like to probably editorialize more
we can't say this is what i think about
you really want to say what you think should be done or how you think this court case should have gone
that's a
i'm just agreeing with you when i think of it how difficult it must be to just to just give the facts because usually on an issue that you really care about you want to persuade people to your viewpoint
you're right
especially when you are dealing with a subject like capital punishment or something or abortion or something where there's an no or yes side
you have your side
you have to report both sides
you really don't want to because you have your side
you have to walk right down the middle with it
sometimes that's hard
that sounds interesting
i'll read your book sometime
it was nice talking to you
it's very hot
in fact i've been cleaning because i live in an apartment i can't do very much gardening other than balcony gardening
i have the little flower boxes with a lot of different flowers
i do enjoy plants
i don't have a yard or anything that i can do gardening
you're not the so-called ex-
the only recommendation i would have for someone who hasn't gardened is one get a couple of good books of books of course
usually they have talk shows
here in dallas they have two great talk shows that go through everything that will grow here which is the opposite probably of what would grow up where you are in fact you could easily do that now turn on a talk show up there and see if there's got to be some gardening folks on the radio that says when to put your grass in and what kind of grass to grow up in virginia and everything
i
for someone who doesn't garden i'd say that's my biggest recommendation is to
you enjoy gardening
i like it a lot
i'm with t i
where was
i like it
i always know that why i'm not a farmer when i garden though
it is dog work
it is tough i have a lot of trees down here
the wind blows all the leaves on from your neighbor after you rake yours
other than those three months when it's pure dog work the rest of it's very enjoyable just going through the experiences of putting little plants in or whatever i haven't had to plant any trees because i've got so many
i do listen to that talk show
there is some great people from texas a and m
there's some great folks that have been well trained and again to recommend gardening for this area
i'm sure it is different in the different areas
i'm originally from pennsylvania
i do go home on weekends during the summer and mow my mother's grass and different things like that
i would have no idea
you would have to learn that though
they're freeze out because the roots are all in the winter
do you have to start all over every year
i have to start all over every year except i do have some some day lilies that i don't do anything with
they seem to come back year after year
i leave them on my balcony even in in the snow and the winter in the ice everything because here not as severe as the snow is in pennsylvania
here we still do get some snow and ice and things like that
we have to bring them in here in the winter because usually if it's not below the ground so you can insulate the roots from freezing the pots will die
everything in a pot will die you can bring them
we do bring stuff in the garage and everything it's quite time consuming by the way
it's quite
i would definitely do it
whatever subject you pick do it the knowledgeable way don't go out there and start digging holes
get some books of whether it be pennsylvania or virginia as well as
then there's always a gardening part of the newspaper or communications as well as i bet there's a talk show up there right now that if you turn the dial around you'll
you'll find someone probably in the morning i don't know discussing what we do up in virginia to get something growing you probably don't have to do much over there
we're i guess in the ice age it's pushed a lot of limestone and everything
to some parts of dallas you just can dig a foot down and you hit solid limestone i think all the trees that are here now were planted kind of like the johnny appleseed type trees where people have come from
it's so scrubby
i think that we even got our famous hundred year old pecan trees from alabama and all that too we call them native pecan trees
they grow wild here
it's what they call pecan pie up there in the east
you don't sound like it
how many times have you called by the way
how many times have you been called
i've been called a lot
i've participated probably in about maybe i don't know seven calls i've called a couple of times
most of the time i notice that it takes forever to get a call through
today i got to laugh because i tried it this morning
i thought everybody was gardening
no no
this is a great subject because they're out there gardening
i don't know if you get c n n
it's here at work in fact i'm at work today believe it or not
they have t v in the break areas there was some heavy tornados i guess in kansas
uh-huh
tornados which is not the right subject
they blow through here all in the spring
i guess it's related somewhat to the weather and the plants and all that sometimes they do essentially nothing
the weather men yesterday were all alert
there's something really terrible going to happen
they sure were right
it wasn't in texas
they claim thirty odd people were killed up in kansas city kansas
back on planting
it is very interesting subject
when did you get a house
your trees grow up so well up there
i'm sure you have plenty of trees
that is a key thing for shade and keeping your bills down
where in virginia are you all
right now the district
washington in fairfax virginia
do you have the cherry blossoms in there or not
there's a few
not nearly as many as what's actually in the district
they're definitely enjoyable
there is a vast variety here of trees
if i look out my window right now i can see couple of pine trees some oak trees yeah
i haven't
it is wide open and flat again as i said i think when the indians were here there there weren't any trees
the civilization has brought all kinds of experiments with all kinds of trees
a lot of them have done well they do have some pine forest areas in east texas where you have native pine trees
here in dallas i think they all were planted by the classical johnny appleseed and johnny pecanseed whatever you would call it
there's a tremendous amount of pecan trees that we use for eating i think they thought that was going to be a great boom crop hundred and fifty years ago because they are all over the place in the south
of course i'm a t i
i'm hoping this works
t i is very good has done a lot of experiments in the uh-huh
speech synthesis
they've come out with some new products
in fact this week they came out with some new math
you might see them in your advertisements
new math
speak and math devices
they have had speak and spell and all that for years they've come out with some different ones this past week
my wife and everyone
what are they going to accomplish out of all this
i said you're not going to have to type on the computer one day
you're just going to have to talk to it
you
it's going to be much faster of course
like i can of course not that i can type very fast either
then what about people that
i personally work with someone that is deaf and cannot speak
she can't speak very clearly she in fact is a data entry person
she types away all day
i'll tell you why i feel so
i do know that in the where i live and i teach school there are so many orientals that have come here
there's a lot of mexican people too which is not neither here nor there
the fact is that all the orientals that are here are very affluent very wise in money matters and have taken over a lot of businesses
all the kids that i have that are oriental are really far above the american kids
the parents are unbelievable because they are just on the way up
money is their main goal
it really is kind of scary
you can not believe the businesses and corporations that have been taken over by orientals
it's kind of scares me not that i don't want them here and not that i don't appreciate the fact that they have rights too
my son once said that perhaps what we should do is buy a little square of land some place in the midwest
that might be the solution
because i lived in iowa for about
i was born in ohio
it really
there are a lot of mexican people here because we're so close to the border
they are wonderful people
None
just that you you feel like when you were born and raised here and you worked very hard to make this country what it is it scares you when you feel like somebody's taking over
a lot of these people plan one day to go back to vietnam or to taiwan or wherever they're from and take with them a lot of american dollars plus a lot of power in american companies
it's kind of scary
i don't know
i don't know the immigration laws that
i do not
in fact i don't know them at all
i do believe there must have been some sort of quota system because
it seemed to take them a long time
there was a lot of uncertainty as to whether they would be able to come
i think there's something about being able to claim imminent danger
i'm not sure what the terminology is
there you go
maybe that's an issue with a lot of people
i guess i haven't been in a situation where it's been threatening to me
i teach in the suburb of dallas
my kids go to school in another suburb of dallas with very very good school systems
they're considered one of the top three in the state both of them
it seems like a lot of the orientals make sure that their kids go to these schools
they're head and shoulders above a lot of the kids here
the kids in this area are very bright and come from parents that are professionals or semiprofessionals and very interested in their education
i think in the last year if i'm not mistaken in four of the six high schools the graduating class valedictorian and salutatorian were half or more oriental
they're just extremely bright kids
also they value learning
i was going to say i would guess that it's not that they are any brighter
they just maybe work harder
i think things come easy for them too
i do think that they have that work ethic that we somehow have missed the boat in with a lot of kids in the united states
they don't want to work for anything
they want it to come to them and be there
they don't want to work hard
these kids work really hard
they have
maybe part of that's the problem that here we've let this value slip
they need to have some competition
what i see is y-
instead of meeting the challenge they're starting to resent them
it's causing i think some problems
that's too bad
because we see a lot of racial problems in the dallas area anyway
it's mainly black and hispanic
there has been some resentment with orientals in the black community because they've started businesses there
the blacks resent them coming in and taking their money
there's been some violence because of it
that's really sad
it is very sad
i really
i've always prided myself
even when i was younger when i was in college i was a member of the n a a c p because i lived up north
i was very into the human rights part of everything
i've become very cynical in the last three four years living in texas
it sounds like you feel that there is need for change
there is too big of a concentration coming all at once to allow for adequate melting into the society
exactly
plus a lot of american dollars
in the long run maybe that's going to make a better world too
you just don't know
yet with
i'm going to ignore
i just
you really don't know what to do
i don't
both of my children are really more tolerant of blacks and hispanics than they are of the orientals
they feel like they've taken over
they feel like they're taking some of the rewards that they should have
i really don't want that to happen
it's happening
i think a lot of their friends feel the same way too
i really do wish i knew about quotas and really wish i
i would suspect that they have
i guess i don't have much
even if i really wish i knew the situations they were going back to or coming from
you feel you can't put yourself in their shoes or really understand them
for some reason orientals are very
i call them very that
they go get it
in stores and so forth it's wh-
in stores and things sometimes they can be very impolite because they get in front of you or they take something that you had in mind to get before you did
just going for it they take it quickly
they don't think anything of that
i don't
yet they have a right to be here
i know that
sometimes it's gets touchy
i'm sure it's a lot different
i'm sure that it's a lot different there
it's a lot different in iowa than it is here
i think as i recall in my son's class there were an awful lot of minorities
and of all varieties
i don't know
i guess i wasn't involved enough to really stop to think about it
since i teach i see it
i feel
i love the example that most of these children give our american children
yet i can see why some of the parents are fearful too
it's a kind of a touchy situation
i wish that we could all just learn from each other and not feel threatened
it doesn't happen that way all the time
it was good talking to you
it was good to talk to you too
i h-
have a good trip in california
have a good weekend
thank you
all righty
some is they're more educated than they used to be i think
i think sometimes leaders in government they've become more adroit in that area too instead of just men all the time
i probably a little bit older than you are
what i see is
the change that i see the most is that women have many more occupations and careers to choose from than when i went to college
there were very few women in business at that time
they were the oddity
now i see
i see for my daughter which is wonderful
i see a whole
i'm a teacher
i love teaching
i think there are a lot of other things i would have liked better
not that i would give the career up because it's a safe career plus because i always have a job plus i am a single parent too
i need the income
i think that's the reason why a lot of women have started to work too is because economically it's just a must
you just
most all
they always have
they're moonlighting else their wife works too
it's just an economic need now
i really think women have so much more responsibility as far as everything
like you said women today have so many
the average today of having a single family with the mother as the head
it just really so commonplace
the majority is married couple with children
still there's a lot more than there used to be
you never picture yourself in a situation like this
my mother always said get an education in case you need one because my father died when we were
we were eleven when he died
she had a nursing degree
she was able to make it
she said you never know what's going to happen
i thank god that i did go to college
isn't that funny because the same thing happened to us except i was twelve
my mother had a nursing degree and was able to make it in her profession
that they were able to do it
even today i think the chance for education is so much better for all of our girls
and boys too
the girls especially
i think it needs to continue to change
i think there's still not equality as far as paychecks for men and women
i think that we still have a long way to go
i think by the year two thousand it we're going to see a lot more changes hopefully that women are able to get the executive jobs
and hold positions that
if they want to dedicate most of their time to that they can do it
i also think that in the future that it's going to continue
i think that they're going to be really responsible and do everything just like what you said make the grade and make it so women can be the top people in their field
i think that's the way it should be
i think so
not that i think that i'm equal to men because there's a lot of things that men can do that i
it
i don't want to be equal
i want to get what i deserve
i want to be able to be on the same level with them
if i can do a job as well as i man i think i should get the same pay
i'm not a women's libber
i think
i feel like if there's a qualified woman to do the job and if she's good or better than a man then they should get the job with the same pay
i think that is happening more and more
i do too
it was good to talk to you
i don't have any i guess definite views about elderly care
the first thing that comes to mind is kind of those horror movies that you see
i think that's one thing that i would look at if i was putting my grandmother or my mother in some sort of home
as far as any court cases that came out of there the history of their doctors their nurses and things like that
a group that i'm a part of goes once a month to they call it the heritage house
it's a nursing home for elderly people
this particular one has people that are in pretty bad shape
a lot of them have had limbs amputated or have serious illnesses
that kind of thing
i watched
a new company bought it
hired new nurses and just redid it
just out of curiosity what kinds of things were they doing when they were considered a bad place
to me it was dirty for one thing
when you would walk in the smell was just
the floors
there were a lot of people just kind of up and down the halls laying in their beds hollering and crying
my goodness
of course i don't know how many of them were not in their right mind
i feel like they were neglected
yeah
neglect to cleanup
i don't really think anyone was being cruel or trying to mistreat them or anything
i just think they were not doing anymore than they had to do
just kind of letting everybody live in a not very good environment
this new company came in
like i said they remodeled the place
it smells nice when you walk in
it looks nice
they got several new color t v's for the people
and redid the dining room where they made it a lot more place for them to be
just small things that make it seem a lot more homey
it's a lot more like an apartment place instead of just
i would personally hate to know that my mother or grandmother or anyone is in a home like that
my biggest fear is that they would be lonely
i would like to know that there are just a lot of activities like you said just putting a plant in a room
just brightens and
just to know that they're not laying in a room
looking at gray walls
that's what would just really kill me
i'd like to know that they have friends there
maybe some kind of activity little field trips or something
they
everyday they have schedules of groups that come in
they will do bingo
other groups come in and do the services other sundays
that they have at least one service every sunday
there are a lot of things
you really do have to kind of seek it out
i know our church does it
there are a lot of other churches
they are just like civic organizations
i have other friends
they also have a dog that maybe needs a home
they will wash it all up
and make sure it's a friendly animal
and take it in and just let the old elderly people pet the dogs
that will be something they would look forward to if they knew that the puppy is coming on wednesday
that would be something to look for
doing the best they can
it
i know it's hard for a lot of families if you're trying to work or trying to take care of your own family
it's kind of hard to because an elderly person sometimes can be totally dependent
on you
i know that's hard sometimes
it would really have to be a last resort
unless i knew that they were somewhere just really great
that they were really enjoying
i have interesting conversations with a lot of these people because many of them of course their minds are not good
a lot them have told me exactly the same story
the next time i go it's the same thing
just somebody to listen to them
just seems to make them really feel good
he has cerebral palsy so bad that he just cannot communicate
he's blind
he has seizures
he's just in a world of his own
yet he wants so much
if you come over to him if he can touch your hand he'll grab it and kiss it
he's always got a smile
he really tries to brighten up your life
it's just amazing
he can't say anything
i would really like to be a teacher
i don't think i could do it because i'm very very emotional
the minute something happens
i cry on hallmark commercials
i mean something real life i just
i always go and do an education things
i meet these kids who are dropping out of school left and right
all the sudden they're in this program
i just want to hug them
i could just imagine working in a home like that
those people they're so sweet and so genuine
all they want is just for everything to be happy
None
that would probably just tear me apart
it does
one of the neatest things i think though is we always take our kids
they have gotten comfortable being around these people
the people love them
they want the children to hug them or hold their hand
so far my kids will do it just real easily
i think it's because they've gone since they were real little
they've never been afraid
that's something
need to
as we walk through the lobby they'll all say bring her here
usually a of elderly people they like to share their experiences with the younger children
they feel like they've lived life
they need to share it
i'm sure i'll be like that too
me too
that's great
it really helps those people i think
like you said i'd really have a lot of second thoughts before i put any of my own family members there
i would hate it if anyone put me in one
i know
i'm always afraid like
nice to talk to you
i think one thing about pets is they're a lot of company
you can tell them anything
they won't tell anybody
that's unconditional affection
do you have a pet
my pet was hit by a car new year's eve
i'm so sorry
that's good that you're going to get another one
i know some of my friends who have pets
they just are really
the ones that have dogs are very protective of them
i think that's one reason they have them especially older people that i know that have pets
they just really take care of them or are protective of them
it's kind of nice
you come home your pet's there for you and wants a little food a little attention
my kids
they really want a dog badly
they've been looking and looking
want
i don't know do you like
it was kind of indoor outdoor
it was
i don't care for the smell of the litter box
my cat was trained to go outside
when i had a cocker spaniel it was an outdoor dog
i think i liked that better
i think
i think that
kind of like big dogs
you have to have room for them
dogs take a lot more care than cats do
cats are pretty independent
they keep themselves clean
if you raise them right you don't have to worry about the litter box thing where with dogs you really do have to let them out and take them for walks and things like that
i see all the people on sunday going for a walk with their dogs
i'm kind of skeptical with my son getting a dog
mom gets to take care of it or something
i gue-
he was out of town last weekend
of course the dog is not trained for anything yet
it was go over there and clean up after the dog
that's exciting
that's a major chore if you don't keep up with it
kids kind of
they want the fun part and not the work
i think it's really important to that if you get a pet that they're spayed neutered so that we're not just going on with this pet population and having to
that kind of gripes on me some
i don't know
if you're going to have a pet
and not have it neutered or spayed you need to be willing to deal with the consequences
i think
just seeing the miracle of birth that's a neat thing to experience as a kid and understand
it was a real positive thing
on the other hand you don't want to be one of these people that dumps the kittens off on the side of the road
they're getting old now
it's time to get rid of them
that's good too
i think that's all i have to say
we had kind of a hard time finding someplace we could put michael's goods
he was going to school at five
he started the first grade when he was five
you had trouble finding somewhere for him to be before he was five
we could
it was
it's really hard to find someplace where you can send your child and expect him to learn something
that's
yeah
you do have to pay if you
parents pay when they stay home with them anyway
my wife works
if i had any children i hope that i'll be in a position to stay home with my child because i'm not real trusting
i don't know
especially today
i just see different things all the time
people are just crazy these days
it takes me a long time to just trust someone as a friend
much less to trust someone with my child
we took our time
we checked it out
we found a preschool for him
it
through other folks where i work
through other folks where we worked we found a nice preschool
i guess that's the best way to get
i don't think i would have left him anywhere that would
before i left him somewhere that
i don't think i'd take that chance
i think it's out of sight or out of mind
you've got to be sure
not that they're going to abuse your child or anything
you never know
you just have to be sure that they're going to be watching them
that they wouldn't let them drink something or eat something off the floor
you
and who you can't
then you hear so much on the news about child care places
also senior care facilities you hear abuse
you just don't know
you almost want to spend a couple of weeks in class with your child just to see how it is or something
you have no children at all
i'm twenty-three
it's just not in the cards for me right now
back to the subject
it's tough
it's hard to find someplace where you can leave your child and trust that he's
you brought up a good point
you would hope that maybe they'd come home and know some of their a b c's or something
he's doing real well
it has paid off for him
he's got a second grade reading level and a fourth grade math level
those early ages when his mom and dad are at work
we could have sent him to anybody
there's a lot people at work that would have baby-sat him sending him to a preschool where he actually learns something
his attitude is i think a little bit
his
did you take this same route with your other two children
they were outside my marriage
i don't know
all my children
they're really good
i guess no
it helps that he has older brothers
just to have role models and things like that
in one way we're kind of lucky because they're all boys
in another way we're not so lucky because we don't have another woman in the house for my wife to share
None
we faced that too
he learned quite a bit not only from nursery school
he learned quite a bit from the older boys
he's excelled
it's paying off for him
he is pretty smart
what kid isn't
i think it's really nice to know that you can find someplace
i don't know how it is down there in waco
in lubbock we have a few that you can send your children to
they can actually learn something instead of just being baby-sat
do they have any kind of program at t i or wherever your wife works
i know they're putting that into a lot of corporations now
maybe that will be an option for
it would be nice there
then i foresee that being just a baby-sitting thing not much learning but
where we sent michael the first few years there was different teachers all the time
some substitute teachers in the afternoon
they actually taught him something instead of just watching him all day
they had a group of kids
they put on skits
they put on plays
they did the halloween thing
it was important to us
we took a good look at it and made sure it was going to go that way
do you think it would have been better for him to have maybe one continuous teacher somebody that he could
is it better the other way with a lot of different
as a child growing up i think is a task that belongs to his parents
he attached himself to a couple of those
i think his attachments at home
he gets the idea of what school is for
i have different teachers
this person can teach me one thing and this person teach me another
i really can't say that it's important for him to attach himself to anybody
with another child i can't say that
i don't have that experience
i can't say that
he did well
i don't think we made too many mistakes
it sounds good
he learned from it
that was the most important thing that we wanted was for him to learn not just to sit there and be baby-sat all day
baby-sat sounds to me like you're here i guess i'll watch you when i get time
maybe i'll clean my house maybe i'll cook you lunch
maybe i won't
they'll probably sit him in front of the television
while they do other things
None
we had a good experience
we really did well
that's good
he served better than we did
he actually gained from it
i think in the long run he gained from it just being somewhere where we learned something
it's important
just really look into
it will take me a long time to find somewhere i'm sure
just because i want to be so positive that my children are okay
as well as the other children in the center
his mom didn't go back to work until when he was six months old
we just didn't want to dump him somewhere
we wanted his center of attention at home
it worked out real well
it's a lot more difficult these days because you have both parents working a lot of times
you have to find day care
whereas here
i'm not making seventy or eighty thousand dollars a year
child care's a necessity whereas years ago the husband basically worked and the wife
mom was allowed to stay home
there was a few families outside of that where dad stayed home and mom worked but not very many that i know of when i was growing up
i'm forty now
when i was a kid mom was always at home
we didn't
i think that has a lot to do with just all children how they learn and things just because the basic family is breaking
it's not there
i think that plays a big part in a child's learning and you know what they can and cannot do in child care
let's start with you
i liked it a lot because it had a lot of music in it
who was in that
it's robert townsend movie
i don't know all the actors or anything
it was a lot of music a lot of old songs things like that
it's still out now
it was called the dells
it was kind of like just about their life and their history and things like that and how they went from stardom to nonstardom
that was pretty good
that won best picture i think
costner got best director
right now kevin costner he's starring in everything
he's doing the kennedy movie that's coming out
there's one
another kennedy movie
let me see
he's doing some other movie
he's going to be in also
let me see
i not sure about the name has meryl streep
what was the name of that
the ba-
the premise of the story is that after you die you go to a place called judgment city
i know what you're talking about
None
i can't remem-
the other actor
defending your life
it's an excellent movie
it's pretty entertaining
what else have i seen lately
not all time favorite
one of my favorites
did you ever see home alone
i heard it was really good
i've just haven't gone out to see it
that was a good one too
i need to see it
fatal attraction i don't know why i like that movie so much
i like suspense
did you ever see this is going way back jagged edge
that was a good one too
i liked the woman that played in that
she played in narrow margin which was a little more recent
that was kind of another suspense type alfred hitchcock type thriller
god i guess i haven't seen too many movies lately
it's hard for me to get to movies now because it's getting so expensive
i'd rather rent
then you end up spending another six dollars on food
that's just for a bucket of popcorn
a pop
it gets pretty
if i
if i take a date
it cost me twenty bucks easy
i don't know
you're usually going to go to dinner or something with that
i was going to say you can find certain restaurants that are nice
and have good food eat for thirty dollars
it's almost more fun
it's almost more fun really to rent movies just kind of stay at home maybe
that's what you're dealing with
then you can make your popcorn and be comfortable
that's about all the movies i've seen recently
i ought to open the paper here because i know i've seen a few that have played
None
did you ever see kindergarten cop
there's a movie i do want to see
what is it
it looks pretty suspenseful
i don't recommend that
as much as defending your life
it was all right kind of funny
did you see that
that might be one of my all time favorites too
it was pretty scary because i was visiting a v a hospital near to where i live
they were saying that some of the patients there you can't leave by themselves because they'll make a weapon out of anything
out of a piece of paper they can kill somebody
this guy in silence of the lambs hannibal lector he was that kind of person
that's what was so scary about the movie
because he was such an awesome character
it was really fas-
you were kind of on his side because he was so fascinating
they couldn't leave him alone at all
they found out what happened when they did leave him alone one time
i won't tell you that just in case you see the movie
i'll probably try to see it in a little while here
very good
it's been out for a while
have you heard anything on out for justice
i haven't heard anything about it
i don't like steven seagal things
has he had very many other movies out
there was one right before that with a similar title
i don't know some macho title
i don't like that a lot
they're action filled and a little bit of humor
None
i like the movies that make you think
did you ever see sleeping with the enemy
that's something i really should have seen
i haven't heard much lately
she said it was okay
you expect more out of julia roberts though
i never did
i saw half of it
i remember i was in school i saw half of it
i fell asleep
everyone else watched it
i remember that movie
it was
i got in to it
they have f x two out
i probably had a test that day or something
it's
it
kind of on that end
it's usually pretty good
i think though that movies are losing their luster
i think it's just losing its originality or something
i can't pinpoint it
it doesn't seem like it's as big rage to get the movie theater as it used to be
i
i don't know
it's hard to say
i know i don't
i don't keep up with it
i don't try to
just for that reason it does cost a lot
why go out and see something right away
if something gets really good reviews maybe you'd finally go spend the twelve bucks
to go to it
i haven't been to an opening for ages
i get my current events basically from news just because i watch
pretty much a lot of television
is it c n n or headline news or just local
i like to tune to c n n because you can tune in any time of day and pretty much get the update on
i think news today it's kind of losing its importance
on radio if you hear any news at all it's like two seconds
really quickly
on commercial radio i guess i tend to get more of my news from national public radio of the morning on the way to work
None
i do here
university of texas at dallas
i'm a news reporter
i usually don't intentionally although i don't intentionally turn on the television to watch news
i don't intentionally turn on the radio to listen to the news
i will intentionally buy a newspaper
you pick your favorite section
the rest
i like to listen to national public radio on the way to work because i don't know it's variety
is it pretty good coverage on there
they throw in a lot of interviews and commentaries
they present different sides of things
i find like on k r l d
each story is no more than two or three lines
they spend a little more time
they go into a lot of the issues and things where they spend five or ten minutes discussing something and
especially when you look for the popular radio stations like mostly the music stations news is pretty much nonexistent
they have little teeny-weeny news
breaks
only in the morning i guess there's a little bit
let's see
i guess i get some kinds of other business related news through trade journals and things
the only reason i get trade journals is if i'm looking for a job or something
i think news is
i think it will be pretty much
now it's kind of your final choice
i think it
it takes a lot more time to read something
you've got news
you
i think that soon the paper may be kind of the only source again
just because i'm thinking that it's getting so short on radio
you have two or three
i know in dallas you can probably get two all news radio stations out of i don't how many popular radio stations
on television you have just the news at six and ten
i just see that dwindling in
i find it hard to believe that people will go back to reading over television just given the way society is
i enjoy reading
most people would rather turn on the tube and
flip through the channels and get the headline news at thirty minutes of
they don't have to go get one
one thing i like about the paper as opposed
every point they make
it's all there
that's why i like national public radio because they get on one of these little things
they'll get into something and really explore it
it's informative
it's a lot more informative than quick half hour news shows that they tell you what they want you to hear
that's what we do
it's like each story is thirty seconds
it's like you really have to tell as much as you can which is not much in that amount of time
it will probably get shorter and shorter as the years go by i think
communication expands the world now
we saw it during the war just now is that we got all the information within minutes
the question is how some of it
i guess there's a lot of debate about censorship and what we're really seeing
is it the true story
is it a little bit biased
even though we do get the story right away they were censored as to what they could tell us
all we had to sit here and ask is what aren't they telling us
that was pretty scary
she said that she didn't want to know what was going on because if she had a son over in saudi arabia she wouldn't want to know that they're bombing or this and that's going on
at the same time i talked to another woman
she was so happy to know because she lived through vietnam
she didn't know what was happening at that time
she was so happy to get the information
there's just a lot of different opinions on that
i like to know what's going on
you get in the habit of like i say turn on headline news
it will play over and over
you just tune it out because it's the same thing
too a lot of times i think especially on television they blow things completely out of proportion
this kennedy thing
what kind of shoes did he wear on the night
it's just like okay this is ridiculous
who cares
what are you doing
it was nice talking to you
not necessarily in dallas
it's a very short drive to areas near here
i have done camping in the past
i can't remember when the last time i actually went camping was
it was several years ago
i did most of my camping in the mountains
that must have been fun though
it is
i have some land there
it's handy to station yourself there on the land and then make trips up into the mountains for backpacking and hiking and overnight camping
that sounds fun
one of them i don't really consider camping
it was at a camp
i don't like those camping grounds where you got r v beside you and then another people in tents beside you
it doesn't
the first time i left him we went overnight camping
we went and we found this little peninsula out in the middle of nowhere by the lake
we had a ball
we just had sleeping bags and fire going
we fried potatoes and bacon and everything for breakfast the next morning
it did
my sister-in-law she's always done a lot of camping
she's good
if you don't you'll find every rock on it
she is always prepared
she brought everything from like i said toilet paper to the rake
the only thing we'd had to do we had to go out looking for some kind of a grill
we seen this old refrigerator that somebody had dumped we broke the i guess it's the freezing component we broke that out of there and put it over our hole
what a clever idea i wouldn't have thought about that
it held our pan and the potatoes and stuff
that's a good idea
if you get a chance
there are some really nice camping areas up in the wichitas which is in oklahoma and arkansas
it's on the oklahoma-arkansas border
it won't take but just a quick look at a map to find where those mountains are
i took a drive up through there as a matter of fact last september just took the drive through to see what was there
i love to swim
i like to get out by a lake or a somewhere close where we can swim
lake tawakoni is a pretty nice place we had a two bedroom mobile home there
the boys still liked to throw their sleeping bags out by the lake and build a little fire and roast their marshmallows until the mosquitos bit and then they came in
they're grown now
they don't go camping with you
i haven't taken my little boy yet
he is so fearless it terrifies me
don't be concerned
it's the water he's not scared of
it's easy to keep him occupied though on land
i've them walk with me along the lakefront we'd have a little contest finding the tiniest shell and finding the biggest shell
we'd hunt pine cones we climbed some pinon pines one year and gathered the cones so that we could eat the pine nuts
we did a lot of naturalist work when we were out
we searched for
we ate the wild plants
we gathered wild berries
it's really the mountains can accommodate you if you know what to find
i had my boys build their own little three leg camp stools by cutting a branch off the tree and binding them together with bark
that sounds so neat
we cooked in a pot
i'm impressed
they've always done a lot of camping
there wasn't
we just didn't get out
my mother wasn't into that
that's who i stayed with
we didn't do much outdoors stuff except swimming we went swimming a lot
my baby's getting sick
if our time is up we can quit
i've got to clean her up
what's it been doing up there
all the farmers
it's good for hay
i'm working for a lady who has a strawberry field
if we don't have rain she's going to lose a lot of money
my goodness
we have been drenched
we have had so much rain for may and june that we've got all the weather people down here really confused
it's just
it's quit raining by at least a month
it's still
i hope they come
i don't know where it came from
it's been really
we got a lot of
it feels like we live in houston
it
it rained today
it just kind of steamed everything up
it's been great because we haven't had to use our sprinkler system
it's hard to plan anything outside just because they show up out of nowhere
everyone up here with their gardens they're not going to have much of a garden this year because it's so dry
i hope you get some of that
we're still forecast for more
is california getting rain then
i'm not real sure
it's meeting what's coming out of the gulf
it's just causing chaos
these are good summer rains electrical storms and all that
it's been wet
we've moved our yard i think three or four times in the last two or three weeks
my gosh
just because it just keeps growing and growing and growing
one week it just rained thunderstormed for a day straight
you couldn't get out there
by the time you finally got out there where your lawn mower wouldn't sink we were
now we need
it's really drying up here
what always works for me is if i water my plants or we wash the car it usually rains
it's surely going to rain
we
let me think
we w-
i don't know
your talking september maybe
you know it was nippy it was still in the seventies
high sixties low seventies in march
we were in new jersey last october it was hotter there than it was here
i was like i want to go home
because we packed to cool off brought shorts and sweaters and everything
we just died
my gosh
i like it here
i wouldn't trade it for snow any day
i like the snow
i like to watch it fall
i just like it where it's deep enough but not
i can handle a vacation in it
my husband is from new jersey
he wouldn't go back either
isn't it weird at christmas time without snow
see last year we had snow at christmas time
it was weird because we had snow
no
in fact we're used to running around in spring clothes in december
when it throws in a real cool winter we get broken pipes and all that kind of stuff because texas just isn't built for real cold weather for long periods of time
it's real dry down there
not were we are
now in houston and stuff they've got it where no hairsprayer works
here it's just about right
it's pretty dry and not too dry where it hurts to breathe
we're just about right
we're just having all this rain
late rain has made it kind of uncomfortable
we're right in a good stop because we get over the hundreds in the summer
it's a dry heat
it's not really as hot and muggy as it would be being over a hundred plus ninety percent humidity
that's what's bad up here is when we do get the real hundred and the high nineties we have the humidity to go with it
you're real mucky
you
your legs stick together just from walking
we like it where we're at
no
people forget that they're live in texas
they don't know how to drive in snow
i wouldn't trade it for anything
that's good
i visited other areas
i'm just a sun person i think
i don't know
i guess that's really about all
in this case it's the only thing to talk about
michelle it's great talking to
the last movie that i have seen
it's been a couple of months
i saw sleeping with the enemy and flatliners
did you see those because of julia roberts or
it was just
someone had
i thought i'd like it
one of my friends who went to see sleeping with the enemy she told me to go
that's why i saw that one
i've seen
i haven't gotten to see any real recent ones
that one is it's cute but kind of far out comedy
i am not one for the
i don't need the suspense movies or
i saw it because my wife wanted to see it
on the other hand i'm not sure i would have gone otherwise
having gone
it really wasn't on a theme that i was that into
as i say i prefer the light movies that
my style of entertainment is comedy primarily and then into action films
uh-huh i didn't care for the movie myself
you kind of have to like to be drawn to this point where you aren't sure what's going to happen
it was interesting
i felt that one was a bit farfetched
in that
i'm trying to think of the other one i saw recently the one on defending your life
i haven't even heard of that one
that was one where
the story line
it was hard to accept that this multimillionaire wheeler dealer would find himself and allow himself to get into that situation
i really liked pretty woman
i just
you just kind of went with it
flatliners it's a drama
i don't usually like them
i really enjoyed it
i don't know
did you care for that one
that was
i guess i hate to be too surprised in a movie
in that one you could pretty well guess where it was
you knew where it would end up
i didn't
it wasn't something that i would enjoy seeing twice or three times
i didn't think so
when
i don't know
of course a bunch of girls had told me and warned me
they said it's a real tearjerker and da da da da da
meanwhile i sat through the movie and said when are you supposed to start crying
whenever she starts crying
i didn't really find it to be a tearjerker
do you go to many movies more than once
if i see them more than once i see them on video
like you said i enjoy the comedies a lot better
these days it's
with some of the movies if you don't go to them within the first four weeks the movie may have left town never to show up again until it comes back in video
unless a movie is popular and stays around you probably will see it on video these days more likely than at the movie
we have
i think just most people have v c r now
we probably watch twice as many movies at home as we do at movie theaters
i can't think of the name of it now that
it was a drama
it wasn't a comedy
at least what i hear on that one that it's coming out a second time in a longer version even though it was a long movie
we'll have to see because there was some talk about that
we're sort of in the middle of the summer season of a lot of new movies coming out
then there's these periods like early fall before christmas or early spring when there's sort of a quiet period where if you bring something out again it will increase the revenues from the movie
what movies are showing down there now
i'd actually have to get a newspaper out
my approach to movies is i kind of hear about them
ask me to name the ten that are out there right now
i'd have to say i don't know
i just look at the newspaper before i decide to go
i know for sure that that one about
it's kind of
some of them they'll start in one area of the country
if they it's
i guess first of all i'll just say we haven't done much gardening
our gardening we lost
we lost our bushes in those and have been waiting to plant new ones
as far as our bushes we don't have any
we do have some blackberry bushes
they were really hearty and stayed on
we've done really well with them
they've been really good
the kids i
we go out
it's hard to go out when it's this hot
keep the weeds out of them and keep them off the ground so the ants don't eat them
they're okay
i love blackberries
we
when i was smaller my family lived in tennessee there used to be wild blackberries that we'd go out and pick my brother and i
i don't have any down here
we have some flowers that have
they're bold
they come up every year
they're getting too thick
they're orange
they look like a lily sort of
i think they're real pretty when it rains because their petals don't soak the rain in
they keep the rain on the outside little rain drops
they look real pretty after the rain
i really like them
i need to get out and
as far as our grass it grows crazy
sometimes my husband does it
sometimes my son does it
it just is
i don't know
we can't seem to get ours green
my neighbors on either side of me have beautiful lawns
we have this god awful ugly thing
i know they must think
my husband got some new fertilizer and stuff
he put it on the front yard to see how it would do and stuff before he put it on the backyard
we've got a great dane in the back she has eaten everything i have put out there
she's eaten the bushes
i've tried to i spent like eight hours planting this nice garden out there i barricaded it up
i went and took a shower and looked back out there
she was already in it
i was so mad
i can't do anything back there because she destroys it
i've tried out in the front
like you said that freeze that came
i had some shrubs i put out front
it killed those too
i'm just real discouraged with the whole thing
the other problem that we have
it's funny because the two bushes on the ends of the house that i think are ugly they lived
that happened to us
i wanted to go out and kill them too
the
i know
we just can't grow grass underneath there
i've got two good size cottonwood trees out in my front yard one on either side of the yard
they're big
they're real full and everything in the summer time
it's killing everything underneath where the leaves are shading the tree
toward the end of the summer when everything starts dying off and whatnot and then the light can get through the tree then the grass starts growing
by then it's so late then the winter comes and it stops
it's a never ending cycle
we've been trying to get something or to pull some grass underneath there and whatnot
i don't
we've been thinking if we built up
some new bushes in there that would live
i think that we're going to try that
i
i have two long windows
i'm trying to decide whether to put bushes in front of them or not
maybe just halfway up the window or something like that so people can't see and hear too much
i don't really have to worry about that that much because my sons' bedrooms are in the front
they've got mini-blinds and stuff
only one is really
the other one is out on the porch
there's not really much i can do about that
one is a bedroom for our oldest son
one is
i really
the flowers are out by the back of the house
that's why the front room is
that's not too bad
i like to look at the flowers
i look at theirs
it's funny because you try so hard i think sometimes to do our yard it's like the wind blows
even if you did get it under control it seems like in just a few
it's really
a lot
it's not my favorite
mine's getting there
i do half
and do it to where i don't have to go back out and redo it
that's my only thing with him
that's why i'm having him help me now
some of the things i like to do are
i sew i like to sew sometimes for my kids
i sew clothes for them every once in a while
i'm beginning to get a little bored with cross stitch
i have to bring it back
i don't know why that is
i don't know if it's looking at the little
it reaches a point where it doesn't seem to be very challenging i think
yet there's
i do a lot of it in the car
do you
we commute from plano to dallas i have nearly an hour both ways that i can really get a lot of work done
i bet
i found that cross stitch is the easiest to do in the car
i've not really done too much challenging stuff
i can do it with a needle and thread and get about five small stitches in which is pretty good
it's very long
i bet
it's such a lost art
i like to just mostly do the tie quilts
the other ones are very pretty
instead of yarn they tied ribbon into it
it's real pretty
when i look at it now i think why didn't i learn these crafts and skills from her because she could crochet and do so many of the old things that aren't in vogue right now that people just don't know how to do
did you say you could knit
i was going to say because if you could knit you could crochet
it's just like doing one handed as long as you learn how to weave the yarn in between your fingers on your left hand
you just use your right hand with the hook
that's not
i think if you can do any handicraft you can learn to crochet
i'm totally intimidated if i sit down at a sewing machine
i get real nervous whereas usually the other needlework stuff is relaxing to me
i just have a phobia about not being able to actually sew
yet i think about
there are some beautiful just gorgeous patterns that people do
i just think that that's one of the arts that i think are really pretty
a lot of people don't do that either
None
it's hard to find the time
i wouldn't if i didn't have this car time ability probably because at night if i sit down i'm doing something with the kids or just not sitting down at all
i always think i can do this and watch t v or something
it seems like i always get my mind carried away to something else
it doesn't quite work
it's so i find myself putting glasses on to watch t v and then taking them off to do needlework
i get frustrated doing that
i like to sketch
i can sketch something like if i see a picture like out of a book i can sketch that that's nice and everything
it's funny
yet i can't do like craft on wood
i certainly can't create
i look at it
you look at those things
you wish so badly that you could do them
sometimes even with that i think you have to have some
mostly a little fresh water fish
mostly lake fishing like rainbow trout and stuff because i used to live in utah
down here i haven't fished much in texas
they're really not
what kind of bait do you use to catch them
just usually worms night crawlers
i didn't know that
just little fish eggs
it will stay relatively well
i didn't know that
yeah they really like that
i have never caught catfish
look catfish
is that right
in amarillo did you fish any of this
i always used to go to my grandparents' in oklahoma they have the lake texoma right next to them
we used to catch some sand bass off there's a roosevelt bridge
what we'd do is let the line all the way to the bottom and crank up turns on the reel about six to twelve times
the fish would be sitting at different levels
how about that
in no time something would hit it
you could pull them up two and three times in a row
you had to find out what level how many cranks they were off the bottom
if you left it on the bottom there was a good chance that you'd catch catfish
of course depending on how big your bait was would be depending on what you caught
i think that is really interesting
we used to have a light at the top of the water
i wish i could go fishing here because i don't really know much about the fishing here
if you did it like you were just saying that's pretty much like rainbow trout
you wait they troll it a little bit
if you
if you can fi-
even a lake
seems like every time somebody's on the bank all they want to do is throw it out just as far as they can and bring it in to you
it's the opposite when you're fishing from a boat
you want to make it land right on the shore and then drag like a plastic worm and just have it come into the water like a regular animal or fish something coming off from the bank like they usually do
you don't have to really get fish from a boat because they're actually right there at the shore
i didn't used to be sold on plastic worms
if
it just a slow reel
let it sit on the bottom
the key is to always have your line tight
that way you can feel when they're hitting it
believe me you'll know the difference
what kind of fish do you like the best to eat
crappie
do you
i also like spanish mackerel
you catch blues
that's a different kind of fishing off the pier too
tell me
my neighbor has gone before and done that
the best thing for crappie is those little spinner baits and jigs
they have like yellow fuzz on a hook that kind of comes out
i know
they're sort of like i want to say flies
not exactly like
they're a little heavier
they're bigger
you don't even have to have a good rod or anything just even a regular line you throw it out
the other thing that's real good is small
they're all silver something real shiny about that long
she has a lot of those little
they're just real colorful things onto her end
she's really a good fisher woman
you sound like you're a good fisher woman too
i am a substitute teacher at this point looking for a full-time job in the public school
then you should be a good one to know because my children are grown now
i don't have firsthand experience right now
what do you think
i think the public school systems are doing a good job
i think that they are starting to head towards more technology and getting the kids computer literate earlier
you know my kindergartners were on the computers
i think that with the way the world is today that's got to be done
i think that the schools now are starting to teach thinking strategies more than just giving them skills
i think that that's something that is drastically needed because most of these kids cannot think
that just
this has been one of my pet peeves and probably why i went into education
i think they're trying to head them into teaching them to think and use the education that they have
i think that's very very important
i agree with you that they're starting children so much earlier on things because our grandchildren
we have a fourth grader
we have one that's in kindergarten
i know the fourth grader is doing stuff that our children were doing in the fifth and sixth grade
it's amazing
her pre-algebra book is higher then
it's like i going to take this home and study it before i can help you
they're really moving them along
that's wha-
i think that it's appropriate to teach them why they are learning this not just because the teacher says you have to learn this
are you finding that since you're doing substitute that you're wanting to do full-time
i have a friend that's a teacher that one of her complaints is she can't teach because she's so busy filling out all the forms
d-
do you find that
as far as i'm concerned you can make a survey or test scores say anything you want it to say
it's just a matter of how you're going to interpret it
you waste so much time quote unquote teaching to the test to make sure that your scores are the very best they're possibly going to be
that i think it's crazy personally
the whole first nine weeks of school is used as a review
more than a review they're getting those kids primed and ready for the tests that are coming up in
i think that's totally useless
i think there's a place and a time for all of the tests and comparisons
i think they've taken it to the extent now that it's just ridiculous
everybody's kids are the best kids that have ever hit this earth
nobody else's children are going to ever live up to this
that's great
that's what they're doing with the school systems
they're wasting too much time on that i think
i know that this friend
is in the plano school district
she teaches emotionally disturbed children
she says she has six graders in there that are reading on the level of the second grade
because evidently you receive a certain amount of money when they're passed on or something
i'm supposed to compare those with my habits
let's see
i
at t i we have to use what's called a tex teller if we want to get cash out
those are only available at t i
if i'm in a mall or something i can't get cash out without paying extra money
i'm always using credit cards
myself i always tr-
i'm a traveling person i'm out of town quite a bit
i use credit cards quite a lot also as far as everything from service work gasoline in my car to my lounging entertainment and for everything
that's
as far as using them outside that i don't use them too much
i think my wife is sort of like you
she does most of the shopping for our household
she'll use them more than i will
do you get to pay the bills
it's me i'm the guy
i'll go in and charge something
i'll have to give them my driver's license
i do carry my american express and my visa which i use for primarily work type things
it's mine too
is it really
we're both beginners then
i've been out of town
this is my first time to use it
did you pick this topic
were you given
they assign you a topic
when you call the eight hundred number they assign you a topic and pretty cut and dried
let's see
how long are we supposed to talk for
about two three minutes i think
i really don't have too much more to say in regards to credit cards
years ago my wife and i got married she was the one with a little bit than i was because i had my credit cards i think up to the limit
i was giving
now it's a little different
i'll pay it the same day it comes
at least i try to
i just kind of tell my kids how much i hate paying interest
they should follow the same rule
if you pay it that way it it's like getting a free loan for a while
you bet it's ju-
if you travel for work and you get your reimbursement before the bill comes in
that's very handy
i think that's all i have
it was nice to meet you
give it a try
in the light of what has been happening lately with the doctors that i know and lawyers and whatnot i think national health insurance is a way to throw a lot of money at a very small problem
if you took half the money that they would spend in the state of texas for health insurance and gave it to qualified students so they could become doctors the problem would go away
i think the problem is that the doctors have conspired to limit the number of doctors and that the lawyers have conspired to make sure that if you are a doctor you are going to pay high premiums on your liability
because i'm a nurse for one thing
you think there are plenty of doctors
i do know that o b which is my field the doctors' malpractice insurance is over two hundred thousand dollars a year that deliver babies
they can't doing anything about that
people are very sue conscious
that's probably true too
people are very conscious of how much money they can get real fast these days
when you think about reasonableness i believe that a law suit should have some foundation in the tort theory
a tort is when you do something wrong
it
if the baby is born dead that happens
if they have complications and
i know there are guys that are real slobs
there are also people out there that are really doing their job
the people that are really doing their job are paying for everybody else
that's true
they have all these monitors now
if anything looks even a little bit funny their only safety precaution is to go in and get that baby
it's costing more all around in health insurance for tests for surgery for longer hospital stay
it's terrible
i believe that there is a system already in place for health care
they have indigent health care
you show up at parkland bleeding they'll fix you
we have that happen
at the last minute they come to us
we can't turn them away
i'd like to wipe them all out
i happen to know a few
i even claim one as a friend
i also know an o b g y n who has stopped practicing
he just said
he's not going to deliver any more babies ever
he said he had to gross two million to take home as much as his malpractice
most of them are very sincere
this guy is catholic
None
you can be human and catholic
you're not likely to find somebody who is going to have a less conscientious effort
who is getting rich
if you were able to write a malpractice insurance that would negate any financial obligation on the part of the doctor over and above the insurance
say you have malpractice insurance and a kid dies or is malformed
this semester i'll tell you what it's been almost impossible for me to get back to regular exercise
it was really easy for me to get quite a bit of exercise swimming
since i worked at a recreation center i could use those facilities quite often
swimming is one of the best exercises you can do
there's no jarring on the
it's least hard on your body
it's the least hard on your body as far as impact
flu- yeah
i do little aerobics three or four times a week
it's not enough to
boy if i go in the summer time i try to jog a couple of miles even doing that three or four times a week when summer hits that's a hard thing to go out and go jogging for half hour or so
i'm not quite getting the level that i need to
do you kind of think it's a chore
do you enjoy it
i like it
to do a whole lot just requires a lot of coordination as far as scheduling and that type of deal
i used to weigh two hundred fifteen pounds
now i weigh only about one seventy-five
i had started weight lifting quite regularly
i got my weight down
it's kind of easy for me to forget about it now because when i'm not fat like i used to be i don't worry about it
although lately i have noticed even if i gain like two pounds i start feeling it
it's amazing how much it changes
i weigh probably about the same i weighed for i don't know how many years
it's changed places
things don't fit just quite exactly fit the same
do you do
in texas does
i'm living in a dorm right now
right downstairs there's a facility
i really feel kind of guilty for not working out more than i do because there's a facility right downstairs where all we have to do is run down there
is it
if you can find the time it's just the
i really do because i like to get off alone and just do that for a while
that's hard
it's like anything else whether or not you want to sacrifice another half hour
right kind of have
if you're having the pressures of school and everything else it's kind of
course it's really
None
i stopped eating meat about must have been eight months ago
any kind of meat
i really feel a lot better
there's a lot of fat in meat
that's about where almost all of the fat comes from i found that really helps
unless you really like fish
i like it
if you go
i like sugar too
that's a problem
it's nice talking to you
think we've covered all the subject
good luck to you there in idaho
you too
good luck
let me tell you it's
i'm in graduate school now
it's a little different challenge isn't it
it's good talking
where are you studying
do you see as the changes that have occurred in the last
to me what becomes socially acceptable
i don't know if it's a factor of me growing older and seeing things through different eyes or if it's a factor of our society actually moving in that direction
i notice things on t v being open more i believe
specifically nudity things like that
i've said several times to my husband that i feel like gee in ten years they'll have just full nudity on t v
nobody will think anything of it
to me that's surprising
to me that's a big change to accept it
it comes across i think subtly a little at a time to where you get so used to seeing a little change that when they go one step further you don't notice it that much
i think that society has come to a point where they're not responsible for any of their actions
somebody else made them do it
that's what i seem to see a lot of that no one is willing to take responsibility for their life and their choices
it's rather sue these guys because they made a seat belt that didn't work right
that's what i think is a big one
i think there's a lot of that
don't you think that maybe a lot of that came from the era we went through that was like hey if it makes you happy do it
kind of like disregard to others
yes
we should take care of ourselves
we should see to our own lives but not to a total disregard of others
i don't know
hers isn't a social thing as much as it's a stage they go through
whenever something happens it's you made me hit that
i try to tell her everything isn't always somebody else's fault
you have to watch where you're going
it's what you just said kind of hits home to me just through her
another thing i think has changed quite a bit is the roles that men and women play
in your opinion good or bad or both
both
there's some great things that have come about with more equality
i think that also
i think the role of women changing has been good in that women are feeling in terms of their self confidence their self worth i can do something
i can be somebody
i think that's good
maybe i think when that was first trying come about with what we know as the women's lib movement i think it was too extreme
i think you can be feminine and still be all those other things too
i think there's definite roles
i think part of the break up of the family maybe it's because of the social changes
the fact that during their early changes where women did maybe speak out come more out of themselves
speak out
i think now less men are because they're used to it
i don't know
i don't know why the families are breaking up
they go in and say hey i'll stick with it while it's good
i'll get out
i think that directly affects the effort that you put into that marriage or that commitment
it's been probably a month or so since i've been to the movies
course my favorite now is dances with wolves
it's an excellent movie
silence of the lambs was good
i guess it's a mystery you'd call it
it's with jodie foster
it's pretty good
another one that i think i really liked was the fisher king
that was robin williams
i can't the last name
we've not been having many opportunities to see movies lately
we really enjoyed dead poets' society
several years back one we saw we really really enjoyed was ordinary people with timothy hutton and mary tyler moore
who played the father anyway excellent movie
that was an excellent movie
we loved it
he made kind of an odd sounding robin hood
basic
it wasn't a bad movie
i thoroughly enjoyed it
then i wasn't expecting any classic either
they did a real good job with it
they didn't try to make him super human or invincible
they just
i haven't an opportunity to see that
you
i guess it really isn't for everybody
it's it's pretty deep and philosophical
i thought it had a wonderful message to it it's the kind you came out and looked at somebody and said i think i liked that
the more you got to thinking about it the more you thought i did like it
when you first came out you weren't real sure
it sounds kind of like one we saw at home here rented it clara's heart
whoopi goldberg
she played a
the nanny type
she was a haitian
anyway she seemed to be that sort of person that seems half crazy
then again she's got a whole lot on the ball
the movie had the whole lot of philosophical content
it wasn't blood and guts and violence and car chases type thing
it's with sean young
it's a mystery
you knew when the murder was going to happen or something
it was still so well done that it was enjoyable
that takes a good bit to make one that's predictable that's still worth watching
i had
i like the i think it's called the
no no
the jagged edge with
serious problems in the public education and what can be done about it
what do you think
that's funny because i just quit my job to stay home with my kids
i was a teacher for seven years in the public schools
i know a little bit about it not
tell me about it
there's some
it's such a broad topic that you need to boil it down
one that i thought it was a serious problem that i'm not sure it's being taken care of right now was bilingual education for different
minority groups and like asians and mexican americans and just people in general that speak other languages that sometimes come from other countries or coming from different areas
as the school district i'm not sure how to go about it because it's hard to get one teacher that speaks all these languages most of these children are put in special ed a bilingual program and then for just a small amount of time
they're into their
the teachers are not sure how to teach them math when they don't read or speak english
a lot of the money isn't put into that
these children are just kind of sat in the corner
a lot of the teachers
it was not the teacher's fault
do you find that those parents
at the same time i've heard that it's even harder when both parents are required to work and can't spend that time typically the mother was at home with the children
really society sort of dictates that both the parents work
i know i've heard some people talk about just the fact that even as far back as the the second and third grade if the kids had proper reading skills or learned proper reading skills that would make a lot of difference
it teaches language too
which is really good
i work at a university
it's really tough when we're
i work at the university of texas at dallas
we have some pretty selective admissions requirements for incoming freshmen
there are some students who are in the top ten of their class
their s a t scores are very low
a lot of it has to do with
their language
it makes it tough because you know when they come in with scores that low they may be good students
they just haven't achieved to their fullest potential
they're going
to fail unless some sort of remedial education is given to them
then it comes into who's supposed to give it to them the colleges and universities or
i know richardson school district has a wonderful program in the remedial reading where
some children who need extra help are put into this reading program
it is just excellent
i wish that all the children could be exposed to that program
i know that there are some parents that say how do i get my kids in that
yet they don't qualify
it's unfortunate that they don't qualify because i think everybody would benefit from these programs
how many children do you have at home
that's why i quit my job
i've been teaching since they were gosh newborns
being a teacher you see all these parents who are working and working and working and just don't have the time
it was kind of getting to me where i'm doing the same thing
my children are getting older
i was missing out on a lot
i just decided to stay home for a while
that's good
okay i guess we are just supposed to talk about things we do in our spare time
i basically read books
i will just stay up and finish a book that i am
i will work on one for a little bit and then the next one
that's just kind of
that is pretty impressive to have three books going
what what kind of books do you read
just really different ones
i have one that i was reading on raising your children and then another one on an autobiography and another one on like a crime story
do you like those detective stories
that is interesting
i like to read also
usually fall into one or two categories true science fiction fantasy on the one hand highly technical
you must work for t i
i am a computer scientist
i have a lot of other hobbies
i am kind of i guess what you would call a project person
i love
i have a shop
when things break around the house i always try to fix them myself
hobby
its' funny
it is a hobby too that i enjoy to do
essentially anything you find in a house a stove or oven or a broken piece of porcelain or chipped tile on the floor just anything
you have a shop
it is not anything elaborate
enough that again for anything in the house i could probably
that is great
in the car
i think i probably would consider that a hobby
he is pretty mobile in that area too
he works on the cars
he rarely takes them in he works on irons and all t v and stuff too
i think it
it can certainly help your finances
do you have any creative or artistic hobbies
not really
during christmas i work on like holiday sweat shirts and those kinds of things
good
not really
i don't necessarily either
i can plink out a song or two on a piano i can
i guess graphic arts is that what they call it
sweat shirts is certainly impressive
i belong to this organization if you have preschool children every once and a while they will have a craft section for the moms those are really neat
we learn to do the transfer pictures
we learn different crafts like that
that is neat
do you cook for a hobby
do you
i
usually once a week i will bake something
it's not anything elaborate
i think that still borders on hobby
i have
drive my wife crazy
i wonder if you can construe raising children
i stopped because it was so
the book is so detailed you have to
it is so detailed
sort of mixed feelings about it i guess
i lean more towards the control side than towards just the free army
on the other hand it's sort of an issue of
i'm not a great fan of government control in general
it's kind of a tough issue
i guess that i would like to say that perhaps someplace in the middle where people could somehow qualify or have a legitimate use for the weapon i suppose because also living in this area the problems in d c come home very quickly
i'm sure
you would take a position where somebody without a
in other words if they just wanted to have a gun to have in their home you wouldn't like them to be able to do that
i'm not so sure about that
i think somehow safety courses
i don't know whether this could be something that was done in school
somehow people
at least there's the moral issue that they knew better
which is sort of flaky
i have the impression that the majority of the problems that we have with guns are probably not from the people that are buying them through legitimate channels anyway
that may be wrong
certainly there are cases children who find their parents' gun or something and shoot a brother or sister or things like that that need to be definitely avoided
that's certainly within the channels
a lot of the crime i think that goes on i don't know to what the degree the guns are purchased through regular channels or they're illegal guns
this morning in our paper there was an article about somebody who had bought three guns in virginia because all you have to do is get a driver's license
he went over there and got a driver's license the same day bought three guns and went up to new york and sold them for very high markups
in a sense that's a legal way of getting the guns
certainly the the purpose is not very legal
i think some sta-
i don't know if it's been actually been implemented
i think so
at least there's been talk about doing like waiting periods and things like that
i think stuff like that is perfectly good
basically if you're buying it for legitimate purposes waiting ten days shouldn't be a problem
and things
i've
i don't own a gun and don't really
i'd just as soon a lot fewer people did
on the other hand like i say i kind of against government control in general
i suppose total ban would lead to more illegal weapons
i
something about banning is that there are so many weapons out there that they're not going to disappear anytime soon
they're already
i know there's a ready market for them
the stolen guns can be sold
the first thing a burglar will pick up if he can is a gun
because they they can be so easily sold
they're
it's not like they're going to disappear all of a sudden even if you do do a total ban on them
it's a real tough problem
i don't know
i grew up
that's sort of almost a separate issue
that's true
some people grew up with guns in the house
we never had any in the house to me the first time i saw a gun up close was a pretty scary thing
i'm not sure that's good either
we i grew up with them
i did some of it
we never had any handguns or anything like that
we had shotguns for quail and pheasant hunting and things like that
it was a whole different thing
gun safety was taken very seriously
it was
before we go hunting we took safety courses
it
that seems to me to be just a whole another issue
i'm not certain that people are terribly concerned about other people
do you have a family budget
how do you work your budgeting
we were both working at the time and so forth
that
we had to do that until we finally got the house paid for and other big bills taken care of
we have a budget
not as strict now as we used to because we don't have quite such a tight financial situation
it's helpful
yes
that did get us so that the house is paid for and other major things are taken care of
now we can relax a little bit more because basically we don't really require as much on a daily or a monthly basis as we did before
we don't have to have quite as strict a budget as we did
we don't have a real strict budget
we have a low budget to work on
we
we just spend about so much
i don't know of a written figure of expenses that we keep to or anything
i know that i go to the grocery store that we always stick within five dollars between here and there
i think i do that automatically myself
i unconsciously stay with a certain amount because i have enough food already stored here that i don't have to make any large purchase at any one time
course we have a large garden here that we grow a lot of our own stuff
we freeze a lot of that
a lot of the vegetables are taken care of in our own personal storage
you guys sound pretty self sufficient
the next time i go to the store why i pick it up and fill it up
it's worked very well that way
that way
the other person might not know about it
that's a good idea
the other thing there the topic was talking about was if
all i can think of is if you don't keep a real tight budget how do you control expenses
one
not fly back
somehow we get back there
this year we did it by train because it was the least expensive
it's more interesting too if you've got the time
we could go to both places without having to spend so much for plane fare
we find that if we're careful with our just everyday things like grocery shopping and gas and entertainment things like that then somewhere out in the wash it will come out that we have enough to get back there
i think we unconsciously
my throat's not as clear today as it should be
we are going to be traveling to europe with a choral
we sing with a so called pennsylvania choral we make a two weeks tour of foreign countries
of course that costs money
we
each of us watches the funds that we spend and make sure that we gather together over a period a time enough money to make this trip
that is another way of budgeting i think we just sort of unconsciously do it
we just live a normal life
we don't throw any money away particularly
we save it for this trip which is always very very nice
whenever i find a dime or something on the ground i i'll probably pick it up
just count it up at the end of the year something
let's face it
when we're talking budget it is important to have a budget
i keep track of mine on a more rough basis now by just watching the level of my checking account
i have a money market account also
i keep those levels up above a certain minimum
i'm always trying to
are you in the market for a new car
yeah
i'm looking for another car
new
sports car
usually black red
not so much that as it is
i've had so many times when i'll have a friend next to me or i see guy broken down on the side of the road and try to lean over and roll down the window
if i'm driving along and there's somebody next to me and somebody that i know and you try to talk to them it's real difficult to drive reach over and try to roll down the window
power locks power windows are just things that just really help a lot
i guess i'm more traditional in that i don't like
because the people that i know who have them always seem to have trouble with them
i just don't like anything that i can't figure out why it doesn't work
i want good gas mileage
i want an air bag
i guess
somehow i just think i like the idea
it sure seems to save lives
yeah
i like the anti-lock brakes
i have never had a chance to
i've never tromped on the brakes on ice or water just to see if they didn't lock up
you think you'd buy an american car or a european or japanese
i don't know a lot about different brands
i tend to have my requirements like the last time i bought a car i guess i did sort of prefer american
my requirements were basically good repair record good mileage
i wanted stick shift i didn't have a whole lot of choice
there was one car in all of the metropolitan area that i could find that was sort of a medium priced car with a
it turned out to be a chrysler
basically it was something that a military guy had ordered and hadn't picked up
it had been on the lot three months
they were really eager to sell it
i guess in this area at least if it's not automatic it doesn't move
i much prefer a stick shift
what i'm curious
i know why i love a stick shift
i just wanted it because again i had i guess traditionally always had a car that had one
i thought it would be more reliable
most of the sports cars are stick shift
i'm not even sure all of them are anymore at least in this area
the people i've talked to don't seem to have stick shift
why do you like stick shift
i guess i grew up on it it's fun
it's an enjoyable part of driving
i do feel like i have more control over the car
to me it gives me more a lot more control in snow and ice and slick conditions
it does
it's really more fun than anything
as long as you're not stuck in heavy traffic it's fun
it's probably safer on long trips because it keeps you more active
of course i like gadgets and fun things
let me go ahead and press one
when i have my spare time
it's a cherished commodity now days
i do enjoy sewing
i hand
i've been doing a a picture for my father-in-law
if i ever get enough spare time
some other things i like to do are music and also reading
i enjoy singing
i
one thing that i like to do is sit down and play the piano
i sit down and enjoy playing musical selections that i am familiar with
my family is familiar with
a couple of hobbies that i also have is
the biggest hobbies i have right now are my kids and whatever they are involved in
like my oldest boy is involved in soccer
we go out and play kick the soccer ball around or play throw the football
we also like to ride bicycles
we're riding bicycles
a lot of the hobbies that i have right now are centered around my children and also things that my wife and i like to do together
personally
i really enjoyed mountain climbing
i really enjoyed skiing and a lot of outdoor activities
there's not a whole lot of mountains here in texas that i can go skiing with that right now
hopefully i will be able to get back to the slopes some day
i grew up in arizona which has some mountains around it
never did get out and ski
i guess i didn't have the person out there saying hey let me take you skiing
of course i was at that stage of my life where i had to be taken to places
of course once i got to the age where i could have done it myself i had other interests i guess
we went quite often
in fact my brother still does a lot of skiing
we would go skiing and enjoy that
luckily it's kind of unusual because hobbies it's a nice thing to have
it's good to fall back on those hobbies when you have time to like you mentioned
i am finding out a lot of the spare time that i had isn't there
it's taken up by activities with work with family with civic and church responsibilities for me
i find if i make i have to make myself realize that it is important to get out there and just even to go for a walk is good recreation for me
my youngest daughter is going to be starting up soccer
she's real excited about doing that
you have participated with that in the past
have you participated in that in the past
i did with my older daughter she was in it for a few years
she has got so many interests herself that
the first one to go
she still likes her piano she is in band
she's got lots of hobbies or activities going on
leslie it's been very nice talking to you
is there anything else that you would like to
thank you
you have a nice evening
are you a fisher person are you
it's mostly from the rivers and lakes
what kind of fish do they have in your neck of the woods
it
down here we usually catch catfish and bass stripped bass where i fish
and trout up at lake shasta when i go up there
i like it all except i don't really care that much for the trout
i grew up in nebraska and grew up cat fishing in the little blue river
we moved to south dakota and did a lot of walleye fishing on the missouri river
now that we are down here i think a lot of people do some bass fishing and strip bass fishing
i am sort of a catfish man at heart
like in iowa and nebraska those little bullheads they look just like catfish
that's what i mean cause i am from iowa
we use to catch those little bullheads
did you get to go fishing very often
it's been a little over a year now
i am not quite sure what residency is for a fishing license here
i really i haven't gone fishing for about two years now it's driving me crazy
one of these days i will go over to lake lewisville or
you like to eat them after you catch them
there's are a lot of people that like to go fishing
they don't like to eat them
most of the time if we catch something we'll take it home and eat it
you're right
i like to fish for trout
they are really good fighters
if i went to a restaurant that probably wouldn't be the first thing i would order if i had a choice of fish on the menu
if i go to a restaurant and order fish it's usually salmon red snapper
do you fillet them out
how do you
we skin them
i just flour them salt and pepper them and cook them
that's the way my mother taught me to fry them
that's how we do it too
although we use to set some trout lines out
we've caught fourteen fifteen pound catfish
sometimes those are good to do on a barbecue grill and just leave the skin on and do it with butter on tin foil the skin just basically scrapes right off
wer-
it really tastes pretty good
i don't think i've ever tried cooking those catfish quite that big
most of them are just the small pan frying ones
i am hoping one of these days i'll have the opportunity to catch a big catfish like that on a rod and reel
so far it's just been on the trout lines
up in south dakota in the missouri river there we've tied into a few northern pike
they really
in the summer time they'll give you a run for your money
when you were
it was just like the rivers and the lakes i suppose
in nebraska
most of the time we just fished in the river although there were a lot of sand pits and things like that that we could fish in
a lot of them ended up being close to the river
if the river every flooded then obviously they would dump some catfish and bass and stuff into the into the ponds and the sand pits we would do a lot of fishing there too
south dakota didn't really have much for
it certainly is going to be a pleasure to chat with you
through nancy dahlgren
she had somehow gotten the information from t i and was distributing it around
what would you say about these everyday invasions of our privacy
i'm not sure that
i think that the opportunity is definitely there for people to invade your privacy when they want to
i think it's
it's certainly not that difficult to tap a phone
let's see
what's the first thing that comes to your mind
the thing that i thought they were concerned about was people calling on the phone from all over the country to sell you something in reality in many cases they knew or they had information about you that was purchased from some other organizations
i thought was beginning to invade the privacy of people because the things about where you live and maybe what you purchased in past months is then put down and sent to someone else in the same business
they in return come back and try to sell you something with this additional knowledge
i think that all that information is quite easy for anyone to get
it's possible for almost anyone to get information about your credit history for instance if they just twist the right arm or claim to be from the right organization when they're calling the credit company
it's possible for a thirteen year old hacker with a modem to find out almost anything about your personal history not to mention change it if he wants to
you mean your history in regards to the charge card company or something like that
for instance yes
they'll probably goes into other things like your records with the government or utility companies or anything
do you consider these serious problems
not yet anyways because i don't think they're widespread enough
i think they have the potential of becoming serious problems
what should we do about it
what could be done about it do you think to correct it
i'm not really sure because the society is going more and more electronic
there are certainly benefits to its doing so
it's hard to say whether the risks have potential of outweighing the benefits or not
i'm not sure what can be done to ensure that they don't
i would think that information held on records by any company or charge card dealer or person should be absolutely private and not be allowed to be given out by those companies
it should be made a national or a state law to protect people so that you would then feel more free to deal direct with these companies
in other words if you call the company yourself directly and then know that what you tell them will be on their records but will not be available to anyone else from the outside so to speak then you would feel more free to go into detail with them we have no control of that now when you're talking with them you really don't want to tell them everything that's on your mind because you feel that it someday might be used against you
if i'm lucky i might be able to hear something through news wise
other than that that's probably how i get my source unless something really tragic
most of the time it is through the news in the evening
that's about the
not that i don't enjoy
part of it is because i just don't
i might look through it real quick if there's something that catches my interest in regards to what's going on around the county or little bit of the state
the majority of the time now i don't get a daily newspaper where i get tons of news coming in
you do
we have two newspapers
i'm in a government position that i'm in the news a lot
i kind of look through to see what i'm quoted in
how bad the quotes are every day
to see if they did it or if they criticize you or put something in there wrong
sometimes there's letter to the editor about me
there's a even editorials for against what i'm doing
the t v i don't really watch even if i'm on it
that's kind of like you said then
we are kind of on the opposite where i get home and while i'm cooking supper the t v is on and watching the news or trying to catch up with what is going on
very seldom do i catch the ten o'clock
by that time old news is probably what i hear through the grapevine or whatever
unless there is a big issue going on like when we were at war then i think everybody was glued to the t v to find out what was going on
other than that no
c n n had the
it brought kind of more of a vivid look at what was going on when they were dropping the bombs and just a lot of different things
yeah
other people that do it differently or don't even watch any news at all
the thing is with t v i
a lot of times the news on the local t v is so brief you really don't get the full picture of what's going on
that's a problem that i have is not getting just a little brief idea of what's happening
a clip a sentence or two
that's about it of what went on
they have so much other information to cover in such a short period of time
i like the weather report
i wa-
i always turn that on that's one part i watch because i go surfing down here
i always want to watch the weather for when the waves are going to be good
you're right on the coast line
you're not further up
i suppose you watch for hurricanes coming in and things like that
that's about the only time in the summer if you're watching t v for the weather even though it's very hard to predict what's going on
they'll kind of say there's a thunderstorm warning or whatever
this is what is expected
a lot of times things happen and change here so drastically so fast where movement that was coming in has shifted or whatever
hundreds of miles out
i can predict my week and where i'm going to be
i can be at the beach when the waves start coming in
anyway i don't know if our time is getting up here
it's got to be fairly close to that
maybe people that have a lot of responsibility over a large mass of people
in general
i know that companies do
they kind of have gotten into the idea that let's drug test them and let's put them through rehab
there's got to be a limitation
do we kind of say well you can be drug tested
you look okay because you look this way
you're very conservative
there's just no way that we would think that you would use drugs
the guy that doesn't fit the stereotype of the conservative or whatever could be drug tested
whether legal rights of that person
there's certainly a lot of things to really consider when you get into drug testing people just at the work place unless of course like i said they have a large responsibility over a mass of people
that's about it
it's just not the com-
i think that's what companies are doing more and more because there are products that are out there
if the company is liable for something that that a employee does while under the influence of a drug then by all means they should have the right
there's also the case about just health and welfare of the
not only low there's all sorts of a financial benefits associated with having people file fewer claims being sick
the whole question that a work force that is known not to be on drugs is going to be more healthy
the only thing is
if they have had medications in the past let's say once a month or twice a month or three times a month or maybe that week they take an advil
the advil will apparently come out positive as if they smoked marijuana
there's poppy seed type things
where's the line where you say to somebody i'm going to drug test you tomorrow
please do not take these medications
how you can do it
the question becomes what do you do about somebody
the only thing that i would say on that is it could blacklist an employee later on
let's say you've taken medication of some sort even though they usually have you at the time list what medications you've taken
let's say you do come out positive
you've taken advil or any of the ibuprofen products out there
you've had a cold
you've been on medication or whatever
is it then the chance that the employer will look at you in more of a negative fashion and say well this is kind of iffy
they on drugs
where there might be in the back of the mind of the employer that this person is on drugs
they may make up their mind that let's get rid of this employee
i think clearly the person who is the line manager the employee should not be privy to the information of drug testing
that should go to an entirely different agency within a corporation
it's a
it's kind of like
i don't know
since i've had children it has changed a little bit
when my husband and i were camping we'd take this domed tent that is easily collapsible and go camping and just kind of roughed it
we'd get up at three in the morning and start on our little escapade for the day and kind of do a lot of different things and then stop when we wanted to
that's kind of changed now
you don't want them up that early
would you then go hiking
would the camping be part of a long hike
we kind of did a little bit of hiking and a little bit of sightseeing different areas sitting back at different areas and spending hours
were you up in wisconsin
would you go into can-
there's places in wisconsin
there's the apostle islands which are in bayfield which is a wonderful place
there's also what we found in the state of south dakota the black hills
we just have this really good time there
sorry to say
that kind of puts a little bit of a hamper on your
if you're going to go camping who wants to deal with bugs
it's just wonderful not to be bugged all night long with a humming mosquito at your ear
most of my camping
i haven't done much since i was a kid we'd basically take the tent up in the sierras and usually just camp near some stream or some lake
just
it wasn't even a full tent
it would be more a tarp strung up between trees
my dad would take four kids
my brother and myself and two cousins we just thought it was absolute heaven
there was certainly nothing like a bathroom a shower or anything
i'm not sure i'd do that anymore
it
some friends of mine and i are planning to camp this summer for four days
also going fishing i have a idea it's going to be a lot more equipment and a lot more stuff
than when you were younger
with kids they don't care about a lot of things
as adults it's like if i don't take a shower every day i feel like
i just don't feel right
there's lots of places if you're going to go camping
None
if you can find some really nice clean campgrounds versus if you go to state parks
they're certainly not up to a standard of a k o a where it's a little bit cleaner
it's not in the same category
state parks you get a little bit fearful too things like that simply because it they are supposed to be patrolled
it's a little bit different
we've always kind of stayed with a k o a and then did other things besides just sit at the campground at night
if you're going to be gone all day long walking someplace or doing tourism or whatever you're camping really is just for like in the evening to start the fire to sit back and watch a fire to enjoy that and then to get up in the morning and get a shower and get cleaned up that kind of stuff
we never really spent that much time at the campground as much as we did
caught his interview last night with david frost
it was the first time i had heard his views expressed by himself
the whole phenomena of him coming out of literally nowhere and no party at least no apparent party support on either side
when you said it it was kind of like a surprise
in that aspect
now the new house bill that went to minnesota being that it is their neighboring state and that i lived in minnesota i'm more familiar with the politics that involved with that and that being passed
as far as politics in the grander part of it as if you want to look at election type things i'm not quite sure even if i'm going to vote
it gets harder and harder each time an election comes up like that to make the decision on who would be the best to run
it seems that the decision so far has been filtered by party politics so much that when the candidates finally get party approval party support and therefore get presented to the public the candidates are already beyond what most public feels is acceptable behavior
the
one of the common criticisms of clinton is gee he'll say or do anything in order to get to the white house
up and to the point of perot being a serious candidate it seems like that was a requirement of being a contender within the party is to have done all those things
here's a guy who for twenty years has been working toward getting the party nomination and preparing himself for the presidency
now it seems like both he and the incumbent president are pretty seriously threatened by somebody who comes out of a whole nonpolitical arena
he might be one of those
it's kind of when you think back of the old politics where a dirt farmer
they were not rich in in any means
it has been kind of in the past i don't know maybe fifty years that in order for a person to get involved with politics they've had to have money
you had to have the views of the people that were going to be paying your way
it makes the common person
i don't know if we'll ever see that where a common person could ever get in there that has good moral standings and has
you think of abraham lincoln and just the background of abraham lincoln teaching himself to read
he didn't do all the other things that you would think that was real popular to do and to get politically involved in and have money
now it's
yet even he was a consummate politician in the sense that not only did he fail in business twice with bankruptcy and failure he lost some eighteen elections before he finally won one
the first and only election he won was the presidency
he had lost every other office that he had
he was appointed a couple of times to like state legislator
you really know a lot of his background
then when he finally did win an election it was the presidency
whether or not i
i really have to ask them why
it's the toughest job in the world to do
not only that you don't have that much freedom to make choices
you have to go through so many different
you have to go the house the congress and all of the other things to get a bill passed
sure you can
then it's not like you have all that power
i think long time ago presidents did have a lot of power
then do you keep kids
do you keep children for other people
that's exactly what i have
my little girl was three and a half in march
my son was two in january
mine was two in march
the three and a half year old will be four in july
that is pretty close
i'm home with the kids all day
i have really tried to make that a priority even though it's financially a big strain on us
i work part-time
my husband's able mostly to take care of them when i'm working
how neat
we adopted these two little guys that was another reason why i really wanted to be here because they have had a couple foster homes already
he probably doesn't remember
his brother was twenty-two months
pretty interesting
i have always wanted to be able to stay home with my kids
that was always my dream
i wasn't necessarily a career person as long as i was single and had to work i was going to get a good job and do the best i could
my husband was in the type of business that
you have to build a clientele
by the time we had kids i couldn't quit
i haven't been able to quit yet
i've had to deal a lot with child care
course we're hoping within hopefully the next two years i'll be able to quit and stay home
i started out
that's neat
it worked out pretty good
we had always said from the beginning that if it gets in the way of the friendship then i'll take them somewhere else
the friendship is more important
it was a wonderful experience for my kids because she really loved them
i knew
that's the hardest thing i think to deal with is that people love your
i put my oldest in a preschool program just for him to have the experience of two mornings a week of being with other kids and starting to learn some taking turns and that kind of thing
he was in there for three months when i pulled him out
the teacher had eleven kids
i had several friends who had recommended it too
it really gets down to the particular teacher
she was a new teacher at the school
she had eleven three year olds in a room
i just think it was way too much
she had no help
that is hard
she was just my
she just kept saying how wild he was
there was kind of a connotation there of it being a problem
he ran back from the bathroom singing and skipping she said
at three years old i don't find that to be a behavioral problem
it's kind of like there was so much going on that she felt like she needed to control more it's really hard to con-
you can't control eleven three year olds with one person
yeah
i just finally took him out plus financial reasons
i was real careful and visited and everything ahead of time
i still felt like even after all the checking i did
i felt safe that the kids weren't going to be left alone somewhere in a room where a teacher could do something inappropriate with them because there was enough classrooms close together that it was like a house with different classrooms
i felt like that was a big factor for me
that they would would be safe from any kind of abuse or that kind of thing
when my friend decided to go back to work and whenever we had problems it worked out okay because she would come and tell me
we'd work it out
after that i found another girl that had gone to church with us that they needed it financially
i though
we'll try her
she came to our house
that just did not work
she loved the kids
she was good with them
they were filthy
i understand kids go out and play
they get dirty
the i was like gosh
my own furniture and stuff was like
the kitchen table i'd find peanut butter and jelly all over the table and the chairs
i was like
in the end she basically ended up stealing a hundred dollars from me
i had a pretty bad taste in my mouth
i work eight to five thirty
what am i supposed to do
i had been sick
i stayed home with them
we went to some of the kindercares
i took the kids there once just to try it
that's what they said
they said bring them in this week for a free day
i lined up someone tuesday
they had a mother's day out that my baby-sitter took them to which was fine
i stayed with them monday
friday my husband and i split
on thursday i didn't like the kindercares
i had two bad experiences just that one day with medicine that my son was supposed to have for a cold that they never gave him
the other one was that the younger one got bit really badly by another child
what they did was they took my
that's horrible
doing something with him
not only was it going to cost me like a hundred and fifty dollars more a month which i didn't have
we're a christian family
because they're like public
you feel like your values aren't getting
i don't want them indoctrinated
i'd like them to be able to say gee god made the flowers and things like that
basic things like that
i talked to another lady at church
she said i found the most wonderful place that i've been taking my daughter
i've know this girl
i value her opinion
she told me about a private one
it was associated with one of the churches here
it was lubbock view christian church
it's a private academy
i went over there
i talked to the lady
they have like a three year waiting list
she said i had a mother tell me that she may take a job in san antonio
she has a three year old and a toddler which mine was at the time
she said i should know something by tomorrow which was friday
she said if she leaves she said i'll let you have her spot
friday afternoon at five thirty she called me
she said she's going
what luck
since october then they have been going there
that's great
the cost was not near as much as the kindercares
they don't have to charge as much
that's great
the hours are wonderful
i think it's the best thing
i told russ that we should have done this a long time ago
i guess as long as i have to work i feel good that they're there
they teach them the alphabet the numbers the things which if they learn they learn
i don't feel like i have to indoctrinate them by age three it's kind of neat when they come home with it
it's not a big trauma to them to learn something
the teachers
taylor got bit several times
taylor bit several times
the teachers dealt with that
we keep them apart
we scold them
we correct them
they mark it all down
they let you know
he doesn't do it anymore
they work at the potty train-
i just
the older brother is
it's hard
i know that's hard
it
i understa-
i wish you could find a good mother's day out because that would be good for your peace of mind also
even for just a couple mornings a week or something to have something like that
i think i'm going to look for that
i been meaning to do that
because some of the churches do have them for like six dollars per child that's not that big a deal
that's usually like
that was a pretty good time
that worked out real good
i'm tickled to death
it was good talking to you
i guess
it said child care criteria i think we both listed an experience
thanks a lot
you too
i was thinking about camping and people's ideas about it
they got the big old antennas up so they can watch their t v when they're going
we've just gotten one of those little tents
that's what we camp in
we kind of rough it
so do we
we'd sleep on those picnic tables at roadside parks
i know it's dangerous
we did
we were doing the same thing
we were on top of a picnic table with our sleeping bags i guess
this ranger comes up with this light shines it on us and said that we're just bear bait out there
bear bait
we go up there fairly often
we've done things when it's kind of cold
we've all got heaters in our tents
in the summer
we've got the fans going
we're not roughing it too much
we have taken t v out there for the kids
they've got their electrical hookups
it's not so bad
a week at a time or just weekends
they had a library at one time out there
that's really not roughing it so much
a pool to go to
there was nobody else
it was just really nice that time of year
we didn't need it
my husband has even camped at lake lavon with one of his friends
it's not very many miles from our house at all
they had
we've taken
it ended up when it came time for us to pull in for the night we'd take a vote
most of the time we decided we wanted to stay in a hotel
instead of getting out all that stuff
we're set now
we've got our bug light
everybody's got their sleeping bags
we were looking at those in a magazine
yeah you can if you can reverse the
nozzle on your vacuum cleaner it blows air out instead of sucking it in
you can fill them up that way
something that's smaller would be a lot more convenient
my husband and i we have a pickup truck
there's plenty of room to hold things
we've used a hair dryer before
i put it on hot and also melted it
we take our dog camping
she sleeps in the tent with us
me either
one night we were camping
it came just a torrential downpour
it was just that bad
we decided we'd just go across the road to the office and see if we could rent anything
i got a condo with a jacuzzi
it was wonderful
i bet it
when i was a kid we camped in virginia
we had one of those little pop up tents which is really nice because it kind of gets you off the ground
it seemed like it rained every weekend for about the year we were really into camping
the lid pops off
the little tent comes up the top it had two double beds in it
since the beginning
do you work for t i
i work as a temporary in the speech lab
what exactly are they going to do
they turn them over to somebody
i guess they're going to try to teach computers how to recognize voices and search for specific words and stuff
any voice no matter what the
that's kind of neat
if they say i i we just type it in like that
i guess that's it for camping
you make sure that you keep up with them for the next time
they've got the elastic on the inside of the poles
you just put them together
it's a dome tent
that was sort of miserable
it was in your bed
it was in padre island and in a truck off corpus but not in a tent
that's about all
it's good talking to you
are you at t i austin
i left t i in january
i signed up for this before i did
that's great
my daughter has talked to my daughter up here with us
she's talked to students
i guess they have sent this to their customers and people in colleges and things
my daughter has talked to two students that were non
i guess
i think that's a good idea
we're on finances
have you retired
i had basically set my sights to leave t i when they announced there would be no salary increases in ninety-one because
i haven't really accomplished that yet
i'm trying
that's
i've been with t i
that's a tough thing the salary thing
what about our financial budget
you should have a lot of information on a budget then if you're
i hope you're a person who does things better than
i don't have a budget
that's one of my goals for this year is to try to get myself in a good long-range planning budget mode
i'm a single mom
i've been just trying to get
you deserve an honor for that a gold star for that i guess
how about yourself
i guess i do
that i've been thinking about that for quite a while
monthly no
i did that the macho thing
i got so sick of it trying to balance the budget one
i always tried to show my wife here's how you
here's how you do the checks
i said i'm not doing this anymore
i've been happy ever since
that's great
i don't even
i said i've been a happy man since i haven't
fooled with that checkbook
i know it's a big pain to try to do that
it really is
that was always a major problem in our marriage
i don't really need a budget to tell me not to spend it
i'm always afraid
no
i've finally worked myself into a spot where i can budget
when i was first divorced i sat down and budgeted
i had outgo that was much higher than what i had coming in
i think that that is a tough
seems to be that way
now that i've gotten past that i can sit down and say okay
i don't know if you have an i r a or
i've got two girls also
i haven't saved anything for their college
you need to do that i'll give you a hint
i don't know if you're a radio talk person listener
listen to bruce williams for financial advice
he's on
he gives very practical financial advice about cars very not nothing college level basic stuff
i don't know
i'll check that out
it's five seventy up here
i'd listen to talk shows for everything for gardening and everything just when i'm doing chores
he will help you avoid a lot of little things financially
that's good to know how
there's a lot of advice out there for how to get a budget
i'm not expert again because
you must have done something
you're
i have one again at u t down there now
she's almost gone through her whole college fund
go ahead
we'll find out
they give us ten minutes
the only advice i give you on college would be there's a lot of scholarship money out there
you ought to as your daughters approach the college age start finding out about the scholarship monies because there is a lot of money out there
how did your daughter get scholarship money on
she got five hundred dollars at a clip through bands through leadership
there's all kinds of civic organ- organizations that will give you one shot money
you get a president's award if you're in high school doing cer-
this up here in arlington
of course you score high on the s a t
you can get two thousand a year or more
she did very well in school
she only got first year money
there were two or three people
only two or three people applied
i'm definitely going to be actively looking into that
the year that they graduate before though while they're graduating there's all kinds of little bitty money that little clubs will give away churches and everything
they don't even have a dozen applicants because the kids are going off after the big money
of course you have to have some sort of record in high school of of achievement and everything
sometimes it's just
our band gave money away
we give two five hundred dollar scholarships just to kids who we think were worthy know
that's great to know
i want to chew up the whole line
you're doing just fine
when i talk i usually like to ask a lot of questions
i'm an engineer
in fact i'm working the night because of the cutbacks and everything
my job
they put me on nights
i call this my recession job
i'm working nights just kind of covering shutdown equipment and everything
it beats being laid off and everything
you got to be a little flexible
in my old age i'm trying to just hang in there until i get my kids through school
i'd like to teach maybe mathematics or something
i hope you can do that
what i did is
None
i had been a stay at home mom
i was very fortunate in starting
i really enjoyed it while i was at t i
the cutbacks were really getting to be rather frightening
i had less than five years
also i wanted to make a little bit more money
i decided i'd like to go out and try sales
i'm out trying to sell telephone systems to businesses
the potential there is fantastic
it's tough right now for everybody
i've got another clue for you for college
we have a friend who is a secretary for t c u up here
they give you scholarship a hundred percent if you work for t c u
check that one out
i've got two friends that work at u t
it's full scholarship
it's not room and board
it's tuition full tuition paid if your parent works at t c u
that sounds fantastic
her mother went over there just for that
brent i kind of gave up my career about three years ago to stay home with my children because i thought it's only going to be another year until the youngest is in school
i thought it was a good sacrifice to make
because it was important to me to spend some time with kids
i know that when i was in school and getting my degree at the same time it was really hard on our family because he would come home
i would leave
i would come home
he would leave
i think one day one of our kids said
they said when is dad leaving or something
i think it's become real important to me that we try to spend time together as a family
there's one or two nights a week we have a
on monday nights we set aside time where it's called family home evening
we stay home that evening all of us
we do things together
you are
you do that
right we try to do a family activity on saturday
the family home evening too
sometimes we try to do our lesson on sunday night and then our activity or something on monday
it's real important to us to spend time together
that's good
how many children do you have
what do you have
the boy's five
the girl is four
my oldest is four
my youngest is about to turn three
they are a handful
when we first got married my wife worked for a year
she got pregnant
we decided she would stay home with the kids
we made that decision
after she had the first baby she stayed home
we had a second baby
she's still at home
at work a lot of people are
i think this is not a normal situation anymore in our world we live in
most of them continue to work if they have kids
i only have one other person i know in my group here that works where the wife stays home
that's because of religious values as well
they think that's important
everybody else works
they drop their kids off at day-care and leave them
i don't know i just don't want strangers raising my children
it's not as stable for the kids
everybody decided to come over and talk to me right now
it's yeah
it's open
i try to go out of my way to plan things that he can do with the kids because
he needs to have some time with them
when he comes home he puts the kids to bed
he reads to them
he spends about an hour doing that
that's pretty good quality time
it's hard for him on saturdays
right he wants to run out and get things done
i try to say why don't you go fly kites
why don't you do something
if i have something in mind then he remembers that
we feel that just spending time together
you don't necessarily have to be doing anything that costs money or that requires you to go a great distance or anything like that
it's just the kids like being together as a family
we took the kids and and went by the farmers market down there in garland
they had a blast running around the farmers market looking at all
they had a little pen there with animals in they could pet
they liked that
on the way home we drove by the local high school
there happened to be an future farmers of america f f a going on there
they had all kinds of pigs and horses and goats and sheep and everything all out in this schoolyard there
we just said let's stop
the kids got to go around and see pigs and animals and things like that
for them that's wonderful
they thought it was the greatest fun
it didn't cost any money
you don't have quite as much money when the wife doesn't work
that's right
i do think the current trends are that the family unit is devaluated
we find that back just even fifty years ago when people had financial problems the first place they went to was their family
families took care of themselves
now they don't support each other that way
definitely motherhood is devalued in this society
if you're stay at home and you're a mother it's what a waste
people think you should be fulfilling yourself
a mother isn't an important thing as having a career
that should be first and and children second
they don't have what we call an internal perspective of things
it's not an easy sacrifice for a person to make
because i have interests too
it is hard to make those interests not be as a major part of my life
at this point
when we started having kids she had to work for a little while
then she just started substituting
she would just substitute once or twice a week just for that little extra money when we were in school
then we would just come home and just go to a neighbor's house for an hour
she wouldn't do that every day
my youngest sister's at b y u now
they have no one at home
it's just a temporary thing
in the middle of it it seems like a long time
you're right
i see that we both share the same belief here that it's important that we spend time with our kids
in spite of
it's hard sometimes at work because people say we're taking a cruise
we're going there because they have a lot more money
a lot of them decide just not to have children
it's amazing they either have one or none
the one person i know that has one they feel guilty
on weekends she would spend all of her time with her kids and spend lots and lots of money
basically i think they really spoil the child
they don't want to have anymore children because she doesn't think she could be a mother at home
she just doesn't think that she could
the guilt feelings she can't deal with it anymore
it is
my wife likes staying home
she works at home some though
the place she worked with before worked out an arrangement with her where she can work at home
that's good
it's kind of a seasonal thing
the rest of the time she's free
she enjoys staying at home
the money part of it is not as rewarding obviously
there's different rewards different kinds of rewards
i think it's an investment in your future even if it's purely not religious
you really have to make quite a bit of money
i know there's
when you adjust your income for what you put out for day-care you're only making five
now we're supposed to talk about social activities
the changes that's occurred
i guess it would be like your generation compared to my generation
i think your generation is
what do i say
they're polite
how was it maybe ten twenty thirty years ago as opposed to what it is today
other people just in general i think and just towards people and property
i guess they would be more conservative some of them i guess
we are somewhat conservative
socially our crime rate has increased
although it's more publicized as opposed to what it used to be it seems like violent crime is on the increase from what i've seen
our prison population has significantly increased i would say
our economy too it's just not what it used to be in the sixties or even fifties from history from what i've read
even the
it started spiraling down i suppose in the seventies
our recovery economically has not been like it used to be
to me also our nuclear family is not the same because more people are living together that aren't married i don't know if
i don't really want to
because i have no problems about it either way kids are i suppose have been raised by single parents more than they ever used to women are more on the rise too so far as getting their careers established
they no longer feel dependent upon men
do you think that that maybe
i've heard different
i know my mom and other ladies they complain because they think that the women now are too busy with their own personal life and career that they really don't have time for their kids
they are a lot of them that have to put their kids into day care or having more with baby sitters
especially if they don't have boy friends or husbands
i guess that's why you always hear these stories about kids being neglected
in fact there was one lady in this area
my gosh just a baby
not a baby she was old enough to
my gosh
that's just an extreme example
i would imagine the situations are out there
i think our education has increased dramatically
then i think also that we're forgetting basic things we should know i think in the morals and values of my generation for most people are totally different from the morals and values of per se your generation
i think as we get older it gets to your
i think the kids now are i would say louder now until after they reach like twenty-five
i think they really have a strong decline and start to settle down and realize things
i could agree with that because used to conservatism was inherent at a much younger age
kids nowadays are just given so much that they really don't have to work
they don't have any intent to go working until they have to
what else considering beside family economics
we can now travel around the world in no time
it's just a hop skip and a jump to get into a plane to go from the east to the west coast i think what's happened too is just our technology is just advancing so rapidly that and there's so much information available out there that folks out there just have a hard time keeping up aside from just going through their daily routine of living to get from day to day to keep abreast of the knowledge out there we got to constantly read go to school
t v watching hasn't gone too much out the door because t v is still
the cable system and the satellite dishes has made it to where a lot of people can just leave regular t v programming and watch a variety of programs out there as well as use of the v c r i don't know if it really hampers or it helps our education system
i don't know because while i'm up here at school i don't watch hardly any t v
thursday night i like to sit down and watch a few shows
i don't any more
even though there's a few up here we call them couch potatoes
for the most part i will
i live in an all girls dorm
for the most part we're all between the ages of eighteen like twenty-one there isn't really a lot of t v watching
that's good
i guess they have their crowds like during the soap operas like in between classes or something i can't say that there's really that many people that sit in front of the t v all day
that's a change then
of course going to school too it's different from the home environment
i know this girl
she's just working within the school
yesterday she was at the kindergarten
there's this little boy
he didn't want to do anything
he said i'm not doing this
he sat at his desk with two pencils in his hand and pretend like he's playing nintendo
i don't know how
i never really watched a lot of t v when i was younger
my parents really didn't allow us to watch that much t v
i don't know
because t v kind of ruined me
that's all that we had not really
it's for the top medium of entertainment
i guess we watched a lot of t v in the winter time
in the summer like right now my mom she doesn't let us watch t v until like eight o'clock at night
my younger brothers and sisters at home
when it starts getting nice outside in the summer and everything she makes us go outside
we're allowed to come in and watch t v until it's dark because she doesn't like the t v herself if it was up to her we wouldn't have one
she feels that kids are too dependent on it also
is there anything else
work ethics
it's maybe getting better a little
of course we're having to weather through the savings and loans all the other scandalous items that the greed that overwhelmed us in the eighties i i think it's going to have to have it's patchwork put on us because we have so much to pay for now
it was nice talking to you
what are majoring in
i'm in california visiting right now
i live in virginia
i'm sitting here going dear
None
what changes
in my lifetime the biggest is in more women working
just to jump ahead a little bit
then we can back up
yeah
i don't see that really yet in positions of power really
do you work in private corporation or government
before that i worked in a bank for eight years
now i'm retired
i see
which do you work in
i work in academia before
there's one woman in our institute who is a manager
in a since perhaps she gets protected a lot because it's almost like a token
it's sort of unfortunate because i think that they don't accept her technically
she's a good paper pusher
it's in a technical position really
she should be more technical for what she does
i think that's sort of unfortunate
because it doesn't really help the cause in the long run
i don't know
teaching i still see that that's where most of the woman are
it's always been that way
not at the college level
i worked at the university for a while
there are woman there
they're not the high paid professors that
they did have one woman dean
i guess she probably did very well
that's the minority
do you think it's because women aren't qualified or don't want the job or just aren't hired for the jobs
i don't know how
of course at this university
it's a big engineering school
i don't think there are many women in the engineering college
that's where the high pay is
i'm wondering how many women actually major in engineering
i say that
yet i know too
i think there are more than there used to be
they may not go into teaching
the two that i know obviously are not in teaching
i suppose in a since i was surprised when they told me they majored in engineering
i don't know that many men that have majored in engineering
because i'm in the humanities it's just
yeah
i met one one day that had just joined the faculty in agricultural engineering
that really surprised me
that's interesting
i suppose that it's difficult to really say why because there probably are a limited number of women who are interested in the subject and well qualified
maybe there aren't
i don't know how many go on and get a p h d in engineering
which could be partially cultural anyway
so that it might be circularly being the same problem of expecting not to get hired for the good jobs anyway
why spend your time getting qualified
None
i guess what amazes me is the number of men who are willing to stay home with the kids
in our case we actually have one father who works part-time a six
hour day so that he can take the kids or kid i'm not sure
was she the major wage earner
this is
did she earn more money that he did
None
yeah
i would imagine she might
he's a really nice guy
he did say that because he was in the humanities and he's now working in more of a technical situation that he had trouble finding a job
so that maybe she was more qualified
still it's interesting that he's been doing this evidently for a good number of years
it's unusual
i know one gal
she's a c p a
her husband is a house husband
they had a child
he was still the house husband
he was
that really is
she was
i don't know how it is now
i know we all went out one evening
i think it would strike one as strange if there's no reason for somebody to stay home that
that's what you'll always be
yet we have to think about that
if she had offered to stay home we wouldn't have thought anything stran-
we're
it wouldn't have been a doubter
because if somebody does if and breaks tradition you're surprised
it's an interesting topic
yet i must say it's not one that i've given a great deal of thought to
it's one of those things that seems to happen
i don't feel for the most part that i've been discriminated against
i don't like administration
then i'm probably a poor example although i was an administrator and could still be i suppose
you were more ambitious than they would let you be
the money didn't go with the positions
i would
the promotions came
there comparable pay for the responsibility
i was told you don't need as much pay as i have because your children are older than my children
your husband has a good job
in a since i suppose when i was hired into the government i was taken advantage of
that's true that sometimes other people get higher increments
for even
i think we are programmed to just take it
i hadn't thought about it because i do like what i do
i just sort of ignore the administrative
part of it since i didn't like it when i had to do it
i figure nobody must like it
i know some people thrive on it
since i don't have a whole lot more to say on the topic
i think this is a tough subject because when you come from two different parts of the country the political views are really different
i guess i've had to discuss a number of what might be considered controversial issues
i guess nothing is as awful as abortion
gun control and day care an things like that
there are some very different views of the people connected with the program which i thought was really interesting
you say two different parts of the country
are you referring to yourself
being in baltimore
maryland is prob- as a hub of liberalism
compared to the country
in many ways very liberal
though pennsylvania and new york aren't actually as liberal
maryland is a very liberal state
here
most people in maryland vote for that
it really is a different
of course you talk gun controls down here in texas
you're asking to be lynched
that's right talk to
i talked with a woman who actually had just purchased a gun that day
and was going target shooting
it was very different
this has opened my eyes to thinking
at one time i just sat here and thought how can anybody believe that
i'd really never met people that did
now i talk to people that do
it's really interesting
it's very true
i'm a new yorker by birth
although i claim florida as my home now
i also have two sons living elsewhere
i lived in florida for ten years
i kind of like it down there
they had a gun control law which went a little bit too far
i think
in your words they were a little bit too liberal
if i'm correct i believe they permitted their carrying concealed weapons
they quickly did away with it
i think in the next session they modified it
it's still legal to own
you can possess 'em here too
None
the brady bill that's
the delay
that's
i'm with the n r a myself
really the only objection we have
next thing you know somebody's trying to take more
that's the
way i guess most of the
political organizations work
None
i would say i'm probably liberal
what is your feeling about expressing yourself by burning the american flag
i'll tell you
i think if they didn't give as much coverage to these idiots that burn the flag it would never happen
i guess i believe that if somebody wants to burn the flag i guess that's their opportunity
they're right in the sense of freedom of speech
i would never
now wait a minute there
None
of being able to display your
ideas
what america stands on is that they can do that
i still
what the flag stands for i guess to me is
that if somebody wants to voice their opinion or display their opinion openly and if that is a way that they can
i still
burn unless the actual fire hinders somebody's health and well-being
None
i think that's taxpayer's money
buys their own flag and burns it that's fine
None
then you don't draw a line between public property and a public symbol
i think what america stands for is the right to be able to disagree with the government
by freedom of speech
i think i
the idea they always keep saying the framers
i believe that the idea of burning
my understanding of how it was framed is that the thing about this country is that you can disagree with its government
you can display
yeah
so that as a freedom of expression and speech and
whatever i think that that's viable
as long as it's your flag and you've made your point i think
realistically you don't think it's right
i would never do it
i love this country too much
that symbol means a lot to me
i guess it's just one of those things where it's a need for them
again we
even though you agree with me
you wouldn't do it yourself
nevertheless you maintain that it is the right of any citizen
so long as it's their possession
that's
i used to know as a boy scout
all i remember was the red in the flag represented the blood that was shed to to create this country
to me that's black eye to every man that ever carried a weapon or killed for his country
i find it you know personally disgusting
i don't think that we
have a right to stop somebody from that
i guess i get all
it's very easy to do
it g- when it's an emotional issue
you sit
you try and think
you try to say to yourself
logically
even for instance the pro life pro choice movement
you know that's just a disgusting thing
i think it should be permitted under certain circumstances
that's what i mean
realistically when you think of it it just sounds like such an awful thing
it evokes an emotional response
ever been decided when is a fetus a human
i think the
the christian point
is always the point of it's at conception
then a friend of mine's a doctor and argues with others that conception is a biblical term
there's no concept of conception in medicine or biology
it's a topsy-turvy world
it's really something how political
ideas and viewpoints within one country can vary so much and also
within the own
how it'll sway from one extreme to another
i think that in this day and age everyone needs to have some sort of exposure to community service
it seems like
i'm thinking of people that are in jail now
i think that maybe if some of those people had gotten exposed to the community gotten exposed to working with other people that some of the things that they did they would not have done
they understand people more
i agree with you in the sense that i think that it's important for people to also share give something of themselves i think that there's too much in a way of self-gratification today
there's not enough sharing
i'm speaking about people that are born rich
that's all they know
i'm thinking that community service would help them just get a feel of what else is out there how other people are living
if they were to work in i don't know a soup kitchen or something
on the same note if poorer people
i think the peace corps is great too
because you go to different countries
you see
in fact i saw an interview on t v the other night with patrick swayze
he's making a movie in i think it's calcutta or either india
somewhere where it's a very poor poor country
he said that people in the west
he said since being there
he said that people have no idea he said of what human sacrifice is
since being there he's learned what it is to be poor and have nothing
yet those people have such a happy
in other words they don't dwell on what they don't have
they're happy with each other type of thing
he said that when he comes back he knows that it it's completely changed his life
i think that that
maybe he wasn't before
now he sees
i think that anybody that works in some kind of service or for the community or something
they can see
you can't know what you don't see
you have to experience some things
you know a lot of people know that other people are poor
they don't know what poor is
unless they actually see it and help or something
i know that that must be true especially if you do something along the lines of helping them learn how to survive how to plant
i've seen so many
extraordinary things on t v
that people have done working in the peace corps and how the people of the community they worked in is so much better
i really believe that they can in something like that
there's something i've really be skeptical of
if you want to send fifty cents a day
you can help a child
i don't know i guess it's just me
i don't know whether to trust that or not
how do yo-
and things going on
i would love to help somebody
i can't bring myself to trust this company who is trying to do this or whatever it is
i don't know just today people are just so money hungry
you don't know what they
it's not like it used to be even in the years of my growing up
i'm fifty-three years old
i have seen a town change from a town to a city and its
people grow from a small town to a large town
you would think that more people would be better share more
do more be more community oriented and all
if they just get more unto themselves kind of
it's not the sharing of
a neighbor to a neighbor we would go out and not even lock our doors and not even worry about it
you can't do that today
today it's like you wouldn't even think of doing that
if you don't have bars on the window you're not even safe
even when i first moved to dallas from new york it seemed like dallas was so open
this was only
i guess it has been awhile
it's amazing now how much it's changed
i don't go
outside at night
in fact i was talking to someone from dallas just last week
they was saying that
she had gone overseas to tokyo
she asked them there if there was anywhere that she shouldn't go because she was alone
being a girl from another country
she said they thought for a few seconds
they said no
they said to her that even if she left her purse on the subway
that she would have that purse returned to her
with nothing missing okay
this is a foreign country you would think being an american or whatever
a foreigner there that
if you leave something anywhere you might as well forget it
she said she could tell them for fifteen minutes places not to go in and around dallas
that's where she was from
i could live in an apartment
i live in waco
you live in really low priced housing you live on the other side of town in the high price apartments
i live
i live in the high price apartments simply because i feel safe here i'm paying probably the hundred or hundred fifty dollars more than i would be paying somewhere else
i wouldn't be able to sleep at night and that to me is worth the extra money for me to be
i feel very safe where i am
that's why i think if people were more exposed to
especially young kids getting out of high school
to have the same exposure and to further their worldliness so to speak
and go to see foreign countries that they would not necessarily be able to afford to see
join the navy to see the world type of thing
nowadays they don't do that anymore
it's not a thing a
a lot of young men don't even have the desire to go into the service
or to do something for someone else
i don't know
to mothers not being at home
we were saying that the basic family is disrupted these days
i think before the father would work
the mother would stay home
having that mother there that base i think
was a big part of family a big part of what your youngsters thought about what they did
the thing is
i think a man can afford to support a woman
the woman affords the luxuries
in other words anyone can live
so to speak
it's what's important to you
a family
i think that girls today have children
six weeks later they're back to work
don't ever see the
it's the most beautiful thing that happens between a mother and a child
i mean once the child's in school if you had a job from say nine to three
they're in school
it's kids that come home and don't have a mother there or the kids are at home in the morning and
where you on the phone a long time
he was waiting for what again
let me go a head and push one
basically i like comedy shows
murphy brown designing women
we have two t v
neither one of them work
for the last year
we just got married
we decided for the first year we won't get a t v
i'm totally out of it as far
we went through that after about five years of marriage
we made it almost about eighteen months without a television
then all of a sudden when you get one you realize gee
i needed that
then you get to remote control the stereo phonic
then you never use the v c r
now it's like we're just glad we never went out and bought a compact disk player cause we wouldn't use it
it's cause your never home
i don't know t v shows
what can i tell you
i like things like i just mentioned
that's the one with candice bergen in it
see another thing was i worked on second shift for like a year and a half
before that i was in college for four years
i never watched t v then because i didn't have time
the
i don't
i could tell you in school that the only thing that ever saw in the dorm was the one soap opera all my children
until then i never paid attention to soap operas
to this day twenty years later i'm in my thirties
i'm going jeez i can't believe that thing's still on television
i almost got hooked on it cause everybody would took about it at dinner and everything else
it was
they
about the only other kinds of things i like
i like to watch a lot of news
almost a year
my god
you'll get one
i never really watched it much growing up
i thought my husband would really miss it because he was an only child
he's seen a lot of t v
i figured no
i don't miss it that much
he did miss it
i've seen cosby show probably ten times
it's a pretty funny show
you have
it's just a over priced
boston yuppie
i like watching a lot of college basketball and pro football
that sounds kind of stupid
no
i like pro basket ball as opposed to
i like the n b a play-offs
back when the pistons were in them
sherman texas
sherman texas
i was just saying where am i calling you from
then i don't know if you like the mavericks or not
we're supposed to talk about television
are you really from texas though
sounds like you're from up north
i wondered if had any teams you like watching from up north or something
i'm a big chicago bears' fan
i always watch them no matter who's on
i'm from indiana
i like the bears
i watch
i like tennis
i haven't played in years
i just like to watch
two players really go at it
i don't
i used to watch oprah a lot in the afternoons
i see her every once in awhile like if i go workout at t i
they have those t v right
was her show big when you where in school since you haven't been out that long
back then
did you see the show where she lost all of that fat
she wheeled it out on a cart
then she's really porked out again i guess
if you don't have a v c r don't even spend your money on it
if you like movies like we do you do it once in awhile
you see it when it first comes out if you really want to see it
it usually comes on television within two years
we've got the dollar cinema in sherman
we usually see first-rate movies
that's television
None
i always
it's hard to talk about something
i feel bad cause
that's okay
my husband had been on this project
she called in
and it was all about sending your kids to college
she was from boston
she was
she was very snooty
her kids were going to places like amherst and b u
i said i didn't know what that was
she went
i thought
i know
it's like don't worry about it
everybody's
what was his name wolf blitzer
did you see him when he was doing the coverage of the gulf
i might of
what was his name
what about this wolf guy
just th-
they made jokes about him on the carson show and all of that
saturday night live
i'd come home from second shift and watch him for an hour and a half
i haven't seen it in a couple of months
i think it has
they finally
some of those people
you don't know if it's a man or a woman
they say they're trying to deduce what he or she is
to see if it's a female they say do you carry a purse
pat says no
you still don't know because a fanny pack is man
now days
yeah it is pretty funny
they do some crazy things
when wayne's world
what's that other one
you've must have seen it recently
i don't know
i've seen it off and on probably
you're not totally out of the loop
yeah
we
one friend of ours got rid of his
he sold his
the rest of our friends we go and watch them
you can do without one
after awhile it will start
you just kind of all of sudden
you're going jeez
you just end up doing it
if you haven't been married that long
that's a good school
your from indiana yeah
do i have a southern accent
real southern
it is
i'm trying to think what purdue kids watch
we watch m t v twenty four hours a day
every now and then they taped days
other then that i'm sure they watched
i think other then accept on a commercial or on news coverage or something
i don't even have cable
somebody to give me a hundred and fifty
my neighbor her husband sits in front of the television all of time
they've only been married five years have a cute one year old kids
i heard dallas is pretty bad with the crime
last night i was listening to the ten o'clock news
for the first five to seven minutes of a news broadcast all they were talking about was the number of shootings the number of drug deals that were going on and crime
it's so depressing just to even listen to the news anymore
back a couple weeks ago they found some people i don't remember at some fast food restaurant
i can't remember if they had been shot or if they had just been thrown in the freezer
i'm pretty sure they'd been shot and put the freezer at the fast
i've worked in fast food restaurants
i remember i used to work at kentucky fried chicken
i just couldn't believe that
and because of the crime
that they would kill people just for the few couple hundred dollars that they would have in there
in their cash drawer
i don't know he decided not to work one night or something
one of the guys that was working was shot
kenny quit the next day
he couldn't deal with it
i understand what your talking about
i have a real problem
it doesn't matter if you live in a small town or if you live in a large city like this
i just think about all the different ways that we have to protect ourselves from
i lived in louisville kentucky for a while
i lived on the outskirts too
louisville was pretty bad especially during the kentucky derby
i don't know
it's asking about what kind of steps we can take just as citizens to try and protect ourselves
i know i have home security system
i have the special lights on the outside
i have
if there's some kind of movement
then they'll automatically come on
it's just i'm constantly think about keeping us safe and protected
that's what i've got
are they babies or
good that they're a comfort to you
i've got a four year old and a three month old
it's scary
i'm used to living in
we just
i'm used to having eight or ten houses on one street
this one's got houses on either side and
now the nice thing
i feel a little bit more comfort since we're so close together like this
i feel like that there's going to be less crime
your neighbors going to be watching out for you
because it's in their backyard too
None
we think our neighbors are stealing from us my husband
one of them's a teenager that lives next door
her friends are pretty wild
he went and got a locking gas cap for his
they weren't stealing it out of mine so much because the gas thing is kind of weird where it's hard to
he went and got a locking cap
they tried to break that off
my goodness
he went down to uba and noticed that it was hanging off where they had tried to break it off
they stole our tailgate off his truck
we can't say they did
it had to be somebody that could do it in the middle of the night
they'd seen it earlier
it's more of a matter of the steps that you do to keep yourself safe
that's why i try and do
the only thing that we can do as citizens is like watch groups that they'll have
they can be dangerous too
that
i was going home the other day
i saw a guy who looked like he was breaking into a window
i thought gee whiz i don't know if he's really doing that or not or if he's the person who lives there
i was thinking i need to call the police when i get back home
it was about about four or five blocks from where we live
i thought no because i wouldn't know if that was really a robber or not because it was in broad daylight
anymore the crime happens in daylight
as it does in night
i watched it on t v i guess last year sometime
they'll break in in the daytime
i hear that if you lock yourself out of your house
you try to get in your house it will
a professional could break in in
so scary you think you've got yourself all locked in and safe
somebody could break in
i have a dog
i want a german shepherd
i don't want any of those ones that will up the kids
i do want a german shepherd
my husband will leave every once in a while
i'm scared here by myself
that's ano-
he is just as vicious if you bu-
i thought that we'd have to have a big dog
we doesn't need a big dog
we got this little bitty dog that
part dachshunds part cocker spaniel
ease very protective
that's one of the best deterrents for a robber is a noisy neighbor even if the neighbor's got a noisy dog
it's easy to fool a dog too
throw them meat or a real intense burglar can just get another dog that's in heat
wow gosh
it was nice talking to you
maybe we'll meet up again
texas
new york does not they're trying to reinstate it
the governor's opposed to it being the democrat that he is
and mario cuomo the state legislatures are more and more coming to supporting it
i ethically don't like the idea
i should say morally i don't like the idea
socially and ethically i think it's a good idea in certain crimes
i would agree with that even more
i'm really offended
just the existence of murder rapist wh-
that after they've gone and done horrible things molested children and kill
them whatever that society has to pay upwards thirty thousand dollars a year to incarcerate them
texas is having a problem right now
i think that's the repeat crimes and the repeat offenders is happening down here where the state patrol board is letting people walk that have done heinous things from killing police officers to just multiple molestations to murders of children just really bad things
these people are getting out like three to five years before they're even suppose to be considered
now they can't find them
they're finding bodies in di-
you think why they say it's because it's over crowded
you think how is everybody that stupid
is the world really that rotten
i don't know
we have the largest murder rate of any developed
yesterday a lady i work with just told me today that in the state capitol here in austin texas they had been looking at a bill making it easier to accept the bill to access handguns
they passed it which basically means without an f b i check any person here in this state over twenty-one can get a gun
here in new york it's a lot harder than that it takes almost six months to get handgun permit in this state
that good
the
that's with
you have to have a police investigation
i know because a friend of mine wanted to get one and listed me as a reference
i know it
it's very easy to get
which i don't consider to be the kind of crime
weapon
i don't like guns in general
when i think about this topic capital punishment i just remember when i was in college in a dorm
i think if he'd been around one of my family members probably would have killed him
in florida in the state of washington when they had the ted bundy case how they just exe-
it hasn't been just
it was in the i think the second or third quarter of last year nineteen ninety i knew some people that said why are you glad
you di-
i said just maybe because he got a lot of media hype all that
None
the thing with bundy was though he escaped
yeah and did it again
that's just maybe because of the little more they said celebrated that
you see somebody's mini series
you hear about somebody's crime
this gets back to capital punishment
the man had stolen not stolen but kidnapped some wealthy ex-athlete's daughter somewhere in florida
they changed all the facts that they said it was true they buried her alive peter strauss had played the lead role
at the end they said this set person was paroled like six months ago
you're thinking
i'm not sure that capital punishment serves as a deterrence
it does serve as a
pun-
in that particular instance
i know it's on a
be all
be all
they think that if they electrocute or slip or do something or gas somebody that they're not going to have the crimes that they do have
we happen to live in dallas which is extremely crime
we just moved here
we've been here before lived in minneapolis saint paul which has an exceedingly low crime rate
we were transferred back here
when you're gone from some place for about six years as we were you really begin to see just how problematic just living is
is that near albany or syracuse
it's near syracuse
it's about
i actually live in a village of sylvan beach
i work in rome
what type of area is that
it use to have a lot of heavy industry
it's kind of
now the air force is the largest employer in the area
None
how is the situation in there in terms of crime and things that would
None
you still have more drug problems and typical
small city type problems
i don't know that there's a real
dallas is a
on some days
the good ole boy network here is very strange like i said
they believe that if they kill somebody tit for tat and
that does something
yet they want spend the money to build the new jails that
they really are over
that's just not a cop out
i'm originally from pennsylvania which i think is basically like new york these days
i don't think they have capital punishment there
i think pennsylvania may have just reenacted it
i'm
from pennsylvania also just outside
i'm from pittsburgh
we'll forgive each other
because they use to be very very conservative when i was growing up
i haven't lived there in twenty
the east part of the state has got all the bleeding hearts and all the welfare cases
that's a different subject
i don't know
you and i think are honest and candid because we could do it in this
i think everybody if they were touched by it would say
do it if somebody in my family or if it happened it me
if your friends or family had that happen to them i think everyone would
don't think that you can rehabilitate
i just don't
i just
it was basically the essence was does the crime fit the punishment
when you see how many repeat offenders there are check fraud cases where they go to jail for five to ten years and rapist getting their hand
just slapped and how it is based on the judge and if the time of day that the court is in session
all these intangible things
you're thinking
yeah
i guess it's a pretty rough thing to be electrocuted
is it
it's more that don't have it
amazingly it's massachusetts went back
and reinstated capital punishment maybe six or seven years ago
i don't know if they've used it since they've reinstated it
it's on the books
i don't know if they did something about
they were again-
did they have it
they were against it
i haven't been back here long enough to realize if they've done it in the last
i guess it depends on what age
i know
i lived through it
are you old enough to know about the war
just barely
i am twenty-nine
it was on the fringe
just yeah
had some friends that were in it
it ended when i was in college when i turned nineteen in nineteen seventy
i cannot even remember at this point
when i turned nineteen it was the year that the draft was still going on
i learned a lesson in gender
in terms of the war i do not know
i do not really know that much about it
i just know socially the impact it had here and what you hear in the media
i guess i think it was not that great that we were in there in terms of for how long it lasted
i think it is basically the same way
it certainly has affected u s policy though
there is no question it had an overwhelming effect of how we approached the thing in iraq
the whole thing that was bad about vietnam it was no different from iraq
i mean it was one country picking on a smaller weaker one
we are going to consider ourselves against in war
in full faction
it was sort of a president's war rather than a country's war
i do not know how you were historically
i was a little bit older before i realized just how long it had been going on since l b j and i pa-
it seemed like it was going on forever
it really
in terms of when you were in school i am sure that it was the majority of your high school and junior high years
one of the things i did not like was the weaponry systems that they used
it just did not seem that i do not know technically we knew what we were doing either
you heard about the things like agent orange et cetera
you would think
of course now everyone's more environmentally intelligent than they were back then
that is true
back then it was not commonly known that saccharin was bad for you and all these other things that people know about themselves now
monetarily too i just do not think we have done enough for the vietnamese people as a whole in south vietnam in general in helping them restore themselves
i don't know if it is because there are not any oil fields there
i do not know if they have that resource or not
i just think it is kind of a shame that you still hear things about the children that are orphans there
on a whole i do not know war is not good
that one i probably
my main opinion would be we should not have done it
you know a little bit more than i do
i did not get to live through it
the people that i know that it did
felt very strongly
at least some of the guys i work with rather are veterans
and from vietnam
i have not talked to any of them that were not glad that they went or rather thought that the reason they went was a good one
that
most of them are very strongly that the reason for america to be there was a good one
they just felt that the way america backed them up was not at all right
in term of
and the finances how they started
air attacks and stuff like that dropped off like crazy
because the congress would not approve
i think it started actually in the late fifties in fifty-eight fifty-nine
it really
i know in nineteen sixty-three i was nine years old
i remember right around then that's when i first started hearing about vietnam
then as i got older and studied in school i realized it was even going on before that
you think to yourself my goodness eisenhower
i know a lot of the vietnam vets that are my age in their later thirties guys that i know that they are just kind of bitter
they
it is that kind of idea
they just do not feel that socially they were given
a friend of mine called it the yellow ribbon syndrome
i won't keep you any more
that is probably about as much as we both know
thanks for talking to me
were you calling from texas
i know where that is
right near d c
pretty much
dallas it is ninety-two degrees here today
at least the humidity is below forty percent which makes it kind of phoenix
little bit cooler like eighty-nine
basically the same thing
you are not missing too much then
take it easy
carolyn one of the main things i'd like to know is how do you feel about knowing about the environment of a nursing home before you would send someone there to live and so forth
i'll tell you
i watched what went on with the twenty twenty show
they specifically talked about some in the area where i am here in texas
you knew of the
i'm not familiar with those homes per se they were in the area where i live
it was really revealing to see some of the things that go on i guess in some of these homes
i would definitely
i guess that the big thing would be once you got someone in a home like that to make sure that you went daily and made sure that they were cared for
from your point of view
how do you think they would feel i should say about moving from where they have lived most of their life into a whole new home situation
i have that kind of situation because my mother lives with me
she's eighty-seven from the time that we were tiny she said i want you to promise that you'll never put me in a rest home
i know how she feels about it
if i ever had to put her there i think it would be probably when i just could not handle it any more if she got to the point where she was totally bedridden and i just didn't have the skills or the strength to lift her or whatever it needed
how do you find that your personal relationship is with her know that you're both together all the time and you are having to do a lot more for her than normal
does that cause any problems between the two of you
i wouldn't say any more than usual
i think it's very hard for her to be waited upon so to speak
i think it's hard for her to have that role of not being able to do as much as she used to
on the other hand it takes on almost a switch of a mother child relationship
my mother lives in an apartment with my sister i except for the three or four months this summer
of course since i see her only once or twice a year i was just thrilled to have her here with me
i spent every minute i could to be with her and cooking foods for her just to make her life as though she were on vacation
somehow another that doesn't work between my mom and my sister
they find they are
my sister's uncomfortable because her mother's there
it has put pressure on both of them from that point of view
that's kind of bad news
by the same token my wife's mother is now moved into a nursing home
after all she has been a farmer's wife
she doesn't like the food
when she
that's another one of those things you have to solve
that's got to be a big adjustment for someone that's as you say lived on a farm for sixty years
go to something like that
after all their life is so totally different
in those early days the food they had to make it from scratch so to speak
you raised your own chickens
you killed your own hogs i suppose
they had to store the meat in
they had regular little places they would hang it to cure it and so forth
now all of a sudden it comes in differently
do you have any major preferences as far as
t v
i was trying to think of some while they were calling you
the one with the two little girls in it what's it called
the twins play the youngest girl
i don't know
that's not it
i like
i really like watching the old nick at nite shows
we can watch those all night sometimes if
lately i've been getting into talk shows
just controversy and
which ones do you like
it depends on the subject
where it's more interesting
his name is
he's black
has a bald head
his first name starts with an m
let's see
it's like
his first name's like marlo or marlin
he always has really strange shows like
see i don't like those
yeah
it seems like
i'm working too
everything keeps me pretty busy
speech pathology
that's what i'm majoring in
this is my first semester
when did he teach
he taught about a year ago
he used to work at university of texas at d-
shoot
he worked there for like fifteen years and then part time u t d at night
they stopped funding the program there
now he's at texas women's university
is he teaching speech pathology there
he published a paper couple of years ago i think one that i read
does he publish quite a bit
he has some different programs out
i don't know what they're called
they're
he has little stuffed animals with them and little cards and stuff
he has yeah
i remember
that's interesting
what are you studying
i am studying nursing
i'm thinking about changing right now
i don't know
it's really tough to get into the program down here
if i decide to stay in nursing i'll probably come and go to t w u
i'm living in the t w u dorm across from collier
that's where the speech program is
there all those nursing majors
i tell you what
that's a tough field though
i have a lot of respect for those people
they've spent a lot of hours studying
you're at baylor
i get to come home on the nineteenth
i'm so excited
is it
it's in provo
i really like it out here
i've been away too long
i've been away from there too long
how
i play a couple of instruments
clarinet is my primary instrument
i also play a little bit of saxophone flute and piano when i get the opportunity which isn't very often
i play the violin and play trumpet i run a municipal band
i sometimes conduct
i'm pretty busy too
was about forty-five miles away i play in a slightly smaller one called the lockhaven symphony and community orchestra
are you a professional musician
i'm just retiring from penn state university only i
i've been working at penn state and using up all my nighttimes
and weekends going to these orchestra rehearsals and concerts and so forth
that's just
we rehearse once a week
that's amazing because i have it set up here that we have at least six to seven rehearsals per concert
one thing is we have a summer series
every single sunday night we play at the library to have a little outdoor stage set up we do that every sunday night during the summer
i don't know we just have an awful lot of engagements
we're just having to turn a lot of people down because we don't want to do things like have a concert back to back or even two days in a row
you must back up and play some of the music twice
you get your little sousa book
you just flip
so you don't play pretty well a full concert band music most of the time then
it's always a mystery
it actually doesn't matter who shows up
so many people switch instruments so often
yeah
i think there's about seventy
on any given night there's not seventy
because about the best i can normally hope for is about fifty
that fills a stage and keeps us busy
they want to play things that push them to do
that's why we have to work real hard when we get a concert together
the last one we did was in a large mall close here
that worked out very nicely
let's see
there's another band around here
someone at work is trying to get me to join that one because they need clarinet players their concert schedule isn't as heavy
they have more in the summer
i think they have ten in the summer one week after the other
i think they're monday nights they don't have rehearsals during that time period
are you just saying you sight read every concert
it's not really sight reading when you've done it again and again and again
some people are
where does this happen laurie
they're in the suburbs of dallas in richardson and plano
i declare
i think it's very much more of a social group than anything else
people always bring refreshments for after rehearsal and hang around for an hour or so
do any of you in your group get paid for any of this
the conductor gets paid a little bit
i think he's the only one that gets paid
you do have to buy your music
who sponsors you basically the city
we do get an awful lot of music
we can borrow music from any of the area colleges if some group just isn't going to play any more they'll just give us their music and that type of thing
we do an awful lot of
we get a lot of donations
i work the same way
i'll be darned
what do you think
providing universal health care insurance for the whole country is a pretty big task
personally i don't approve of it for two reasons
number one is that i think that the federal government has a problem with the deficit right now
if they were to administer this they would
number two i think that the quality of health care would go down because the competition would be dried up
really no one would only answer
i've seen what it has done in other countries
i don't think we should head in that direction
i do agree that they exist
health care insurance for everyone is skyrocketing
it's become to a point where basically no one can afford it anymore
i agree that it's a big task
i think that the u s should move toward some kind of national health care plan at least as a long term kind of goal
possibly just starting with more regulation of health insurance and that sort of thing
i think that ultimately it would be a good idea to
just it seems that health insurance costs are sky rocketing as fast as the national deficit perhaps
so that
that's a vicious cycle of course
what you're saying though is instead of having the national government administer giving health insurance to every man woman and child throughout the whole company you see more of them as regulating the high costs that people are forced to pay for it right now
is that correct
do you think that
i wouldn't exclude the possibility of the government actually administrating it ultimately
with the costs as they are right now do you think that the government
what that would require is for us to pay more taxes
the people that can afford taxes the middle income and the upper income will be paying more taxes to pay for health insurance for everyone whereas right now the public themselves get health insurance
they provide their own health insurance
as it is now the middle and upper classes are paying more than their share for the health care of the whole country because they're the only people that can afford health insurance
that the other people have no health insurance
they'll get medical care anyway at least in emergencies
somebody winds up paying for that
basically the people paying for it are the people who are buying health insurance
i don't see that this situation would get any worse
you think it might get better huh
i kind of disagree
the reason being is we have
i guess it's my fear of the national government and also because the bureaucratic rules that it would take to administer it
the health insurance companies right now pretty much regulate and are pretty picky and don't allow cases where they might throw them out of business whereas the federal government if they took over everything they wouldn't care because they'll never go out of business
so you'd s-
i feel that the cost would increase dramatically also
in the same sense the care and the attitude of the doctors and the professionals within the medical field would diminish
i think
i'm not sure what contributes to air pollution exactly
i guess when you think of it everybody has some sort of aerosol in their home
it's kind of dangerous
i don't know
i'm close to salt lake there's mountains all around
sometimes i think tend to hold a little bit of it in
it's fairly clean
you know how quite a
you think the mountains are kind of a barrier
i don't know
when i drive down just along the freeway there's a lot of plants that they're burning things
here in texas i know pretty much every place here is relatively flat
i would think that that would probably contribute to us not having that big of a smog problem or something like that
we have a real fog problem
the last few years just through december and january it really is foggy and seems to just
it's kind of like it just stays for a month quite foggy
gee
i don't know what else
i guess i've never really thought about the fact in california they have a lot of smog problems
it's real hilly there
that is probably something that plays a
i think probably just a lot of factories they have the smoke stacks i guess you call them and different things like that
that's what i see burning a lot
i know there are some oil companies
i'm sure that that contributes a lot
aren't they supposed to be coming out with some sort of special gas or something that doesn't emit certain chemicals or something
i don't know
i haven't heard that
i know
i think they differ from state to state
that's been a new thing in the last few years
i guess some cars are a lot worse than others
i think those
are you working for t i
i work in waco at a t v station
that's how you got involved
no we have
my husband's sister lives in dallas
they kind of got us involved that way
yeah i don't know
i know that
i know they're always churning that up i think they burn a lot there too
we just had a big thing here in waco
it's really been a big fight because a lot of the people that live by the landfill don't want it expanded because they're thinking that they're water is going to be contaminated somehow
they
i don't think i'd like that
we when we've taken things to the dump just the dump that is closest to us
i know that on windy days they're always moving the trash over to different spots
they've got those big bulldozers
you can see the dust flying
i'm sure that their homes are really quite dusty
one of the big concerns is there's a school right across the highway from the landfill
is there
the parents were really really upset
worried about their kids getting
they've been fighting over it for the last year
they just now approved it
they're going to try an appeal or something
cooking and food
i don't cook a lot
i am kind of interested in cakes and muffins and stuff like that
i can't seem to get them exactly right
i am just trying to perfect some things
i have a bread recipe that is real easy that everyone always really does like
that doesn't require kneading the dough
it is wonderful
what is funny is that you use bran all bran it looks like it is a wheat bread
it is actually all bran flour it is just regular
the type that yeast that sort of thing you let it rise
you can let it rise in the refrigerator and then punch it down and then make your rolls
they really are good they are so easy to do
last year i had a christmas party at my office
i made the tuna fish sandwiches
i think everyone knows how to make tuna fish
i thought that would be easy for me to make
i can not go wrong with that
i made it
i used celery seed in my
i just thought it was so strange
i thought that that was what celery seed was for
how funny
everyone really really loved the tuna fish
they just couldn't get over the fact that i used celery in it
it just surprised me
see i have used celery before
i never used the celery seed in it
what else do you put in it besides the celery seed
just really fine onions and green pepper and the celery seed
i use miracle whip salad dressing instead of the actual mayonnaise because i really don't like the helman's mayonnaise
if you use salad dressing with kind of i guess a tart taste
it was the first time
i was brought up with tuna fish where you put in chopped hard boiled eggs which now is a no no with cholesterol and
chopped up dill pickles
i don't think i had eggs that night or something
i would have put eggs
isn't that interesting
you use bell pepper and onion and celery seed
sometimes i use the miracle whip
sometimes if i am using regular mayonnaise to spice it up a little bit i will use a little bit of mustard with it
just to put a little zing in it
i like to barbecue baby back ribs
they are so easy to do if you have a good barbecue sauce you just cook them very very slowly in the oven
it is not hard to cook like some meals are
of course it is messy to eat
i make lasagna from scratch
people really like my lasagna sometimes i am requested to make that
that is not too hard to do because you can do it in advanced and just bake it
and not breaking the pasta
i have a wonderful recipe for strawberry pie
it just takes forever it is when the strawberries are nice and big and fresh and yummy
it is like a normal pie crust
then you use this sort of
it is a cream cheese layering
you thin it out a little bit
or make it a little fluffier
you line the whole pie crust with that it is sort of like in a way using cheese cake
it is not a real cheese cake
then you
just put the strawberries
it is really making me want to exercise
every single woman in the audience is about ten pounds
i started anchoring
exercising about last spring when i joined the president's health club
i was really motivated and going
i went for a little while
it is hard to go regularly for a long time
where i live in waco they do not have anywhere here that is affiliated with president's
now i do not have a club
i do not have any motivation to just go out and jog aimlessly or something like that
i am not exercising at the moment
i wish i could
i just do not like just running with no where to go
i had gotten up regularly for awhile with a neighbor
i thought that would be the time to get going
we walked pretty steadily for about three weeks
then she had to get back to work which was
she is not around
i just don't like walking by myself at night or in the dark of the morning i don't seem to find time in the day time
of course it is motivation that is keeping me from really looking for that opportunity
i think a lot of the times if you have someone to work out with or walk with or something it does give you that motivation
you can pretty much do it privately if you had your own private sort of contest where you would try and see if you could lose more weight than your friend or something like that
that would keep you going
more than weight
of course i could lose certainly from ten to twenty pounds i think more than that
that is something that i am motivated about now because i do need to get myself feeling better just in better shape
all the same it is connected to my attitude
i am not feeling as perky and good
it is hard to get my attitude to get myself up there
i understand that walking is suppose to be the best exercise
you have less chance of hurting yourself
it works everything it gets your breathing up it doesn't yeah
i understand running hurt your shins or knees or something like that
it felt good
then i had pulled a muscle in my knee
i hyper extended it or something
boy
i have never had that problem before i guess that age just starts to catch up to me
i guess my favorite exercise in the gym is the bikes
is it
if you watch television or if you listen to a walkman it is pretty okay
that is sort of weird because you are not going anywhere
i use to play racquetball i really liked that because to me it had a point
there were points you would make
there was a point to it
running and jogging and just not going anywhere is just
i have got a dog now
of course she needs walking that is a little less burdensome or boring to be walking at least with her
i can put on the earphones to have something to listen to
you were talking about walking at night and in the morning or early in the morning
you see a lot of mostly older people though that walk in the malls
early in the mornings and things like that
i have never even thought about it really
we have over here in plano a little recreation center that has got a walking track
it is also for security as well as the convenience of doing it any time of the year
i find it very tedious because i am watching the clock constantly
there is just nothing else to look at
i actually get more tired doing that than
that is a little less
what kind of music do you like
seeing as how i'm a musician
i like everything from hard core country to wagner and mahler
i like new age stuff
i basically have a wide range of musical likes
None
there is things written for doc severenson and a few other people
the rest of them are just parts
i love baroque music
it is one of my favorite periods
in fact
we used to have ralph dutchen
now he is in massachusetts
then there is a trumpet player at north texas the main teacher
he has played
the two of them have played natural trumpets
occasionally when she can't get those people we use just e flat trumpets with valves
glen bell plays
rick bogarts played
do you like romantic music
that is mostly the rest of good trumpet marks are romantic music mahler and ruckner and strauss
i am liking it more and more now
they are mostly mozart
i just like the melodies more and libretto
my trumpet teacher used to play in the fort worth opera
i have not seen him playing anywhere lately
maybe it is cause he is playing in fort worth
i am basically a church musician
we do all
we hire lots of instrumentalists off and on for different things
i am always making music
there are some of the few organizations that have the funds to do big big works
we hire an orchestra at least twice a year
he plays pretty regularly
i think so
i heard glen bell taught at plano as well
they have cornered the market on trumpet
we are a group of musicians that just kind of have formed out of a desire to sing
many of the people in the group are just real talented
lot of them are former music teachers or currently teaching
there's one gal that's in the plano community orchestra
just different backgrounds
i play the piano i have a four year old who has started to play the piano
he does that musically listens
he can play which is kind of interesting
i think it's because he's always heard music in our home since he was a baby
they did
that's lots of fun
how did they get involved in that
basically they read in the newspaper that there were open auditions
they went and tried out
my husband played harold hill from the music man
my son played one of the children in a band
how fun
my son plays the clarinet in his band at school
my daughter takes piano lessons too
we just really like music
i especially like it as an outlet when the t v goes off
who do you have her or him take it from
i have him take from a friend of mine who teaches suzuki
you listen to the music and then learn to play it by hearing the intervals and things like that
i teach
you play what's on the piano
he can't learn like that
i guess he's about two and a half in his real understanding of things
when my friend played something on the piano and he played it with his right hand
we went wow we better have him s- do something
educationally
that was really fun
my
my husband and i love to go to the musicals when they come into town into dallas
i have an eight and a half year old daughter who's taking piano lessons and started out at the age of just turning five she just seemed to enjoy it so much
now my four and a half year old daughter is trying to imitate her older sister and wanting to play
she actually does some very nice chording just naturally
i think that's great
i wasn't sure when to start her
i didn't want to push her too early either but kind of had a mixed feelings about that scene
that's really hard i think especially if you start them
they get pretty good
they get close ten eleven or something
you're like god i really want
sometimes it's hard to know exactly when
i don't know
knowing from what my daughter has gone through she learned a lot
of course it was something she had to keep relearning if she ever got away from it
i don't know if she's any farther ahead than those kids who started when they were eight
should i say seven
she's not a gifted pianist in the sense that she's going to excel just naturally
None
i'm kind of just playing with it
at this point we're going to kind of wait i think just more for the financial reasons of it anyway
it can get expensive that's for sure
my friend is very generous in letting us have my children do the suzuki method without paying a lot out
that's good
it's been good for our family
as a piano teacher do you have any feelings for kids who come from a suzuki method
i don't have any suzuki students
something happening to me at christmas time that verified to me that i will al-
i don't have an elderly person that i could send to a nursing home or anything
both of my parents are dead
i did have a friend that was in a convalescent home like a nursing home
i went there very often to visit her and
i think they would be better off being at home with their family
we have an eighty seven year old mother in law living with me right now because of her circumstances she can no longer live independently
even moving from her house to our house has been tremendously unsettling for her
we have several young children they about drive her crazy
i can believe that
most elderly people can't take having a lot of noise and kids running around and things like that
we've struggled a lot with it because most of the nursing homes i've been in are very depressing to me
she's still alert enough that i think she would really know that we were putting her there i think she would really resent it
i think that would make it very hard
on the other hand i see my wife with
oh see that's really a sad situation
None
when the kids have kids come she's always saying why do they have to be here
she'll say that to the kids' friends
it's a hard situation either way i think
in a case like that you more or less think it would be better if she were in a nursing home because you have your family growing up where
the cost of these nursing homes are so
you really have no choice that way if you're not rich
i know this lady that was a friend of mine
her husband was still alive at the time when she was in there
it was costing him a small fortune to keep her in there
i think we need to develop some alternatives like adult day care that's more readily available
just come home for dinner
usually they want to go to bed fairly early anyhow
that would probably be nice if we could ever get something like that
there's not many of those available right now they're very hard to get them into
we tried sending her to a senior citizen center
they're really not prepared to cope with her because she's somewhat senile
a lot of the activities that they're engaged in she can't participate in
i think it's an issue that
with the graying of america we're really going to have to as a country figure out how we're going to deal with this
it is a difficult situation
you hate seeing them just sort of send off and not well cared for
if they don't know anybody and they don't know what's going on around them and everything like that i can see maybe a nursing home would be better
if they have their wits about them and everything it's kind of hard
i think it depends on their physical ability too
my mother always said she hopes she never had to be like that
luckily she lived by herself
one day she had a heart attack
she was gone
she never did have to go into a nursing home or anything like that
there's so many of us kids that
she could have taken turns living with each one of us for a period of time because we all don't live in the same city anyhow nor the same state
i have a couple more that live out here in california
then i have a broth-
why don't you go ahead first
short term it works out pretty well because we have just enough to cover expenses with a little left over
budgeting in the short term isn't too much of an issue because there's not that much extra to go around
long term is
we're starting to think about long term considerations college and retirement
with not a whole lot of discretionary money it's kind of hard to figure out how to do it
that's kind of
to what we're doing is budgeting
month to month is kind of taking into consideration what the bills are and what's extra
that's kind of how we do it from month to month depending on what insurance is due or whatever
long term that's a little bit easier for us because with our jobs we can take out extra money towards savings four oh one k plans retirement plans that kind of stuff
we can kind of put aside some money that actually is better for us not to see versus when it's on the paycheck
you have to try and take out some of that money
long term probably is a little bit better than short term simply because it's automatically taken out
that works out much better for us
that's kind of how we do it anyway
and the old if you can't see it then you can't spend it idea
if you can't touch it you can't spend it either
that kind of works out where you get into some plans that you touch it you're going to get a penalty that kind of thing
it leads you to kind of say i'm not going to take it out
i'm going to keep it and
you'll have that
that's kind of how we do it
ours is more like month to month too
other than that is kind of how we do it
i don't know if our time is up or what
they'll
we actually do have some money in a four oh one k
i just wish i could afford to put more away each week because i agree that it's an excellent way
it grows
it seems like at first you're not going to see a big return
as the years go on if you're with the company for any length of time then it gets much better
you just have to kind of look at it that way
there's other savings plans or other things that you can do
automatic deposit from checks to where you don't see it
exactly whatever is in our checking account is basically just about what gets spent
we don't see it
then it works out to where you don't look at it
that's it
it's easy because you do spend it
like i said you kind of look at it
you better have some other way of savings
checking accounts aren't the best for long term type of planning
you don't get a good return on it anyway
i guess other than things like the stock market or mutual funds there's really not much of a return on anything these days
it's a bad time
it's nice for people buying homes
for older people who have money in c d or whatever it must be awfully hard to see rates go down to three and a half percent or whatever
we have some in-laws that had theirs in some money market certificates and other things and kind of took them out of that because they got so low
it drops
your better bet is to try to get in with something with your corporation if they have some kind of savings plans or something like that to where they kind of match the percentage or whatever or some kind of profit sharing
i'm with a small company now
i hope if we're successful that they'll go in for some sort of profit sharing that'll be very nice
i guess we're kind of running out of steam on this topic here
just briefly
i worked in a nursing home
i kind of know from way back how things used to be run
i think there has been definite changes of nursing homes
i think if i had to personally put one of my parents in a nursing home they would have to be pretty bad off to where i couldn't take care of them at all
they cook meals
they clean their house for them
they still have their own independence
and not reliable
i don't think
the nursing homes when i was working in them were very much understaffed very much in need of good personnel
i wouldn't have
they were not given the time
they were not given the money basically to staff appropriately people to help
i can remember lifting a patient all by myself simply because there was not another person to help
it's leave the patient in bed all day long get them up
i would have preferred to get them up than
i think nursing homes have changed
hopefully they have
i guess i haven't had that much experience
i've only seen my great grandparents in a nursing home i have an aunt who lived on her own until she was well in her nineties then she got sick
she ended up in nursing home my parents went to visit her
it got to the point where it seemed like the nursing home didn't want to deal wi- her anymore they gave her drugs to keep her asleep
i think that can happen
i think in the nursing home that i worked for
i'm sure that some of the patients were given medication to keep them quiet
they would just lay all day long
and the ones tha-
they were not on the same ward
they were in the same nursing home
these mentally ill patients could walk into where the other older people that were in there for reasons of age
the mentally ill patients could walk right into the rooms or do whatever they wanted to basically
because if you weren't there to watch them and keep them in their own wing they had freedom to just walk around
i think there was a couple that were schizophrenic
i remember one time watching one of the schizophrenic patients actually go out on a binge or whatever you want to say it she grabbed a hold of this
it was kind of funny when i looked back at it
i remember the patient getting very upset
that woman actually pulled the other person's hair
she just came up right behind him and pulled his hair
it was a guy that was just really upset
he said what the hell are you think you're doing
i laughed at it then
then i'm thinking god
i think there's laws now that nursing homes have to keep the mentally ill totally away from these people and not in the same type of facilities
a lot of these older people they're not insane or anything like that
they don't have these tendencies to lash out
seeing that kind of made me think twice about
it seems like the small town nursing homes there's a lot more personal attention
i kind of look at it this way
you have more competition
i think nursing homes have to be better than when there's one nursing home for a whole community
this is back in nineteen seventy-seven that i worked there i look back at it and say jeez
it would have to be awfully bad for me to put my parents in there
my grandmother later on got cancer and could no longer
actually she
far too much for what we get
uh-huh
i think when i look at all the things that are coming out now about over spending and spending money that's not there and buying things that are extremely expensive where they could buy it at a better discount
when
you mean like those twenty thousand dollar toilets
that's exactly the whole thing
it's just
as long as the person that's spending the money doesn't think about
i can go out and spend anything that i want to
they think i'll go out and buy a four hundred toilet seat
i could have went to k-mart and bought it for ten or fifteen
that kind of thing
i don't mind them getting what they need
it takes very little to just shop around and
i know a lot of corporations now are looking at their amount of money that's being spent
they're looking at what's the best buy
it used to be if you had a company you had to go through certain people
you didn't care what you paid
going to actually shop at best buy for fax machines things like that instead of going through these office supply companies that mark up their amounts and say i'll give you a legal pad for five bucks
you can go to another shop and get it for maybe sixty cents or ninety cents that kind of thing
i'm also wondering why our taxes are still so high considering the world's probably in better shape now than it has been in the last fifty years
except for everything keeps going up
i know as a middle class
also i have one dependent has my daughter
i keep looking at where's the so-called tax relief for having children
there is none
i know
i think i paid just as much as when i didn't have her
i don't even get to see half my paycheck
between four oh one k and the thirty-four percent they're taking out for taxes
you're still going to owe the government as much money by the end of this coming year what's going to happen is all these people are going to find out that they owe the government
it certainly isn't going to be in their savings account
there'll be a lot of problems because of that
put people into january or february which is always suppose to be
they're going to have to just cut back
i don't know where the answer is
in the first place there's also taxation without representation
i don't feel represented anymore in our government
None
that's the whole thing
i don't think people think they can make a difference
when you've got candidates as you do
it's candidates that have money it's backed by big business
big business says we don't care about the little person
you're not going to get anymore abe lincolns around
who knows
that's going to backfire because
generations from now we might set back in our little rocking chairs and watch our grandchildren go through an entirely different system of things and say this government itself isn't working
just like the communist government of the old u s s r
maybe that's going to happen to america where they'll say hey
and each state take care of itself and no government type of
something has to happen
i'm certainly fed up with it
should young americans be forced to do a year of service
i don't think they should be forced
i think they should be i guess encouraged to do some kind of public work i guess just to get them i guess involved with community maybe
other than that i think it's a good idea to get them involved in city and community activities and the shelters and
helping out volunteering i guess if they can
i'd force them
i think a lot of kids actually do a lot of work
no one just realizes it
i think they start out young like in girl scouts and boy scouts
i was a boy scout
as part of being a boy scout you had to do projects all throughout
to become an eagle scout you have to do a yearlong project
see that's what we did in girl scouts
that got you involved real good
i think it starts kids out on the right track
it lets them decide if that's what they enjoy doing
i think people generally volunteer
i think a lot more people volunteer than get credit for it in hospitals and the shelters and stuff like that
even if it is a couple times a year like at the holidays at least they're getting out and doing it and
we have a funny commercial around here
they could solve all the world's problems or something
i guess if we all give five hours a week or five percent of our salary we could
or just force kids to serve for parents i guess
yeah
i've noticed a lot of
i think that's pretty neat
they go along and have so many miles i guess of highway to take over they clean it up
i think
i think it gets them prepared to learn how to volunteer as they get older
i know i did in girl scouts and everything
just started trying to get something together like that around here from the community because we had a big ice storm very recently
i'm in new york
long way
we just had a really big ice storm
basically half of the trees in the city are no good anymore
we had three hundred thousand people without power
it was
we didn't have power for a week
there are still people who don't have power
it's been ten days already
there are still something like ten thousand people without power
my god
yeah
we're officially in a state of emergency
funny thing is the national news how they covered it
we've been in a state of emergency for ten or eleven days
we just got our phone back today
they're putting out ads now for people to come volunteer
that's good
we have
everywhere that a tree is down people need help
a lot of older folks need help getting
they certainly can't carry it themselves
one thing we do at our church is
we go along
i'm really not sure how we find the individuals
we find older people that cannot afford to fix up their homes that desperately need it
we go along with all the material and in one day more or less go in and say roof paint fix whatever we can
that's great
it's not a lot because you're just doing a house at a time
every little bit helps
is that supported by all donations to the church and so forth
he
he donates a lot not everything but a lot of the material
we don't promote it a lot outside the community because we don't want recognition for it so much as we just want to help people out
it's real neat
i bet it gives you a real good feeling to be doing that
it helps people
this last couple we helped they were in their eighties
she was bedridden
just tears your heart out to see this kind of thing
if you can do any a little bit it helps
that's real good
we had organizations like that in college
some did elderly visits
some did big brother big sister stuff like that
i'm convinced that at least twenty-five percent of our school participated in some sort of group
activity that
twenty-five i don't know twenty-five percent
that's a lot of kids though
she thinks
it was a small school
still that's a good chunk of kids
a lot of people would get involved
there were all different
they had a dance marathon for charity or to support that
such that lots of people got involved that way
i'll agree with you though
None
some people i don't think have a year in them to volunteer if you know what i mean
some people just can't even afford it
whatever
the peace corps doesn't pay very well
their parents
i have a friend whose daughter is in the peace corps in guatemala right now
he and his wife just went off to visit her
i know i could never afford to go visit a kid in guatemala
None
i think
the kid's certainly not making much money
i can see where that
i'm grateful for people like that
i don't see how they can yeah
neither can i
i
i'll do my little community service throughout but never for a year again
i guess our vote is no
it's been nice talking to you again
i hope everything works out up there
we're slowly getting everything back together again
it's taking time
everything
good luck
good luck to you too
all right
with little regulation going on because of deregulation during the reagan eight years more and more s and l simply began to take riskier and riskier loans
when they began to collapse one after the other i think almost like an avalanche of property values devalued
i don't have a field for whether or not this is the equivalent of what was called the teapot dome
i vaguely recall
i've never gone and done any study on it since the s and l thing
that teapot dome scandal is where gobs of land was sold at really inflated prices on the theory that there were natural gas beneath it
that appeared to be corruption within the hoover administration
i don't have a real since of corruption that caused s and l all though i have a feeling that people look the other way when things began to go sourer maybe
i think people just started not being as careful with the loans that they were making whenever they gave them out
maybe because everyone else was doing they figured they would just go ahead and approve it also
it captures some of the feeling i have from the people making business decisions that if they failed it's sort of no skin of my back
i just since that they didn't have a commitment to the stability of the organizations they were making the decisions for
i don't know whether that's because they had other opportunities to which they could move that it was that easy for them to find new work that they weren't stuck to where they were
things begin to collapse
or whether they had extracted enough money in a percentage base that they didn't care any more
i'm rather puzzled about the
None
i don't as much as i should know about it
i do know that one of the reasons that caused it is the fact that the federal reserved backed any loan that the savings and l made with a hundred thousand dollars
they were kind of insured with that hundred thousand dollars
i think that's kind of why they were making the riskier loans
they were like we have a hundred thousand dollars insurance on it
they didn't have a since of risk
plus where the fact where they were allowed to make loans in almost any type of loan
some banks they're limited to the types of loans that they're allowed to make
i think the s and l were more open with the types of loans that they were allowed to make
i think if they would be more bound to certain loans and not as high of insurance by the reserve then i don't think this would have happened
do you think there's a final accounting yet not in the since of pennies an nickels
do you think there's accounting on an ordered of magnitude or that they really do understand how much money it is
for awhile it seemed like every time i opened the paper up it was escalating in terms of damage
is your since that we now understand how bad it is
is there more to be heard yet
i think that people just basically got tired of hearing it
None
i think it's still adding up
i think it will be for awhile
you don't think necessarily they don't have a complete grasp yet
i don't think they do
i don't think how they could find how much was really lost or how much they were going to lose because there still are some s and ls still open
it's very possible for them to go down in the future because of this
do you think possibly that it will help with the regular banks
i don't know
i think it would be harder
i think there are some regular banks that will go down with it
it seems that i recall reading let's say starting three years a go but not so much in the last year of bank risks relative to the loaning funds to third world countries like mexico venezuela
and argentina based on oil loans
the price of oil had gone south resulting in those loans being very risky
i guess i read articles of various banks that have done the right thing to contain their risks given that they had made multiple billion dollar loans
i have this vague since that that could happen that there are still monies loaned out to third world countries that could end up being totally lost
yeah
they just wrote off millions of dollars because they know they will never get it back
they just wrote it right off
i think we've lost a lot of money
we never going to get it back
you think that it's just gone
cause we're talking about some peens that have just even gave up on getting it back and trying any more
my since is it was there to try to protect small investors
it ended up protecting big investors
i guess i feel like as long as we have the possibility for this large numbers of people to be protected the possibility exist for these sorts of problems
i think is it necessary to have the backing
it's just for safe purposes in case something would happen
i ne-
your since is that the loan guaranties really were accounts guaranties
so that the account holders that if something went wrong they would have their money
given that the s and ls have had disasters then their money is still being protected
it's million of people with anywhere from thousands to tens of thousands i guess of dollars being protected
it seems like there was a lot of money being protected in multiple accounts
if you take ten million people and protect ten thousand dollars it still only a hundred billion dollars
we're taking about monies way in access of that now
it's obvious that we've protected large accounts
it seems like maybe that needs to be rethought
i guess i'm content with the need to have protection on accounts
i feel likes it's on an individual basis
they're all protected by the government
let alone any of them that went bankrupt
i guess that means that from my perspective it could happen again
that means
i'm not worried enough
then it will happen again because we don't pay attention to those kinds of things
i think it will be a long time in the future before it does happen again
i think the bank people in any kind of people like that are going to be worry enough not to let it happen again in the near future
i think later on they're going to start and forget about and start making the riskier loans
you're going to have to take some risk
as long as their backed i think they're still going start taking on riskier loans
i think there is a chance of it possibly happen again but not until late in the future
perhaps if there are regulatory constraints put back in place
maybe we have learned a little bit of a lesson here about what happens if you remove a little of the regulation
my family moved to texas about eight years ago
i have never lived here
when we came back to texas i was really kind of excited
there wasn't a tax on food that we purchased at the grocery store and things
all of that was new to me
i'm sort of feeling like we're getting a better deal here
i lived in missouri and then in utah
both places had pretty good state income tax
we've always paid tax on everything we purchased even food at the grocery store
i thought it was really kind of a pretty good deal not to have to pay tax on your groceries
i don't enjoy paying taxes
it's hard
i think that is what we have to have our streets and have our government
we have to pay for them and pay for the employment of the people that run them and things like that
i think i guess what i feel is that most people they don't like to pay taxes because they feel like there's some people that aren't paying their fair share
that makes you feel bad
when last year the elections were going on the governors election and state and
i didn't have anything against clayton williams personally or anything
it was kind of hard for me to think here's someone as wealthy as he is
he claimed he didn't have to pay income tax
he thought
there's some people are living pretty good life styles
they're not paying income tax
that's not fair
there's some people who are abusing the systems that we pay taxes to support
all that makes us feel bad
i think all in all how i feel is that i'm willing to pay the taxes because i think i like our country compared to the other countries i've studied and visited
i'm willing to pay extra to live here and to enjoy the services that i enjoy
i don't think that there's any system that everybody would think is fair as far as being taxed
i guess in texas with
really the people that have money to buy things are paying the more because they're paying the sales tax on the larger items that they buy and stuff
we lived in kansas city for a couple of years
we were kind of in for a rude awakening
they had personal property taxes on cars
the first year we were there it was kind of like eight hundred dollars
we're
that was kind of different
to file a state income tax was also kind of tough too
it always seems like we're always paying taxes for something
it was kind of nice this year to finally be able to get a little money back
i have a accounting background
i then have also done tax returns in the past for other people when i worked for an accounting firm
it is kind of sad to see how the people that have the resources to hire somebody and have the money to spend to put there money in places they don't have to pay taxes
i can understand why the rich people don't want to pay
a large percent
that's not really fair either
if they've earned money by themselves people just kind of given the money
it is
sometimes i think for myself that income that we have we pay a certain salary
i think the employer keeps in mind this will be deducted
so many taxes will be deducted from it
i think our salaries are a little bit higher because we have to pay taxes on it
i think in that way we're compensated just by our society
yet they don't pay you just what it would take
if you pay taxes on it you wouldn't have any money left over
some of the people that make a great deal of money and everything
i wish that they would realize that they couldn't make this kind of money
even if they made that kind of money there's some countries that have fifty percent income tax that have
they wouldn't be able to enjoy the in that
they need to be willing to pay a little bit more for it
they need to pay for it too because they couldn't do it somewhere else
i like texas not having the state income tax
i hope that
we've had enough industry here that i guess it
industry here is able to fund the state because we have oil here and things
that's what i've always heard
is that
they must have enough other stuff because the way the oil has been the last few years that really has not been
there's something about the industry in the state
the city had enough money
it was really nice that they had that
they would have so many community outdoor theaters and community country club type things
i really liked that
people decided to expect certain services
i
i'm comfortable at least in this year with
i'm willing to sacrifice i guess
i want to be here
i enjoy living here in this country
having seen other countries i'd much rather live here and pay taxes
i guess i better let you go
i've never initiated one of these phone calls
you get luck of the draw
good luck to you
you're in texas
i guess we should get on with this
did you get the message about what it was
i think they'll always represent a threat whether or not there's an active cold war or not
it's a totally different economy based on different beliefs and different priorities
given the military powers on both sides i think it's always a threat
i suspect they're not our biggest threat anymore
i wonder how much of a threat they are
i agree with you that they'll always be somewhat of a threat given that it's just so big
there's just so much military machine there
it's recognized that the two great powers are us and them
the great powers are always pitted against each other
i wonder how much longer they're going to be them
they're going downhill pretty steady
i agree right now they're not
i agree
if something were to happen i'm sure they would all of a sudden band together just for the sake of unity against us or something if need be
i feel kind of sorry for them right now because the people are wanting things that we have that they're not allow-
just some basic freedoms
their government is not allowing it
gorbachev seems to be going back on some of the things that he's been trying to push
i noticed this this most recent scare of his where he just decided that
if there are any demonstrations in favor of boris yeltsin he decided i'll just cancel all demonstrations altogether
i think that he's actually
i think he's also making the military angry at him
i've heard stories now where the military is running around
they're sort of getting restless
a restless military is the kind of thing that happens
see i'm concerned that since he's banned demonstrations altogether that he's going to do the type of thing that happened in tiananmen square
he's going to wipe out no telling how many of his own countrymen right in the middle of red square
it's going to cause more civil war than is already occurring
i wonder
he seems
it might be something that he wouldn't be able to control
that's something that really true
that's certainly true
his military may just go out and say we just
we're to not let you do it
that's real scary
i would expect their own problems would keep them away from us for a while
it could be real dangerous
i guess as long as they're fighting each other we don't have to worry about them wasting their time with us
wouldn't it be nice if no one had to fight anybody else
that's an impossibility i think given the differences in the world
people are just too different
i don't know
i think that underlying we're all probably not as different as everybody thinks
unfortunately people aren't that insightful
that's certainly true of it
therefore he's wrong
he's bad
we have to wipe him out
i was discussing with someone before
this someone before one of these calls matter of fact about another topic
it came up
one of these calls matter of fact about another topic
it came up
this poem everything i wanted to know i learned in kindergarten or something
this is the idea that
the idea that
in kindergarten we learned to share
we learned to play with each other
whenever we'd start a fight we'd all apologize and hug each other
that would be all
if we could just do the same thing sort of with everybody else i suspect we'd be fine
people grow up
they forget
i often sort of wonder how having never been to the soviet union how different the people there really are
not right now of course at some point i would like to go to moscow just to see all these things that you can see on television now and can read about
ten years ago we didn't have this kind of information we didn't know what things were like
i would love to go there to go see what this is like
this is amazing because this is an example of an entirely different culture that wants to be like us
it would be interesting to watch
the people
i just feel so sorry for the people in the country that they can't do any-
there's nothing that they can do
the ones i even feel somewhat worse for even
the ones in the baltic states where they don't have a strong leader then
at least russia has some sort of strong leader
i mean they have yeltsin who may yet sort of help russia
the baltic states i think are just sort of trapped
they were taken over not too long ago and then just sort of told you're here now
i think it's a sad state of affairs
it's probably not dissimilar from the something like that in northern iraq who are actually countrymen of
some of them were split off into israel i believe
some of them are in turkey when actually they're their own people and their beliefs and their own culture system
they were split up into three different countries
they're very dissatisfied
they're causing wars right now
i don't think it's that different from what the baltic states are going through
it sounds very similar
they were sort of forced
now they just want to sort of speak up and say hey
they have a problem
i think their big problem up there is unfortunately
they all want the
whereas the baltics are saying we want our own
the one that i think
one of the women that i work for is married to an iranian
she has a lot of insight because she knows a lot of the history of the countries over there
within five or six countries there are probably ten cultures of people
they don't all have their own country
some of them are mad about it
my wife is syrian
also i know some of the history
the other funny thing is that i'm jewish
i know
i know
i sort of toured the area
i know that it really is lots of different cultures in one place it's almost the same thing out in the soviet union right now
there are
we did it couple of hundred years ago here
they wanted to do it
i don't think the people here two hundred years ago were that different
that's certainly true
they had the same ideals and the same basic beliefs
i wonder if now the people in the soviet union don't have ideas very different from that
they might
i understand the topic this morning is our policy in latin america and what we've been doing down there
as you indicated you don't have too much input into the area
it just so happens that our daughter-in-law is panamanian
we have been in panama
i have worked in el salvador
we visit mexico occasionally
we do have a little information on it here
very good
when i was in college i visited mexico several times
i was in the peace corps and
recently i have been following the middle east rather than
that's for sure
the u s policy towards central america as far as
i kind of go back to the el salvador thing because texas instruments had a plant down there for a while
i worked in there for a little while
at that particular time
let's see
that was seventy-three seventy-four kind of before the the civil war really picked up down there
u s policy at that particular time there was of course military assistance to the government itself
anything that's anti-communist we kind of had a tendency to be pro
i believe at the time that i was down there that the salvadorian government really gotten out of hand yet
the right wing death squad type situation
i wasn't really aware of it's being terribly at the time that i was down there
our policies seem to be pretty much one of trying to setup businesses down there and use the one resource anyway that salvador had
that was people
we didn't seem to be going in and taking anything out of the country other than just it's labor
everything that t i did anyway we shipped in
it was worked on down there assembled and then sent back here
i didn't feel that we really exploiting them any
you don't feel that we were exploiting in the sense of we were benefiting
they weren't
in the particular incidence that i was aware of t i wasn't the only ones in there
there was several other companies
of course we kind of concentrate on
i felt like we're going in and taken all their gold or oil
it just
the only thing that they had a great abundance of was human beings
did we tend to change their attitudes
sometimes when americans go into foreign countries they tend to flaunt american things americanism consumer products t v the whole works
there was a
the time that i was down there i stayed quite a bit at one of the big hotels san salvador
at the time i thought there ought to be a law against american tourists because they for the most part tend to be the most obnoxious as a group
i saw this in panama also
it's the almost stereotype
flowery shirt shorts camera hanging around their neck demanding this that and the other thing
we're here
we want this
we want that
that's the stereotype that's very strong down there
that sort of thing
i believe those of us who were working down there got a little bit more appreciation for the local culture
yet they were having to deal directly with the local people
boy
there is the old brash or ugly american-type
i saw incidences in the hotel where i just wanted to go over and crawl in the corner and say my god
those are not americans
there are
of course i remember one case where we had some canadians in there who were every bit as bad
i think it's just kind of the north american situation
i didn't see quite as much of that sort of thing as panamanians are just about
they're every bit
i know when my son was in the air force
he was stationed in panama
he married a panamanian girl
when she came up here
except for the language situation some of the cultures she's just about an american
as far as t v and the moneymaking part of it and all that
the local population kind of sort of accepts that
i've also seen the other side of it too
you were in peru
i wasn't aware of that many americans there except for a very heavy concentration of peace corps volunteers
it was one of the big targets
i don't think at that time at least peace corps was an obnoxious group in the sense that we were very controlled regarding number of days off
you couldn't just take off and leave your group and go explore and things like that
i was working actually in the savings and loan program
that was quite specialized
what area did you live in
is peace corps still active down in there
i don't have any idea
i was peru thirteen which meant there were twelve groups before mine
some of them were quite big in the sense they were community development
they were building schools and doing co-ops and things like that
health inoculation and things
has those influences lasted
do you know whether the things that you and your groups before you did did those live on
were they reabsorbed
some of the peace corps that i knew of did marry peruvians
every now and then some news filters in that they went to see some of the old things
and of course the savings and loan program that just continued to grow
we were just a very small specialized group too to get that going and spread
of course peace corps bowed out of that because that's something that nationalized very quickly
that was kind of the aim wasn't it to get it started and then have it
that's
i knew that there was a lot of effort
a lot of work went into a lot of that
i just wondered if it lasted and if it took
some of the programs i would have concern about like the language teaching
why should we push english
a lot of people were down there teaching english
when they talked about hungary or someplace one of the eastern law countries requesting peace corps to teach language to me that's a little bit marginal
the textbook was in english
basically i taught it in spanish
because i really didn't see the point in their knowing stuff rotely and writing it on a test
my brother-in-law teaches at northern illinois university
they were in china a couple of years ago
he was over there at the university of shah and teaching
how do you feel about the metric system
i have more than one foreign automobile
i find the nondecimal system with all the halves and quarters
they give you these measurements like forty-two and three eighths inches
we had to go a little less and trying to figure what's less than three eighths
you used the metric
you just go down
you get out so many inches
we just marked a little bit less than that which is somewhat awkward
had it been millimeters you could have done
they in essence have gotten around it by listing decimal inches
are you involved in any engineering drawing stuff that
i work in metal fab
tenths of inches are normal
the inch is broken up and has been for quite some time in tenths hundredths thousandths ten thousandths of an inch
are you involved in any other metric type things like
i have a suzuki motorcycle
i've had motorcycles japanese motorcycles for years and years
the metric system comes easy to me
i think it's interesting when you go out there
you're looking for a wrench
you want the next size larger
i inherited some stuff like fifteen thirty seconds
that one's fairly easy because that's probably slightly under half an inch
some of them like twenty-seven
there are some thirty seconds and some of the things that don't translate
to go from eighths to sixteenths to thirty seconds and remember where it falls it
you've got to go over there and try it
i suppose i need a larger one
obviously you can look at it and say
do you drink adult beverages
have you noticed that a lot of
the next
fifths of whiskey i thought was always kind of strange
i always wondered about that myself
they had quarts at the same time though
the idea was is that with five fifths they could sell five
it was
i find that interesting
it's the soda and this kind of things coming in one liter bottles
i think it's kind of generational
although i must admit that i'm not conversant in saying that's three centimeters away or
it's like i say i work in a machine shop
everything's still inches
everything's still fractions of inches or tenths or thousandths or
it's hard to think though
it's like a mill
we use a one mill bond wire or one point five mill bond wire on semiconductor devices
what's a mill
what really annoys me is the way we in the united states have been converting to metric
before that we had a horizon plymouth horizon
both of them were a mismatch of both
don't you find that interesting
why pieces
could you get any connection on which was metric and which wasn't
the starter was bosch american
the bolts were english then
it was annoying
three bolts on the starter
two of them were american
one of them was metric
you go from the water pump up to the radiator
on the water pump it was all metric
on the factory fittings the factory screw lock radiator hose clamps
if you look at general motors the size
and of course ford and chrysler
if they all went metric
in a sense it's like when you're milling something you simply set your equipment
you got your calipers there
you measure
it's not a problem either way
you go to look at it
you don't know which set to reach in american or metric
you're never quite sure
is that a metric bolt
you beat on it
it can be annoying
my other concern is is the american government going to force us to go
i don't think so
i think they've now just taken the attitude that if it
there a lot of things like sports
automobile races
i don't think it's particularly bothersome because in reality
it's like troy ounces in ounces of gold
how many ounces of gold
i was trying to figure up gold content on something
it has gold plated header
they're trying to think of what's a troy ounce
that makes
is that going to change too
there's a metric ton
there's a ton
what's a metric ton
se- i don't remember
i read it
are we still going to maintain drams for perfume
but then the medicine
and some of these other things
and the chemistry in those kinds of areas
when you go to order a drink say i don't know it's
what will a shot be
when you go to the store and you're trying to figure this box is twelve ounces
this one's three pounds
the other one's two point one kis
you're lost
i don't know
i think the federal government is going to more or less leave it alone
i think there are more pressing problems
what i was thinking about is an economical issue concerning it
are the tools that
are you talking about cutting equipment or tools for set up
tools for set up and for measurement
you got to have a one tenth indicator
it's a hundred dollars
usually two one tenth indicators at a hundred dollars each
you got to have six inch set of calipers at anywhere from sixty to a hundred twenty dollars
you got to have a zero to one for sixty dollars
you've got thousands of dollars or so
i was thinking about though that when you actually get to the milling equipment though when it starts turning
i know
when you simply drilling a hole a real simple thing like gee
as in metric size hole or an american sized hole
the thing is then you've got to with screws
that's the other issue
and thread
i don't go to the movies a whole lot
i went two or three weeks ago for the first time in a long time and saw dances with wolves which turned out to be an extremely good movie
i hear
a whole bunch of us were going to go see it
it's playing at school in about two weeks i guess
we're going to go see that
you enjoyed that
it's something that
i was telling him about a couple of weeks ago
he said i'll wait until it comes out on tape and rent the video
i said no
the scenery and the landscape and the country that they're in needs a big screen
it's just amazing amazing picture
i've heard it's not one for the videos
every now and then you find one that you say yeah
this is the one for me this time
let's see
i was just sit-
friend and i went to see out for justice which is steven segal because we're both big karate fans
we wanted to see what this is like
impressed with
i've seen his other movies
i just think he's pretty good
this movie
his karate is pretty good
i generally
i'd be just fine without them because kids come running out wanting to beat each other up
they do
they get i remember when grand prix came out when i was a kid and some other movies like that
i suspect today what they see is bound to be what they want to do when they get out of it
that was number one for the week too
it was a little bit
in the middle of that conversation we sort or picked an interesting point
that helped us sort of feel good about ourselves and about one around us in that at least if everyone's running around seeing karate movies and stuff like that at least they're still going to see the real good movies
it turned out to be an excellent movie
i was absolutely enthralled by it
patrick swayze
i especially like him
you know what's pretty cute
i've seen the ads for it
i'm not real sure what it's about
some friends called up and said do you want to go see this movie
they said it starred meryl streep and mel brooks
i thought what a strange combination
it's albert brooks
it's lot better
it was a strange combination
it turned out to be a very cute movie
the whole premise is that they go out
they die they have to
they happen to meet in this town this sort of city where you're set up
they
they decide if you can move up to the next level
it's something like that
they have to decide whether or not they're good enough
as it turns out they meet there and fall in love and stuff like that
you can guess the rest of the plot
it's really funny because what they have them do is sit down and see scenes of their lives
that's pretty good
i guess that's where the title comes from then
they have an attorney for you and attorney
the prosecutor's job is to make sure you don't move up a level
the defense's job is to make sure that you do
it's a neat little story actually
i went thinking it'll be okay not great
i actually came away thinking it was really pretty good
we've got a couple of movies out recently ghosts and defending your life that have to do with after life i guess
it kind of makes you wonder
besides working at t i i'm a graduate student at north texas and working on master's in communication
i think about these things and people trying to define their own world view
what exactly do we see about this world
why are we so fascinated with the other world
i'm sure that it seems like
it certainly would explain the preoccupation with
i suspect it's always been a preoccupation with that sort of things
it has
there's no real way of finding out
did you ever see flatliners
i did not
she really liked it
that's probably one of those ones that
probably worth seeing on video
we really enjoyed it
it was also right along the same lines
they would go ahead and kill themselves for three or four minutes to see what happens
she said that this was almost believable
you get the medical profession doing these kinds of things
you never know
it's a little far fetched to
it was odd enough
they didn't just sort of make it silly
it was done fairly well i think
i actually enjoyed that as well
then they get crazy
it doesn't end like the story has been going
i guess that covers our topic
it was nice talking to you
i think that there is something definitely wrong with our school system just because of the results that you see coming out of the school system
as far as people dropping out of school grades on test scores being low more and more people taking g e d trying to get out of high school instead of just going through high school
you know something must be wrong as far as not just the teaching techniques but just motivation
within the schools themselves
it's okay
she
the results
i hear what you're saying about the results
i'm in a kind of an interesting situation in that my wife teaches school here in plano
i know that the results that they get out of the system sometime is certainly not
i know
i work around a lot of teachers
i understand how supportive they are of their students and how excited they are
some how i don't think the students are getting excited
i've often wondered if it doesn't come back to the home environment
no matter what they do in the classroom if they go home at night and it's all totally undone
the thing that karen my wife has run into so often is that you run into a group of kids that are going to succeed no matter what no matter how bad their teachers are
these people somehow manage to
it's unfortunately probably maybe twenty-five or thirty percent of them do that
not even that much probably
that would be at the absolute most
those that come out fall out of the system that are real trouble
i wonder whether that's just
in a democracy where people have kind of a freedom to sort of do what they want
there's an inefficiency there
you've got to let those
speaking of doing what you want just in society today being that it's nineteen ninety-one
a lot of teenagers and young people have a lot more freedom as far as what they do
yeah
as far as even something as simple as staying up late watching television late
you start dating too early
that plays a big part because you spend eight hours of your day or more in school
any other part of your life that's going to definitely affect your school life
sometimes in some systems they make everything so competitive
from the minute that you walk in until you leave your competing against somebody else
your competing against a system or something
a lot of
when they get into a real competitive system they just say what the heck
and tend not to do too awful well
he is now in a program that's trying to get him out of high school because he fell back several years ago
he will have gone to school five years
the reason that he was doing so badly a couple of years ago was because his mother died
he was having to support his entire family take care of his brothers and sisters
all that had an adverse affect on his school life
that's a perfect example of how your home life plays a definite part
and
now that he's in this program and he's i guess okay
he's making straight a
i guess school was not a number one priority for him at that time
survival becomes more of a priority than education
unfortunately there's and old joke about
you don't really appreciate it until you're much older anyway
i know when i went to school my attitude was kind of one of these people are taking a tremendous amount of my time
i've got better things to be doing than sitting here listening to this stuff over and over again
i guess today some how or other there would be a program of some sort that would take care of that sort of thing
some of the cures that i've heard for this that sort of make sense
most teachers after they have taught for a very long especially at the lower grades can spot a problem almost immediately
it's kind of these intervention programs
a lot of people will get to looking at these and say hey that's socialism
that's communism
that's
then it gets political
boy
i don't care
that's the point i'm at now
that's the point we all should be at is finding some solution
nothing totally radical
if it's something that might help
there's not a lot being done
the radical programs in some cases are just totally unacceptable
there are kids families that should just simply be taken out of the homes
just removed from those situations
they're never going to get anywhere
yet politically that is not a very popular view
i'm sure that if you ran on a platform of we're going to find the kids that are having trouble at home and we're going to take them out of the home
unfortunately something like that in lieu of that is the intervention programs in school where these kids are spotted fairly early on
that's get to be a problem in texas
i mean it's almost like
you can counsel a kid eight hours a day
he goes home
in worst cases he's got parents either on drugs or something like that
they don't care
mamma guess what i did in school today
who cares
a lot of the parents now are so young
they still don't know what's going on
how are they supposed to teach their kids that are coming up what's going on
it's a vicious cycle
that we're smack dead in the center of
we have to try to swim out
kind of like the bermuda triangle
it's almost impossible to swim back up
yeah
its just the solutions they're going to be in our political system
i don't know if you've ever had too much to do with especially asian japanese families coming
here in plano we've got quite a few
engineering types people who have come from japan
they put their kids in the u s schools
they're appalled
not so much at what the schools are teaching but what they let the kids get away with
they see most
they're quite upset about the disruptive influence of school
most of them would say those people should be removed from the school system
in japan they would be
here again you get back into a political thing where
i've been out of college only two years
you were saying that you don't appreciate education until you get out
i really don't see myself going back to school or anything
i appreciate more what i had
i had all these classes and all this knowledge and this big library across the street from my dorm
i just didn't take as much advantage of it as i should have
okay
i mean all kinds of resources and just there
i'd give anything to have that right now in my regular li-
you have everything given to you
then if i was young i wouldn't see it
that's it
None
now that it's gone i
i kind of look back at it sometimes
that was a lot of fun
i'm not sure that i took the greatest advantage of what i went through there
i experienced a lot
i feel like i got a good college education
just when i got out i feel like i should have spent more time in the library
i should have taken those continuing educations classes or whatever they were
the informal classes that you don't get credit for
i guess we're in the process of a home repair right at this point
we're painting the outside of our house
certainly
interesting enough this time we're changing the color which makes it an addition
the colors that we painted changed the entire look of the house
it's helping
it really is looking good
we went through a process of home repairs on a rental house we had
probably the most extensive and the interesting part of it was how much we learned about what we could do
we didn't have very much money
we had to do it ourselves in kind of a slow process
we learned how to retile bathtubs and just all kinds of things that are unusual
the other thing that we did was the roof of our house
we did that a different color also
of course being a woman most of these things were done by the men
i wasn't directly involved
they really were helpful i know to our house
howard and i were talking about home repair the other night in connection with scouting
i think it's neat for young people to learn how to take care of a household like fixing dripping faucets
as a matter of fact
one thing we did was we had paneling on
we were repainting the front room in the hall there
we took down that paneling
he helped me
it was fun to work with him
and help putty up the holes together and do things
i like it so much better
it really does
people that have been to my house before and then now really have liked
nice to have it come out positive and look good
we have a lot that needs be done
we have carpeting
we did have a new floor put in our kitchen
i have my mother living with us
she was in a room with a carpet
of course she's quite aged
that meant she had problems now and then
it was really good to get the carpet out of there and put a linoleum down
it was easier to clean and see where the dirt was
so that was a really positive
i was impressed
i think that
it seems to me like it's probably more expensive to put down linoleum almost than it is to put down carpet
in the case of the linoleum they have to rip up everything and fix the floor
it's
they have to put stuff on the floor
it's kind of a process
it sounds like you have some pretty good experiences with home repair
my husband and i have gotten into some problems with credit cards
we tend to run them up to the maximum and then ask for more
they're really bad for us
matter of fact we've gotten rid of all of our credit cards except for a mastercard and a visa
we pretty much keep those maxed out
i was going to say that that sounds like pretty many
i see what you meant
i had probably twenty credit cards for
i had an american express american express gold an optima all the different department stores two visas two mastercards
i had
any time anybody would send me an application preapproved or whatever i took it
it really ended up getting us in some real serious trouble
see the more credit cards you have the more people offer them to you
the more you use them the more they send them to you
each of these had an annual fee also right
the american express was probably the worst because with the gold card
i can't remember how much it was because i didn't even have it very long before i gave it up i know the green card was like thirty-five forty- five dollars a year
you had to pay it in full every month
exactly
that's it
i sent back all of mine except the ones that were free
then i also limited it to one of each one mastercard and one visa
here most of the stores will accept those
i then got a discover card since they pay you back
that was one of the ones in the group that i ended up closing
it really wasn't my choice though
i ended up actually losing my credit cards
i ended up going through a credit counseling service because my husband and i just don't handle credit very well once you start with their service they close your accounts out
i see
i'm still paying on all these accounts
my accounts are closed
i would prefer to keep it that way
once we're paid off i would prefer just to have one mastercard and one visa
that's it
i pay off my cards every month
i think that's a really good way to handle it because that way if you paid off every month you never have to worry about how much do i have to pay these guys this month
you buy what you can afford
if you handle it just like you would like a check or cash it's a lot easier to keep it in check
also in a sense they're giving you a loan for a month
that if i were smarter i would have that same amount in savings and get the interest which i don't do
yeah
the thought of adding x percent to the price of what i buy
i can't accept
i think at this point in time with the economy the way it is i think that it's going to get even worse
i'm glad that we're starting to pay our debts off now
only we started this last year we probably still have about another year to go before we're completely out of the hole
i think they way the whole economy is going right now it's just not good to be in debt
that would be a very scary feeling for me to know that i was juggling payments to different people i guess because i never experienced it
it's not because i'm rich or anything
when you're getting rid of the whole credit card cycle and if you really get into the mind set i got really good at juggling money and basically robbing peter to pay paul
it was scary because i was so good at it
i thought this is not right
this has got to stop because eventually it'd end up catching up with me
it hit me in the face
it sounds like you learned from it
you're coming out of it all right
i don't think that
when we buy on credit we just don't have a concept of how much money we're spending until the bill comes in
all of a sudden you look at the bill
you go my gosh
now the fact that you still have two cards
do you use them more judiciously
we pretty much use them for emergency type things like transmission fell out on our car that paid for a new transmission and things like that
we try not to use them for incidental type things like gas and stuff like that
i've gotten a lot more away from credit cards
i pay by check a lot more now
it sounds good
like i said it sounds like you've really got it under control
i admire you for having that mind set for not even getting past the thirty days
that's ideally where i would like to be
like i said once it happened i couldn't because my son's tuition came due
i guess i had not really counted on it quite at that point yeah
it was i thought a lot
sixty dollars interest or something for just a couple of months
i'm going jeez that's outrageous
in retrospect it wasn't all that much
a lot of people pay a lot more
still i figured i didn't need those items if it cost me sixty dollars more to have them
i think about all the money that we've spent on interest on all of our credit cards
it's just incredible
did you use to not feel so badly because you could take it off your income tax
i'm fairly newly married
i've only been married less than two years before that i never owned a home or anything
i never had any deductions
really it was always just money thrown away
i never really thought about it because
i was so good at it that it just kind of got stuck in the back of my mind and just never became a real problem until all of a sudden it came an insurmountable problem
i suspect that thinking about it and looking at my friends and the number of credit cards that they use and the amount that i know they buy i guess probably a lot of them are in a similar situation and just don't talk about it
most people don't like to talk about money
and especially if you don't feel you're handling it quite right or that somebody might make fun of you or that it would be
i think the average american is probably pretty heavily in debt not including a mortgage
a mortgage is an understandable debt because you have to have a roof over your head
i would much rather own my own home than be renting it like we're doing
we're basically kind of throwing seven hundred dollars a month away
right now with the way our credit card situation is there's nobody in the world that's going to give us a mortgage on a house
once i suppose you prove yourself by paying this off next year you'll be in very good shape
it's going to take quite a while
i'm not really counting on it real soon
the weather here is warm
it has been sort of raining on and off
i am an avid gardener
i measure the rain in our rain gauge on a regular basis
i can avoid wasting money on watering
it has been threatening to rain for the last couple of days
it has not
it is very warm here which is typical for this time of the year
i think you are earlier than we are as a rule aren't you
your growing summer starts a lot earlier than ours
it starts in march as a rule
people have got their gardens in a lot of them now
probably not
we have had a frost as late as in june
that is nice
i will be glad to give you some of ours
usually we get it in great quantities in april and may
it stops for three months
it has really been nice here
i don't know if we'll get it or not
the weather they forecast for our area seems to go right past us and misses us just by not too many miles
i know the weather is very important for people who make their living off of the land
we live out in the country
we are not a farming person
we have a garden
we are not farmers
you know there are some disadvantages to being down south
that is it gets so hot that a lot of things die during the summer from the heat
they really do
you have to be very careful to make sure you keep everything watered
that makes it bad too with water being at a premium
they have really been rationed on their water
it makes it real hard to have a yard
my parents are now in san diego
they've got pebbles in their yard because
they are not allowed to water
what do you do
it is very rough on them
the summers are extremely hot
your humidity is different though than ours i think
it makes a bit of a difference too
what is your humidity like
i don't know
i do not know what it is percentage wise
None
it is drier in dallas than it is in houston or san antonio or even austin
it is not dry
i have lived here for many years
i think it has gotten more humid over the years
it could be
i know my brother's home has been flooded a couple of times
does he live near the lake
there is a lake not far
it is more run off from surrounding areas and that
he is just in an area where it is just low enough that it collects there
he has had a couple of inches in his house several times
that is a problem
they tell you when you are looking for a house or buying land to build on
to be very careful and check the drainage because
it is deceptive
i know exactly what you mean
where we are we get flooded it floods below us
we are high enough that we never have had any problem like that
that is fortunate
we really like it here
i like it here
i grew up here
i did grow up here
this is very much home for me
i liked it when we visited there
one of my theories is that you always go to warm places during the winter
i go to cool places during the summer if i can anyway
usually when we have gone it has been nice
it is hot to me in the wintertime down there
it is nice
it is really a nice area
i had a friend from england visit once at christmas
we could not get her out of the what she called the back garden
she went back to the north of england with a sunburn
good heavens
it takes me about four and a half hours to mow our grass
i try to cover up
that is really healthier frankly
i have had a couple of problems
i decided it is not worth it
i like to get tan in the summer time because i think you look healthier
we are just crazy
it is interesting because you get out in that sun an awful lot
my sister is a sun fiend
she is five years younger than me
i think that is why
it just makes your skin more leathery
i don't know the scientific principle
it burns something off the natural oils or something like that
the elasticity of your skin the collagen or whatever they call it
you lose a lot of that
that sounds like the right theory
we have really had nice
when it has rained it's been a good soaking rain
it has just been a really nice spring
that is great
it has been very nice here too
i hope it continues because my parents are coming to visit this evening
that is great
i want them to have nice weather for their visit instead of driving around in the rain
probably four or five days
that is great
thank you
i hope the weather stays real good for them and that you have a good visit and everything
i hope your garden does good
okay
it was really nice talking to you
good luck in this venture
it is like i said
i hope you enjoy it as much as i have been enjoying it
in fact if i had not been preparing for the out of town visitors i probably would have been making some phone calls in the last couple of days
i forget to make a call
i am glad you have broken the ice with me because now i will start doing it
thanks jean
is that a sport you like to participate in
i'm a second hand spectator as a result of my late husband's interest in golf
i guess he'd be a fanatic if he thought he could get away with it
he limits it pretty good
i have tried to go out and play golf
i stand there and swing and swing
i can't even hit the ball
i am very good at watching it on television
he was really enthusiastic about keeping up with the tournaments
he's really into it
and did some instructions at the country club for a while
golf tended to be so-
i am not really deeply involved in following any of the sports
golf was one that i developed a working knowledge of a lot of the golfers
therefore i enjoyed following those particular players
part of it was the personality and their sportsmanship
the competitor
i became involved in following his career
i know that my husband
he thought he was spectacular
i'm not going to stay interested in him
i decided andy bean was good competition
any time they both played he was just real excited when tom was shown on the television
i followed andy bean
he's interesting
he's quite a character
there are some really really wonderful people in the game of golf who do give wonderful role models
i think it's critical to have a good role model in any sports
do you ever watch those where they just play for a certain amou-
i myself really have not seen a whole lot of point to the game of golf
you hit it again and lose it again
i know the whole point is to get it in that little bitty hole
seems to me like if they made the hole bigger it'd be easier
i know
i sometimes wonder why men like it so much because they get so frustrated mad at themselves when they don't do well
they play maybe once a month or less they all hit in the low nineties
they think they're having a really good game
my husband's average ran in the mid seventies he wasn't bad
as far as influencing young people i think that that is one of the sports that you can carry into old age
it is a good healthy wholesome lifestyle
i think that that is one of the sports that's a good healthy way to move into maturity safely
a lot of elderly people don't even take up golf until they're in their later years
they can still get good at it
it's something that
maybe that's what i'll do when i have time later on
it's also something that husband and wife can participate in you can both enjoy the same sport and participate in separate circles
you can go to the country club together
you've both been out and exercised
you have enjoyed the day
i'll tell you what if they're not real good golfers sometimes it is not fun to ride around and listen to their exclamations all day long
my husband's pretty tolerant
he's not too bad to watch
mine had a very short fuse
just get so mad he'd just wham that club up against a tree and break that rascal
he doesn't seem to show it on the golf course
he'll talk about the other guys he plays with doing that and how immature he thought it was and stuff
i guess he's real laid back about it
he'll come home though when he was shooting in the hundreds
he'll tell me what a great day he had and about this great shot he made and everything
i shot in the hundreds
i made this one good one
did you have to listen to long stories about on the seventeenth hole i hit it and went this way it's hard for me to
one thing that is a drawback about it i think is the cost
requires special equipment
they want to play another course they're not a member of and other fees
i can imagine what kind of costs are involved if you're going to try to go pro because you spend hours and hours and hours practicing
they don't give those sessions away
nor do they give instructions away
he said fine
he said we'll just take you over to the course and get you some lessons and let you see if you like it
those kinds of things happen though
you get a little taste of it
you say hey this is not bad
you really begin to develop an interest in it
i am not an athlete at all
i'm always the one that got hit by the bat in baseball
and hung my fingernails in the net in volleyball
i am not an athlete
at least you're competing against yourself i guess more than everybody else out there
i haven't really acquired an interest in it
i'm open to try anything
the one thing that is also detrimental as far i'm concerned my skin is very fair i'm going to have to golf in the evening
i'm going to have to golf at a time when the heat of the day does not cook me
i don't think the
we keep our newspapers and stuff like that
we take them to be recycled
we have a pretty nice recycling center in our city now
we take the newspapers and plastic and glass up there
they're open two days a week
you can just take it up there and drop it off
everybody up there looks pleased with themselves when they're taking their stuff in like they're doing something good to
he said every time i turn around you're telling me some new rule about recycling
yesterday i was tell him you're supposed to squeeze the plastic jugs
what are you supposed to do with them
where you're supposed to collapse the plastic jugs
i wish that our recycling center took paper bags
we like to just put our newspapers in a paper bag and then carry them up there that way
we have to bring the paper bags back every time
do you take your papers somewhere
does someone pick them up
we usually collect quite a bit
we take them in
we don't take our cans up to that center though
we don't use aluminum cans
we generally don't have those to do
it takes us about a year to save up enough to be worth bothering to go in and do
do you have any ideas on anything that would make
they charge you
it's a flat rate i think for picking up your garbage
some communities are trying to do that now
i think that maybe if they only charged for the garbage that you did not sort and have set up for recycling
they charged you by weight of how much trash you were actually sending to a land fill
that might be a better way to do it
then people would know that it was going to cost them money to not sort their trash
because then it would make monetary sense to them to say hey if i just spend the time to sort this out where this stuff can be recycled then i don't have to pay for them hauling it off
my father was telling me about some program he read about where you buy your garbage bag from the city
you pay more than just what you would pay for an empty garbage bag
then you don't pay any monthly fee or anything
how ever many bags of garbage you throw away that's how many you have to pay for
they are talking about going to curbside pickup in our city
i don't know if they decided to do or not
i think they said it was going to add either a dollar or three dollars a month to your bill to have them do that
although i think a lot of those programs can operate at about a break even point
i don't know
the center that they've got now where you take your stuff in i think that should be making some money
i guess they sell everything to some waste company that comes and gets it
i wish that more of the cans you buy vegetables and fruit and stuff like that in were recyclable
i don't know anybody that takes that
my husband likes pepsi
those cans are steel instead of aluminum
we can't ever recycle them
now i didn't know that
usually if we're going to buy sodas they're in the two liter bottles
that's all i can really think about for recycling
people that call on the phone all the time to try to sell you something that try to sell you the newspaper and carpet cleaning and roof repair
i think it's a waste of paper the people that always leave junk mail because you just end up throwing it away most of the time
probably eighty percent of the junk mail that you get is something that you don't need
m c i really does
see i just say no thank you and hang up
they won't take a no for an answer here for some reason
i do telemarketing
i'm very polite
i just say no thank you and say no thank you very politely
i hang up and
i think the only thing that really bothers me is
they try to get information out of me
like the united states census bureau
i don't understand what their need to know is
i think that is my biggest objection to anything as far as invading my privacy if somebody wants personal information out of me
telephone calls i figure they don't bother me one way or the other
i know when i do telemarketing i'm a soft person
if someone says i am not interested i'll just say fine and back out
i make very good sales
as i said i'm not half as pushy as these people because i don't really care
if they're not interested fine
i'm not pushing something down their throat that i don't think is a good item anyway
i feel like movie stars or
i guess they're portray being a movie star
i think they go too far
yeah they follow them around twenty-four hours a day
you know they do ted kennedy
it's a different story then
who cares about ed mcmahon
he has a chauffeur
he never drives a car either
seriously my classification of invasion of privacy is trying to get personal information
and without your permission
this to me is my invasion of privacy
you can always write to and stop the junk mail
i wrote to them when it came on the air
i don't get any of that bull
it works by the way
the telephone doesn't bother me because i leave it half the time on answering service anyway
i figure i can turn it off one way or the other
i think that's the only bottom line thing that i dislike
it does
other than the u s census
the carpet place that called me three times
if people don't use the telephone
i don't know when the police has their project going
i don't know when the other ones have their project going and when they want to pick up down my street for things
i-
you have to have the telephone
you can't
sometimes it's hard to screen out all the calls that you don't want
see there's no way of knowing
that's the problem
the product i sell i sell mostly to older people which can't get it in a normal public situation
most of them like it because the company i work for is nationwide and reputable
they know that hey we're backing it one hundred percent
if we were denied the right to call people up these people would never be able to get it
they'd never have it then at that point
because we offer it in a very low quantity
i don't know what to do as far as that's concerned
it is nerve racking
at least as i said you can always say no thank you
i own my own home
you just know about what time
some days i hate staying home because the phone rings all the time
i don't know
when they call up and want to say tell me this this this this and i'll give you a free something or other
they say don't you want to know what's free
i s- no
i don't like that
even if i guess it's for coupons they have a survey they run
one of them is supposed to be a smokers survey
the questions go a lot farther than having to do anything with smoking
they start out
they ask you even to your income level
i think that's
i just found out that my car was thirty months old
it doesn't
i bought it in eighty-eight
the last car we got was a used car
mine was a year old
we bought it for very functional purposes
we bought a station wagon
we wanted one that could carry a lot of equipment
we chose a nissan stanza wagon
i've never been sorry
that's wonderful
while it is still good
we all say if i could have the car i always wanted i would buy a nissan maxima
a or foreign cars
do you feel though craftsmanship is much superior to the american abilities
i've read all the consumer reports and things
they just run head and shoulders above the american made cars
i had a ford escort that absolutely needed taps the day we got it
i mean it was ready for the graveyard
i spent as much on that car in twelve months as i spent for the car
that was just trying to hold us
it was an older car
escort is supposed to have a great track record as far as sales
it just was not deliv-
you get stung a time or two
you say no thanks
i just trusted the consumer reports and the auto
reports inst-
he gave me four choices of cars to buy
the nissan came
we bought the nissan for functional purposes not what the consumer reports said we should get
it served our needs
later on the reports that he studied showed that nissan was head and shoulders above the rest in the class that we were looking for
i'd rather have a maxima than a cadillac
it's comfort
there's a lot of features on there that are desirable if you're going to pay that kind of money for a car
where are they
what is their location
is it asian
it is japanese
if i couldn't have my luxury maxima then i'd buy me a fancy little red c r x sports car
every one of us have two sides
if i had the car i wanted
probably let's see i like the looks of the lincoln town car
i don't know the performance of it
None
i would get hung up by my boot straps if i ever mentioned the ford product in my family
i really have not seen
a lot of the american cars parts are produced in foreign countries and assembled here or vice versa
that was one minute
at any rate do you have color preferences
what would be the features that you would be looking for
the comfort of a large car that the security of a large car
and the luxuries of a large car
color preferences
i think probably if i were going to be practical which doesn't mean i would be
simply because it's more visible at night
it's cooler i believe
the interior
i'd have to live with that
if i got the c r x it would have to have a real good sound system in it because i'd want that too
can you hang on again hon-
you like to listen to a lot of music
is it talk shows
i listen to k c b i a lot
i will listen to the news and the traffic and those things at work
if i'm going to be traveling in that car for any period of time
you just can't enjoy it unless you've got a good sound system to produce all the characteristics of the instruments
i do love classical music
it li-
do you listen to w r r
i do like them
i'd like to have a compact disc player in the car
i do a fair amount of cooking
i love having guests to dinner
i usually prepare something depending upon the guests
i like to prepare chicken pasta or a casserole
unless i catch a fish and i prepare it
i just broil it and put lemon on it
that's about the way i prepare most fish
i made scallops the other night
basically i found a recipe to make it in the microwave
you swished around a little melted butter and microwaved them for about nine minutes
you had to add sesame seeds and bread crumbs on top
if you are looking for a french recipe that was good
my husband liked it
no
unfortunately scallops are one of the more expensive fish items
i look for them to go on sale at the grocery store
one of the things i love to do eat out
there's a restaurant called string bean on spring valley and central
it's just home cooking
it's kind of like black eye pea
i do not think it's a chain
that's the other restaurant black eye pea
i do not really like
i do not like greasy places
i do not feel like they are very healthy
i always
feel like the home cooking places are the healthiest meals
i tend to have chicken fried steak when i
i got chicken marinara the last two times
how was it
it was great
that's what i like
i just like a piece of chicken
i get green beans and mashed potatoes
i get teased by my family a lot because i like experimenting on food
sometimes i go for fairly exotic things
my father teases me about gourmet cooking
the last time we had some friends over for dinner i tried a dessert that sounded wonderful in the recipe
it was just a total bust
my brother tried to make a bunch of things way back
my that's ambitious
we had german shepherds at the time
we took some and gave it to the dogs
the dog he treated it like a milk bone
he never did finish it
then he tried to made grapefruit citron one time
it's supposed to be candy
it did not turn out very well
None
it concentrated all the acid of the grapefruit into a kind of a candy stick
see i am not
my husband accuses me of putting him through dessert depravation because we have ice cream
that's why when i did this experiment for the company we had about three weeks ago
everything else was fine
that was a fiasco
you have to put eggs and everything don't you
i also don't have much of a sweet tooth
i can live without dessert for the most part
make everything diet
do you cook for yourself
do you cook for others
when i was single i think my favorite meal was a baked potato
i never put anything other than a little butter on it
if i had a little cheddar cheese sometimes i would grate that up
it's amazingly satisfying
i guess there's hardly any protein
it fills you up
the cheese has to make up for whatever the protein you get
i did not say it was nourishing
it was satisfying
i never really enjoyed cooking for myself
i ate very simply
i think that's one reason i like having people over because i could try things
i must be a frustrated chemist or something like that
cooking is a little bit like being in a chemistry lab
blow up
i once had an old boy friend over to dinner when i was recently staying with my parents
i had this wonderful recipe
you were supposed to make a toffee like substance for a pie by boiling evaporated milk three hours
it does turn to toffee inside the can
the only problem was when i opened the can it just flew all over the place
the boy friend thought
he was supposed to be there at six o'clock not seven o'clock
just at the time all this happened the door bell rang
there he was
i had to have my dad sort of entertain him
i really do not remember
i have made it since i and several times before
i never had that problem
he was a gourmet cook
he had a very sophisticated taste
i really wanted to impress the heck out of him
as far as
i do enjoy cooking
i was awfully glad i was given this
i didn't quite hear all of it
i see
i think that's pleasurable for all of us
what are your thoughts on dining out
i really choose restaurants more for the quality of food than anything else
a little bit for the price
i think that as far as quality of food goes some of the most expensive places i've been had the worst quality of food
a lot of places that even don't look like much
some of the best food i have ever had was inside of a place that we drove up
i was like i'm not eating in there
we went in
it was the most wonderful food
one place that we went just recently was to atchafalaya
it was just fabulous
my husband was aghast because i ate turnip greens and liked it
where was that at near your
it's a hari krishna run restaurant
i think so
it starts with a k
that should get you close enough to be able to find it
i think it's probably listed in the restaurants
it's just fabulous food
we like arby's
they use the insides of the animals heart and liver
they form it
they make it look like roast beef
i said no
that's not what i heard
from somebody that was supposed to know what they were talking about
my goodness
that's happened before
we like mexican food
None
how about the health food restaurants like this one
it's probably not advertised as such is it
health food restaurants that
None
there are restaurants that cater to the people that are very health conscious as far as their cholesterol levels and their fat content and the amount of calcium and so forth that are in each product
they list them
it's called rodolfo's
they have very good food over there
i don't know how expensive they are
it was pretty reasonable
it was around ten dollars for lunch okay
which is kind of high for lunch i guess
you were served by maitre d's and men waiters
i won't really be interested in going there
i feel like i'm paying five dollars for the food probably and five dollars for something that i could get along quite well without
i guess if you were trying to impress somebody like taking somebody that you hadn't seen for a long time and wanted to show them a good restaurant
maybe that
now the red lobster i found is very nice at lunchtime
i like the seafood when they had it the broiled
they have lunch specials that
you can't beat that price if you went to a cafeteria
i know a lot of their specials sometimes are fried things
i had a broiled chicken breast
it was excellent
it was exce-
why would you go to a seafood restaurant
it was
he doesn't understand why somebody would go to a seafood place and eat either chicken or steak
i've never had catfish either in a restaurant because i'm from the north
that was a no no
i haven't gotten over that from the north
catfish is wonderful
i kind of stay a-
because of all the pollution in the lakes and everywhere there isn't any safe haven anymore for fish
especially in wisconsin and michigan they say no buying of our fish
i am
the best brand of chicken to buy is the pilgrim pride because they don't use all these hormones to remote unnatural growth in their products
we have to be on the lookout if we want to stay healthy
i
on one hand i see that
on the other hand my older sister remembers when at one point they were taking radioactive wastes and storing them in tin barrels which i guess
had a half-life of five years if they sit empty on dry land
they're putting radioactive waste in it which reduces it dramatically
they take these things that will rust
they throw them in the ocean which is going to speedup the process even more
i'd like to get ahold of some engineers and knock their heads together if it would do any good
then they wouldn't think
they shot holes in them to sink them
this is before i was born
we're taking thirty years ago
the tuna is radioactive to a certain extent
i think
everything we eat should have a label on it
there's some things i think we can't avoid for health purposes and some things that we just need to like
None
i'm going to starve to death
i'm going to get over it and just go ahead and eat as healthily as i possibly can
i wish i didn't
before i got married about the only credit cards i used were gas cards because i didn't like carrying the cash with me all the time
i just never wanted to get into the hang-up of using credit cards and having all those bills hanging over my head
the only reason i got it was there was a while years ago when you couldn't cash a check without a mastercard or visa
that's why i went ahead and got one
i have a whole wallet full of credit cards
i try to use at least one gasoline credit card a week and try to use a different one so that
i'll use those if i need to run in and buy a dozen pair hose right quick or something like that
for the most part i had used those for charging airline tickets
i fly southwest a good little bit which means i can just run that card through the machine
it saves a lot time
that's what i was using it for
however we had a very pressing financial family crisis which said you have no alternative
you do not have any other options i charged all three of those cards up
right now i am paying and praying
it's one of those i'm glad it was there
right
most of my charges were medications
i see
the doctor would accept mastercard or visa
a lot of times you can get by using those for
i've found some doctors that say
so many of them don't anymore
i have not
i say i need a checkup in six months
i kind of set that aside and just pay for it
i can handle paying for it and waiting two or three weeks
it is
it's very difficult to get out
i ought to go to the credit union and borrow the money and pay this off
the interest even though it bothered me it didn't used to bother me so much because of course you could list it on a schedule a
you got all your interest towards your tax deductions
now they've messed that up to where it really is a financial burden to have to pay it
it is easy to get into a credit card problem
i think about young people that think
i have my first credit card they just don't understand that you still have to be able to make the payments
it's not just paying back what you've charged
you send in fifty dollars
i'm looking at three or four years before my balances are cleared on those charge accounts
as the monthly payment amount goes down that will free up more cash where i can continue to make the larger payments
as long as i don't have a major disaster where i have to use it again i can do that
that's frightening to me
my husband is in business for himself i work for t i
he doesn't
i've learned when you're in business for yourself that you don't count on something until it's happened
it's those once in a lifetime cases
after ten years he's got two of them they should pay through next month
we're both just looking at each other every night going man that will pay off both of our mastercards
and just in one lump
that's the only way you can do it is to have a big chunk of money it's like you say
i'm really looking forward to that
you need a big chunk of money
you need a large reserve so that if you do charge on that account you can make a single lump sum payment
those are very handy if you have the reserves and you can make lump sum payments sharp good no problem you're living on the other guy's money for a while
i can promise you that those credit card companies are going to ride high on my money
it just irks me
i've got three cards
that just blows my mind
my house is paid for
even the payment on that doesn't equal the payment on one of those credit cards
my car is paid for now
you see again the credit cards came in handy
i went to a seminar
i said for crying out loud
the smart half was don't pay it for consumables
if you can't afford to go to a restaurant and eat out and pay cash don't put it on a credit card
that is the smart half
i can remember before we had kids we did that a lot
it was no biggie because we could pay it off
we cut that out real quick
i do like having them there
there is a bit of security in having the credit cards and knowing that in times of crisis they are there to use you have to have a very good sense of saving or common sense not to get yourself in trouble
pat did you vote in the last election
you did
that's great
why do you think
for example he'd say look you and i see different sides of the fence
he said i just won't vote
i think that's a lot of people
in the past three years i've had three different addresses
i just haven't
graduate school or whatever
i haven't kept track of it
i voted
this past time i didn't
i voted it for the presidential election
then i didn't vote i guess in the two year for some legislators and things
characteristically in the local elections typically those people who vote are those who feel very strongly about an issue
that's probably one reason why i voted in the last election but not really this one because this one really didn't matter that much
of course listening to the instructors you'll find out that everything matters
then you could go crazy worrying about everything
they also say that most people vote their local politics that local is much more important than national issues
that's the way you get to national that's the way you make changes about your neighborhood
i definitely think so
i know that i have been involved in preparing and in carrying out a lot of the local petitions that take place
it makes a big difference when it's the difference in having a child run over in the dark
it took a close call to wake us up and cause us to take that kind of action
that's completely unnecessary
if you just cross that major street the character of the neighborhood changes
it's less savory
i felt very strongly about that
they were at risk
it was for elderly people who lived alone
they were going to put a cluster of houses there for them
even clustering together for the elderly does not ensure safety
all it did was to in my judgment make them
we did get a petition together
we very strongly resisted it
it was placed closer to my neighborhood it was on the
i think that they're much more comfortable there
i haven't seen too much crime in my neighborhood
although we have a good crime watch program it's very serious just across the street
did you think
i know that texas's last gubernatorial election probably brought out a lot of voters
did that seem to
that got national attention i guess having a woman governor running against a man and whatever
that's it it was a dirty election
people were calling each other names and every bit of the trash
it was a dirty campaign
what's funny up here i see a lot of virginia news i guess senator robb and governor wilder are active right here
they have some type of wire tapping problem going on
the people in virginia are complaining
robb is married to lynda bird johnson the people in virginia are complaining that he's using texas politics in virginia they're really complaining big time
they said that we don't have that type of trashy politics up here like they do in texas all the time
of course that's not all the time
yeah
we were having some pretty healthy campaigns that were based on issues there for two or three of the gubernatorial races historically texas
they vote on those people who are least likely to do damage
i know that i'm previously from pennsylvania dick thornburg who's now the attorney general is going to run for senator because john heinz a senator from pennsylvania died in an airplane crash i know that they're expecting a gigantic turn out to landslide dick thornburg into the senate because they don't like the governor's political appointee or whatever they're almost expecting landslide turn out right now
you see
we're going to support him
that was true in a lot of cases in a couple of the older sixties campaigns
that's true
even when john kennedy was elected there were so many strikes against him
there were people who believed he could make a difference
that's not to say what has transpired or what really was
that was a big turn out election
it was people going to vote for i think more than those who voted against
i know that in my own area of people whom i knew and how they were going to vote they didn't go to vote against a politician as they did a little bit later when nixon was running
they went to vote against the lesser of the two evils in certain cases
they voted their convictions
i think that also happened with ronald reagan
he was landslided in
people really saw that was
what do you consider the most important benefit besides salary
boy i don't know
that's a tough one
i suppose it's changes as my perception changes of what i'm getting gypped on
i guess right now the one in my mind is health insurance
if i step back i'm not sure i'd say that
what about you
right now i'm in sort of a weird situation
i'm a graduate student that i don't have that many benefits per se
sort of get
on the other hand one of these days you'll be out looking for a
i can see from her angle
i think health insurance is real real important
i've discovered
even in my case they're really a pain in the neck about it up here
the university makes me buy a small
they have what they call the mandatory portion of their health insurance they offer insurance to everyone
then the basics that are major medical they force you to buy here
i'm covered by my wife's anyway
i still pay them a hundred dollars a semester for mandatory
that's sort of annoying that i'm paying for something i'm not getting in that case
i'd rather that went to something else
yeah
the benefits you're getting for that hundred dollars a semester you never use because you just use your wife's
None
it turns out that that hundred dollars sort of would entitle me to go to the university health services here and use them
it turns out that i do think they're excellent physicians there
through my wife's h m o we've registered for them as our primary care physicians
we go there anyway
if they were to bill which which i believe they don't
if they were to bill the h m o for my business they could in theory be getting paid twice for the same thing
they're not thank god
otherwise i would imagine good vacation is important although i don't know if that's really a deciding factor for many people on a job
i don't
that's a negative about where i am in that i worked five years civil service
there
it works out as i remember basically to
you start at two and a half weeks or something like that
at three years it goes to four weeks i believe
i've been at t i now coming up on fifteen years
this year is going to go to four weeks here
that's really
that is a negative but probably not a deciding factor
i know my wife
i think she gets about two weeks a year i guess they're pretty good about it if she wants other time off
they usually let her
that
that's the thing is how flexible they are for comp time kinds of things
that's the
that's why it hasn't made all that much difference is because with the civil service that you could take your vacation in increments of one hour there wasn't anything as far as comp time
you tend to dribble away a week of it a year an hour here a couple hours there kind of a thing
whereas here things are free enough that the actual vacation time per year probably isn't that much different
that's reasonable i think
i think the health insurance
i think that's going through changes everywhere to
they've gone through a couple years ago here where they will cover you much better if you go to their designated hospitals
now they're in the process of developing a list of designated doctors
that just routine visits they will compensate much better for if you go to their designated doctors
which
my assumption is that that will not include my doctor since he keeps real busy without having to
i think i was watching something the other day about that on a news special or something like that
they were saying how in some sense that that's good because that makes health care affordable for everyone and lowers the cost of everything and all insurance
in other cases it's actually bad because it winds up people they have much less of a choice in who they can use and stuff like that
i think in the much bigger picture than to some extent hospitals and doctors have some fixed amount
if you don't work for somebody that's got enough clout to give you these rates and make this agreement then you're not covered by that
the added costs get passed on to you
i'm not sure
one of the phrases i use is that it's moving towards private socialized medicine that in terms of the negatives always heard in terms of socialized medicine you have no choice on who you go to for a doctor and things like that where it's the government that decides
here it's
the effect is the same as the
you get left out of the loop more
i know that their idea is that if you have to pay a bigger share you'll be more careful about spending the money and helping hold down the costs i don't know
in terms of the health care i find that although i've been lucky enough to never have any big problems that the cost is not a big factor
i want to know if the doctor's doing the right thing to make me get better
you want to know that when you pick a doctor you could pick one who you could have some sort of a feeling about
that's the
how do you feel about spot testing for drugs
i think if somebody's not on drugs they have no reason to be afraid of it
i do think that there has to be some controls
i don't think one test positive should be
i think they should test more than once
it's refreshing to hear somebody
all these people that are against it they may not even be on drugs
they call it an invasion of privacy
i don't see that
to me that just doesn't sound like a valid argument because this company is paying you good money that you're working for i believe that
they have the right to know if you're using a dangerous substance
there's so many jobs that
it's how can you do anything about a problem besides if you don't know about it
i think there definitely needs to be some control to it
i agree that there needs to be a well thought out sane approach to
just because something can get mixed in the mail
the chemicals could react incorrectly than what you would expect them to
None
somebody's test gets mixed up with somebody else's
those things do happen
i certainly wouldn't want people's lives ruined
i've the company that i work for has just within the last couple of years instituted for all new hired employees
they say that they've also implemented random testing
it hasn't happened to me in the couple of years that it's been in progress i fully agree with it
there's all these memos going around about folks that are disgruntled and feel it's an invasion of privacy
i agree with you
if you feel it's an invasion of privacy you've probably got something you're trying to hide
you maybe need to look for some other type of job to do that doesn't require the testing
to me it's not an invasion or privacy
i think people have a right to know if their life maybe's in jeopardy
the work they're doing for their company
those things are all affected
it doesn't seem to bother the quality of work eventually it does
i don't think that's an invasion of privacy
it's destroying a lot of people's lives
and one of the few that they don't have a cure for
it's destroying people's lives
i think that person plus anybody in danger should know about it and be aware of it
it's kind of hard to
i guess the gay movement has had a lot to do with considering that an invasion of privacy
do you work for texas instruments
i'm down in the central
i don't know how familiar you are with texas
we live near a town called temple
that's probably why
we got about two inches of rain in about three hours yesterday
did you really
that's great
it's cooled things down somewhat
we need rain real bad up here
everything's really getting dry
it's getting real bad
i hope you do get some rain up there
i can't think of anything else
i guess being in agreement kind of tends to limit the conversation
i can understand
it's funny that you mentioned that
t i is pretty much a worldwide company we have manufacturing plants all around the world including some places where the use of certain drugs that are illegal here are not illegal
i'll be darn
from a quality standpoint just because it's not illegal doesn't mean it doesn't affect you the same way
i can't think that would make any
if you're going to do business in another country you've got to respect their rules
i mean if that's the trade off
you go by their laws
some of the countries are very much against drugs
you use them you
where is it if they steal they lose a thumb or a finger
that's quite a deterrent
in saudi arabia using alcohol and drugs and something like that you get the death penalty
it's pretty strict over there
i guess we have so many freedoms over here we sometimes forget about
people tend to take the first amendment out of context
which means i could do anything i want to
you can't stop me
None
they abuse it is what they do
i'm glad to see more and more companies implementing the policy
what contacts do you have with the public school sy-
i have a boy
he just went into middle school
i have a girl
she's in grade school
i have a little boy who goes to
it's called early childhood
i have a young boy in that
i have a lot of children in the school system down here
i think we have excellent teachers here
i am really
the way the teachers work with the students
i've not been so happy with the schools
last year my son and daughter were in the same grade school before he moved up to middle school
it was just packed
it was a fire hazard if we had any kind of assembly there with parents
it was just a real problem
we had to do a bond issue and vote to take money and either have students bussed to different schools if that's what the prefer to do or to work for another school to be built which is a good idea
in the meantime the school still has lots and lots of kids in it
i think one thing is that would
secondly when we have enough schools sometimes we can't get the support for the teachers that we need to pay them to keep good teachers
i think that's true
i've got a little different contact
i've got one son that graduated from high school last year and another son that's a sophomore this year my wife teaches kindergarten here in richardson
in general i think one of the reasons that we chose to live in richardson when we came here was the schools
i think that plano and richardson in terms of the things seriously wrong with the public schools are not nearly to the extent that
we see through out the country
i think a big part of that is just the demographics
the population in those schools are typically people that very much value the education and support the school systems although there's still some problems
when i was going to school
in my family school was certainly valued
if i was ever in trouble in school i was also in trouble at home even more so
i think that part of it is not exactly with the schools but with the culture that doesn't value the education and doesn't value the schools and doesn't support what the schools are trying to do
it is so hard with a family system either divorced or just one parent or just li-
if both of them have to work even that is a hard situation for the children to have a supportive system around them to make school work for them i think it's real important that the parents work with the school i think what you said is really a pinpoint though that the student and the family life really adds or detracts what's happening in the school what about your wife
is she happy at school
she has two half day classes
she has on the order of twice as many students as the teachers in the higher grades her background is in child development and so forth
kindergarten is as high as she wants to teach
she's teaching rather than something else because that's the jobs that are available and that the schedule matches with our kids and things like that
the
the question had something to do with usage of personal computers
we are talking about computers this morning
i'm a firm believer in having lots of them
boy you've got me beat
i have a zenith here at home i have a commodore and a zenith
my wife has an a t and t twelve hundred i believe it is
on my commodore i mainly study lottery numbers would you believe
i have written some programs in basic whereby i can select any number of drawings and from that extract the numbers that have appeared the most i have another program in which i can look at the cyclical appearance of these numbers to see if there's anything that's consistent on that
i have another program that allows me to add all the numbers i want
it generates a complete set of numbers so that all combinations are covered this is what i do most of the time
that's what you do on at least one of your machines on your commodore
of course i have word processors
i write all my letters it's wonderful
my thoughts in my head come in bursts of about a paragraph at a time
i get them all down
naturally on a computer if you make a mistake who cares
you can go back and correct
how about you charles
i do an awful lot of preparation of documents
i use word processors and graphics programs and simply make all of our slides
some i do on an x t maybe we don't call these personal computers
i started out with an i b m p c about a year after they came out
may i ask where you work sir
or what section of it
in an obscure part of the defense department
that's my type of work too
i work at the applied research lab here on campus
my field is underwater acoustics there's a lot of things we can do with computers into studying how things vary in the water and taking advantage of them and so forth
it's a very nice field
i am retiring at the end of december
are you also a professor
do you just research
i'm an associate professor
i'm a full time researcher it's been a very very interesting career believe me
what are you going to do when you stop take all your machines with you or
the ones here in the laboratory obviously they're going to stay
i have similar machines at home
i would consider doing some more consulting when i get home i have a very very busy extra life anyway
i play in several symphony orchestras i run a concert band
i have a lot of external interests i do want to get much more deeply into computer work because obviously the world is going to be controlled run and operated by computers in the future
it is really taking over
the amount of work that we're doing and the depth of things that we are studying can basically only be handled by computers because it's so much
here again let's say i'm starting to getting ready in preparation for retirement basically what i'm doing is slowly getting rid of my things
for many many years i had a full size acoustics study laboratory where i could take recordings and perform experiments with them and so forth
that's gone now
i'm sort of out of business
as i say i worked with
fellow named steve blazey was the fellow i worked with for many many years he is now retired
it's been an interesting life
computers have come in towards the latter end of that
seem to have the topic already on tip of your tongue there
why don't you go ahead and start
isn't the subject auto repair
that's something i like to do and something i can do with now the sophisticated cars we have today with all the computers and everything
there's not a whole lot you can do without the equipment and electronic analysis that needs to be done on a car
i do like to get out and tinker with a car
it's something i can do still
in fact the last thing i've done i don't even remember what it is
that's too bad
the last thing i can remember doing wh-
that was all right because like you said that was pre technology days i guess
you could do a lot of it yourself still
i didn't tinker too much with the engine
it was in pretty good shape
my main concern and what i enjoy doing was the interior
it was pretty shelled
it was fun
it was taking the whole interior apart and ordering new carpeting and
did you install all that yourself
i bet that was a lot of fun
it was
my wife she helped out a little
we sanded down the insides of the door panels
that's too bad
a sixty-seven mustang is about the
i really enjoyed it
i was surprised at the availability of parts yet
you can still get factory original parts
you pay a premium
you just don't get them
i didn't
i went ahead and got japanese made duplicates or wherever they were made
prefabs and all that stuff
that's fine
i don't think that there would be
you didn't notice the difference did you
there was
i had heard rumors that it was because they couldn't duplicate
the glove box was just a little wider
the carpeting stretched a little too far
but just little things
one of the screws on the window regulators
you could get three of the four to lineup
thin-
it was
the end result is after you put your panels on nobody sees that
it works just the same
that's true
that is something i really enjoy doing working on our car too
i just changed my oil tonight
i enjoy also working on things like the brakes
in fact just two weeks ago i helped my neighbor out on his brakes on his car
either if it's a drum or disc brakes i enjoy working on those kind of things
i honestly don't have the tools for the drum
i know you got certain spring lever that you got to have or some spring pulley or something that you got to pull that spring back over onto that notch
my dad has got all that
i helped him when i was growing up
i don't have that stuff now
because of the drum brakes i don't have any choice but to take them in
it doesn't hurt every once in a while to have them done professionally too
i was helping my neighbor out
one of his drums needed to be resurfaced
i don't have of course the equipment to do that
he took it into a shop and had it resurfaced and fixed that way
it is true
the nicest thing about them is everything was standard
None
what do you think are the major social changes
what age if you don't mind me asking
i'm thirty-one
you're young
you should take my word
i've seen a social change
besides that i came from california where social change is
every second
social change in california means it takes another two or three minutes longer to get to work
it started actually going to work in eighty-two
between eighty-two and eighty-five it started out taking me an hour and fifteen minutes to get to work
it became an hour and a half to some days two hours to get to work
that's social change
what do you think is the major social change
that's a tricky one
i think one the women in the work force
and i think the fact that they're becoming more
they're more apt to be in political offices now
i think we've made great strides in that respect
i think that thirty years ago when i was newly married family was very very important
i think now it's revolving back full circle
i think that's probably for two reasons
the number one is women wanted to get out of the house
the second reason is everything costs so much more that if you don't have equal rights so that your wife gets equal pay you can't make twice as much
i know that economically a wife almost has to work anymore
yet i'm also noticing in the areas that i'm working and stuff more and more women are wanting now to stay home with the children where fifteen years ago they didn't
they wanted children
they still wanted to be their own person out in the work force
i am seeing women now wanting to stay home more at least until the children are up to school age
i find that very interesting that it's sort of reverting back
i've found that too where the wife is married
not married
still after five years it's like first kid they're out of the work force for another ten years
i think most of those people are still out
we won't see them back for another two or three years
very rarely do i meet anybody whose children are past that age when they've been away for a few years
it's kind of different
i note that i had taken care of my grandchildren recently while my daughter and her husband had been out of town
i do not envy these mothers or these fathers that have the children that they have to rush home from work and pick them up at day care get them through their homework get them to their soccer practice get them to their piano lessons
that's tough
None
parents even rarely see their kids for weekends which is kind of rough too
running into these women that are wanting to have their children at the age of thirty-nine forty i'm thinking at the age of fifty-two you're crazy
you're absolutely nuts
the other one i don't know what her age is
i know she is somewhere in that hairy age of half a century up there
boy i'll tell you
these are the go-gettingest happiest people i've ever met
you can be go getting
you can also get gray hairs and have a nervous breakdown
it's not my children
one is
one is four
None
i've always worked from the time that they were little
i decided to
i think that's wonderful
i teach school
i teach middle school age children
i see a lot of variation in what happens when kids are at home
i have taught school ever since my children were little
the advantage of teaching school is your hours are closer to your children's
your holidays are too
teaching i think is a good career to have and still be able to spend a lot of quality time with kids
that's what i was doing before
it just seemed like it took a lot of my time with them being so little
it's really hard
with them being as young
i really didn't have that much of a choice because my husband was trying to finish his college work and his master's degree and so forth
it was a matter of somebody had to have a
that's what was kind of where we were
i really didn't have to work
i felt like i really wanted to work
i also felt like boy i was sure missing a lot
they were growing so fast
that choice was there
it's different staying home
i think that we need to spend more family time together with children today
we made a point to spend a lot of quality time
the activities that we were involved in were the activities the kids were involved in through scouting or anything like that
we always made a point to have breakfast together and supper together now
when the kids were in high school it was harder to always have supper together
we did always have breakfast together
we had supper together as much as possible
when it wasn't feasible that was understandable
we've always tried to spend time to talk and have some together time
we sat around the table
i think that's been important because we do have a close family even though the kids are basically grown they still like to sit down at the table and us all eat together when they're here and have spoken before of they want that kind of situation for them when they marry and have children
they do what they see
with the dysfunctional families today i'm sure as a schoolteacher also you see what happens to these kids when these families never communicate or they're dysfunctional as far as the second families one parent families or all those kinds of problems that they have
you see them magnified in the children
i'm sure that
you really
boy boy
i taught early childhood i had the little ones
i saw it there too
None
i think most teachers realize the value of quality time with children i think we make a point to do that
None
i wish we could reach more of the rest of the world
i think the major problems in education are not what's happening in the schools
they expect us to create miracles at school and fix all the problems and take over the roles of the parents as well as that of the teachers you get to a point where it's completely impossible
i know exactly what you're saying
you just get more and more frustrated
yet you feel for the kids
what do you consider an invasion of privacy
i was just now told that's what the topic was
i guess invasion of privacy to me for example would be unauthorized use of credit cards uh-huh
i guess recently one of the t v stations here ran a series of news casts on unauthorized credit card usage and how easy it was to get a person's credit card numbers
i was quite surprised at that
i guess i can consider myself fortunate that it never happened to me
i've never had that happen to me either
i was in michael's the other night and charged something
they asked for my home phone even though the charge had been approved
if i was the type of individual that had an unlisted number i think i would be hesitant to give it
you know that i believe it's a federal law that you do not have to give your phone number on charge tickets
one of the things that upset me when i lived in california was they did a lot of things with your social security number
they would not cash checks unless they had your social security number
we had our social security numbers imprinted on our checks
i was really unhappy about that situation
i can see where that was
i don't mind my phone number and address or work phone being given when i have to cash a check
neither am i a person that
None
one of the biggest things i think that's going on in this country right now is the selling of mail lists and things like that
recently i purchased some magazines u s news and forbes magazine
every since that day i have been inundated with subscriptions to this subscriptions to that this news letter this investment letter even to the point of people calling me at home
prior to me ordering these magazines i never got those kind of calls
i discovered with charge cards i feel like that i don't know whether it's the stores themselves that sell the list or whether the credit report bureau sells it
i get catalogs from people i've never even heard of
i know they have to be coming from my charge cards
from some list
from some list that knows that i have say a charge account at neiman's or something
then i'll get catalogs that are within that range that i would never order from ordinarily
i get tired of that
i look at all that junk mail
i think of how inept our post office is and how that's taking up
they're not even paying full postage
if you did away with some of that our postal service might give better service
i think the general public would be tremendously upset if they knew how easy it is for let's say the criminal individuals to get access to people's records their credit cards driver's licenses checks things like that
i don't think anybody really knows what to do about it
let's face it
computers can be gotten into very easily if you're so inclined to have the smarts to be able to tinker with something like that
and have a basic knowledge
uh-huh
and which is scary
our lives are on computers
i don't know
i resent the calls of an evening trying to sell me something
fortunately i haven't been inundated with that situation yet
either wanting to clean our carpet sell us storm windows
i'd like to tell you first of all what's happening in our community here in plano
right now we have a pretty nice recycling program where a lot of the recyclable materials can be picked up by the collection agency or the city along with your garbage can
you can put out newspaper
you can put out certain types of plastic material
that is on a roll out effort right now
not all the citizens and the people in plano can go ahead and participate right now
that will be rolled out to everyone i hope in the next year or so
those that aren't participating they have the specific drop off sites where you can take glass and newspaper and aluminum
i think overall that's an excellent opportunity
i hate to see our landfills being filled up and growing bigger and bigger and bigger where they are becoming a big problem for not only the people that are living today but for the future also
i was read-
it's not a city
i'm out in the wilderness literally
i like it
give you an idea
it's three and a half miles of dirt road to the asphalt
i do some interesting recycling things
i'm going to incorporate into my garage area a weight activated crusher
when i drive the car in the driveway in the afternoon it will just drive it up on a ramp that actually puts me on top of the pressure side of a hydraulic cylinder
the weight of the car will crush
hopefully it's not my wife
let's hope not
you can get in trouble for that
i thought i'd use it as an escapement type thing
what you do is you just build up the pressure you go over and release it
it just drops
it's quite similar to a hydraulic jack isn't it
what it will be you drive up on the jack
it won't go down
i have another recycling method i use
anytime they send me a return envelope i put all that stuff back in the envelope plus the other stuff that i happen to gather up
like i say we live a way
when you throw trash away you throw it in my yard
i don't like that i don't do that
i take it
i mail it back to them
we might be able to incorporate some of that
i think one of the best ways to help the recycling problem is to eliminate non reusable items
for instance i saw a thing on nova the other day
this guy has designed recyclable items
plastic it's all out of plastic
he's a engineer designing stuff
that's a great idea
incorporating reusable materials into your actual scheme of product operations is is the only way to really do it on a broad scale
make it financially attractive to recycle somebody will find a way to make money at it
there is a guy in dallas
he collects trash
he's out for cardboard
i've found out too that a couple years ago
at one time we could get a pretty good return with the boy scouts
are you a news person
i really am
i enjoy listening to the news and getting as much as i can although i'm a full time student
None
None
i work quite a bit
i like to listen to national public radio all things considered
i like to listen to that and catch
sometimes i don't get the current events because that show kind of has feature stories that might not
the real current news and the hard news there is not really enough of it there
i've had that frustration too
you like n p r programming
in general
i watch a lot of c n n and c span
i subscribe to three newspapers
i sort of can't get enough of this
when i travel elsewhere i'm often amazed at the local papers how little they have
h-
of world events and national events
in dallas what is the newspaper situation
one of our major papers just closed down
they closed shop and said we can't put any more papers out
was that the better paper
it was a more effective paper as far as i was concerned
None
which i like
i like to save the editorial information or
i like just to find out what's happening pretty quick
i feel that the other newspaper
the dallas morning news is the one that's still here
the morning news is okay
you have to wade through a lot of editorial garbage as far as i'm concerned
if you were to look at the front page of today's morning times would you see things about what is going on in europe
you see troy aikman's knee surgery
a quarterback for the cowboys
you know what i mean there is
not something you'll be interested in ten years from now by any means
how about you
i guess in washington d c you guys have several papers that are pretty effective don't you
i rather like the washington post
i also get the new york times and the wall street journal
each of them covers different things in different ways
if i only looked at one of them i clearly would have a different perspective on the world
i have a question
does the wall street journal
i've kind of gathered lately that maybe their information is not just only related to business
is that a correct assumption
that is certainly true
they will have articles
a few days ago they had a nice article on einstein theory of relativity
that started on the front page ran into almost full page inside
these are feature kind of articles
the bulk of the paper certainly is about business kinds of activities
there is some very good other articles you'll find in the journal
do you find that you're
i wish it were in more depth
that doesn't mean to say longer
c n n was pretty good during the war
they sort of had a unique vantage point for doing that reporting
it's never quite
exercise
as a matter fact i work out in the mornings
i have got a routine for every morning of the week
i don't work out on saturday or sunday i do a combination of running and weight training
i just joined on my own
i have been thinking about getting with one of their counselors just see what they might have to offer as far as alternatives
i pretty much worked on my own routine
what kind of running do you do
i run one mile on monday wednesdays and fridays
on tuesdays and thursdays i run two miles
after that i work out with weights
is just aerobics
i work out with free weights
i mean the running
yeah
it is really the aerobic work out part
you do a mile in about eight minutes or less
about seven minutes
then you don't get out of breath
that is a pretty good clip
i am pretty winded by the time i get done
it's not pushing it real hard like if you tried to make six or something like that
i could probably go faster
then i would wear myself out
i wouldn't be able to work out anything else
i don't run much any more
i don't lift any heavy weight
i see
this
do you just try and keep them i guess firm and
i play the trumpet
the the more upper body strength the easier it is to play
that is true
you really have to build up around your neck and your shoulders to keep from hurting yourself when you play high
i see
you have to do it correctly
i see
you are part of a band
i play at church
i see
it wasn't the trumpet
i was just wandering if that was what it was or something
do you have any plans of maybe running more when the weather gets nicer
the weather is nice except for when it rains in dallas
that doesn't mean it gets done
i mostly jump rope more
i use to do a little bit of jumping rope when i was
a while back i was more into basketball i could do a lot of jump rope and other jumping exercises to try to build my calves
it has been a while since i have done that
you know it
they tend to tighten up whenever you have to do something at great length of time
that is true
i have noticed that
it also builds too much mass if you just
i lift weights with about the same curl weight as i do the squats with
then it doesn't bother me very much
that is interesting though
i have been thinking of changing
i am thinking of changing it up
that is why i was thinking to talking to one of their counselors and seeing what different exercises they could get me on to get out of the routine
i have heard that you get locked into a routine then you are going to get to a point where you just stop developing
i am looking at changing things a little bit
i have started doing more push ups
it has helped a lot
i add sets to it so that i don't like you said wear it out
clothing at work
i work as a news reporter
a lot of
since i work in a small station
this is my first job i dress very variedly
sometimes i'm shooting and doing photography
i'll be in jeans one day
another day i'll be on camera
i'll be in a suit
another day i'll come in
i won't know what i'm doing
i'll wear a pant suit
it really varies
me neither
i don't wear a lot of makeup or anything like that
it takes too much time out of my day
i don't know
i don't mind it at all
i work at a bakery
we have to wear white pants and any color t shirt as long as it's not a bright color like a pastel
we wear aprons and have to pull our hair back
italian i guess
i don't mind having to wear a uniform because i don't have to buy as many clothes
that's one thing i would like is just to have something i don't have to get up and decide what to wear
i like to wear comfortable things like cotton and baggy things and
when it was time to go out i didn't have anything to wear
i don't mind
let me see
my feet bother me
they're just tedious to go find shoes for me it's just
i wear size nine i don't know if just the shoes i get i don't like them they don't fit right
i just wish that i could just go without them
wow i love shoes
let's see
when i do get into a bigger market i'll probably go out and buy a bunch of suits and things and where i wouldn't have to shoot and do a lot of other things
then i would be able to dress more business-like and things like that
we're all kind of just out of school at this station
we're all
it's pretty fun though
i like the suit look professional look
i'm going to be a teacher
i'll probably just wear casual clothes maybe skirts and some
i like the suits with the
they come with a mini type skirt and the jacket
i'm pretty short
that really doesn't flatter me
i think it looks good on taller people
i have like two pairs of pants because i can never find any that are short enough for me it's just ridiculous
i like the stretch pants the cotton ones
it's just a chore to pick up my feet
because i'm used to wearing the little white girl tennis shoes
yeah i have a pair of those
i'm used to those
they're just sort of
your feet you don't feel them
it's like exercise or something for your feet
i know what warm is
five pairs of socks and
i guess we're recording now
as far as spare time they talked about
i think
i've got a six year old and a
my baby's one today
i'm expecting
i don't know
i have had some because i was working for p i e
they went bankrupt
i've got quite a bit of spare time right now
i've been making dolls cloth dolls
have you
they're all cloth
it's not any porcelain at all
you just sew everything up huh
yeah i make the clothes for them
don't ask me what the other hair i made
it looked
i made some of them with regular wigs
did you
i went to the flea markets and bought the wigs for a dollar
my goodness
do you sell them
have you
i just have to get a place where i can sell them
if i would just work all day long making the clothes and everything probably about two and a half days
i also crochet
i can crochet and knit
i started an
it's been a whole long time ago probably over a year ago
it's sitting in my closet half done right now
it's a knitting one
i don't know
i didn't like it
didn't you
then i went to crocheting
now i want to learn how to knit again
i kind of like that
i just like i say haven't done it for a while
i do like sewing sometimes
i've made a few of just the little valence curtains in my house and things like that
it's just finding the time for
in fact i just bought a serger in december
i would love one of these
that's neat
i haven't done everything on it yet
just what little bit i have used it for i really like it
those are wonderful aren't they
especially making the seams and things like that
that's what i hate doing is the finishing stuff
i like that
that's neat
do you have
fifty-seven's not young
they don't have any children
i just make clothes for my dolls
how did you get involved in that
just sewing and stuff and decided to buy a pattern and try to make a doll
you did buy a pattern and then started from there
they turned out really cute
you got to have a pattern for the body
have you ever seen those bunnies that they dress
i did dress one of those
i have quite a few of them in my house
most of them i have bought already clothed
i did make the dress on one
i kind of made the pattern up
it's probably not the best
i bought a bunny pattern one time
when i sewed it up the face of it looked like a mouse
it did
it was too pointed
i tore it back apart again
i haven't tried another one
i bought a little lamb pattern and the material and everything to make it out of
i haven't made it yet
do you do any kind of painting or anything
i tried that
i ended up just stenciling just a roller shade
i had a hard time stenciling
people have told me it's very easy
my neighbor did it first
i seen her house
i saw how beautiful it looked
then i decided i was going to do it
it turned out really really good
mostly flowers
i've done it in all my rooms
credit cards
do i
then your are in debt
i get in a rut with credit cards cause they get me kind of in a vicious cycle where you use them a lot one month and then you have to use whatever money you have to pay those off then you have no money
i probably have one of every credit card there is
it kind of comes and goes
i use citibank the advantage one pretty much cause you get vantage points for every dollar you spend
as long as you pay it off every month it doesn't cost you anything
that is a good idea
is that through a visa
i got all sorts of credit cards for my business that i use
i pay the minimum
you shouldn't do that
i have got myself
you never get out of the hole that way
that is why i have got myself with all this trouble now
i pay most of them on time and everything
it is kind of strange
every time you try to get out of debt the economy goes to pot because people are spending money right
the rest of the and me we have got to pay fourteen and eighteen percent
thou who doesn't need credit gets cheap credit
i would be interested to find out how much people use credit this year say in nineteen ninety-two as opposed to nineteen ninety-one even nineteen ninety
i think it would be amazing how many more people use it
i think so
i would like to see some numbers on that
do you have any credit union where you work or anything like that
who do you work for
i work for channel six
it's an n b c affiliate down here
a lot of my business is down there
gene he-
you probably work with
and what else
are you in the south part of town now
i live actually in hewett
that is where davis iron works is
do you know parker machine tool down there
bobby parker and
i am not sure
prime air
they make humidifiers and filters for air filtration stuff for hospitals homes something like that
they have a place i guess that would be similar to prime air
i have gone through there
once and a while we go up six there rather than take forty-five
i don't like that drive
they are bad at hewett too on eighty-four
of course i couldn't pay that on a credit card
i was just wondering if you had had any experience with the care of the elderly
in fact
we cared for her the last seventeen months of her life here at home
aside from
those times she was there in the regular hospital
she was diagnosed having inoperable type of cancer
the doctor elected to have her finish out in the hospice program
as far as i'm concerned that is far and above any nursing home because the elderly parent in question is around their own family
the hospice program provides a hospital type bed and all the oxygen
stuff and a visiting nurse at least every other day et cetera et cetera et cetera
that's nice
it's all taken care of by medicare
it's really neat
i wouldn't banish my old loved one to a warehouse
that's what i basically view a nursing home as a warehouse
i think a lot of people struggle with
i guess the problem is that the spouse of whoever the parent is
that's really sad
in this case spouse and i are united in this area because
i guess her grandfather and grandmother both lived with
this isn't just one instance
in fact her experiences were invaluable to me
i remember being a child
my grandmother had had
they did for a long time
tell you how long until she got where she had to have complete care
they couldn't keep her in the house anymore
it was really hard on everyone
she had to have twenty-four hour a day care
i don't remember much about it except that there was a nursing home at that time just a block or two from our house
they put her there
it was very hard on everyone to see grandmother be like that
None
maybe as you say the care of grandmother was just such that such mom and dad couldn't handle it
i do remember that she was totally incapable of taking care of herself in any way
they found that they could not give her the hygienic care and everything that she needed
then there's almost no choice left to her then
like you say there is a tendency for people to be abandoned though
i do remember the other patients there
in fact just sit and chat with them for five minutes and be interested in what they have to say regardless of what it is
i guess that's hard on people to
i'm
None
i just praised the lord that we were able to
what do you you in your lawn
do you hire someone to do it
we've been doing it ourselves for most of the time find that it's really a little more economical
i find that i have the time
i kind of enjoyed it over here in texas
it was very frustrating because i didn't have the watering system
it was just too much work and not enough enjoyment
over here we get enough water naturally as well have the automatic sprinklers
it's a lot more rewarding
we do our own out here mow it ourselves and everything
our water supply right now is bad
that's right
here in patterson i can water on tuesdays thursdays saturday and sunday four days a week
if we don't get some rain they might limit it to not even four times yeah
we do our mowing ourselves and everything
i do our
i find that i've been doing a lot of perennial planting which i never did before it's been real enjoyable although i didn't do any this last fall because our past winters have been so cold they'd freeze down
by the time the flowers would come back to life it was supposedly the time to pull things out for the spring and summer planting
i was getting kind of disillusioned and tired and spending too much money on something that was kind of more of a problem than it was rewarding
i'm going to try to wait now and just do the spring and summer type plantings and see how that feels
in fact we just pruned them way down
i just had to replace one of them
i just bought that yesterday
i'll probably go outside today and plant that
i like to have the roses where i can have cut flowers all year long
did you
i even had roses on my table for christmas dinner which was really pretty
other than the roses i don't have too many flowers
those are nice
i plant gladiolas those are always pretty
they get so tall
they bend over so fast
i haven't done much in bulbs
in fact i received as a christmas present a planter that had bulbs in it that we were supposed to go ahead and water it any time and after it started to sprout put in a sunny window
it just grew like crazy
i don't have
is it one of those amaryllis
no i'm thinking white narcissus or something like a white paper flower or so
in plano and most of the newer areas of texas they have just the minimum square footage for lots to where you get a little bit of a backyard
we did plan it to where we have some play yard left over
it's very small
most of the houses here if you have a pool you don't have anything else in the backyard that's about the size of most of them
i guess we're kind of fortunate
everyone looks at our yard with kind of sense of awe like wow you really got some grass
that makes it nice
it's hot enough here in the summer time that we could have a pool
we don't have one
they are a lot of people that do have pools around here we just have dogs
we do have a garden
it's just a small one
we had lots of tomatoes and zucchini it's amazing what you can get out of a little it's probably about twenty by six something like that
it's amazing how many plants you can plant in there it was nice
i don't think this yard is a very
i guess if i had to rate it from one to ten i guess
i think there should be limitations of semiautomatics
things like that should not be just given out to anybody
in fact i can't imagine
i guess being that i come from a hunting family
when you get into a lot of the more complex weapons i would say yes
i definitely think that some things shouldn't be limited like you said rifles and hunting rifles and
i think semiautomatic weapons people say
i personally cannot see any use for them other than for people who dislike have some sort of crazed ambition to have high powered weapons or something
to do massive amounts of killing
how much do you wa-
the only thing that i can see is the police having it in a case where somebody is going to kill a massive amount of people or somebody that's escaping that's very dangerous semiautomatic would allow more rounds to be put out to hopefully catch the person and get him down
i think of my family
they're very much into sporting
they may have some shotguns
they may have other type of hunting type things
i figured if the criminals had to take a hunting gun
nobody would see it
yet you can't stop people from having a handgun in their home
even if there are small children around
i guess i was always taught
i don't know if that makes a difference if the parent sets down to them and say this gun can kill you don't ever play with it
i don't know if that makes a difference or what
i think if you're
we have to get rid of them all because they only seem to do bad
the criminals would get them even if they had to go across border to get them
people who have them and are responsible with them are are being punished
they're saying that
how to make sure the guns
we had guns all over our house when we were kids and not that they were laying on the couch or anything like that i never had an interest in them
being in the fact that i knew that guns could kill i had four brothers and never messed with any type of guns it was kind of the idea that we knew that a gun could kill and that a gun wasn't a toy of course
we went through
the national rifle club
you're going to learn how to have safeguards and know how to protect yourself
yet have this
i grew up in a family
my father had two guns he used to hunt years ago
he stopped really before i was old enough to remember
i knew we had the guns in the house
the time my father was keeping them just for protection at the time
let's go get the gun
it was just something you knew was there it was your father's
that was not something you'd played with at all that's the thing that should be stressed
i don't know if the kids nowadays are different than what
do you have the long
i was raised in new york
i guess up there you all don't have too long of a growing season do you
we probably have about three months
do you do your own gardening
we don't farm much
we do have a garden
see i got mine in
let's see
i enjoy tinkering with it
we hit a hundred hundred and two sometimes
we don't do too much during the summer as far as tomatoes and stuff
probably mid-march i can put anything in the ground
beets and onions
then i have to wait for my
you've had more freezing this winter i think
had just a few that freezes a little here and there
every once in a while we get a freeze around the middle of april
it's pretty tough
do you work
are you retired
i work i'm only forty years old
my husbands retired
he's not a gardener
he's been helping me more
he really isn't real crazy about gardening
i really enjoy it
i'm a golfer
it gives me time outdoors and time around my house
i burned my grass off here in the last couple of days getting ready to start to the spring season and see if i can grow me another nice lawn
it's a lot of work
like you said it's good to get outside
i like my garden too
we have just a small garden
we planted corn last year too which takes quite a bit of space we didn't have too good luck with it
we had a couple of real good wind storms
it really damaged the corn we didn't get too much corn
what i did with my garden is i have a two by six frame that's five by ten
i have two of them sitting side by side then i put a black plastic
they call it wedet i put that down
i put up a couple of inches of pine moss on top of that i use one of those black poker hoses that actually oozes water every where i waste it up and down there a couple of times
that's great
i only have to water about two hours a week it's pretty nice
we don't usually cover ours
other years we've tried newspapers we do our watering from our spring
you have a spring
we have an old fashioned pipe sitting that water runs into
it stops
when the water comes up it comes on again
we use that to water our garden
that's pretty nice
you actually enjoy it
oh do
i can imagine
do you go more for keeping them off naturally
do you
i try not to use any insecticides at all
sometimes i can't manage
our lawn is a big lawn because we live out in the country
our lawn is not perfect
it's just a lawn
mine's full of dandelions
does your wife ever make a hot bacon dressing for
it's delicious
it goes real good on dandelions
i've tried dandelion wine i've never tried any dandelions just to eat
use the greens if you get them when they're young and tender before they have grown too tall
they do get a little stringy
they're kind of fun to try
get a few
throw them in with the rest of your salad sometimes
i've been cutting our grass too lately because my husband's back
he's been having trouble with
wasn't allowed to run a lawn mower
it takes about four hours to cut our grass
we have hills
i just go ahead and do it
you all are into the lawn big time
i guess i got
my whole section of my house is probably a tenth of an acre then i have a pretty nice backyard
i've got enough room to throw horseshoes
that's great
a lot of people don't have that much space even
it's nice
i'm only a mile
you have all the conveniences of
and the country also
i don't really have all the room in the house i need
those
they called rolly polly bugs
if you touch them they roll up in a ball
i'm plagued with those things
i haven't figured out
i don't know
if you leave a piece of newspaper in the yard too long they get in there
you can find them during the daytime if you pick something up that's been laying around
a slug is actually kind of slimy these are just
they roll up
i'm plagued with those
i think you have a lot more insects down there even than what we have
i think it's a big problem because we're in more of a tempered zone
we only freeze down here in january and february at the most
they be can be a real
you spray in one part of your lawn
they just move to
you got to
your neighbor gets them
he sprays his yard
you get them back again
we're not doing too bad down here really
they're big now
we have daffodils
they're just beginning to come out and bud
mine are up and bloomed already
they're such a nice bright early spring
in my back flower bed i have tiger lilies they bloom in
they're nice and green
they're up above a foot
it's raining today
do you all have a
what kind o grass do you grow up there
do you grow bermuda or
our grass like i said is just grass
i have bermuda
i still have the old standby crabgrass here and there
they suggested that we discuss what we think of when we say camping
where do you like to camp
i can camp just about most anyway
camping or motor home is nice travel trailer pop up
i used to live in the ozarks and liked to go up there and just take a backpack and strike out into the woods
i used to do it quite a bit
you'd have a lot of hills down in that area
go out
find a creek
that's great long as it's not raining
we used to have one of those little caves you can go back in get out of the rain
that would be
i don't know much about camping in texas
i'm in pennsylvania
we're up here in northwestern part of pennsylvania
you kind of know what it's like then
we've done many types of camping
we've done tent camping
we had access to a motor home which is really super great
they have some nice camping grounds that have the water piped out just set it up
get out of the city for awhile
when the children were smaller we used to go to delaware along the ocean most every year
that was fun
we really enjoyed that
you're fading out
maybe dropping my phone
we used to
we used to
i think the worst thing is when it's raining
that's kind of rough when you got to fight snakes off when your sleeping
copperheads mostly
one year they were just everywhere
we had a real rainy spring it was all year
you still backpacked and camped out
i lived down in the bottom of a big hollow
we had to pretty much hike out most of the time
i would think a cave could have problems like that too
it was just big enough for a couple of people to sack out
that's great
the first couple of times it's pretty scary
do they
they've had longer hunting seasons than that even to get rid of more of them because they were increasing so much
down here they stopped for awhile
they really made it hard to hunt them
we really like camping
i must say that we really have a lot of fun a lot of memories in that from camping
it's good to get out and smell some fresh air too
it's a lot of work too it's getting ready and taking care of everything
it's really refreshing
i think we're about to run out of our time
it was really good hearing from you
i hope you get back into camping again and do a little more of it
you have a good day
do you think russia's still a threat
i guess i'm maybe naive
i never did feel that russia was a big threat to us
obviously
i somehow think that war is one of those things that maybe is inevitable
i don't look at it as a threat in the same sense that i think this question was meant
i think
have you ever read the book nineteen eighty-four
you know how there was three continents that were always fighting with each other right
you could picture it as being russia versus the u s during the whole time
what they would do is they would get their prisoners and kill them as soon as they got them because the people there could realize that they were the same as themselves
the prisoners of wars were the same as the people living in that country
you didn't want that to happen
to me it had always been that way
this government controls everything right you have the people inhabiting the country
these people have nothing to do with the government itself
these people are the same as you are
what goes on is that every time somebody attacks a country it's not going to be within the borders of the u s or russia itself
in lithuania they were announced to be a separate country
yet the government that's in moscow told its army to go in there and get those people
the u s didn't go in there and try to save those people
it's like you're not going to go in there and say no
what happens is you don't mess with us we won't mess with you
let's mess with the neutral countries
now they're saying i guess other leaders were still crazier about it
other people you could think that they might use a bomb here and a bomb there
russia has never been known for throwing an atomic bomb anywhere
the u s has
it seems like their army or whatever can can go in there quicker than an atomic bomb can and do the job with less suffering
i think the thing
like they were saying they go
libya could start a nuclear war because of whoever is behind the button but not the u s s r
i guess there was concern that iraq would use nonconventional warheads with the chemical weapons and things
yet it didn't happen
why not
my point of view to that is is that the attack would have been so complete on iraq if they had
you can imagine the first chemical weapon used that would have meant a total attack of the iraq country within three hours of when the weapon was shot
you think it was fear that kept iraq from using it
yet the
what happens is
if he were to use that he might as well commit suicide because he's going to be captured and
the u s also makes a lot of treaties with other people saying okay
we'll take care of you like marcos right
yet you can still come live here
i think that's not very likely
yet as the parallel russia is that saddam hussein is using the chemical warfare on his own people
i guess that makes sense what you said that within their own borders they feel freer to do what they feel necessary
there's just
the u s goes and goes into panama
i don't believe in war
i don't believe that anybody should die
then you have
what happens is
suppose i go to war
i'm holding a gun
i'm just looking at myself holding a gun
whoever shoots first survives
that same person also has a family
his parents are going to cry
life ends there
to me that's ridiculous
i just don't believe it
it's pretty hard to think that people are just going to shoot each other down
it's legal in a situation like that
or that it resolves anything in the end that negotiations couldn't resolve
saddam hussein lost so much money during the war that it was ridiculous
all he was trying to do was make money at the beginning and keep his power
it sounds like neither one of us thinks that the soviet union is a real threat to the u s
i don't think so
i think they're especially getting their life back together now
a lot of things that you saw on tv
a lot of inhabitants of russia would love to stay in their country just as long as they were able to express what they wanted to
a lot of dancers and stuff like that
it must be a beautiful country
it's just that they won't let you get out
when you want to get out of the country that's what you want to do
well
how you doing
you're right here
i just called and came in
are you
i just got a little booklet in the mail with the gifts
i thought i better make some calls
i haven't got a chance to look at them yet
my daughter got a few calls at home
i guess they give them to computer students too in virginia something like that
one i think worked at a university the furthest away i've talked to someone has been new york
we're supposed to talk about the elderly now i guess
do you have anybody that you are close to that decision on or anything
i've thought about it for myself and all
my wife's mother is in a retirement home
she's not in a nursing home
well that's a
didn't we push
she's down in san antonio it's a brand new one
it's a catholic retirement home for nuns
it's at trinity
isn't that neat
they have a retirement home for the nuns they take some lay people
that one's really super
i know what they're talking about on regular retirement
they do have a wing where the people who are really sick have nurses
that's good
they have other wings that we visited that are very nice
it's just super
they have a guard with locks
she's perfectly healthy
what made her decide to go
her husband died
she just did not want to take care of the house she visited the place and then fell in love with it and decided to just shun all responsibilities of any kind
that's good
she's happy as heck
they serve meals of course
that's nice
i know the ones where you're really ill we visited a long time ago when she had a grandmother that was in one
they were all more or less hospitalized type really really sick
you got more experience than i do then on it
it was really sad heartbreaking i guess
i just felt for those people especially the ones that never got visited
that would be awful
i never thought about that
that just bothered me so much especially at my age
that really made a bad impression on me
i always thought not really bad of them because most of them i believe are probably pretty good for the people
i don't know
it would be a tough tough decision
i think that hopefully we as a country are learning a little more about it
they're getting nicer
boy that really pumps them up
if you just have people your own age you never get a chance to see kids or anything or animals or anything you can't take care of them
it's nice to have them visit and everything
sometimes that even helps them just being around young people to because some of them are so just stationary they'll get in a wheelchair
they'll just sit in a chair
until you come along and really try and pump them up they're just stationary
i feel like gosh that's all they do all day long
i do love to see young kids go and men take the pets and everything
i think you do get more by stimulation
in fact my mother in law just visited
she's just about seventy-five perfectly fine
she visited us here in dallas
every time she goes back to san antonio she said she's much better
she's much more alive and active when she's been on a visit with somebody else our routine has obviously hectic with teenagers and everything she's much
the stimulation part is really important i think like any animal anything you just lay around that's the fastest way to die i think
of course i've seen those reports on t v the horrible ones that scares me
anything bad
it's sad
i've seen them on t v with bed sores
they just stay in the same clothes or the same sheets and not do laundry
i just think how can you do that
these people have given so much of their lives to america whatever
here is how we treat them
when i was younger i lived in the east
it seemed like there were several people that i knew that had their parents
one of them was even a woman who was fairly old
i guess
i think whether it's more a custom up there or maybe because i was younger it's just not a custom anymore to have the grandparents live with you anymore
i guess that we aren't getting away from that which is not right
i think you learn a lot from them from all their experiences
that's one of my favorite things to do is sit around and listen to their stories
they really have a lot of good insights my husband's father is really old
he had him late in life
he'll be eighty this year
he lives with different people in the family
that's nice in a lot of ways
i think my kids better not do that to me
i don't want that
i think of it how would i want to be treated rather than
it's easy to say yeah
when i think i don't want to do that
i say i'm going to build a little house behind yours
i'll take care of your lawn he says
i'm not
you're going to put me away
that's the way we call it which is really wrong
my wife's mother she's in san ant-
it's a little hotel you might say
a swimming pool and grounds
she has enough room
she has two bedrooms and a separate living area
they don't have kitchens or anything it's like on each floor they have a little kitchen area where you can go down and make a meal
that's great
now can she leave on a day by herself
it's nothing like that
she's totally on her own
she still drives which does scare us some because she has dented a few things
we keep thinking about that they get less alert
they don't care
i've seen some of these elderly people on t v the ones from florida that just run into people
they don't even understand what happened
that's their one last thing that they can still do
you take away that driving ability
that would really be hard
i know
we've thought about doing that for my husband's father because he
he still drives
it's wonderful in one respect
i don't know if you can afford the insurance
luckily he drives a big old tank
i don't think he could get hurt
he hasn't had any accidents luckily
people are all different
i wonder if they should give them a test or at least maybe give them a refresher driving course just to see how well they are every five years
they're thinking of doing that
i think that would be a great idea because i think they do become less aware
they don't hear as well for one thing that doesn't help
everybody needs retraining
it doesn't hurt
i don't know why you couldn't after sixty-five every five years have a refresher course and then take another driving
the insurance companies would probably help pay for some of that
i think they maybe should do that
the families
have you noticed any new trends in politics
the one i think is interesting is the los angeles police chief who says he won't resign
did you hear yesterday that mayor bradley said that he should
i think what's interesting is that the political activists jesse jackson and a lot of other people went out there and are demonstrating
i find it interesting that outsiders would bother to go in
how do you feel about people like jesse jackson getting involved
i think sometimes it's good for people outside
they get a different perspective on an issue and stuff
i think though that it should still be sort of up to the majority in the area
do you think gates should resign
he obviously failed somewhere along the line
speaking of that kind of issue have you kept up with john wiley price
i think he's got good intentions
i'm not sure if the way he goes about what he does is really right
i was talking to someone who said that for all his obvious efforts to get media attention that he actually is a worker on the
i guess he's on the county board of supervisors or at those meetings he really comes quite well prepared and is well informed and is a hard worker and is really quite agreeable
and that this stuff we see in the media is
he's really just trying to make a political statement
i find that an interesting element of politics that most people would not know that john wiley price apparently is a
of course he's got in this deal of racism and the name calling and all this
apparently he's a a worker
you may disagree with him
i find this whole
what do you think of this fourteen one and ten four one in dallas
i think that they should go ahead and go to the fourteen one
to me it's just fair
it seems like every area should have an equal voice
did you see the map they drew up on how they were going to divide up the districts
it was the strangest
i'm not sure it was gerrymandered
the way they drew these little patterns and stuff i guess i'm a little cynical of the power base
i don't quite understand why they don't go with fourteen one
it seems to me that what happened in the election that a lot of the people don't vote because they don't think that they have any affect
i guess i am disappointed with dallas in that the fourteen one it
you can disagree with al lipscomb and
what's the lady's name
you can disagree with what they're doing and what they're saying
in reality i think they're trying to represent their constituents
i think dallas is doing itself a disservice
i don't know why certain groups are fighting so hard to keep the ten four one
even those people are
i think it's kind of interesting that everybody's so busy politicking that the question is are we getting anything good done
are you involved in the schools at all public schools this whole thing down there where they're trying to devote all our money and raise our taxes and better schools
it all seems like everybody's trying to one-upmanship on everybody else
i have got to run to a meeting
i don't think we've gone our ten minutes
i think we've talked long enough
there's been a lot of publicity lately about that new nancy reagan book out by kitty kelly the unauthorized biography
i don't particularly read biographies or autobiographies
i'm more of a fiction and nonfiction reader not of that nature though
the reason why i was thinking about looking at it is because it's supposed to
it's supposed to have a lot of unflattering things in it
i thought just purely for entertainment i might enjoy that
i wouldn't want to go out and buy it the hard back copy of it
i might check
if they had it i don't even know that i'd probably read it even if it was at the library though
i'm just not really interested in reading about other people's lives to that degree
unless maybe they lived a long long time ago
for me it would be interesting to find out what life was like in that period
not really interested
None
if i read a biography it's mostly because maybe i have to
back when i was in school i had to have information about that person or preparing some kind of lesson
i need to have more information about people
i do like to read some biographies
that one just sounded gossipy
i wouldn't want to sit down and just read it cover to cover but flip through just to get a good laugh
i think the last biography that i read i think it was on lady randolph churchill
that was excellent
i think the first one is called jenny or something like that because that was her name
i've been looking for the other half of it and read the
it was absolutely excellent
it was very descriptive of people with money back then and affluents in england that were associated to the king and all
it was
it's been a while
i love to read
i'm constantly reading
i like mysteries
i like
as far as improving myself i haven't read any lately
i was reading classical works that i hadn't read before
that you might have needed to read in school but that i just didn't read for some reason or another or that you can only read so many in school that they make a requirement of
you have so many out there that you never get a chance to read
i said
i think it was because i read dickens' a tale of two cities
that
i could not believe that it took me so long to read such a good book
i hadn't read that one
i thought to myself what other things are out there that are classics
that have withstood time and that are just excellent
something's excellent about them whether it's the way they were written or whether it was the material that was written about
i started reading
i had a binge of bo-
my mother
my mother sent me boxes full of different books
she just would get them real cheap and stuff and send them over
she was i guess because
it seems like older people have much better
in their schooling they got more of the classics than i did
she knows so much more of them than i do
i wouldn't even know to go look for that author or that book
i like the classics too
i think that there's a lot of books out now that are kind of garbage
i don't prefer to read a lot of the things like you might find at a target or a supermarket or something where they have a bunch of books out paperback type books
usually i'm going to the book store for a particular reason
probably you read a book review or something
i buy some of the not self-improvement books but self-help books
we just bought a new house
i bought a couple of books about how to buy a house and what to look for
or how to repair this or repair that in your own home
or how to do something books for reference
those are really helpful i think in helping
some medical symptoms how do you know when to take your child to the doctor or not
purely just for enjoyment
i had a major in english and linguistics
i have a lot of books in my home that i can read from the classics
i do enjoy those quite a bit
for reading just day to day i have a particular book i'm looking for
i just enjoy the newspaper magazine
what i do is i usually have two books at one time
just depending
some authors i can just basically drink in
others eh i really do have to work at them
and then whether they're a foreign author or whatever or if it's their style or just understanding the material
some of those it's like i said
to me it's worthwhile in the end
i usually remember those a long time later
then i have books that i read just purely for enjoyment
yeah
i particularly like dick francis books and just some of the authors that are for mysteries just purely for entertainment
except to be momentarily pleased because i can never remember
i think that's good because you do have to use your mind and imagine up the circumstances and things
it's not like most television where you can sit there and not even pay attention very much but
television it gives you everything
it's basically mindless
the only really thing you are having to use is connecting the things that they give you
what you're hearing and your sight
they give you everything else
the television that we see nowadays seems like it doesn't even have some of the underlying things to it that maybe the old movies and things had the underlying themes and stuff that maybe you had to kind of figure out
or with hitchcock or something where you're either expecting something or w-
i don't know
i don't really care much for t v at all
i sometimes get hooked into it
i really get mad at myself when i do because i realize fully there's no really redeeming value for
that's right
i think it is good to read books and
when you develop your imagination that can take you into a lot of other areas because you've developed your mind in seeing things
even if it's your own set way
