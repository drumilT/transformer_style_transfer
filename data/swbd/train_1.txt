what kind of experience do you have then with child care
i wonder if that worked
you might try
see if it
i don't remember
i guess we can start
i don't have any kids
she just had a baby
she was worrying about going back to work and what she was going to do with him and the different
i used to work when i had two children
i don't envy anybody who's in that
does your sister live in a big community
it's a fairly large community
she got real lucky though
he had a boss who moved into a larger office she's able to take her baby to work with her
it's a small office that she works in it's a legal office
it's just one lawyer she's the only one really that takes care of the office
they have an extra room and everything for the baby
it works out pretty good for her
i know a lot of people around here sometimes have mothers or grandmothers that take care of their kids
the community i'm in is not a real large one
there are a lot of people who babysit in their homes that
it's fairly safe
None
i don't feel comfortable about leaving my kids in a big day care center simply because there's so many kids and so many
colds and things like that
they're expensive
they just watch them and let them play and things like that
you don't always even know if it's going to be the right place or not
i guess after he gets to a certain age she's going to have to take him to a day care
when she can't keep control of him
he starts crawling
it would be nice to have him around seems like
at the wrong time
when you have kids will you work
i don't know that's something i've considered
i teach my kids at home
i'm here all the time
they don't go to school
is it like
what's that called
it's correspondence school
some states say that you have to be a certified teacher in order to do that
i'm not a certified teacher
my kids are only elementary levels right now
they haven't been to public schools at all
my oldest he was
my youngest two have never been
we don't
you've never had
does the company you work for test for drugs
they just recently started a policy of testing drugs which was kind of interesting
when i went to work for them they didn't do that
since then they've started a drug testing policy not because of their own convictions but because the clients of our company requests that we do that
we're not being tested for drugs at all
our policies and procedures manual the furthest it goes about drugs is in kind of the miscellaneous section or it's reasons for immediate dismissal
that's pretty general
i work for an environmental management firm i'm an engineer there
i do go on a lot of hazardous waste sites
i don't operate any machinery
people for our company that do operate machinery like drill rigs and things like that are under a medical monitoring program
they're at a higher risk of exposure
blood screening is part of that
i think that drugs
it's not their exclusive
it's just something that turns up in the other parameters that they test for
i think it's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have to exercise some quick judgment in the field
it's actually
a lot of our clients are big oil companies
they go out to
the clients are very concerned that the engineers who go out there are adhering to their drug policy because they're on their territory and everything
the thing that's interesting is that i'm an engineer a software engineer
i work in the software house
everybody there are all software engineers
they never go out to the oil rigs or anything
yet we're subjected to this policy the same one that all the engineers have to
a little different actually
we have to go through the same thing
it's a little different i guess
then if you get injured on the job if you trip and fall or something they give you a drug test right away
a lot of people were really upset with the policy at first
they didn't find any problem with that
that's been an issue in our company even though we don't have the random or even regular drug screening
people will just get
i've
i have many a time called him to come get me
they don't think twice about serving beer by the keg
i think drug testing
i don't know
i think it's got some relevance
i think its relevance is pretty limited
i think
it's really bizarre
particularly where we are
there was a story of a woman last year who actually did slip on the ice and sprained her ankle
she was a personnel secretary
i don't know
i have a lot of mixed feelings about on the one hand it's like if
they should be able to make it as a continue of employment in some sense
it's like employments are contractual by nature anyway i had an experience when i was interviewing for a job where i had to do a drug test
it was kind of a long story
it was just an incredibly humiliating experience what i went through
it amounted to going in before any of these interviews
i'm going in for interviews
they flew me out to chicago
before i went into any of the interviews they took me to the doctor to give me a physical
they said it was going to be a physical
beforehand they told me they were going to do drug screening
i had forgotten about that
basically i'd already peed off in that morning
when i got in there i wasn't able to give a full sample
they made me sit and wait for forty-five minutes drink a whole ton of water before
the procedure is utterly humiliating
he examines you
the question was kind of interesting to me because i was just trying to put together a long term financial plan and monthly budget
the only thing i do now is put the data into quicken
i've considered using it once myself
i decided that the amount of information that would have to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date
i kind of gave up on the idea of using quicken at least for now
i've found it's the only reliable way to keep a check book balanced actually because what will happen is my wife will write a few checks and then not bother to total it it comes in to doing all the arithmetic
it really helps with that
it's similar problems
we just have the one check book
occasionally we will get behind like you say
how to you handle that the long range or medium range planning on finances
we haven't had to until just recently
i guess we've got a daughter who is eighteen months and another one on the way
we needed to start doing more of that just for saving for college and things like that
we try to put away two and four thousand a year just for that
that's pretty good if you can do that
we haven't really put much away for her college up to this point
we're to the point now where our financial income is enough that we can consider putting some away for college
we are going to be starting a regular payroll deduction in the fall
the money that i will be making this summer we'll be putting away for the college fund
sounds good
i guess we're just at the point
now we're just going on the one income
it's a lot more interesting trying to
find some extra payroll deductions is probably the only way we will be able to do it
kind of enforce the savings
it will be interesting to see
our situation is just kind of the opposite of that cause my wife was not working for some time and was going to school and just recently took on a full time job almost full time
it's only recently that we've had the money where we could start putting away large sums of it for long range goals like college and sickness and travel and that kind of thing
i was just curious what part of the country
cincinnati actually
i was kind of wondering if they would be collecting people with the western accents or something like that
i don't know how many people are getting involved in this
that's interesting
i was kind of interested if you found out about the study by reading telecom digest
was there another
a colleague of mine at work got some information over the computer network called internet
he just forwarded that on to me
it sounded like it would be an interesting project to participate in
i sent back mail
it would be interesting to see how the data base
i guess we're talking about the experiment
probably need to try to get back on the topic
it's hard to talk about finances without getting to dollar figures i guess
what other long range goals do you have besides college
i think either my wife or i would like to pursue advanced degrees at some point i guess we will have to factor that in if we are not working for employers that happen to fund that
it seems like every year my employer just gives back a little bit your tuition reimbursement
they use to reimburse one hundred percent
now it's reimbursement depending on the grade you get in class
it's a real shame from what we had before because we're
i lived over in europe for a couple of years
in germany they don't have the jury system
what they do is they have three judges basically
you get up there
the prosecuting attorney presents his evidence
your defense attorney presents their evidence
those three guys take the evidence go off figure it out and then come back and say whether you're guilty or not
when you have a man that's signed a statement saying he's guilty
we have a family called all day family
what they've done is they've bought mercedes after mercedes after mercedes is what they've done
i would have to look at it
if they did it with just the judges the police have to do a lot better job of making sure that their evidence is airtight
the judges sitting in that kind of stuff day after day they know all the procedures
you can't use this as evidence because it was either illegally obtained or whatever
you wouldn't have this theatrics where the lawyer jumps up and presents it to the jury
the judge says no
disregard that
any jury's not going to disregard the evidence
that's true
i think our judicial system is attorney welfare myself
i hold it in the utmost contempt
my favorite is the police department
you and i we have work schedules
if they do catch them they don't get any monetary gain out of it whereas we write a check
where do you think they target their efforts
leave the details up to somebody else
i think to begin with you would have
here in atlanta area our crime rate is just astronomical
you go out on the streets
they're giving speeding tickets
talking about the lawyers what might very well cause a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that is to set the fees for cases
it's kind of like do it in the similar vein like v c r or television repair
if you take your t v in a lot of these t v repair places will say i'll repair your t v for a hundred dollars
if he gets in there and starts rooting around and finds something in there that's really tremendously wrong with it then he eats it
he repairs it gives it back to you and takes your hundred dollars
if he comes in and says i'll repair your v c r or somebody else's v c r for a hundred dollars gets in there
maybe if we did that with the lawyers so that whether it's a murder case or somebody suing somebody else you get x dollars for that case
that's it
when you get the most heinous of crimes have you ever noticed you always get the most renowned defense attorney
here's this bum that didn't have a job he's got a attorney that you and i could never afford
None
you're talking to the other half that's paying for it
it's amazing
when you stop and look at it the judges they're all former lawyers
that's another problem
they're totally and morally bankrupt without any ethics whatsoever
with that type person running it you could expect that you
do you know anyone that is in a nursing home or has ever been in one
my grandparents were looking into it before
i know what they've said
i'm trying to think
my wife's grandmother had alzheimer's
they were going to put her into a nursing home
when they put her in she had all kinds of trouble
the nursing home made them come
they thought it was too much of a bother
she sort of went bananas
they couldn't deal with her
i guess you need to know whether it's a no deposit no return kind of thing whether
if they're equipped to handle the kind of patients you're going to have put in there too
i know my grandparents wanted to have some independence still
they wanted to be independent as well
my grandmother actually was in a nursing home that
there was a retirement hotel and then a
for the first few years she had her own apartment and made her own meals sometimes but could also go and eat someplace else
as she became less able to take care of herself then she moved into this other part that was able to provide full-time care
she didn't have to do anything anymore
my experience has been that most people that move into nursing homes die very quickly
that's som-
i don't know whether that's because they sort of give up hope once they get in there or what the reason is
i think the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home is only six months or something
a lot of it's probably to do with the fact that people go to it because they need help
they're already ill before they go
if you can take care of yourself at all or have someone that can take care of you then you stay where you are
people send you there as a last resort
that was their thinking
also so they could find someplace that they enjoyed while they still had choices to make
of course you can't just sit around and wait
the money is also another issue how you're going to pay for it
i guess it's not exactly fair for the younger family members to have to put it in their savings
it is kind of fair
it's also not fair because they have their own children to raise
it's another problem
if it were you you probably wouldn't want someone choosing a place for you to live based on lowest price
it's just so complicated anymore i think
with medicine being the way it is you're extending life where sometimes the quality of living has gone down
they're not necessarily enjoying life anymore
maybe that's the purpose of the nursing home is to have them go someplace where they can see that it's not worth continuing
cause if your spouse died all alone it'd be nice to go someplace with people similar to you
i've known quite a few people that have gone to retirement communities
here in california and in ari-
what do you think about putting the elderly in a nursing home
i think that it varies on the individual basis
sometimes there is no alternative
you do not have family available or family that's
you may not even have family who are around
sometimes it's not an alternative
i think also sometimes it can be a benefit if it's for a short time
sometimes in a nursing home especially if it's after an acute illness
to rehab after an illness
sometimes the nursing homes are good for just short periods of time
too often the acute hospitals are sending them out much faster than what they're
there is some good to it
sometimes too it's used as a dumb job
the families do not necessarily
they don't want to take the responsibility
they will put them in a nursing home
you see
it depends on how sick the person is too what you're capable of if you have a family to take care of of your own
to the best of my ability i'd like to do it until it gets impossible
there's not a choice because it's not economically feasible even to put them in a nursing home
i think nursing homes can be good
you need to check them out ahead of time
there's also some that are set up for specialties i know some
unfortunately some elderly have i guess it's alzheimer's or where they wonder or
you need a special nursing home for that
you need one that has a unit that's locked where they are not able to get out and roam around you need people who are trained for that type of problem
there's different types of nursing homes i think
my grandmother's not really in a nursing home but a retirement home that also has a nursing home sort of attached to it
she decided that eventually she doesn't want her family taking care of her and being a burden
she really enjoys it right now
gives her a little bit of her own independence she still has a security there
there's also sort of a wing for those people that do get sick
what i like about it and i think she likes about it is that she knows everybody there now
if she ever does become ill it will be like family around her
i've seen some of them like that too
also they have a lot of activities going on for the ones who are more active
it's not sort of like a sick place
she travels
it's in the mountains
it's beautiful
definitely it's
i think that the decision that needs to be made though on nursing home has to be a joint one between the elderly person who's
sometimes the choices because of the nature of the illness when they're
do you happen to be working for a large firm
it's about three hundred and fifty people
it's big enough
they don't have any kind of pension plan where they contribute anything
i wish they did
they have a four o one k
i put all the money into it
i work for a fairly large company
we don't have four o one k plan stuff like that
we do have retirement
the rest is whatever you want to put in if you put more than that or something like that
that's a pretty good deal
how long does it take for your contribution to vest
i don't know
i'm sure it's not till twenty-five years thirty years
it's hundred bucks a month or something for a family
i guess what we have is what they call a flex benefits plan where you get a certain amount of dollars
you spend it on a cafeteria of whatever you want or need
otherwise
we have one of those use it or lose it plans too where they'll basically pay for child care type expenses
i can send in a request for payment
they'll send me a check for the amount they withheld
that's pretty good
it saves a third off on taxes or something
it depends on which company you work for
i know that the one plan that everyone seems to be in in my place is plan d
it's fifteen hundred dollars
if you go for the other ones you're paying too much money for them because if you're relatively healthy then it's really unlikely that you'd use that amount of money
someone did start a cost benefit analysis
ends up the best is to take a high deductible and take a loss whatever it happens to be if you happen to be a healthy individual
on the other hand i had a similar health plan
one of my kids was in a car accident
i wound up having to pay for a bunch of doctor visits and stuff out of my pocket because no insurance policy happened to cover it which is
you mean not even your car insurance
it got all screwed up because i had a high deductible on the health insurance no fault here
i had a high deductible
we just goofed up the medical insurance and the car insurance and stuff and
i don't know
i think other than health insurance i think an extra week of
every year they give you an extra day until you've got four weeks
that's nice
we don't get them till your seventh year of service till you get an extra week
especially in the kind of engineering job i'm in companies don't stay afloat that long
they
now they don't
you work for bell or something like that
it's the bell corps which is
i don't know
it's no longer
that's what
now they don't
all that stuff
they no longer
hearing a lo-
they're always laying people off which is another benefit that you can have other than salary is trade that off for security
does it
they must have pretty good severance though
i don't know
we haven't been doing layoffs
we've been doing down sizing with getting rid of extra layers of management
i don't know what they do for those people
mean the management they get rid of
there's too many chiefs and not enough indians
they put
have you ever served on a jury
i had to beg off from the duty
i was called
i was not chosen
i was originally chosen primarily i think because i was a young fellow
they tend to view the younger fellows as more likely to hand down a guilty verdict
they saw it
back to the issue
there too there are also cases in which i feel a majority rule might be acceptable particularly i think in civil cases
in criminal cases i'd like to see the unanimity remain
in civil cases i think a majority rule by jury would be sufficient
could you give me an example of a case where you think that
in a criminal case say one in which there is say assault or some such i think there ought to be a unanimous vote because by law and by constitution there must be proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this
in civil law there is such a thing as let's say
i think
are you just trying to say that criminal cases are more tangible
for instance say
also too i think i'm tempering this and the fact that the consequences are much more serious in a criminal case
do you think that in a civil case if there was majority rule that it would be easy for someone to be set up
i really can't say for certain truth be known
as it stands there's many ways and means by which a person can be set up both in a civil and criminal case
the documentary the thin blue line pretty much demonstrated that
i don't know if you're familiar with that or not
a fellow
he served out his sentence until it was discovered by a fellow who was making a documentary called the thin blue line that this guy had basically gotten railroaded through the judicial system
he was exonerated
i think that there are many cases in our judicial system where justice is not served
i also think just like you were talking about before why you were chosen to be on a jury that the process of picking jurors is not always objective
certainly not
they're really looking for someone who will pretty much fulfill the lawyers' desires
the
you get up
each attorney can use that as much as they like
i think it's a limit now
they pretty much go through that
you have to give a reason to the court why you can't serve
onto the thing i was never aware that juries had any say on recommending sentencing
i guess it starts recording now
i don't really know that much about the recycling in this area that we're in
i'm not real familiar with anything that
fact as far as i know the school doesn't have any kind of programs or anything out here or the grocery store or anything
they started off recycling by putting the
i guess the city has bought the big green trash cans
they have a recycling truck that comes around now
you separate your glass and paper and aluminum
you set it out
they pick it up
it works real neat
we're originally from another state
i know in the state we were from that they did that similar type thing
the city set separate trash cans
you separated your stuff
you put it in there
they took it
like on bottles did they give you so many cents back for cans
they started after we moved down here
i'm not really familiar
i just know that my in-laws up in oklahoma that's how they pick it up
i don't know if they get anything back on it
do you get money for it
i noticed it
you don't see too many thrown out around the
all kinds of bottles they really charge people i guess when you purchase them when you turn them back in
i remember the old days as a kid where bottle was a nickel
now most of them are throwaway
maybe that's one thing they can do
i bought some cokes the other day in the little bottles
i know they were at least ten cents apiece
it was like two dollars and something for the bottles
i was like god almighty
it's pretty dangerous out there when they fall over
it's quite
they say that there's a big glut of the green glass
out in this area they really don't have anything
now i know that minyard's and places like that around arlington and fort worth and a lot of those grocery stores they have like four different bins out front
different colors for different things and things like that
i do know some of these places were doing that
they discontinued them because people were coming and dumping their trash in them
they really don't
there's too much labor involved i guess to separate the stuff
it can be
selecting clean junk as they say
who wants to clean their junk before they throw it away
it was nice talking to you
i think two or three minutes is fine
it was nice talking to you
i guess i was going to do it for my son so that he could make some money
then it has my name on it
i'm like okay
we're doing it for a church choir
are you
that's interesting
thank you
have you heard about saturns
i haven't been over to a dealer to look at them although i did see something in tonight's paper that said that their reliability is rated to be equal to that of i guess the japanese cars
that's great
that's kind of the type of car that i'm thinking about we might get
saturns you can't go to a dealer unless you go to a saturn dealer
this offshoot of g m
supposedly they've got great customer
yet i don't know whether i would buy saturn or not at this point
my card and desires tend to be pretty picky
None
like what
let's see
i like cars that are designed with human beings in mind
that's not just the driver and the passenger
that's the person who's working on it
i do almost all my own maintenance and those types of things
i found that while you can find some cars that are comfortable to ride in finding a car anymore that's fairly easy for me to work on it's not very
yo-
i do most of the work on that myself
when i look at modern cars and stuff like that i just say i will never do that with the modern cars
it's so complicated too
i say boy
i'd have to almost go take a class or something like that
i find that for everyday things it's really very easy to work on
i'm kind of spoiled
i really liked working on it cause it was pretty easy too
i'm kind of biased in that
i want a car that i can work on because i think it just costs too much even to get the oil changed anymore
that's probably one thing i'd look at
one of the cars we'd most like to get would be the new ninety-one ford taurus cause they're actually one of the cheaper cars that have dual side air bags
i've driven some tauruses over the last couple of years when i've been on business trips
as rental cars
i've always been very impressed
i think
reasonable performance
this is out in california
i've been real impressed with that
i didn't realize that they were putting dual air bags in that car now
the ninety-twos
i think that's excellent
the thing is that it's twenty thousand dollars
my wife and i are actually contemplating buying a new car in the next year and a half or so
we're actually been looking around and thinking about things
we'd like to get a
i don't know
a dealer return type thing on a ninety-two and ninety-three or something like that
if we
that would be a good deal to go with
the other thing we're looking at is the saturns too
they looked really nice
what do you looking for in those
what attracts you to the saturns
of course we've already talked
what kind of things are you looking for
the saturns you can get air bags in them
one of the two things that
i'd say the most important thing is a car that's not going to fall apart that doesn't have problems
you just get so depressed for the u s auto makers when you do that
you see the reliability and the types of problems they have
the other one
those two things
None
what is your community currently doing with regard to recycling
basically they're just having various recycling bins located for trash pickup
some local communities are very active in that respect
they do have bins set up
i live in a metropolitan area
they're not too inclined to do something as aggressive as that
here they
live in an apartment complex
they only have one set of recycling bins one or two sets as opposed to a set at each of the dumpsters
a lot of the people who live up front don't bother to recycle because it's too far to carry the stuff to the other bins
i think a lot of the issues with regard to recycling are that people have to be motivated to do
i know massachusetts has
we have had a bottle bill for quite a few years now
the majority of the incentive in recycling bottles probably believe it or not is just to get the extra nickel at the store and not
where people aren't really eco conscious it's just the fact that it's something they have to do
i'm not going to throw a bottle away
people need to be more conscious of it
here they're trying to push through a bill
a lot of people are against it
it's going to create a lot more work for the stores that sell sodas and stuff
they want to implement a refund on cans and on plastic bottles and everything
it took awhile for that bill to be passed up here as far as recycling bottles and cans
it's been pretty successful
people notice it as far as highways being
people would have a drink of soda
instead of throwing out the window they keep the bottle
more importantly it's recycling reusable materials back into
that's the big thing i think that they try to promote
i think here instead of just requiring that you put out the trash and stuff if they could get some kind of rebate those people who do put the stuff out and separate it have lower collection fee or something may encourage people to separate
there definitely has to be a motivation factor
i know that where i work
there's a big push on for recycling paper materials computer output paper and also to decrease the amount of styrofoam usage because of
they're very proactive
matter of fact they give you discounts if you use
it's incentives like that that get people more conscious of it
i think that's what they need to do be more proactive like that
i believe it was last year that they actually collected the old phone books
usually have them come from projects to collect old ones
phone books are a large volume of annual
they just
matter of fact that reminded me of an article i saw in the pa-
the local schools you could send your phone book with your kid to school
what they'll do is they'll recycle it
there was an article or a story done awhile ago that
a guy went to a landfill dug down five feet and pulled up a phone book from nineteen sixty
they don't degrade over such a period of time
part of the problem with recycling them in the past has been the covers are made with a clay based paper
they used to have to take out all the pages and then cut the spine off to be able to recycle them
now i think they've come up with some way of pulling the glue out
how let's see about ten years ago
what do you think was different ten years ago from now
they did more things together
they ate dinner at the table together
the parents usually took out more time than they do now to come with the children and just spend the day doing a family activity
although i'm not a mother i still think that a lot has changed since ten years ago
what do you think about that
ten years from today seems rather short
i don't know
it leaves a lot of time out for family and things like that
i think that has a lot to do with economic situation
what about as far as social changes in the individual
it depends
it's hard to say because i think people were busy ten twenty
how old are you
there's maybe a five year gap between us
i think that things have been busy all along
it's just a matter where priorities are placed
and that usually as far as families are concerned there used to be just one person working and usually the other parent was home
now it's pretty much an economic necessity in most places for both parents to work
do you think it's an economic necessity
do you think that we're all trying to keep up with a certain standard of living
i do think
do you think
people really need two cars and a house in the suburbs
there are a lot of people that don't have that
there is that other group that is working to maintain a standard of living that they think is surviving
None
you think it's
i'm saying that the group that is just trying to survive from day to day where both parents are working is more of the majority than the people that have the higher standard of living
if you look at economics across this country and statistics on who has the money and who the decreasing middle class in this country i think that that's in my opinion the case
i have met people
sometimes i often find that maybe there's so many different things available to us a microwave a v c r a answering machine a dishwasher a refrigerator and some of those items for the
i guess we're sticking more to social changes
people want all of that
not all of those are necessities
they're trying to
i say they
probably the best things to do is tie them with a rope and throw them in the water
a good southern solution
how do you feel
that's of course being facetious
i don't know
the things they asked to talk about were whether the judge should be the one that does the sentencing
seems to me that i think that's the way it's done now
at least
it seems to me that the judge does it
i think that's probably all right in that they maybe know what the norm is for a particular thing
i guess also what the system will absorb
possibly though on capital cases like maybe the death penalty i'm kind of undecided on that whether the judge should have the sole
he could have a personal prejudice
judges are people like everybody else even though they're supposed to be impartial
maybe
i think that may be an exception as well
i think that
doesn't the jury decide on the death penalty rather than the judge
i think that's the way it is
they decide whether or not
there's a big uproar going on right now the governor has been trying to decide whether he's going to commute it or not
it's someone who had
it's just like if you've got a dog that's running wild and biting people put it to sleep
just get it out
it's not able to fit in
i guess
if somebody gets the death penalty they're judged guilty
if not don't let them sit up there on death row for
i guess there have been several cases where people have been executed by mistake
i'm sure
you'd hate to be one of those
the other thing they asked about was whether the verdict should be required to be unanimous
which again i think is the way it is now that all verdicts
maybe not
i think in lesser cases it's ten out of twelve or five out of six whatever
how ever many is sitting on a jury
i believe that's the way it is
i'm pretty sure you're correct on capital cases
and that there's one juror that is different than the other eleven
they say they're hopelessly deadlocked
the judge told them
that's probably an expensive trial
i'm not sure there's a number
it's probably thirty forty thousand dollars a day
maybe they could go with a nine hundred number and have people dial in and give their vote
that's been so long i've practically forgot who noriega was
my cousin is a f b i agent down in miami
she's not involved in that case
she does
have you ever served on a jury
i haven't
i never got selected for a jury
they had some guy that was defending himself
our discussion's about the care of the elderly
what do you think is important
i don't know how old you are
if you had parents say or grandparents whatever it is who were ready
who you thought might benefit from a nursing home what do you think you would look for
my dad's almost ninety
he lives by himself
he's in good shape
some friends of mine have gone through this
i think i'd look for a home where they got a lot of attention and where they did some things to try to keep them mentally alive
and where there were caring and compassionate people operating it
my wife's grandmother is in a nursing home in minnesota
we go there once a year
we tend to see her there cause we're in boston
we're pretty far away
it seems
the environment there i don't know too much about it
it seems nice enough
it's hard
at least half of the residents i would say are not mentally sound
it's hard to tell how much of that rubs off on those who are struggling to retain clarity
i don't know
we also my wife and i volunteer to go to a nursing home that's just a mile from our house
she goes more often than i
we used to go once every two months to visit some of the patients there
we have a two year old son
sometimes we'd take him with us
there i would say it's the same thing
it's a relatively nice environment
again it must be depressing for the people who are just essentially not able to take care of themselves in their own house but certainly have retained all of their mental skills and so on
it's must be depressing to walk the halls and see all these other people who really don't know where they are
i think they're relatively respectful and concerned in as much as they can be
i've noticed some of the patients asking for things just repetitively but things that are not reasonable
at some level the
i'm sure that the staff learn what's normal for this person
it looks to me like maybe their not catering to this person's needs is really because this person is just in a state where they don't really need what they think they need
it's possible
i was thinking also that there could be a fair burn out factor in just having to respond to people's needs where the needs are sometimes depending on the person not going to be what we would perceive of as rational need
i'll tell you one thing though that i saw that was really nice
we used to see a husband and wife in there together
they were in the same room which not all husband and wives were
these two were
when you walked into their room they had brought all their furniture from their house
it gives them a sense of identity
it didn't look like how you walk into some rooms
it's completely generic
that's it
this room on the other hand they got rid of all of the sort of standard issue beds and dressers and this and that
they had all their stuff from their house
it looked like it must have been
it must also give them a sense of security and s-
i think part of what you're saying matches what i have read
i used to initially think that the only people who went into such residences were people who were adequately deficient in their abilities physical or mental that they couldn't take care of themselves
i also know a couple of people whose parents have gone into such things because i think they provide a lot of social activities
one of my friend's parents who went in because she had largely lost her abilities
she was in there for awhile when they were away on vacation
that's new to me
i think it was sort of on the grounds that they were considering whether she would live there
i feel like the whole vocabulary of this is very loaded if you think of words like put her in there
there's so much
i guess you're probably in the same situation we're in
our kids are grown up
they're
one's twenty-six
the other is twenty-one
None
they're going to be getting there
there's no prospects right away for anything to happen
i see
i have five children
the rest of my girls are twenty-three twenty-six twenty-eight and twenty-nine
i have three granddaughters right now
i
she's a teacher
what she does is she
she kind of
they let her bring her little daughter in for free
None
she just works part-time
then i have another daughter in bountiful utah
she has to work full-time
it's just tearing her apart
the baby just screams
the baby is seventeen months
she just screams
even if she knows that they're fixing to get ready to go over there
they're not even there yet
i have a seven month old granddaughter
her mother stays home
they live with us as orange county is really expensive
of course we love it because we get to see this cute little baby all the time
she just
she used to work in the preschool and child care
she says after working in there
here she was a provider
there's only so much one person can do
she said she'll never put her child in a preschool
it's really very difficult
when
the first ten or twelve years i stayed home
after that i went to work
a couple of times i just
then i had one job
that job ran out because it was kind of a government seeded type job
later i tried to get the baby to a baby-sitter
supposed to be good recommended person from the church
i knew her personally
i quit my job because i couldn't stand how she was taking care of my child
first of all her children were sick all the time
when my son stayed over there he got sick
same thing that her kids had
we didn't take her over there until about eleven o'clock
she'd take my son and her daughter over to kindergarten
that day i was saying now he's sick
she goes he has the same thing that all my kids have
that's what he got
goes okay
it's not like he's going to infect her kids
then what happened is i said he just threw up
kindergarten starts at eleven thirty
she said she'll keep him home
he'll probably just sleep anyway
you know what
that woman sent him to kindergarten
he threw up again
they put him in the nurse's office
what happened is they gave her a call because they knew that she was my baby-sitter
they said
she wasn't home
all her kids were sick
she wasn't home
her daughter that was in kindergarten with him also did not go to school because she was sick
why didn't she keep him home with her
it got to the point where he's supposed to get out of kindergarten about two thirty
i had to leave work
it was five o'clock in the evening
i found out he was still there at school
they were calling me
they said somebody's got to pick him up
i kept thinking that she was going to pick him up because she only lives two blocks away from the school
he had a hundred and four fever
they couldn't give him anything because they're not allowed to at school and everything
i quit that job
i stayed home for awhile longer
then i went and got a job in real estate where i can kind of adjust my time a little bit better
i haven't had any really very good experience with child care
when our kids were small we had a couple of good women who would often get them to come to the house
who's your favorite team
i
i kind of grabbed on to that team
i used to watch them a lot when they were playing the big steel curtain
last year it was buffalo
i still try to keep up with buffalo because they just impressed me as being so efficient
they never score
that really impressed me
then down here i li-
i've been keeping up with the saints a lot
they are exciting aren't they
the saints are starting to impress me this year a lot
they are just a fun team to watch
they are really
did you see the game
they ha- a fireworks display at halftime
some paper or something in the super dome up in the roof caught
you're kidding
they had to stop the game in lieu of the third quarter and put out this fire
those big piece of something came falling out of the roof and landed on the field
there's this big fire on the field
they were dumping the gatorade bucket and everything
i can't believe that
you just really can't tell what's going to happen
morton anderson kicked a sixty yard field goal
it was beautiful right down the middle
do you think they're going to be able to make it this year
None
i'm not sure who they play
it's pretty much going between washington
and buffalo new orleans and chicago because chicago has only lost twice
one of those was to buffalo
they beat the saints
what do you think about houston
from what i saw they were playing
from what i saw the game houston impressed me a lot
my brother watched it on t v and said that warren moon was just having an off night
if that was an off night i'd hate to see when he's on a good night
he definitely is one of the best i think
their backfield is really impressive
they squeaked out a game on sunday
who did they play
that was
i watched that game
that was
because i'm right here in dallas i kind of pull for dallas
also houston is in pittsburgh's division
that's true
i hate dallas
i was never really a big dallas fan until we moved here
they just kind of grew on me
they've actually started doing something
i've actually paid attention to them
do you know anything about the expansion teams they're thinking about bringing in
what cities are they looking at
right now i think this memphis they're trying to get the teams
that's where i was when i saw
baltimore is trying to get a team
there's some other city
i'm not sure
i think you are right
i know they've got a football team
i think it might be them
right now i think it's memphis and i think baltimore have a really good shot at it
i know saint louis is much bigger than memphis
when i went up there they were saying that memphis sold more tickets than saint louis did
it's like the liberty stadium in memphis holds about sixty-two
i think that one advantage of having the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you don't convict someone who really shouldn't be convicted
i think that a unanimous verdict helps to ensure that
i guess maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who is very unreasonable in some way that you would have a problem that you wouldn't convict someone who maybe should be convicted
i have twice
what sorts of cases were they
they were just small time cases where trailers and banks were involved
were they criminal or civil
they weren't any criminal
what was the verdict
did the jury have trouble reaching a decision
the jury i think it was ten to one on the jury because they only had to have eleven people it was
the one changed his vote at the end
did it become
it became unanimous after they turned it in he changed his mind after they turned it in it then became unanimous
since it was a civil case it really didn't matter
what was the other case
the other case was just traffic
didn't really even count
it was seat belt law it didn't even hardly go through
i'm a college student
i haven't been a jury eligible age for very long i did get one summons actually at one point
i declined it which i'm able to do because i'm a student because it was a very bad time
you learn a lot going to the juries like that though
yeah i would like to do at some point
i haven't
one thing that i think maybe is a problem is i think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now
i wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesn't work as well
i wouldn't think that it does from what i experienced in them
it didn't turn out the way i planned it the way that i would think that it would go
you thought it turned out pretty well
it was
it just wasn't organized enough for me
i just assumed that it would have been
it was just kind of a zoo
the jurors just sort of
that's interesting
did it work out pretty well in the end
did a couple of people sort of gradually sort of assume sort of a moderator role in the trial
they picked one person
he finally moderated everything and made it turn out the way it should have
it did end up working out pretty well
the one thing i sometimes wonder about in civil cases is whether especially sort of in maybe product liability or medical malpractice where there's sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes it's not just a matter of did this guy rip off this guy
it's just a matter of interpreting a contract
it's sort of a matter of sometimes getting into very technical issues
i wonder if the system works adequately in educating the jurors about whatever issue is under discussion
i don't think that they educate them enough to really know what's going on
in the case you were involved in you said it was just sort of a bank matter of some kind
the bank was suing them because they went to get the trailer which was seemingly their property
the deal was that he had borrowed money from the bank to buy it
he hadn't made the payments
they came to get it
when they came to get it it was on the landlord's property
he wouldn't let them take it off
they were suing to get it back
it was a double wide
they'd already taken it apart
they left it there when they came back to get it a couple of days later it had rained and got all in it
they were suing him for the money
there's no way they could because it was the moving company
i get most of my news from newspapers really
i read the daily newspaper the houston chronicle
sometimes i'll read the wall street or the new york times
sometimes i get a hold of copies of it
how about you
do you mostly get things from t v or
i actually get most of my news coverage off computer networks
however i do also watch television news usually in the morning once a day
i read the front page of the wall street journal most every day
that's interesting
what sort
dow jones for example cause the news wire
it's picked up and actually available at my office
it's no fee or subscription either to read at my leisure
it's sort of by category
is it something that is a little bit different from that
it's similar to that
it's dow jones
that's interesting
i had access in the past to
i thought that was a pretty good way to get news
i've never used the dow jones news wire
do you read any news magazines or anything like that for sort of a broader more long term analytical sort of approach
actually not
i do follow
i don't know how to describe it
i'll say a religious newspaper which talks about issues that are relevant to me in a more broad sense
it's a weekly but not like business week or news week or one of those kinds of things
i'd like to say however that i'm overwhelmingly disappointed with the media in general except for the raw news wires
in sort of quality or sort of an orientation in terms of view point or the way the news is presented or whatever
i personally think
i have a problem with their viewpoint
you won't offend me
go ahead and say
i personally think there's a strong bias in the media
after all who writes
that's a liberal field at least from academia
the other thing that i always notice is that whenever they write about something that i'm an expert in i find their descriptions to be wrong it
they generally make mistake on anything technical at least
even if it's not technical if it's some social thing or whatever it doesn't matter
if i am an expert in it they usually make mistakes which makes me think i'm not expert in it
by mistakes do you mean just like honest mistakes
do you think they are deliberate sorts of things
i think both
by deliberate i mean mistakes of omission
to give you an example we will go out of the printing media
i know of cases where we have one television media where they will show
that's disturbing
which is rather disturbing
he does that
i don't usually
it was
it was addictive
did you think that the gulf war coverage would be kind of an abnormality
whether you thought it was more of a biased or whatever
i guess you wouldn't
if you just watched it during the gulf war that probably wouldn't tell you much
during that small sample i would think that everyone was just about the same except the three networks radio television programming
if at a particular time you wanted to get the latest and greatest news you could do that by turning on c n n
at the moment it's under chaos
i don't really have a budget per se
it's called living within your means
no
i have a rough feel for how much money i can afford to spend each month
i
then it goes through the moon
what do yo-
we're trying to
the other side of it is
not much on that side of it
we don't know how long it will be a dream
we're real happy that we don't have any debt
at the same time we're real scared about incurring it in this economy right now
we're stepping real careful and trying to see what's the best way to save the little bit that we do get on top of expenses every month
what do you and your husband do
it will be easier once we get overseas cause we have support quota it's cheaper to live overseas than it is to live here
it doesn't get switched very easily once you come home
we go over seas for four years
we come back for a year
with what church
we're with wycliff bible translators
yes i know who they are
there was a fairly large building that belongs to them
are you active in translation
we will be
i was over four years doing language surveying which is the first step
came home and got married
we will go back as translators cause we want to raise a family
it is easier to raise a family as translators
i always wanted to do translation
as long as i was single and foot loose so to speak it's easier
they really need surveyors cause you're free to travel anywhere
what languages do you speak besides english of course
i have a smattering of about ten different ones
i'm not bilingual in any of them because i kept switching from one area to the other
since i did complete a survey in one area i'd switch to the other
i know the greetings in about ten
in about five i guess i can do better in it
my french is pretty good
it's french
i'm terrified to speak in france
they're real snobby about their language
french is street french
i just picked it up off the street
i knew what i was communicating
i didn't know what i was saying
he paled and said i'm not going to tell you what you said
i didn't ask him either
they hemorrhaged him to death without new infusions that will eventually die
it just amazes me that the french don't recognize that
some of my things
i'd like to have a short work week
we need better health insurance and
if you don't want to talk about it now and then be bored when we get to it
i just press one then
i think that a short work week is real nice
i have a thirty-seven hour work week
right now i'm just a student
i've work in the job force before
it seems like saturday you get off
sunday you're getting ready for monday
if we could have a thirty-two hour work week with that happen is that for every four people we could give another job
that way everybody would have a three day holiday
that would make a bigger market
we'd have more recreation
we'd have less crime
we'd have to build less prisons less police force
there may be more crime if people have more leisure time
that's a possibility
one of the problems they're facing now a lot of people now is that the small business can't offer health insurance it's too costly
what is happening is that they're on a policy where they have x amount of users in it
they get a specific rate
what happens is that if people start having chronic illness and things like that
it's called a group
what happens then is that
they have to cancel just life insurance
what they do is that they cancel the insurance
then all the people don't have any insurance coverage
i'm satisfied with my job
i'm an engineering student
i work for my instructor
i'm not a typical student
i'm older
i'm in my thirties
i have a lot of job experience
my instructor thrives on that because he can just tell me what he wants
he can give me access and tell me what to do and just turn me loose in the same token it's really enjoyable for me because i don't have to have nobody breathing down my back
one of the things that i really hate about jobs i don't like bosses that want to
i just really can't deal with that
what kind of jobs have you done
i do research in computer science
i've just been doing that for a few years now
my job has most of the benefits i want
what i really like is i like being
they send me to conferences for instance but probably not as much as i'd like
that's just nice having a company being able to give you time to do that sort of thing and sort of
they also
a really important thing to me is when they pay for continuing education
i get night courses that they'll cover right now
that's really good
you have what you might call knowledge power when you work at a company whether you know it or not is that you're categorized
some people can be let go and replaced like say a typist somebody who does data entry or answers the telephone or receptionist
if you're a person that's doing computer type things and you have the knowledge you know what the system you've revised and revamped the system then you're vital to the company you get more benefits
that's where i'm like
that's one of the things that i've found in any one of these jobs and anything i've done is that to have knowledge
when you have the knowledge you're not going to be let go
what i
what were you saying
i think we're started now
do you want to go ahead and start
i haven't really been up to date on a lot of music
i haven't really gone out
and bought any or listened to much on the radio except for classical
you like classical music
i like classical music
i like all kinds
i like different things about each one of them
i like most of them except for country
you don't
i think i might like dancing to it
i don't like listening to it
the kind of country i like is kind of the older country music
not the kind like kenny rodgers and stuff like that
that's a little bit to
what's the old country music like
like hank williams
even hank williams junior is real good stuff
the kind that this stuff
you d-
sometimes i do
not all the time
i guess i like the blues a lot
i guess you could say it's similar as far as the way they do it
i do too
me too
most rap i don't like
you're about like i am then
i can't
i can barely watch anymore because they have this heavy metal stuff on there
i can't like that
i liked aerosmith and led zepplin and van halen
i like groups like that
when you get
i even like guns and roses some of their stuff
some of these groups now like slaughter
i really haven't listened to that
you went to school then in
i'm surprised you didn't go to any parties or anything where they were playing a lot of music or stuff
i used to a long time ago
since i've started back into school now i haven't really done that much
i've been pretty busy
i used to go out and dance a lot
i don't do that anymore either
i see
i've just been real busy with lots of other things
how old are you
you went to school for awhile and quit then went back
i went to school and got a degree
i worked for awhile
i started back a year and a half ago
i'm twenty-eight
i didn't really start getting into music until i went to college because my parents didn't really have music in the house
i see
i'm always behind
i'm never really up to date on all that stuff
i know what i like when i like a sound a certain kind of sound
my mother had a piano in the house
my father likes
he's from west virginia
that's what he grew up listening to
he's always liked it
he's probably about fifty-three years old now
he grew up in the late fifties
when they had the elvis presley music and stuff like that
he likes that
my mom always liked that kind of stuff
my mom likes doris day
she always had these old doris day records and stuff like that though
i grew up listening to that stuff
i could see why you were kind of sheltered
i do play the piano
i like the early seventies late sixties rock
do you like van halen or anything like that
how about brian adams
what songs does he play
this love cuts like a knife
summer of sixty-nine
he's from canada
i'm not very good at remembering the titles
i can
do you watch music television m t v at all or v h one
do you get cable
that's you have to get cable to get those stations anyhow
yeah
do you like someone recent like enya
she's from ireland
she's been on the top ten i guess or whatever
she did
how serious is the
needless to say here in washington d c
d c around here stands for drug capital or death capital
it's really bad here
for example
luckily it hasn't gotten that bad here
san jose actually has a pretty good record in terms of being relatively low on violent crime
it's on the uprise especially in a lot of the outlying agricultural towns
because you end up having a lot of gangs forming largely around the hispanic core
it seems to be that gang warfare follows very rapidly on the heels of
that's how they bind themselves together in groups i guess
interestingly enough i don't think we have here a lot of gangs but not a whole large group of them but just a few most of them centered around drug territory
nowadays the latest thing i've read about in the paper here that they're doing as far as crimes involving stealing cars is that instead of stealing cars at night breaking into them or whatever they will pick out a car that they want and wait until you show up
as you get out of the car they just step up and take the keys off of you and drive the car away
that's efficient
that's the latest thing
they get in
i think they call it car jacking around here
i'm from ohio
my wife's from florida
this is a whole new thing
it's really scary sometimes
it's pretty bad when they're using metal detectors in school of course the mayor of d c is having a real problem trying to
what do you do to reduce crime in a major city like d c where it's a way of life for everybody
i would hate to have to wrestle with that problem
i don't know what the solution is
there's no way they can stop the drugs
that's what's causing all the killing
most of them are fairly radical in terms of what you'd have to do
course
the parents aren't making a living at anything
they see all their friends and neighbors
they're accidental parents half the time anyway
their friends are driving mercedes
it's actually
i think to a large extent they don't understand the concept that what they're doing is actually illegal because this is the way they were raised
it's not wrong because all their friends do it
maybe it's the law that wrong in their eyes
they say it's the law that's got to be changed instead of their way of life
i don't know
i think that the drug thing would actually be relatively easy to solve in terms of an actual solution to the problem the other social problems wouldn't go away
there's been a lot of
i used to think that this whole argument was completely bogus
then the more i thought about it the more sense it made is that alcohol is as bad a drug as anything else
prohibition didn't stop it and didn't do anything really to slow
capital punishment
the problem i have with capital punishment is that it's supposed to be a deterrent to crime
i don't think that it really actually does that
they don't stop and think and say maybe i shouldn't do this because i might get the gas chamber or something like that
they try and get out of it
i think that in some cases it is warranted
i don't
i'm thinking of an extreme case like a serial murderer
you're in favor of capital punishment then
for some things
needs to be punished or eliminated from society
i don't think that rehabilitation is effective
i'm kind of in favor of capital punishment also
i just don't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because you still see them committing the same crimes
i tend to agree with you that we should have it
i don't know that it's always effective
i guess we're kind of stuck with it
it's a difficult problem isn't it to determine how you're going to punish somebody for a particular crime
then i think that some murderers don't really warrant capital punishment
like for example you hear about cases where women have killed their husbands who abused them i don't think
do you think they should be punished at all or
they're not really a danger to society
i know they put them in jail sometimes i guess
just would depend upon the circumstances and the extent of the abuse and if another alternative was available
i wonder what you think about this
unfortunately we don't get to do it
it used to be a long time ago i guess in biblical times
if somebody killed somebody in your family
i know that if somebody had done something to my family i would feel that i had the right to get revenge on them
i think that would be kind of drastic punishment
one thing i think that if there is a chance for rehabilitation then that chance should be investigated
like i said if someone is just pathologically going to murder people no matter what then i think they should be eliminated from society
that's interesting
i have to agree with that
there's a lot of folks probably that are in prison that aren't really a danger to society
a lot of people that
not sure
i'm in washington d c or at least very close to it
i'm not sure what kind of capital punishment we have here
i know in north carolina we do have capital punishment
i'm from south carolina
we in our family have been pretty remiss in trying to keep track of daily finances
way back what twelve years ago or something when i got my first computer i did what everybody else does which is to put the whole family budget on the machine and put checks and checkbooks and all this kind of thing
we kept that going for about a month
it became so onerous that we gave up on it
the only thing that we do now is i keep a little spread sheet of what i call the net worth calculation which is just the present value of various kinds of investments and so worth
i only update that i don't know maybe once every quarter or so every three months just basically when the statements come in
just to see whether or not we're getting ahead falling behind or staying even or what
that's really about the extent of the kind of financial score keeping that we're doing
it's kind of difficult for me because right now like most teachers i'm laid off
it's very hard on a nonfixed income because i don't know how many days i'm going to be called in and whether i am or not to try to keep track of finances
i know how much i have to bring in a month
that's about it
anything extra is more or less split up between all of us
i see
are you married
are you living with people that you're sharing expenses
i see
right now we get aid from the state at this point because there's no other way to do it
my ex-husband just sort of took off and doesn't pay child support
right now i know what i'm getting from the state
i have to balance more or less what i get from the state with my bills and try to work as many days as possible
i still have to figure out
it's like a juggling act every single month
this week i've been just holding my breath and hoping they'll call me in
they probably won't because next week the kids have school vacation
the four days before they only have a four day week they usually don't need subs because everybody's pretty good about coming in
i see
i'm shopping around as far as trying to get some extra money
and getting pledge sheets for the boy scouts
trying to get pledge sheets for the boy scouts
every penny i bring in is ten percent to me
we do a lot of robbing peter to pay paul
i guess we're in the situation that a lot of middle-class americans are in
you're the first
my lord
in one of these
his company went bankrupt
it was a subsidiary of an outfit called u s shoe or something
it was a computer subsidiary
they just
they took the top management and gave them jobs at the corporate front office
everybody else was sent packing
i've got somebody was knocking on my door here
it sounds like in a certain sense at least at the present
it sounds terrible to say
at the present stage you probably are even more in the market for a budgetary thing than most people probably might be
in terms of keeping score of input and output
do you have a computer at home
we try to
i keep track of every penny
it's like what do we have left
what do we have to pay what have we paid this month what hasn't come in yet
do you use a standard spread sheet
None
why don't you start cause it said i was suppose to ask you what do you
do you have any elderly relatives currently in an nursing home now
my gosh
we decide not to put her in a nursing home
my sister takes care of her
even though she is a hundred and two she still has all of her faculties
with somebody that needs around the clock care
i have seen them age twenty in the time and with the expense and everything
i still think it is worth it if you had a good nursing home
they needed some quality care
fortunately four of them live in the same home town
she has alzheimer's
it was getting where she was getting dangerous letting strangers in and things like this
they were very fortunate
she happens to room with one of the doctor's mother's
that's good
she's got a lot of family there and that go and see her all of the time
she really doesn't
she has adjusted beautifully
that is great
then i am also facing my father who is very sick
my mother and father reside in colorado
at that point because he requires round the clock
it's really sad
i have thought if something would happen to my mother for
i would have to move him down here
where i can go see it
i'd be very uncomfortable with him being in colorado
why yeah
some of them are limited care too where people can do
they have apartment styles
basically people kind of have a small apartment
doctor's are available if they need them
i know a lady that lives in a place similar to that in austin
the only problem with these are that they are very expensive
the bad thing about it before you can get any kind of government help you have to be a pauper
it takes every penny
they want you to spend every dime you have before the government will pay for your care
that's the sad part about it
i think a lot of people who do it now
my mother could make it on that
i would send it back to her
that's what would happen
you just have to give everything away
i work at a brokerage firm
i have seen so many people that just have to gift their belongings as much as they can each year in anticipation of having to move to a nursing home
i guess i don't know how old you are
we're the generation moving into this
i don't know how our kids are going to take care of us
everybody in my family has always had
my mother and my father are in their late sixties
they're not
he's still living at home
i don't know how he is ever going to get on his own the way things are
i know
it's kind of
something will have to change as more and more of us get older
luckily if we could be like your grandmother i would love to live to a hundred and two if i were okay
you see these people in their seventies yeah
that's the bad thing
the other day i attended a conference here at utah state university on recycling uh-huh
i was kind of interested to hear cause they had some people from the e p a and lots of different places
i didn't think that was a new revelation
it's not too new
what is the e p a recommending now
the guy was pretty negative about the things that the government was doing even though he was from the e p a
he had a lot of facts to give and things like how many solid waste plants were being shut down
one of the most interesting things that he was talking
he was talking about the city of new york and how they went and collected all this news print
now at this stage of the game where they have gotten into
that's a common problem though
that has happened in dallas as well as new york
i try to recycle all of the newspapers that come to my house
after a while i just quit taking the newspaper because i couldn't recycle it anymore which isn't good for business on the other end either i suppose
we're doing some here in cash valley the community here
we've actually got a kind of a nice set up
we've got a couple of plants here that actually take recycled paper and shred it and spray it with chemical treatment so that it's not a fire hazard and make it into insulation
they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them because they are actually buying it and shipping it in from outside
that's good
one of the real keys it sounds like to getting recycling for paper or something like that to go is to get some sort of business to actually want it once you have collected it
there has to be a reuse for it
that's why they recycle
the one i think is the most interesting is with the recycled bottles and all that the industry seems to be doing with the recycled polymers everything from waste baskets to carpet to the sticky slide rugs under the carpet i think they are even putting it in the roadways these days
they're making clothes now that are recycled
like the recycled plastic coke bottles and milk cartons and things like that
there was a paper presented at this conference from a guy from alabama
he was kind of hired to do a study by two departments for the government
one was environmental protection
the other one was i can't remember what
the basic idea it was presented to him was how can we maximize the amount of energy that we can get back from recycling and minimize the volume of stuff that we are putting into our landfill the solution that he came up with for plastics it was really quite amazing
he says the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them
he came to the conclusion plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause it's low weight but it's high volume so it takes up a lot of space there's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling
there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it produce electricity
his solution was to burn plastic collect it and burn it
it's carbon
that makes sense
a carbon fuel of some sort
it's more than even paper or something like that
what about emissions
None
it's not very practical
it's interesting
i bet that was a good day at the conference then
real interesting
i got a bit
my feeling is that it's really being used today
it really isn't doing any real good purpose for anything because it's not cost effective because of the amount of time the people end up waiting on appeal
i think i've seen some statistics that say that it's more expensive to kill somebody than to keep them in prison for life
because you've got all the prison expenses plus all the legal expenses
it certainly doesn't seem to be a deterrent for one thing because it's used so infrequently and for another thing because i honestly don't think the people that are committing the crimes that would be eligible really care
committing them mostly is either crimes of passion or at the moment
they think they're not going to get caught
it's kind of like the aids phenomenon
i'm never going to get caught
you also have to think whether it's worthwhile on the individual basis for example someone like jeffrey dahlmer
one way or another
the other side to that is if you put him in prison for life there's a chance that he might do things in prison and somehow redeem himself
in some cases yes
so that
the other problem with capital punishment you run into is what are you going to do about people who are later
there are cases where twenty thirty years after the fact of getting evidence especially as new technology comes along that might prove their innocence then oops
you can apologize nicely
i think the price
it's better that a thousand people go free than one person be unjustly imprisoned i think is really the philosophy of the way our legal system works
the benefit of the doubt to the last iota is based on the person who is accused
i think that
the way it's being used now it's like you listen to bush
where are we going to impose d-
it's like for drug dealers is the new big thing in
tsongas is also saying make it a capital crime to be a major drug dealer
again i don't think these people care
they seem that the profit margin's so high that the risk is almost not there
especially now i live in massachusetts
we're going to get capital punishment here probably after the second coming or something
None
you look at our crime rates and things like that and you compare them to texas or someplace that does it's impossible to make a case that it's affecting it in any way
i think it's mainly people they get the vengeance of it
None
it's also
the big thing down there was all right we have capital punishment
if you look at who gets accused and who are the ones who actually get executed it's very racially related and ethnically related
yeah it's lot of blacks
a sixty-two year old guy is less likely to be put on death row from what i've seen
i think when you listen to the victims' families and things they're always talking about feeling justified or feeling like they've gotten something out of it
my thought has been once the guy has been imprisoned if he goes to jail forever or whatever if he gets killed it shouldn't make any difference to the victim's family
the only thing that should really
the important thing is that they be caught and not be a danger to society
also by keeping them in prison you do have the possibility of making restitution
the
you will work your prison job
any money you earn will go to the victim's family
the other thing is that i was reading through a book on human geneo research there more and more things like schizophrenia
why does it just turn out to be genetic or biochemical in origin
if someday we can go to jeff dahlmer and say the problem is you've got an endorphin imbalance
if you take this regularly you'll be a sane and productive member of society
you really get back to the question of is someone responsible for their actions
i think on some of it you have to say someone's responsible for his actions
i never liked the insanity defense
i'm ann
you're ann
that is the exclusion of jurors because of or in spite of their race
the people that
the jury that's trying the officers in that case
is an all white panel
there's been a lot made in the local papers of that
it's in ventura
there's still quite a bit of publicity obviously
it's kind of debatable whether you could get a fair trial almost anywhere because that
that videotape was just horrible
None
i think it would be very difficult to find a panel that would not have seen it and known of what was going on
i agree with you
i can't imagine that they would do an all white jury without having some sort of discrimination or appeal on not having a jury of his peers and all of that kind of stuff
the
i'm kind of torn on this issue
it's like they're saying on the one hand he's not getting a jury of his peers which is in some ways i think true
on the other hand it's also saying that white jurors are not going to convict
they're not going to do their job which is
the whole point of being on a jury is to convict or let go based on
what's the prevailing thought within the community
you know what the news media is going to make of it
what about the community
None
i rather imagine there's some snickering about it and a lot of the usually fatalistic here we go again folks
my goodness
i
on the one hand you almost hope that they convict them because they have that very strong piece of physical evidence
these people beating the heck out of this guy
that's interesting
be a good adjudicator
i don't know
again there's
i don't know if it's got as much notoriety
it's rather almost as infamous here as it was with the rodney king problem
a girl walked into a korean owned store
she had a dispute black girl
she had some kind of a dispute over some orange juice with the owner of the store
of course they
the criminal case went up
my goodness
it was just
she gave her no time in jail all of these things
we have people wondering around with petitions trying to get the judge
it would make life easier
the whole world would know what you were facing
it's a matter of deciding
before a couple of years ago i had a very narrow view of nursing homes
it was more like a funeral home
then i had to do some volunteer work here in tyler texas
i went to one
it just had a very good activities director
now i don't have such a bad view of nursing homes anymore
i certainly wouldn't want to send my parent unless it was an absolute last resort
i have a sister that is in nursing school
she's real interested in geriatrics
that sounds good
she's real interested in what ann richards has been doing
ann richards is really cracking down on the nursing homes
you wouldn't know anything about a texas governor
that's about all it goes
she's really cracking down on restrictions and what goes on in nursing homes
my sister's real interested in that and getting into that side of nursing
that's one problem with the nursing home environment
the elderly even out of the nursing home are very open to abuse
they don't always have their full wits about them
it can be pretty sad
i've had a grandmother who had a stroke
she was in a nursing home for four or five years before she died
it's the type of thing that she was living down in florida
my families was up in maryland the other part of her family was up in new york state
it was very difficult for either them or my grandfather to take care of her since she could not do very much for herself after the stroke
the nursing home was the best facility to put her in
besides moving her up which is not a practical solution since both my parents work
both my aunts and uncle work
which means it's very difficult for some-
there's also a lot of medical problems that can't always be completely handled in the home
which makes it
some of the really nice ones that really take care of their people are so expensive cause they can afford to hire the people that are really going to care for the older
even there you have to watch out for
the elderly sometimes have a lot of jewelry and other stuff that just very easily tends to disappear in the nursing homes
he was in the nursing home the last several years of his life
someone visited him every day
if she couldn't someone visited him every day
people didn't get paid much there at all
they would let a patient get a lot of bed sores
the people living in the nursing home would have all kinds of needs that wouldn't get met because they were just old people
the nurses and doctors really didn't put forth any loving care for them
either that or they're just so understaffed that they can't afford to put in the care that they need
cause it's
an elderly person can
you need to have twenty-four hour care answering all the needs cause they can't do much for themselves at certain points
nurses get so worn down
there's a number of
the elderly are very complaining because they remember the way that things used to be
and remember being able to do things for themselves which they no longer can
it very very hard
they feel pretty helpless
we just moved my grandfather into not a nursing home a transitional type facility
is it like a retirement center
they provide one meal a day
the rest of the housekeeping and other meals a day are up to him
they do have group activities going on
he'd much rather be living alone in his apartment down in florida
to move into that facility we moved him from florida up to maryland
it's a bit of a shock to the system weather-wise if nothing else
there was stuff like that in florida
what are your benefits like at your job
how do you feel about them
pretty good actually
they have a pretty good benefits package
in fact they're kind of known for having good benefits
i saw a survey recently
that's good
i'm making actually over the average for my career my experience and all that stuff which kind of surprised me
i'm not a hugely advanced degree or any of that stuff
our benefits are pretty good
that's pretty generous although you have to hold the stock for two years before you get the company contribution which is kind of a pain
the best thing is four years or five years you're completely vested in the retirement plan and everything
it's not t-
there's several medical plans to choose from that cover pretty much everything
i don't pay much of it
i pay five dollars every time i visit the hospital for a checkup or whatever
they don't cover eyes though
i have contact lenses
that's kind of a pain
i can live
for all practical purpose you are almost a hundred percent covered
so that you've got small things to gripe about
that sounds like you must feel really good about it
the dental plan is fabulous
the dental plan i pay absolutely nothing because i guess they would charge a little bit if there was some orthodontia or something for one of my dependents or something like that that's not the case
i work in washington at the naval research laboratory
i get no benefits from them at the part time work although they pay better per hour than my sort of quote real job does
benefits through the government are really
before i
at that time i was in gravy city
the law firms
benefits were just amazing we had everything paid for
with the government it's not quite that nice a deal
it's okay
what we have to do is we have to pay about twenty percent of our costs
it's deducted from our check each month and that sort of thing
the plans that are available to us range from kind of mediocre to really sweet
it could be better
it's really nice to be able to work in a research atmosphere where i don't have to worry about academics or anything like that
one of the things with my company is that they've got a reputation for a lot of job security
there's a lot of different things that they do lot of different divisions in the san francisco bay area that they do
i myself have moved around quite a bit within the company i haven't had to move my residence to do that
i still live in san jose
that's interesting
i have a cousin whose husband works for hewlett packard up in the massachusetts area
he lives in andover the work that he
he's specifically an engineer and does work with the hewlett packard machines that do
it's amazing
it's all ecologically designed
he seems really really happy with the set up
in fact i know a guy who works at andover who i used to work with out here he moved his family back east a few years ago to take that position
anyhow
steve with the election year and whatnot coming up do you think we ought to cut taxes raise them
what do you think
i do know that politicians always talking out of both sides of their mouths
let's example
at the same time the budget he sent to congress has tax and fee increases
i know the politicians aren't straightforward
in terms of economics i'm not
it's hard to call
None
i always that the real question is are we getting a reasonable return on investment
for instance like social security tax or soc-
that's tax
supposedly this money is going into some kind of fund so that when it comes our turn to retire the money will be there for us
yeah
when i see that money taken out of my paycheck every other week i really think that money's history
as far as return investment that's nothing
we're not even going to get the exact same number of dollars back
someone was telling me that there's still an office staffed with people there in d c that are researching to find a cure for polio
i believe that the cure for polio is already founded
supposedly once you have an office in d c and staff it with people it's really tough to close it down
they just haven't yet
i'm not exactly sure about polio in particular
that might be the difference
the other thing that i remember seeing on t v lately had to do with
it's funny because it was one of the things that bush is trying really hard to get ahold of is the line item veto where congress is able to attach all kinds of funny amendments for individual congressional districts to the main budget proposals
the poor president has to either accept or reject the whole thing
it sounds like you think that we'd be able to save some money by passing the line item veto
i think the line item veto is not necessarily a bad thing assuming that the president uses it to get rid of this kind of waste
on the other hand it assumes that you have lots of confidence in your president not to veto important things
whenever there's that kind of subjective judgment there's always going to be a dispute as to where the boundary between waste and necessity is
i'm not sure that that will help solve our problems
there definitely is a problem with
i forgot
there has to be some way to do it
i lived in massachusetts for a while
when dukakis vetoed certain things there was a big uproar and wasn't necessarily so popular
massachusetts wasn't in that great shape financially
i don't know
they were very good at first
that's part of the reason he became a nominee is because things went so well
of course the bottom fell out
there's two ways you can kind of go to get out of tough financial situations
i guess you can raise taxes and then create job programs and whatnot
you can hope that if people keep their money that they'll spend more and create jobs and whatnot
it's a hard balance it definitely is
even not for government even just for a small business
i know some
i'm not sure how it is in georgia
in pittsburgh the crime rate really is not very high at the moment
is that true for atlanta
it's lower than it has been in the past
i guess nineteen ninety is when it start to drop off
usually around the christmas season is usually when the crime rate is a little bit higher
what kind of crime problem do you usually run into
the least from what's on the news there are very few actual robberies reported of residences
what's more likely to occur is knocking over a small store or a car theft things of that nature
very few assaults
on the college campuses there are cases of people getting from an automated teller and somebody trying to device a scam for getting the money for them that actually preys mostly on foreigners
mostly petty things and nothing really too big
i guess here we run into that sometime
i guess a lot of crimes are done with apartment type break ins that type not much home break ins
there are some but not very high
as far as tellers and things like that it's not extremely high either
there were one case where this one guy was taking women from the teller and making them give him money and stuff and then at the same time raping them all
that's kind of like a double assault there
a strange case that happened was someone actually stole a complete automated teller machine
they backed up into it with a truck and put it on the back and drove away with it
there's a crime for you
i guess most of the things that happen around here are pretty innocuous
although from what i hear in the news
i saw an episode of the t v show cops one time that was in pittsburgh
it did surprise me because they were doing drug arrests and things like that
i don't really think those things happen too often because like i said from what's reported in the news at least it's not all that common
like i say lot of cases is usually just apartments and break ins and things like that
a lot of it is due to drugs
drug related in most cases
it's not like it's someone do steal a or television or v c r or something like that
it is for drugs because you really can't on the street make any money off of it per se
you going to get ten or fifteen bucks for it you really not making a sizeable profit
it's not really lucrative to take chances like that even though it does exist
i live in an apartment
the apartment would be very easy for just about anyone to break in
even so it's still difficult for me to convince my apartment mates to lock the doors when they go out
it would be so easy for someone who is motivated to do so to just sit out back take a look at when people are here and when they're not just come in
they could get in pretty easy and especially since there are bedrooms upstairs and people leave the door open while they're upstairs playing music
you'd be surprised also how much people watch you that even not participating in any type crime
i was surprised
they work at the same place i did
i didn't know that they had been watching me
i was getting ready to go in my car one morning
the first thing they said is you must don't have to be to work at eight
i get a lot of my news driving home from work listening to all things considered on national public radio
that is one of my big sources for current events information
i really like that coverage
my wife on the other hand is home most of the day
she watches a lot of the cable news network
have you ever heard of all things considered
we don't have the national public radio in my area
i can hear it at the college town nearby when i'm in stillwater which is about an hour away
the f m signal doesn't reach this far
i'll listen to shortwave quite a bit
it gives you a whole different perspective on the news when you hear it from a european point of view or from the country of origin
i agree with you too on
i'm not too satisfied with our local newspaper which is why i rely on shortwave and then the cable c n n
i'm interested in the shortwave aspect of it
how do you find that the coverage from other places in the world
how do you think that the viewpoints differ
i think a lot of it is just the fact that in the u s you're so far removed in a lot of cases from conflicts
it's not happening in your backyard the news isn't as personal in what we receive domestically than what's on shortwave
b b c is almost
it just
do you think then that the american media is presenting an opinion along with their facts
very much so
i think a lot of it is especially t v news
they don't really have the time and a lot of them don't have the education and the background to really decipher the news and to really explain it
i think it's important to interpret it
a lot of times the person doesn't have the experience to do the interpreting
which approach do you find to be more useful the interpretive approach or the straight reporting
i like the straight reporting
i hope to be able to form my own opinion of it
it's nice to hear someone's interpretation of it i always think it's humorous when the president gives the state of the union for thirty minutes
for an hour and a half you hear different commentators explaining what you just heard
a lot of time i don't hear exactly what they write into it
overall i think i would rather hear just straight reporting
one of the things that i found interesting last year during the gulf conflict was a sentiment against peter arnett who had stayed in iraq and was presenting some of the things that were available
there was a piece where he was showing a bombed out building where there was obviously a hastily erected sign saying baby milk factory
while he was being severely censored and could not make any judgment call on this it was fairly obvious that it was a piece of propaganda
people were really down on him for reporting the fact that this isn't a baby milk factory
how could he say it was
i think that to me showed that the americans were really getting used to having not just the facts but also the conclusions and opinions spoon fed to them
i think people have that opinion
they want to sit down in front of the tv or read a magazine or u s a today and read in four paragraphs and find out every-
let's talk about the wonderful abuses in the state of pennsylvania of personal property taxes whereby you can purchase something mail order
after the fact the state of pennsylvania can find out about it and send you a bill for the sales tax appropriate to that item that you purchased as well as interest and penalties
i don't think they're out of line
devil's advocate possibly
whether or not you agree with that law you're still circumventing it
you are legal in your circumvention of that law
what if you're not doing it in order to circumvent the law though
what if you don't even realize that you're subject to paying income tax on something that you purchase mail order
really i don't think that's a valid argument
naturally some things you just can't find in your local k-mart or bryn mawr stereo dealer
then why not pay the sales tax
why should an individual just because the state can't really find out about it be able to avoid paying sales tax
it seems to me that generally at least in my own experience when i purchase something mail order it's not to circumvent paying sales tax to the state of pennsylvania
it's because the commonwealth of pennsylvania
it's because i can't find the item that i want at a competitive price anywhere in my local area
i go outside the area for that
i think that it's not my responsibility to police myself and pay pennsylvania what they believe they are owed even though the revenue stream went to another state
i don't think that that's my responsibility as a conscientious consumer
is it also legal
from what i understand from various net readings the federal government is going to try to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state tax schemes into place in the next few years
it is a lost revenue stream right now
states can use all the revenue they can get
with something like that do your arguments still apply
i think that if policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion then i don't argue with it
it's not a burden on the consumer to remember that i bought this out of state
the point is is that businesses do that
i was actually talking about businesses purchasing something mail order and then having to pay sales tax on it
that's my understanding of the way it works
usually the person ordering doesn't pay
the accounting department will suck up all the bills at the end of the month and realize how much they have to pay
there are some substantial nasty penalties if businesses try to avoid that
do you mean businesses from the point of view of selling things to a consumer and then being responsible for the sales tax
businesses if purchasing things mail order
if i'm a computer consulting firm and i see this great deal on forty-six mother boards from say utah
i might buy the mother boards from utah but then still have to pay pennsylvania sales tax
my accounting department will at the end of the month
i think that's the way things work in pennsylvania
i know they work that way here in d c
i'm unfamiliar with that because i never see that end of the business
my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer
if that's the case if the business is responsible for policing themselves then i think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that the opportunity to forget that you owe sales tax for something can be avoided
a big hole does exist right now in that consumers can just say i forgot that
there is no well defined mechanism at all
that it is
i don't know if i agree with that
None
what is your family
we have money that we take out each month for food and for gas and things like that
we put aside so much money each month for birthdays and for christmas and for other things
we budget them into what we call our needs and wants list
the things like a vacation
we have a fund for the things we need and then for the things that we want
we're continually putting into those each month how much we're going to need
we know the month that we're going to have enough to get that particular item
we very rarely buy anything on credit
we kind of have the same plan
we have one credit card
every month we put the same amount in for retirement
our new thing to our budget is we just had a baby
budgeting each month an allowance for his education starting now
that's in our budget every month now
we too do the same thing as far as
we take one big vacation a year and then maybe three small vacations
an
we have found that we spend less money if we pull out the money instead of just writing checks for things
we actually pull out the money each month that we want to put in for birthdays that we want to put in for the vacation that we put in for christmas
you have a separate account for that then
a lot of that i don't know how safe it is
i see
it's actually pulled out
i see
they each have their own account
does your husband deal in stocks and bonds and mutual funds and all that kind of stuff
does he invest in that and for long-term
we have an investment plan
we have really found
we are really saving a lot of money
you've sat down with a piece of paper
what goes into that particular thing
christmas birthdays car maintenance dental medical
we have it
when we see something on sale instead of just looking in our checking account and saying well we've got enough and getting it and then when something comes up kind of scrimping to pay for a medical bill
we're finding that we even have more money than we thought
what do you do as far as
i take it
do you run the family budget as far as groceries and that sort of thing
what's that
do you have a set amount that you spend each month
how do you work that
i usually have extra
then that can go back into our checking account
i can just carry it over
there are certain months of the year that you'll spend more on food than other months and certain times when that will be left over
that's completely up to me how i do that
because i don't work i stay home
it's kind of my money
i also get my own money to do what i want to go to lunches and do that kind of thing
we have a clothing envelope for each of the kids and for myself and my husband that we put how much we figure we need each month on clothing
as far as big things like something comes up and you have to buy a t v or a big item for the house
do you have a household
we're going to need to buy a bed for my daughter that's coming out of her crib this year
also we need a new bed
we've got both of those budgeted
we put a certain amount in each month
we know which month we'll enough saved to go buy those
if we find one on sale before then then we can just take that and put it towards
it's crystal clear all the time except for during the winter
we get a little bit of pollution in the valley
we're in kind of a basin
there's been a lot of population growth around here
here in utah up along the wasatch along the western side of these rocky mountains here where a lot of the big cities are salt lake and ogden and provo
logan's up in the valley a little bit further north
it's like seventy percent of it is from cars
it always really hits hard during the winter when we get the inversion
when we get cold air down in the valleys and warm air up above
it just sits and sits and sits
we're starting to hit pollution levels now on the wasatch front which match that of l a a few years ago
it's almost sad
when i grew up here it was just always the crisp air up in the mountain valleys
now it's not in the mountain valleys
it's supposed to have about the worst air pollution
i think probably due to a lot of students going back and forth to school
we're right next to interstate five also
they're getting serious about things like mandatory
they've already passed laws where you have to get your cars checked for pollution if you're in certain counties
population is a lot lighter up here
they're expanding it to more counties here as the population spreads out
i think they're also going to be making it
there was something in the law about if you're car was over a certain age like over twenty years old you didn't have to get it done anymore
they're eliminating that out here
i think they're eliminating that loophole
they're also talking very seriously about the thing called a dirt gun where they're looking at the emissions from the car using basically a spectrometer and looking at basically how much of what is coming out of the exhaust
do it remotely just looking at what they do
they look at the source light
as the car goes by you can see the exhaust pipe and the source light behind it
you can look at the emissions actually
where does the source light go
across the street
i see
they'll set up a trap or something like that in some sense
they're also looking at other ways of monitoring this cause they've found out something basically that
a poorly tuned car can emit something
it was four hundred times as much of certain pollutants then a properly tuned car
the idea being that if you tuned up this ten percent of the cars that were producing like fifty percent of the pollution then it'd be one way to cut the pollution in half
it's also been
it's tough
i've looked into riding the bus to work
i can drive to work and get there in twenty to twenty-five minutes over a very congested corridor which goes over lake washington on one of the floating bridges
None
it takes over an hour
i feel guilty cause i'm driving a
that i'm the least informed
i'm the least informed person in the whole united states
i've never read a newspaper in my entire life
i never watch t v news nor listen to the news on the radio unless i'm just happening to be listening to music and they slip it on in the car radio before i can turn it off
i've explored that with lots of people
they've tried to lock me up and things like that
i'm basically not interested
i also find everything is so slick and superficial and misguided and off the
what am i trying to say
i occasionally will read something like the new york review of books
someone will write a book about something
i'll learn all about this thing that was in the news two years earlier
anything i participated in or know about when i read about it in the paper is always covered from such a funny and superficial perspective that i don't have much confidence in it
i don't think it's just that i'm lazy
i like to refer to this as sort of consumer report phenomenon
assume that they do a reasonable job in other areas
without thinking that there were people who think each other area of specialty
i guess you could explain it two ways
the cynical view is
the view that i would rather take
i think the same thing is true with news
if you want to just have an idea as to what's going on most papers and especially the better papers the times the wall street journal the washington post give you a reasonable idea
i totally concede that intelligent people read these things and intelligent people write them
i'm not being elitist in that sense i hope
there's a reasonable question as to whether it's worth the amount of time it takes
most people think it is
i can accept that some people think it's not and can find better ways to use it
you don't
i think they're saying if something's really important i'll at least find out that it happened
that's is a reasonable start
for awhile i didn't read a newspaper when i came out here because i didn't find one that i liked
if something important happened it was covered on t v
i could then go and pick up newspapers if it were important enough to read about
i imagine you get the same level of something that you cared about happened you'd find out from friends or other channels
i did on
i actually have a
that's the closest thing
i sort of had planned to have dinner with a friend of mine
when i arrived at her house she was engrossed in that
we ended up watching it for a couple of hours zooming out and grabbing something to eat and then zooming back and watching it some more
i thought that was terrific because she actually helped me understand what was going on
even then i didn't end up doing it on my own
i work for georgia tech
it does have about i guess two thousand civil employees
on a scale i guess it's still considered small
the area i work in it primarily have maybe a hundred people or so
that's make up most of the laboratory
from that standpoint it's pretty small
i work for actually probably similar kind of place
i work for lincoln laboratory
we're actually part of m i t
it's very much the same kind of place the technical institution
while i was sitting here waiting while they tried to find somebody for me to talk to trying to think of what things were important besides salary and a job i guess list i had scribbled down was the people you worked with and maybe the challenge of the work and the working conditions things like that
what sorts of things would you consider important
because a lot of time nowadays even though you're working you're treated
it may not be true in every place
in a lot of cases i think you're treated more like a number instead of a person
when it come down to layoff they don't really consider people and their well being as far as how their next dollar going to come in
i was reading this book one time about this guy that had
that way that one person wouldn't get one big blunt blow at one time
i think if they had programs that set up to subsidize people that do get laid off a little bit better other than something like
the company as a whole
you as an employee even the company is making money
you are responsible for that company growth
you're responsible also for helping that company get to the point that it's at at making profits
there should be something in there or some kind of clause that will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than neglect or something like that
it's not a person's fault that people not buying or businesses are not on the up and up all the time
i don't see how one or two people maybe more one or two but a number of people can be the downfall of a company situation
how do you mean that
in a sense that say how do you make a conclusion that you're going to lay off these ten people
for the bad times of the company
what about the work effort those ten people did when the company was doing well
in that standpoint
you think it's better than to try to spread the effort equally among all the employees of the company
even at that it would at least give the person time to look for another job because they know that there are problems
there are reason to look for another job instead of just dumping it on them all at one time
that's my views
i think back about a few years ago when things were tough hewlett-packard did that for awhile
they went to a four and a half day work week rather than just cut everybody back ten percent
and have to give everybody a half day a week off
i think you can do that for a little while
at least that would give a person a chance to look because the way it is a person really don't have a chance
i've noticed that this year it seems to have been a lot warmer than it has in the past
it's a lot warmer a lot drier too because usually about this time of year you see a little bit more rain
by mid february we start getting a lot of rain
i remember last year
we had ice and snow
terrible ice storm around this time of the year
this year it's been so hot and sunny
it's really quite amazing
my wife and i we used to live in san antonio couple years ago
it was i remember the first day of spring
it was so much ice that came down later on that afternoon and evening
it was horrible
it was twenty-nine there
it was in the seventies out here
it was really
i don't know
i guess i'm just sort of acclimated to colder weather
i like it warmer
i like it warm
it doesn't really matter
i would much rather see it cool at this time of year anyway because it would mean a little bit more rain possibly
i have
i don-
i've spent most of my time in warm weather areas
the ice and snow just doesn't hold any allure for me at all
i spent three years in germany
i'm not too thrilled with the whole thing anyway
i got used to it
when we came to san antonio it was just swelter
we got used to it
we went up to dallas
it was just
it's not that it's just hot or dry
do you think san antonio is more comfortable than dallas
you must
we were down there
the last day right before we left i had to ride with my sister
the air conditioning went out on the car
you just get used to air conditioning all the time
the humidity was like eighty percent plus
it was just killing us
that's really bad
just so mild
you've been to such extremes like san angelo texas where you walk outside and you sweat
you're sweating
you see the water leaving your arm
wow
i know i tend to be able to get along with monotony in the weather when it's very temperate
it doesn't
some people say they like to watch the changing of the seasons
i'd rather like southern california have it kind of sunny and temperate all the time
it's kind of a luxury
i don't know
i think in some respects it probably more tolerable
i guess the weather isn't as lively a topic as some of the others we might have gotten
it's just like that was my fault
the weather's
man it gets pretty mundane
you can only talk about the situation just so long
it's nice talking to you
we're talking about drug testing in the work place
i've been tested a few times just before employment
that's about it
we have random drug testing in my business
i've never had to do it
i think it's mostly for the field people that drive trucks and heavy machinery that kind of stuff
they have done some testing around our office mostly after lunch looking for people drinking beer and stuff at lunch time
they do with alcohol
they'll check for alcohol
i thought it was just like marijuana or cocaine
once you start doing that stuff you're sort of stuck into checking for the whole thing
that's interesting
in the oil business
you work in the office around
it's pretty safe environment
i work in the automotive air bag industry where we make the safety bags for the cars
we work around a lot of explosives
that's
i'm all for it because the type of environment i work in they're working with explosives
they could blow up the whole
they have safety features with each of the explosives they use
still it can be dangerous
i agree
i think that under certain circumstances especially when you're working in high risk industries where you can really hurt other people that you need to have that kind of stuff
as long as it's not abused random
as long as it's random and the individual's rights are protected i don't have that big a problem with it
do they fire them or do they
this is it
the policy is something like if you turn yourself in as having a drug related problem then you're eligible for company counseling
if they catch you if you test positive for a controlled substance then you get fired
it's sort of one of these little catch twenty-twos
if you're not worried about it you just forget about it
i know they do have counseling and that they do give you a second chance
i'm not sure if it's if you get caught or if you turn yourself in
if they're going to give you the opportunity to turn yourself in then they ought to go out of the way i think a little bit more to help get you rehabilitated to get back at your job
when you're a private company the rules don't always apply
do you think it limits
it's hard for me to evaluate it because everybody i work around is in an office environment
it's not
i guess i haven't run into anybody that's been a problem
i guess it works much like any lottery
everybody's got an equal chance to get picked
i'd rather have that than say this week the a and b are going to be in
next week
i'm not sure if our policy covers that or not
especially around equipment machinery and stuff
that's true
i've gone out and had a beer at lunch time but not to excess in any case
is it
i don't remember to tell you the truth
they must
gee whiz
i really don't know
you can take some of that testing a little bit too far
there was a company in houston
they did an unannounced drug sweep of their company it was an unannounced sweep of
you're first
i was just going to say i think one of the biggest thing for me is room for advancement not to get in a dead end job
plus for me it's medical and benefits and dental
i guess one of the differences i see is working for a university there is room for advancement but not so much so in quite a highly unionized environment and then also in the administrative association
there is a progressive path
are they pretty much train for a specific job
that what i hired for and then just very little variation from that
also there just isn't the ability to in one sense have a broader scope for rewarding people for their performances
that's in our situation where we are dealing with an institution
it's a little more difficult to recognize an individual's performance i suppose that's maybe a disadvantage of being in a larger institution
i agree the medical benefits and those kinds of things are one of the big pluses of working for a large organization and also the security aspect for long term employment
that's interesting though
i don't know if that's necessarily the case anymore
i use to think that after you work
you mean job security
that use to be i think a couple of years ago
i don't know if it is so much anymore
in fact we just had a lay off in what november i guess
it wasn't necessarily
some people had been there a long time
in some of the large oil companies there has been massive lay offs
i think it's probably a major distinction between institutions and the corporate world in institutions are slower to react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where the businesses we need to cut back that's what we do
institutionally like here at the university if there is a cut back it's not where it's needed
where it cuts back the most
in one sense for us it's where it makes the least noise which means it's often the lowest support type roles
you get too many management people
it's very easy for them to say this is the best way when they really aren't aware of what all it took to get the work done
they wonder why it doesn't get done in the same amount of time
those people aren't there anymore
it's support people that are providing the speed for it
what else do you think is important
the
my perspective is from an institution
there is not much incentive for innovativeness because the limitation for reward is very severe if you're in the corporate world i think there is considerable motivation for
although the more complex your structure the less difficult it is to kind of carry some things through i think
you can see the reward of the efforts
i was going to say it's more personal for one thing
you probably have a better team cooperation or team playing atmosphere
probably where as in a bigger corporation i think you're just a number
you end up being your own person if you do your job fine and if somebody else is messing it up then that's their problem
you really
whereas in a smaller
i think you would be more willing to either help that person or help it get accomplished
it becomes the organization instead of person being a part of the individual themselves
with the issue of trial by jury i actually found the whole question about whether you need a unanimous verdict in a criminal case to be somewhat interesting
i agree that
i believe for civil suits it's not unanimous
for criminal suits it's unanimous by federal law
i don't know if it's even true that it's always unanimous because i thought there were cases where it was okay for a state to have it eleven out of twelve
that's why i phrased it that way
the difference could be that for state felonies versus federal felonies that things that are under federal jurisdiction require the unanimous
things that are under state jurisdiction even criminal don't require
i don't know what
do you think that that's an unreasonable requirement that they be unanimous
i'd be curious as to what the requirement for an acquittal is
i don't think it would be wrong to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if six or seven voted not guilty then instead of it being a hung jury that was an acquittal
i don't know whether you need a unanimous vote of not guilty to acquit
that would be an interesting change
it was also allow the idea that if you had one person who was very disagreeable that it fundamentally changes the way the processing occurs because
i think if anything it would have to be a very close to unanimous decision
i've never had the opportunity to serve on a jury although i've been out here and registered for i guess about five years
i thought that that would be very interesting thing to do
i've been called three different times
i've never actually even made it into the jury box
because there have always been a number of people
i've never gotten up there to answer any of the questions
the people i know who have served have said that usually what ends up happening is that after initially finding out where people stand that the whole deliberation usually results if there is something like a nine three or more severe and the people in the majority trying to convince the minority that they're right in fact i'm not sure that that's any more liable to get rid of the reasonable doubt than anything else
that peer pressure
in some cases if it's a long trial the desire of people to get out of there and not be stuck in there for a very long time that people are changing their minds for the wrong reasons
i'd read one book
some of them did say that when they were the only one left opposing the verdict everyone was getting on them so heavily that eventually they just gave in knowing that nothing they could do could stop it from either being the verdict everyone else was trying for or a hung jury because the one vote doesn't mean anything except the ability to not have a verdict
i understand
you would hope that if you were in that situation that you'd have the moral fortitude to hold out if you believed that that was really the proper response
i think of the movie twelve angry men
it's exactly that situation where
it's eleven to one
he's the one
i believe he was opposed to the conviction
he held on
do you think you get good coverage from the sources that you have
actually no
i'm in school
i kind of miss out on most of the current events
i don't watch a lot of it
that's the on-
what about you
i read
i try to at least have a few minutes to look through that
i look through
i get a newsweek every week which i pretty much read that cover to cover
i as far as
don't watch much t v
don't listen to the radio too much especially the news channels or anything like that
that's about all i ever hear of it
most of my news probably comes from newsweek
for the longer term i read scientific american and readers' digest and some of those other types of magazines that come out which they
the news isn't immediate what you'd generally think of as news
it's recent material
it's more in depth
it is more in depth less broad
it's probably isn't less broad
it's just more in depth
it is more just significant information
not the fact that there was a big auto accident down on the corner of broad and main
they're making time because they to fill in an hour's worth of news
i do too
i get kind of bored watching t v actually when i watch the news on t v because it goes so slow
there's nothing that really is so exciting
you may find one little news item interesting
you have to wait twenty minutes to hear about it
that's about what it ends up being
you mention newsweek
i do like u s news and world report
i think that's a good magazine
they certainly have a very similar charter at least in my mind
what kind of news normally interests you
what do you find interesting versus what do you find boring
right now trying to keep abreast of what's going on in europe with all the u s s r's satellites breaking off trying to become independent and european community coming together
that's going to affect our economy quite a bit
they keep claiming it's going to have a big influence
we've yet to see it
it's only been three months or something like that since that happened
they like to tell us that it's going to be important
i'm pretty sure it is because once europe becomes unified and their economy becomes one big economy we're going to be kind of hurting
i think that's a possibility
we might also be helped though because it will be easier to do business over there too
i know of at least one company that specifically went over there and established a presence before nineteen ninety-two so that they would have it when it came time
yeah so they have a toe hold
once you're in there then you can easily expand
getting in after nineteen ninety-two is more difficult
when they first start off they're going to be highly protectionist
there's already a lot of evidence that they are being very protectionist
even amongst themselves they're being somewhat protectionist
england doesn't want to do one thing
sweden doesn't want to do other thing
they've all got their own reasons which have to be resolved yet
some of it is
i can understand their viewpoint
they're starting off
you want to get established before they com-
what is the
do you watch anything with sports or anything like that
i'm not really into sports
unfortunately i forced to watch quite a bit of sports
course you can always misplace it
what kind of music you into
i have a pretty wide taste in music ranging from progressive rock to jazz to lot of different forms of music
in fact it's easier for me to say the types of music that i don't like are opera and screaming heavy metal
i can't deal with opera at all
heavy metal it's noisy
i'm into some industrial music that's a bit even harder than that
it's got to have a point to it
i don't mind music that's
the basic point of heavy metal which seems to be music to annoy you
gets a little annoying
lot of stuff that actually has ended up becoming popular like nirvana and
lot of the stuff i was listening to in my teens like the clash and the sex pistols and r e m that sort of stuff
r e m makes me laugh because they've gone from a college radio progressive group to being ultra mainstream at this point
it's not really that they've changed their musical style so much as the stream changed
it's a lot of people saying that bands in that position sold out
i think that's pretty much bull
r e m really hasn't changed
if it's interesting
they're producing similar music
it's good music people have picked up on it
for a while there popular music seemed to have not a lot of point to it
i was really tired of the michael bolton
michael bolton really got on my nerves because he was making all this money doing mediocre cover tunes
i could go down to a bar that's about three minutes from my house and hear people doing covers better than him
None
i'm sure that sold a lot for him
that's all you really need for a lot of pop
i've kind of developed a short hatred for pop
it just seems like there's no real point
you hear the same tune over and over again in a thousand guises
it's interesting because you were saying that you liked classical music i like a lot of classical music
i also dislike some classical music
what gets me even more is the attitude of people who are really into classical music
and feel that if it's not seventy five years old it hasn't stood the test of time
i can believe that
what kind of things do you like in classical
i like bach
stand debussy or debussy
i like tchaikovsky
he can make a lot of noise when he's so inclined
some stuff that i like
for instance frank zappa has done a fair amount of orchestral composition that's interesting music
it would not get performed by any municipally funded philharmonic
just because number one it's frank zappa and he's weird number two isn't he still alive
we're
much better off playing beethoven's ninth
that's right
we'll do the ninth
everyone will know it and hum it
it just isn't chance taking enough for me
i feel that music should take chances in one way or another and that if you've heard a piece a hundred times
do you think that there's any way that
do you think there's too much crime now
i guess
out of control i don't know
i live in the university district in seattle near the university of washington
there's a lot of problems
there's a big rise in homelessness and more street people
we get cars on our block regularly gone through rifled through and stuff
i would not have guessed that in seattle
you figured it was like omaha
it's not newark
yeah
i wonder what really is the answer
it seems like the prison systems we can't seem to decide whether or not it's a reform system or penal system
where you put away the people that are so bad that you don't want them out in circulation
the problem is that we only have but so much room
we try to put aside in the warehouse
all we do is just displace other people which come back into society and commit crimes
it's
i think
my mom taught english as a second language
she was dealing mostly with people that were in on drug crimes
you mean she taught in a prison
in a maximum security prison down in central virginia
the problem she had was not with the inmates at all
the people that she had the most problems with were the people that ran the prison
the bureaucracy
it was
they put her
obviously i didn't see the classroom and
they put her at the end of a hallway
they refused to let her wear a body alarm
i just assume it was something that she could hit immediately and really annoy a lot of people
None
she didn't feel safe
she felt fine for the first year when she had her first set of inmates
later on the administration kept getting worse
she got a couple of inmates that she didn't feel quite as comfortable around
she decided that it was too
she didn't feel that public schools were safe
next thing you know she's teaching in a maximum security prison
at least it's maximum security
the point was that it
you said that perhaps people have given up the thought that rehabilitation's possible
i'm thinking that it's even to the point that the people that run the system have given up on it
i think the people that run the system are the most hardened and probably the most cynical
i talked to a few people who worked in prisons and stuff
it's
getting
i always have problems because i can never decide whether or not i'm supposed to be a conservative or a liberal
those are funny labels
i keep thinking that there's got to be some way that a lot of this is circumstances
i can't help but wonder if i grew up without a father on the streets and with little or no money wouldn't i be in prison at this point
i think you can blame it on social problems
i don't know
as poverty has gotten worse as education has gotten worse as there's been more single parent families as there's been more homelessness there's been more crime
i don't remember the gentleman's name
the mayor of baltimore is a rhodes scholar
what he
is he the guy wants to deregulate heroin or something
what he wants to do is take all the money that he gets for drug enforcement and use it for drug education
basically just attack the problem at the demand side
stop trying to attack supply which to some extent makes sense and to some extent doesn't
switzerland tried the grand experiment
they had this park where they were letting anybody use drugs as long as they stayed in the park
jonathan you say it's near and dear to your heart
buying a car is something you're contemplating i take it
fantasizing about
our situation is that we're a two car family i have a mini van we bought a few years ago
it's got a five year loan
that's still got a couple years to run the car i get to drive is a nissan sentra that's going to be ten years old next month
i think about sprucing that up in a couple years if i can
what kind of a car do you think you'll buy next
i think the next car we get will probably be a
i like buicks
it's a nineteen eighty-seven whatever i get i want to have air bags both driver's and passenger side and four door because it's much more convenient if you're carrying anybody rather than have them stoop down to get over
i think the four door is probably a major requirement
other than that reasonable cost and safety and as much economy as you can get out of a car
i'm not looking for one with a great big engine something that will carry it around careful i guess is best way to describe it
that seems to be just fine
i know they're coming out with some v eight now
i think that's probably a little over kill for this day and age
they've got some pretty powerful sixes
v eights seem to be a return to the days of ten or twelve miles a gallon
i drive a ford truck
i like trucks because they're spacious
it's handy to haul things
it's not related to my business
there's so many occasions when i've had to move some members of the family or do this or that
it's handy to have a truck and not have to borrow one
is traction much of an issue for you up there
not really
i figure if it's so bad that i need a four wheel drive i probably ought to be home anyway
actually pretty good way of looking at it
we had a small accident with our mini van a few years ago
we weren't aware of it and just slipped on some black ice and went into another car
this is a rear wheel drive model
we got some monster studded snow tires after that
what make is the mini van
we're pleased with it in terms of comfort and driveability
it's real nice for carrying around our kids and others
it's got some nice features in terms of being able to remove seats and flip them around
we've been able to do some real creative load hauling when called upon
one of my sons has a plymouth van or that same type of thing the voyager i guess they have a child that's five years old
it's really handy for hauling him around and their stuff
of course as he gets friends i'm sure that will be even handier
i know if we had kids still at home we'd certainly have to seriously consider a van just for their functional value
i think that we're going to be owning a mini van for some years to come
probably till the kids are out of high school anyway
what about all wheel drive
is that
even as light as that is with the small tires it's done pretty well in winter
again like you if conditions are that bad i probably don't want to be driving anyway
i know i'd be happy with a reasonable four door
again we've got the same issue with getting kids into the
what kind of crime do you think is the most prevalent in our society
boy probably robberies people stealing from each other
that's mostly what i hear though is people getting ripped off and things getting stolen
that's the most prevalent crime the ones that really add up after a while i guess far as insurance money and stuff like that insurance costs
everybody has to pay for it indirectly eventually
i wonder if drug use is a more prevalent crime though because so many people use it
even though just using is not really
it is a crime
yeah
that is a crime
i guess when you count all the little things that people do like
speeding is a crime
that's true
i was staying in the realm of felonies versus misdemeanors and drug use
drug use is probably a misdemeanor
what kind
have you been the subject of such a crime such as stealing or anything
i've been caught with marijuana before
i guess that was a crime
that's not that much
those aren't
when i think of crime i think of stuff that affects other people like people getting killed or raped
in some ways it's almost worse than murder
it's very degrading
murder is hard on the people that were related to it is a rather final solution though
once a person's gone then it's
the person that's been raped has to live with that the rest of their life
what do you think is an appropriate punishment for things such as rape or murder or something like that
for a lot of the kind of premeditated murders i think the death penalty is
they have that down here in florida still
the electric chair
do they
i think that's still an appropriate penalty to pay if they absolutely sure they got the right guy
i guess usually they're always sure they
i think it from conviction to execution should take no longer than a year
if that
the sooner
a year's plenty of time for something to come out i guess
then there's been guys in jail for six years
the other guy admits that he did it
the system isn't perfect
it's run by a bunch of imperfect humans
you do the best you can to make it perfect
you go out of your way to try real hard to make it perfect
i think you have to accept some of the errors
i think that murder itself would decrease significantly if there was a credible punishment for murderers
i don't think it's so much of a deterrent as it is a good way for vengeance for the relatives and family members
just general society to
it decreases the prison population
which is significant i mean
i know that lot of murders that you hear about are people that know each other
they're kind of like crimes of passion and stuff like that
you might be able to stop people
generally the crimes of passion and things like that are not premeditated
they can be
usually they aren't
they're spur of the moment the premeditated murders the ones where the person plots and plans when you catch those individuals i think that you you end up with someone who's more dangerous to society because they actually could harbor these thoughts for a long time
they could probably do it again
they would have no problems doing it again
i think locking them up for fifty years doesn't do any good because as a taxpayer i'm going to pay one and a
yeah
we do
we've been married for twenty-three years we have three teenage daughters
they're very expensive
we've actually gone just recently to having two checking accounts
now we are having two
it's kind of hard to talk
i have to be
that's kind of the way i feel about it
i usually
of course we're like a lot of people
we just scramble through month to month
we have a two income family
she also works she enjoys it
she's good at it
if it's
i'm pretty bad about procrastinating one of these days i am going to do something about that i believe
she handles it pretty well
your wife
she writes all the checks once a month
is her career related to finance or accounting
sort of on a peripheral
she's an annuity administrator she works for an insurance company
she enjoys it
that's sort of related to her field a little bit
we've experimented with budgets from time to time
if
a lot of times we just kind of play it by ear
we try to keep
just taken directly
it's just taking it out
that's kind of handy
if you don't see it you don't miss it
that's exactly what we've always done they've always had where they match your funds
sometimes if you save so much then they will match it
we've done that too
my husband works for an insurance company he has now for about oh gosh how long has it been ten years i guess
he was with another company before that
we have
i work also
i only have a part time job i get paid very little
i try to use that money for food
we just transfer it into my account
i use that for food household expenses
i add my own check to that
with that i try and handle some of the clothes that the girls need and things like that
the expenses that we need and have around the house
just kind of play it by ear but keep the deductions
we jim has a budget
i am given so much money a month
i am suppose to kind of get the food out of that
i try not to
i don't ask for more
i just try and make it on that
i think when you go to the grocery store you can go crazy with all the choices that you have
how long have you been married
about five years
you're just really getting started
do you have a family too
i've got one little girl
she's nineteen months
she's not
not really
not too bad
you will see that all of a sudden you're trying to decide whether you are going to do soccer and piano and all these choices that they have of activities to do you really have to start saying okay what can we afford
you have to really sit down and plan some more
i think when we were back at your age we didn't have much of a budget
more budgeting as they got older
what do you do
i'm an electronic technician
i work for a university georgia tech research
i just
we have a good friend that's about to move to atlanta
budgeting
i found i feel a lot better
we use to work out of one check book it would be very hard for me because i wouldn't have any idea how much money i was spending in one month
now i know exactly what i'm spending
it's so much easier
i seem to be younger than most people who talk on this thing
i'm just graduating from college
i didn't really perceive much of a problem with the school system
you can compare just about thing to japan
it seems to be not difficult enough for students not challenging enough and just not generally competitive enough
however if it weren't for our needless
i haven't
it's been seventy-nine since i was uh-huh
i've seen things change
i wasn't really listening to the world go by back then
it's hard to compare
it seems like when i lived in chicago
i've lived down here
i certainly see how much i pay in real estate taxes every year
i begin to wonder if i'm really getting my money's worth
i've seen so many different things so many different bad reports coming out of the school system
i recognize that there are good schools out there
somebody's getting a good education because we
i don't pretend to understand that either
i'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools
then again i'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put because the dropout rate is in those areas w-
it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and crime
they all seem to go together
it seems like if you could eliminate one
the other two a-
it's just like i don't expect them to know which part is best to fix just like i don't know
it's a complicated issue
i still don't think i would blame it directly on the school
i think i blame it on a couple of different things
i think i blame it on the school system
that's i meant when i said the school
although i think that
that's odd because i don't think the teachers in my school district were well paid
there are some school districts out there that are very well paid
i know one family that's got
they both have
second jobs that they work in the afternoons
from their teaching job alone they pull in forty grand each
it
okay
they only work nine months a year
they get an awful lot of breaks in between
that's my tax dollars that i'm spending on that
i don't even have kids
that's true
there's
you can always play games with talking about whoa look at this
when you're w-
there's really not much you can directly do about that
i think that if there is a problem with the school system it's been my perception that the school teachers and school officials are not that well paid that perhaps that might be one area that could be improved
this is a profession
as a matter of fact it's a pretty big influence on
do your privacy being invaded at any time
that is something that is not required in fact it is actually prohibited
it doesn't stop many
it's one of the things that it's used for primarily is for demographic research
to get your phone number on
that you can still
i say what are you going to do
ultimately they say no
really it's part of this compliance thing
the thing i don't like
i know that certain states actually sell their lists like motor vehicles
that really burns me because you're required
i think that it's one thing to voluntarily give it because someone asks
it's another thing where it's required by law
they go ahead and take that information and sell it to somebody
i don't think they have the right to do that
that's something that people have seen
here's an easy way to make some money
i don't know if that's been challenged in the courts or not
i've heard fairly recently some talk about that in my state
the budget problems up here are pretty tense
people are looking for alternate ways of
enhancing revenue is the phrase they use
they were talking about selling the d m v lists
there was a lot of consternation about that
the last i heard they'd backed down from that idea
that's easy
you become
you start getting millions of calls or solicitations
y-
like national public radio or
i think i sent in money f- once to public t v
i started getting calls from all sorts of diseases and syndromes and everything you could imagine
it just started soon after i had done that one
i just said this is terrible
that's also happened to me where i've given money to my old alma mater in college
it's one thing
the thing that makes me mad is then they start getting other people
the people do these phonathons they call you up
they actually happen to be people who graduated in your class or something like that
they say we know you
you had contributed x amount last year
hold on here
how do you know that
why you even telling me this
it's one thing that i and the college knows that
that was very offensive too
last year the lotus development company the company that puts out one two three was planning on marketing a c d rom with people's names sorted by number of different criteria
yeah
you're remodeling
i live in an apartment now
two summers ago i went to massachusetts i went with a friend of mine
we undertook a building house
this was a lincoln log house where you have the wall partitions
it's preconstructed you might say
we started from an empty lot with
we had to cut them down and clear the lot
one of our main problems was
in massachusetts i thought i was going to
it was a fun time
i thought gosh summer time
all it ever did was rain and thunder storms
we're in the process
it started pouring down rain
i guess we had most of it done
the end was result
what happened was that a lot of water settled on the top
it really didn't give a very good finish
some of the
it was sort of sandy and not a very good finish
it was okay
it's only the basement floor
it was okay
it kept us pretty busy
it was only
we just had two helpers and sort of a family type
it wasn't a commercial project or something
it was sort of just get my brother and maybe my cousin's coming over today to help us do that kind of thing so that the scheduling and everything was kind of hectic
materials coming in
overall we got it done
it's a three bedroom two bath house
it's pretty neat
what was it for
it was for my friend's parents
they'd lived in this old
they live in this old house
his mom just wanted a new house
we did that
she was really pleased with it
it came really great
why is it that the weather in atlanta that gets
that's why you
the windows what type of windows are you putting in
the windows are something that is conducive to temperature changes in the solar game
what are you putting in triple glaze or double glaze or
we just went into a building supply store and bought plate glass
it
it's had several owners and stuff
you have the sash windows in
did it go up and down
i see
we wanted to
those are
the ones that would open wouldn't want to stay open
they
it causes the glass to crack
it's a never ending problem
i haven't been in any really home repair things lately
i guess i have to say at this point that i do approve of it
because i know that in using drugs i was not a good employee
i can see from the company's standpoint that there
you are also under their liability under the workmen's comp
on my job we had a lot of workmen's comp cases
it's also a retreading plant
that's where most of our injuries occur
what we do is we'll have a drug test if a break or a man has an accident
then he's automatically given a drug test
do they do it within hours of the
is it
that kind of
i don't know if it's been a deterrent or not because we have just started using it for the past year or so
we've let some people go that we found that drugs were used in their system
i don't know how t e c would handle it
they haven't pursued it
if there's some problem i know
he went to a separate drug testing firm
they showed it negative
i think the tests themselves are not really that cut and dried
that's sort of scary
i also had a friend who was just around some people that were smoking cocaine
he tested positive on cocaine
then you always wonder is he just saying that
that's a bad situation
i think most companies now as far as entry
exams require that
i'm really gung ho for it
in fact i
some of the places now like i b m don't allow them smoking in the plant
we have designated smoking areas
i work in sort of a building that's not really
it's a little bit separated
it's a factory environment
they have designated smoking
it's just wide open
it's not ventilated properly i think that's bad
as far as the drugs being in the factory kind of environment that way i think it's essential
because you're endangering everybody's lives if it's something like that
they never called me
they never
finally the day we declared war was my time
my boss has gone for about three times i think
i told him he's obviously in a high risk group
of course they did specifically single them out when we started
that they were going to do all them first
wouldn't that be awful
like i say i'm a former drug user
i accepted christ as my lord and savior
i don't use drugs any more
what kind of drugs did you use if you don't mind
marijuana cocaine and amphetamines
all on the job too
it had gotten that bad
it's really lucky that you got away from that
i was losing jobs just from doing a poor job
that's it
there's all kinds of drawbacks much less the drug testing
i'm definitely for it
you want to think that you're working with people who are not only putting out their fair share
in some cases my husband several years back worked for motorola
they had
it was a chemical handling type
they have some serious chemicals out there
they have emergency shower where you just run in there and strip off and dump water that kind of thing
they had people out there using all sorts of drugs handling those chemicals
my gosh
that's really frightening
i think some places like that it should be mandatory on a greater frequency than maybe
just paper pushers like i am
you'd think so
they weren't
when he was at
course now it's been years now because it was even before they had the designated smoking type stuff at t i
i guess it was eighty-four eighty-five something like that
at that time they had no testing whatsoever
that's scary
that reminds me of
i have just casually asked her what he did for a living
she said he's the supervisor of this chemical land fill where they go and dump all this toxic stuff
i just went where
i'm proud though that i grew up in the sixties
back then it was popular
people have really become wise about drugs they really have a good campaign for the young people
i guess it was just a generational thing
that's good
it really is
i think we did it
it's good talking to you
i enjoyed talking to you cathy
seems to be a topic that's going to probably take about a generation to catch on it seems or maybe a generation to two
we may have to do it out of necessity as far as moving that time schedule up
it does seem to be a lot of habits to break
i wasn't raised as a kid on it
my kids are
they tended to want to grab the aluminum cans when that was one of the first things to do
we were doing all right there until the price dropped out
as far as at home use we'll pick up a six pack every once in a while or for whatever occasion of doctor pepper or something
by the time we gathered up enough crushed cans to take it in
at the time it was still about forty or fifty cents a pound
we came out with about a dollar
a lot of hassle all year round
cans laying
they realized
of course to them a dollar was a dollar at four and five years old
that was a big deal
we decided it wasn't worth us keeping it
t i started keeping up with cans there
occasionally i'll bring whatever i've got laying around the car or the like and throw them in there
as far as a habit at the house i haven't started on anything other than just whatever the city wants to pick up
i don't know if it was
it should be starting i would stay probably in the next month if everything goes that
it seemed like
if i recall it's been a long time
they were fine on the big green containers seems like they said they were just going to have a bin
all different types would go in there
that they would sort it as needed
it seemed that there was
at the time anyway the thinking was that there was too much not getting sorted properly and that at the collection sites where everything's clearly labeled and people that happen to go to that kind of trouble to do it happen to do it pretty well those are okay to have the general public doing the sorting
when it comes down to just general purpose trash that all the houses
they felt that having one guy just sit there and run through it real quick was better than having a household try it
i don't know
it would get messy too
i know other places when they recycle they have to wash out their glass jars and whatnot which we're not in the habit of doing
i was brought up long time ago that they didn't even have cans
you'd return them to the the grocery store
you'd get our money back
that was all well and good
i guess this day and age they don't
it seemed to be a very popular thing for people driving by that highway there by our tracks to throw the bottles at the tracks and try to break them
they weren't that successful
there were a lot of bottles to be returned
we just walk about a half a mile in each direction and gathered up enough to buy whatever we wanted for the day
they p-
i think kids don't appreciate maybe the value of money that it's so little that they don't care
for a good
i wonder
we did buy a can crusher
we are crushing cans
when we buy the soda when it's on sale for ninety-nine cents
i would say in the last three years we've probably used a lot more cans than ever before
it was just easier
as you say it takes a while to build it up
since we've had the crusher all summer
i think the kids when we were on vacation they said they did take them to a recycling place probably at one of the li-
what are their names
liberty is the cat
wife and i we have two cats
one's real nice
the other one is a
are they just house pets
that's what ours are too
our cat we got from the pound the night she was going to be put to sleep
that's why we call her liberty
that's a nice story
i've had mice let's see
i had a son that was an animal lover
at one point i had a snake skunk dog and cat running loose in the house
the skunk was it kind of like a cat to have around the house
yes it was litter trained we had it perfumed it was very aggressive
all three of them dog cat and skunk used to chase each other all through the house
the skunk
the only thing we have with the skunk he was very very protective of his territory being the sofa and the blanket on the sofa
i had a dog one time
he chased after a skunk and got sprayed we had to give him a tomato juice bath and get him cleaned up
ours would still back up to the dog or cat when he got mad and try to perfume them
the glands had been removed
i suppose it was still in the instinct of them to back up and get ready
i think they're kind of nice to have
they're kind of just relaxing to pet and to
when they sit up on your lap and stuff like that just kind of enjoyable to have
what do you think
i always said if i died i'd come back as a dog
do you like big dogs or little dogs
we had a german shepherd
he had dysplasia he had it for about three or four years where we just about had to lift him and carry him every place he went
when he died we got a little one
our shepherd was almost thirteen years old
it just was almost cruel because
uh-huh almost cruel for him to walk
he couldn't get up
he was a hundred and twenty pounds
it was a chore
we said the next time around we'd get
we've had three cats in our married life
we've got a calico now
she's the nice one
we used to live in an apartment
our cats never went outside
the neighbors used to let their dogs out
our neighbors were i don't know kind of slimy
our cats wound up getting fleas from the apartment that we were in we had to flea bath them
it was an experience that they didn't enjoy at all
don't even talk to me
when i was single i had gone away for the weekend
my husband was to keep my cat
he let her out
my house was loaded with fleas
you walked in
your legs were just black
we had such a time and never got the cat back
i found it in the street
if you were going to have a dinner party what would you make
let's see
i like seafood
let's see
shrimp steamed shellfish with maybe herbs
what is the steamed shellfish you said
what would that be like a clam or
i think hors d'oeuvres are good too
that way you can have a variety
if you have a dinner party and you're going to serve seafood for supper what type of hors d'oeuvres would you serve prior to the meal
cheeses or fruits or vegetables or
just
probably not nachos and dip
when you serve the meal what type of wine would you have with seafood
all these hard questions
what white wine
i don't know a lot about that
dessert
chocolate something chocolate
usually when we have a dinner party i like to grill
you do
we might have some cocktails ahead of time and maybe some dip some cheese
one of our favorites is to take some let's see philadelphia cream cheese i think
and pour cocktail sauce over the top of it and then get these little canned shrimp and wash them and cool them and then dump them in the sauce and then take crackers
you just dip the cracker in the sauce with the clams and the cream cheese
you have a real nice dip that goes good with a cocktail
i like to barbecue steaks or pork chops
lot of times we'll have baked potatoes with them and a salad
i don't know what we usually have for dessert
that's what we would do for a dinner party i guess
that's more for when friends come over
i wouldn't be the big snotty kind
i just really started learning about that
i bought a martha stewart
she talks about catering and goes into all that and the
do you work in a setting where you are in the food business
my father owns a restaurant
None
it's just a cafe
it's not really anything that i want to
it's in lewisville
you graduated from which high school
that's a public school or private
is your father's cafe one that you could cater out of
he's not interested in letting his twenty-one year old daughter experiment with it probably
let's see
what else for catering
that would be good
could have fruits and pineapple
let's see
you could actually go with a chicken if you wanted to
i think decorating your food is really
we have a sheltie collie a miniature sheltie
it's about six months old
we're try-
we don't have a yard
it has to stay inside
we're having a difficult time trying to train it
you're in the roughest stages of pet ownership i think
i guess
i don't know if that has anything to do with the intelligence really the training bit
my son and daughter-in-law have kind of a sheltie mix
we watched it this summer for two to three months
it wasn't trained quite fully either it was a sweet and an intelligent dog
how do you
i'm old fashioned
when i got my dogs when they did something i hollered at them and threw them outside
just put them outside i guess unless you catch them in the act
we're hardly ever at home
it's kind of difficult
you don't want to spank it or scare it or anything like that
we try to take it
it gets frustrating when you take it outside
does it just want to sniff around
it runs right inside
it does it
it won't it's little job
it comes inside
there's certain spots in the house where he likes to go
he chews on plants and all that
that's nothing
that's natural for a little puppy
it'll catch on pretty soon i'll bet you
i have a almost sixteen year old golden retriever
she's gone the other way
that's sad
because she's so old she doesn't have much control we're battling with that problem she still feels good
she can't hear worth a darn or see very well
she's got a great appetite
she knows we're there
of course not
we can't bear to do anything because she's been our friend for all these years
we're putting up with all her accidents
the la-
that was a bad one
i think we're buying a carpet
what's the deal
we're trying to take it on walks now we can't because it's not accustomed to being on a leash
it just goes like a mad dog
it just jumps up and down and starts yapping
does it
None
maybe you can get it signed up this spring or summer for some of the dog obedience classes
we've heard some bad things about some of those
they sometimes misuse their license or whatever
we went to the junior college richland we took
my daughter was living at home then
she took the norwegian elk hound over there it's a pretty good class
they did pretty good except this dog is
she didn't learn a lot
i think it calmed her down a little bit
she's used to being around other dogs now
i think it was a six week program
i think it was one night a week for six weeks
it was a group class outside
sheltie collies are timid
they don't really
they're usually
if they're not accustomed to something they're really scared
our friend has a
i guess we're going to describe job benefits
what do you think next to salary do you rank is the most important job benefits
i would say the medical group insurance area as far as covering medical costs for yourself or family members
does your company have good benefits in that regard
i work for a public school district it's different than a company where most companies fund almost the entire thing
where the school district does the employee must pick up a greater figure in the way of costs
overall i've been pleased with it over the years
i think the biggest frustration is because of the cost of insurance going up every year our district has had to change companies
now we're on a managed care thing which has stressed a lot of people out although it has not disturbed me any
i'm
my medical coverage is with an h m o in my opinion that's bordering on a health clinic
it seems to be a good way to maintain costs and still provide a good amount of coverage
our district did that for the ninety-one and the ninety calendar years
i was in the h m o
i was because my same doctor agreed to be in it for
they usually sign a contract or something i did have surgery last summer
i paid ten dollars when i went to see him that first day
i've never seen another bill
i have to say it really works
again i was fortunate because my doctor agreed to be in it
if you've been going to a doctor for ten years or something and he elects not to join it can be very stressful for those people
i'm fairly young myself
three years ago is when i first got into full time employment at that time i immediately joined the h m o
i never really
the only doctor i've kind of consistently had has been through the h m o
for me it's worked out real good
if you have a family and everybody's gone to different doctors it is hard to give up somebody who you feel knows you and your body and just has all the medical history
you feel comfortable with it
i'm sure it would be very stressful
my husband and i have just elected that if that happens i will go and just pay
you can continue to go to your own doctor your benefits are not as good
you mentioned you work for a school system
all right
i work for georgia tech in the research branch
i guess another one that i rank up there high is the kind of job flexibility and time off i enjoy as a benefit
are you talking about spring break
it really
i'm not a teacher
i don't think the teachers could stand the stress
it is just texas has really
it would be just
in two weeks we have spring break
i don't know who looks forward to it more the students or
i'm not actually on the teaching faculty
we have a large research organization associated with the university
that's who i work with
we're given a good bit of flexibility in what we do
that's good
i would think that that type of employment one day you might be really tuned in and the next day a little luke warm or something it's good that they allow you that
now we do have to work the day
we do get many days off
we all look forward to it
that's the only reason i work there is that my children now have graduated from college
at the time i worked there because my hours and days were the same as theirs i've just continued to stay there
are there any things that you'd like to see changed in terms of the benefits
i guess the recording has started now
have you ever served on a jury
i was in the air force and served on a court martial board a couple of times which is very similar to a jury
i've been voting for years
i couldn't figure out why i hadn't been called yet i finally was
it was an interesting experience
it was municipal court it was a combination of
i was in the pool for a couple of weeks it was a combination of criminal and civil
they had
did the judge hand down sentences
did you folks do that
i had a hard time getting seated on a jury
i kept getting
i'd be questioned for empaneling the jury
they kept dismissing me
it's just whether the prosecutor or the defense attorney feels like
they want to get the best mix for their case
they ask all kinds of wild questions
that's a science in itself
i kept getting called up for drunk driving questions
i think part of it was they didn't like the fact that i don't drink any more
because you'd probably be too puritanical
in my case i might have been more sympathetic with the person who got caught
i was never there for any sentencing
i finally got empaneled on one case on my next to the last day
we got into the jury room to decide the case
there was one guy on the jury who announced to everybody that he didn't need to deliberate because he'd already decided that the guy was not guilty
he would never vote for guilty
they appointed me jury foreman
i didn't think that going in without deliberating allowed us to reach a verdict
i told the judge that we were unable to reach a verdict because we couldn't get one member of the jury to deliberate
the whole thing had to be tried over again
it was funny
i don't know
i didn't like not being able to deliberate
i wanted to vote guilty for the guy
the other people were kind of mixed the guy had to go through the whole thing all over again
how many members were on the jury
it must have been six
i didn't realize until the wayne kennedy smith trial a few months ago that they had six member juries
i thought that it was always twelve men tried and true so to speak
apparently for some crimes it's permissible to have six people sit in judgment
getting to this unanimous thing whether a jury should be unanimous or not in a court martial case it doesn't require the jury to be unanimous
it's a simple majority rules
is it on capital crimes that they have to be unanimous
we
the two that i were on had to do with drugs we were unanimous is acquitting the person even though we in our gut felt that the individuals were both guilty just because of various things
being fair to the person if the government doesn't prove its case no matter how you feel you have to go by what's offered as proof
we had to acquit him in both cases
it was too circumstantial
it was in some of the critical things like special investigations at one time in one of the cases had videotaped this person
something happened to the camera and the tape and all they could do was testify
there was a point where i would have said no that no one would deserve to die for a crime that he committed
since i've become a parent and since i've seen things like jeffrey dahlmer i really have to question that
i can't conceive of someone being that brutal to that many other people
try and figure out what would be a suitable punishment
of the statements made by people against the death penalty i like the statement made by cuomo
he's governor of new york
he's against the death penalty
he said that he would want to seriously hurt or if not kill someone if they did something to his wife
even in that situation he would hope that there would be people around him who would keep him from
it's a question of your gut reactions to something like that versus an intelligent reason response
that was the thing that killed dukakis back four years ago when someone asked him a similar question
he thought for a second and gave a thoughtful well reasoned reply when people wanted to see if he was going to go for a gut level reaction
i think that the people who are strongly in favor of the death penalty are really working from that gut level
whether it be a biblical force the eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth a life for a life type logic or just some sort of anger at putting murderers up in federal pens for the rest of their life while we foot the bill
i think people are working at that from more of a gut reaction than a reason humane one
i don't think the decisions that are going to be made on the death penalty until we decide what our prison system is intended to do
are they reformatories where we're trying to take people who can't survive or that aren't conforming enough to society so that we work well together
is it designed for punishment
the death penalty surely fits in well in a penal situation where you're trying to punishment
perhaps not in the manner that we do it
in theory it fits in
in a reformatory
if you put someone to death you obviously
the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent
i really don't agree with that
i don't think anyone who would commit a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say i was about to kill and dismember this person
if they catch me they're going to kill me
i better not do it
i just
don't think that it works that way
people say that
if it was really a deterrent i think like horse thieves in the old west
if it was really seriously going to be a deterrent i would think that it would be public
i don't think it would be this private thing because nobody ever sees it
if
like say some young kids or something like that that might be inclined more towards a life of crime had to sit and watch and see a guy burn or something or shot by a firing squad or something like that
i would think you'd make a bigger impact on their life rather than telling them that there's protestors out here at the
i don't know if that would really work that way or not
there's a lot of violence
are you working right now
i'm working in the computer science department here at c m u
what kind of work do you do
i'm doing basically system design work and implementation work for the speech group here
i work at the georgia tech research institute
i'm a co-op student
i work and go to school about halftime
i really don't have any job benefits to speak of
we're kind of
we don't really have any vacation or sick days or health care or anything really
it's pretty fair they've got you slaving away
at this point
i'm research stuff here now
they have okay benefits package
one of the significant benefits here is that you can take up to two courses a semester
they pay for the classes
carnegie mellon that works out to be a reasonable benefit
they do that i think if you're research here
i know of some of the people that have gotten their masters
i think that they might pay for that
i know they'll let you decrease how many hours you work by kind of percentage
they'll let you work halftime if you want to finish
they'll let you work decrease your number of hours by any percentage just about so if you want to get your masters
i think of course with your extra degrees you get a pay raise due
that will probably help out
i don't know in terms of other things other benefits other than sort of monetary
i
we do
we have to contribute a certain amount to it
it's kind of split between c m u and the employee
that's a pretty important part of it there because that can be really expensive if you ever have any health problems
i think my
i'm still covered with my dad's health plan where he works
it would definitely be something to look into once i get my own
right now it's the
like everywhere else
here in pittsburgh the health care rates are going up pretty quickly
you are right
i really agree that that's pretty important
i guess the only real benefit i guess you could say working here besides
i'm in school
there's some weird law where student employees working for the government don't have to pay social security tax
that's about the only real bonus i have to take that into consideration when i evaluate how much i get paid real because if i was working somewhere else i'd have to pay an extra five percent
they've just raised the income caps on social security to the point where
if you could call it a benefit that c m u i-
the other thing that they allow you to do here while you are working is consult for other companies
that kind of helps out in terms of
keeping up-to-date with contacts in industry
in case you ever need to bail out
around here it's like
we pretty much work from project to project with different sponsors
there is not a whole lot of funded research from
i don't know exactly what's hot down in texas
that's about all i can feel apt to discuss with you since i just know
that's usually what's hot around here
what kind of music do you like
mostly folk music
i find myself listening to a lot of either old timer or new england dance bands as well as just more popular folk music and new artists coming up
we're on totally different wavelengths
i'm more old rock and roll some newer heavy metal rock and roll type van halen that kind of thing
what about classic rock type stations
i don't listen to the radio at all
classic rock for me is what i have which is doors eagles jimmy hendrix
some of the older eagles stuff was good
i didn't like
they started getting a little more
the type of music at least to me only sounds good at a high volumes
i don't like listening at high volumes
some of their older stuff was quite enjoyable to me
hotel california and that era
that's something doesn't even sound good loud really
definitely
anything new you like coming out now other than folk music some i might know of
down in texas listen to a little country every now and then
way more than i can stand down here
there's a conway twitty twang
then there's the dolly parton hollywood sound
that's even more commercialized country music
it's getting pretty big everywhere as i see it
i think some of them the artists are even hitting the pop charts
it's kind of strange that it's getting as big as it is
concert tours for country and western sings it's quite odd
i don't know
music is kind of going an odd direction nowadays i think
it's becoming not necessarily good music just popular music
i think most artists are in to make a few bucks
that's all it
they're not in it to say anything or give a message which is what they were do-
late sixties early seventies they were definitely pushing a message
that's what you say
music is wrapped around now
i don't think gun
at least to my mind guns and roses doesn't have too much to say
it's kind of odd
it's just who does it
you hear a paula abdul song
i think if somebody else were to play that everybody would think that's lousy
because she did it it's supposed to be good
it would be considered good because it's madonna
folk music would be huge just because madonna does it
it's really backwards how things are working now
it's the artist not the merit
i don't think that's a good thing at all
i don't know how much farther we can digress before we have to turn it around and go the other way at least
i don't know
i know for myself that for the most part i don't know which artist is which
i listen to a song
i don't like it if i really like the song eventually i'll figure out who it was
i don't know enough about it because i just listen
everything i listen to is what i buy not whatever they play on the radio
you have to figure out what to buy
do you just buy along the same artist
it's way to hectic and too confusing
you keep buying the same artists until you don't like an album then you stop
about the only new music i hear is somebody else that i know will buy something new that i haven't heard
i listen to it that way
as far as
that's one thing i like about some of the folk music scenes
there's a couple of nice small coffee houses up in new jersey
it's very nice
an artist is there
very often the artist will have an album
if you like the artist you buy the album
you definitely get to try before you buy
it
you don't always quite get it right
they're in a public school here in tyler
i'm happy with it
good curriculum
they have no problems
i do live in the best part of the city
i live in the real richy part i guess
everybody around me is
they're
their schools are kind of rundown and older
they don't really
i'm happy with what they're in
go ahead
it's pretty much what i was going to say
there's a lot of disparity between different neighborhoods and what sort of schools go in
i grew up in new york
the place
or not new york city upstate new york i went to the city of rochester school district a lot of my friends were in one of the neighboring suburbs
we weren't too far removed geographically from each other
the difference in schools i think was pretty substantial one of the things that probably would have been better is if the entire county had just one school system
that could result in more equitable distribution of money
what was happening was all the very rich people move out to the suburbs
the city had a very low tax base so they didn't have a lot of money to work with
there wasn't as many of the nice supplies in science class that we would have liked
there wasn't as many advanced placement courses when i was a senior that some other schools had
it
i think that one of the ways to help schools in general and get them all to a minimum level of competency almost would be to expand the size of school districts so you get a wider variety of people
the problem with that is then the rich people will either pull their kids out of the public school and put them in private schools or they'll move farther away
it's kind of you end up chasing like a dog chasing its own tail sort of
also the family environment
you can come to south tyler where i live
you have got room mothers in every room
you've got every holiday
all these kids have these really supportive parents always up there for something
the parents might not could even tell you what their kid's teacher's name is
that has a whole lot to do with it
as far as their learning if the parents aren't willing to go with the kids and find out what they're learning and if they're learning they really don't have much of a chance at all
they just don't
i'm up there at my kids' school
if they're up i call and find out
okay
i know kids that their parents could really give a rip
the kids are not motivated
they just go to school
eh i'll get through the day and bring homework home
there's nobody to sit them down and say you're going to do this
just they take a notion to do it
that doesn't work either
they can't just have it at school and then come home
there's nothing
i know that was a big factor for me
i ended up coming out of the public school system very well and was very good education
ended up getting some scholarships to go to college
which is really nice
i think the difference for me was that they were always there
was
that's the way
i had the brakes done on it
the reason i did that was because i don't have a scope
it has eight spark plugs
it's hard to get at them
i had an occasion to have to change the battery once
i was really surprised that the brakes
i know that the oil should be changed very regularly and all of the bearings
the lubrication system needs to be lubricated and
i stay on top of that
they wanted something like fifteen dollars a front or something like that
maybe it was thirty dollars to do it just to pack the bearings
what i found is that they had a brake job
the other thing i let them do some times is that i let them go through and let them do the diagnostics
i can decide whether i want them to do it or whether i can do it
they told me that my brake pads were gosh seventy percent still good
still it was cheaper in the long run
i just got the the brakes done
i thought that was a good deal
they repacked the wheel bearings
plus they repacked the the wheel bearings
i've had considerable experience
you might say i'm good back yard mechanic
i took auto shop in high school
i still have a pretty good feel for it
i had bigger cars
the brakes go out fairly rapidly on those
what i was surprised at is that on my little nissan i have almost one hundred and ten
i drove on those brake pads for forty-five thousand miles
there was hardly any wear to them
those small little trucks and cars like that the longevity of the brake pads is really good
they've gotten to the point that they don't weigh very much
the surface materials on the pads is so good
i just did it anyway
i like to stay up on it
i just kind of stay up on it
if you go and just about any point in time
it's not dirty
i keep it that way because that is the key to the longevity
how
it sounds like you've had some good experiences with that my experiences have been kind of contrary to that
i get a little more involved in the maintenance of my car
in fact i have an eighty-seven mustang with a three o two in it that i've beefed up a little bit one of the things that i did was to change the pulley system on it to use under drive pulleys so that the engine doesn't have to turn the accessories and can use more of the power to the rear wheels the only catch was the first set of under drive pulleys that i put on it were not even cast aluminum
there's three pulleys that you change
you change the crank pulley the alternator pulley and the water pump pulley
when i changed those over i put on these pressed aluminum things probably about four months ago the water pump decided to go out
in the process of seizing the belt spun on the pulley and wore through the water pump pulley almost all the way
i was on my way to work one day
the water pump pulley split laterally in half
the other half was kind of dangling off the end of the crank i
i'm from maryland
i have one son who's almost sixteen months old
are you married or
i have two children
i try to spend as much time as possible with them
what kind of things do you do
we do a lot of things with them
taylor my youngest is
my oldest is in school
she has a lot of school programs and things like that
was it a big change in your life to have a child
it's really nice
my husband is working most of the time
i'm just working a couple days a month
what do you do during those days
we spend a lot of time at the playground
we go to the zoo
we go
we wa-
you said you worked a couple days a month though
what do you do
are you
it's real easy to work out my schedule
to still stay in with that
and to have enough time to spend with matthew
he's just now really starting to get interested in a lot of things
my wife was
she worked part-time when my oldest was little
now she's staying home all the time
that worked out really well because it's a big transition i think to have children
to go from nothing
when you have children it doesn't work that way anymore
i think a lot of people are realizing that
still there are so many people that have their careers first
i think it's really hurting the kids
i think that my wife leaned that way
i'm really glad she did
i'm glad she's staying home
i know there are some days when she wishes she was back at work
that's why i like
i think
well that's why i'm glad my wife did too
she worked either two to three days a week
that got her out of the house
yet she'd get to spend three or four days with
we had started out like that
i think that was really ideal
then when you start having two of them it's a little bit tougher
are you from the maryland area
i've lived here forever
i live in germantown
where are you from
i'm in dallas texas
i've lived here like eight years or so
that explains
we do a lot of things on the weekends together the family
as far as during the week it's usually just my son and i
he works for coca cola
he manages a plant out here
it takes a lot of time
it
my wife did some teaching at a private tutoring place
that got me to be able to spend more time with the kids at night and stuff
'cause normally if they need something they just go to mom
i'm perfectly capable of doing it for them
we'd go to the library and do things like that
i know my husband was real
in the beginning when he was transferred to a larger plant
he works about an hour and a half away from our home
it takes him a little bit of time
i'm not able to work during the week because of that
i was working in the evening
he was coming home
i could go to work
their relationship when i was able to work in the evenings really grew
he
i think it really helped to have that time together
i think you grow closer
was your husband naturally a child
had he been around children
yeah
he has seven other brothers and sisters
we have thirteen grand
his parents have thirteen grandchildren
there's a lot of kids in the family
he really enjoys it
right now it's kind of a difficult time
the cost of living here is just so tremendously outrageous
it's difficult to do it any other way
i
it's hard because
then you're not getting to spend as much time at home
your husband is not getting to spend as much time at home as he'd want to
that's a tough situation
then again some
to get along too
at least i just consider myself blessed that i can stay home
like i said my wife normally feels that way
there are days when i come home and she says here take these kids
she's had about enough during those days
for the most part i've really feel like that's led
the way that we- jus-
like what you said with the cost of living and everything i think a lot of people can't afford to get by on just one salary and won't
i think that's tended to lead to a decline in families and family values especially
i really think that that's one of the problems the nation's facing that we need to do something about
i don't know what
i think the kids are where they need to
they need to really focus on the children in this country
would you have said that a couple of years ago do you think
i didn't even really think about it that much
i was vaguely aware of it
it wasn't really that important to me
it really does
just the whole
seeing how you really are forming the mind
in the next year or so you'll see so many instances where he'll mimic something that you've done
everything i'm doing he's learning from
you think if i wasn't here he'd be learning that from a baby-sitter or from a day care
that's how they're developing their patterns
i think a lot of people either don't care or don't realize it
they just put it in the back of their mind and let it slide
i've seen a lot of people just say he'll learn everything when he gets into
None
it
i know
even just this first year that i've been with my son here he's
of a difference it makes staying home with him
instead of
plus i think it becomes part of you too
you get to stay home
it's not just for him
it's also for you because you're both kind of bonding together there too i think
it's been nice talking to you
it's nice talking to you too
lynn do you want to start
i tend to take two kinds of vacations the vacations to visit family and the vacations to just have a week being cultural and going to the theater and doing sight-seeing and things like that
i couldn't live without the family vacations
my favorite is the indulgent ones where we go off and see places that have interested me since i was a kid
not anymore
they're moving to florida
that's one of those things
basically it sorts out into that
about once every three or four years i try to get over to england because i lived there for a while
i'd love to go back
it was
i'd really like to go because i'm fairly recently married
my husband has been hearing about these people for years
he's never met them
i'd like to do that
that's our typical vacation
we enjoy the family vacations
the other ones are very special getaways
we probably take one of each every year
we as you do take family vacations sometimes one a year
this year we're not going to be taking one for
vacations we really enjoy
i've never
we really love cruises
we've gone fairly inexpensive as most cruises go
we usually book just a month before it's ready to go
we get upgraded
last two times in fact we had an outside room
it was beautiful
we like not having to take our suitcase in and out of hotel rooms and drag it all around
what do you do on a cruise
my god you do everything
you can be as busy as you want to be or as laid back as you want to be
you can take part in the games that they have going on
they have a massage parlor
you can do anything
that's just aboard ship
when the ship docks you get to go sight-seeing and shopping
that's quite fun
where have you been on these cruises
nassau san juan saint thomas
we've gone with friends each time
we went to the western caribbean which is port cancun cozumel
the mexican coast
it was wonderful
we really like those
i guess we just like to go someplace entirely different
we've been down in texas eighteen years
like you we always try to make it back home to see the relatives
that's fun
things are different there though
i grew up in dallas
None
it's not like i'm going home
my parents retired first to san diego
they're going now to florida
they're going very nice places
i just grab the car and drive everywhere
that's great
it is nice
it's not home
i've never thought about a cruise
they really are
as i said we've done them three times
we'd be going again this year if circumstances hadn't changed
we'd probably go
my husband would
the minute i said the word he's chomping at the bit
i like all of that
we're going to be able to go up there
that will be nice
i'm kind of looking forward to that except i hate to see them go
don't go in the winter
that's what everybody says
i think it's
i think i'll try to stay away except my second grandchild will be born
that will be hard to stay away from
there are exceptions made for special occasions like that
the ordinary thing is to stay out of the north in the winter and get out of texas in the summer
that sounds wonderful
i guess i would contemplate going on a cruise all circumstances permitting it
there's all age groups too
that's kind of fun
if you sit at a table with a lot of people for your meals you meet different people
you may meet people thirty years older than you or younger
everybody is really interesting
everybody is there to have a good time
how long are the cruises
we've only gone on the seven day cruises
they have ten day ones
i think seven days is long enough for us
i think most vacations seven days is enough for us
that was pushing it a bit
i tend when i spend enough money to go overseas
that makes sense it really does
we went to panama too
that's interesting
we went with our daughter and son-in-law to visit his parents who live there
his father is a doctor
his mother is a kindergarten teacher
they took time off
they were having a little break
they took some time off that they could show us around
it is a beautiful country
it is gorgeous
it's just a gorgeous country
maybe now things are calming down again
we really hope so
that's really great
as i said basically all i've done is go back and forth to parents
that's pretty good
my husband had a conference in l a
we spent a week in l a
of course
do you like l a
i'm very unusual
it's funny when i tried
today i went to see regarding with henry
i'm dying to see that
we jeff wariner just got out of the hospital jeff and deeanna went and
we all liked it
we had both moms and fifteen year olds and a twelve year old
my goodness
everyone enjoyed it
i am just dying to see it
they said get a baby-sitter
we'll all go see regarding henry i said ooh i want to see it so bad
my son had gotten to see a lot of movies this summer on choir tour and visiting friends and one thing and another a lot of the ones i had wanted to see
since he had this friend up from houston and his friend had already seen so many and i thought they decided on this and i thought i want to see this one too
let me see
we went to see one hundred and one dalmatians last weekend
that may be
we won't
she goes all the time
i go maybe once every couple of months
when i go i go see two at a time
we went to see soapdish
was that good
hysterical
i want to see that and city slickers both
that's what i was
my face hurt so bad
course growing up on the back of a horse and being on ranches and stuff so much of that was so true
i was absolutely rolling in the aisles
good
i'm glad to hear that because they
they are
like i said with soapdish it is so cornball
it is so overacted that you're just hysterical
they just carried it off
i don't know if you got to see weekend at bernie's that was out a couple of year's ago
they had a free showing at the berkeley united artist
we didn't think we'd have much chance of getting in
we thought we'd try it free movie
it was so funny and it sounds like what you were just describing soapdish too
we hurt by the time we came out
the whole theater was hysterical
it's just goofy
it's
it should be out on t v i would think
cause it's just a fun summer light comedy
especially in the theater it was contagious i imagine the way soapdish was but with everyone laughing
gosh i never laughed
people were just screaming and applauding
it was just hysterical
i'm glad you did that before your surgery
me too because i don't even know if i could live through it now
i'm getting around real good
i'm just still real sore
today course i went back to work two weeks after i don't have permanent work
right now i'm working with a temporary agency
the second week i was out of the hospital i went up and worked half day on the computers cause you can learn all the software for free
i went up to do wordperfect cause that seems like that's what everybody wants
i was up there half a day and came home and collapsed
they called me to see if i wanted to work a day
i said yeah
i went
of course it took me the whole weekend to recover from that
i worked about three days a week ever since two to three days a week
i went to my doctors last thursday
this was my fourth week checkup
he said gosh you're just healing really well
he says i'm not going to say you're going to feel like playing ball
you can if you want to
he was teasing me
he says yeah
he says so you just take it easy for two more weeks
i said okay fine i will
whatever you call easy i'll do it
i'm real glad that we didn't go see those funny ones when i'm still sort of on the sore side
what's your next
that was one jay got to see
i to try and find time it's hard with jim's schedule too just to get a time that we can both go
i'm holding out for city slickers for the two of us because we had friends that went to see that and said it's just perfect for our age group
that's what he would have liked to have seen regarding henry too
knew that
we've got a lot of company this summer which is wonderful
some of the different things we're doing there's just not enough time to do it all
realistically
he knew he couldn't get them all in
jay really liked robin hood
when the choir group went to see backdraft and they thought it was funny cause he sounded like the critics
he said the plot line and the characters aren't real big
the fire scenes and that action part is fantastic
he thought robin hood was great
he enjoyed it
i went
i really like him a lot which is why dances with wolves was the last movie we had seen for several months
in fact a friend from germany was visiting in march
we wanted to take him to see it
i just thought that was terrific
i really enjoy harrison ford which is one of the reasons i wanted to see
he's very good in regarding henry
that's not an easy part to play i don't think
my kids are going to their dad's tomorrow night
i sort of think i may go do that
that one won't your sides
we went to the
are you a golfer
are you a spectator
i'm a
i don't actually play golf
i'm the same way
i go out there and hit the ball
in the carolina's it's just we've got a bunch of golf courses around here
i don't know
i'm not a serious golfer at all
a friend of mine goes golfing a lot
he drags me out every now and then
i don't really even have a game
when i go out and play golf it's usually like at one of these par threes that
you
i like watching it on t v
god a couple years ago i played two three times a week and got lousy
i thought i was really improving and the big break was going to come
i got worse again
if i can hit a great deal my friends
to get me they say i hit worm burners because i can't hit it up in the air
i'm pretty bad
i get great distance hitting it across the ground
if it's going over water or something one of them have to take the shot for me because i'm
i'm getting better
i've got where now i can hit it in the air some of the time
i'm kind of a novice at it
i'm that and worse
i play
i've been doing so bad
next year i'm starting over from scratch
i guess that's what i need to do is get some kind of lessons or something
my tee off is not bad
i'm good up to everything else putting and stuff like that
it's just that initial tee
i think i'm doing all fine
checking the ground and so forth
if you get down on the ground you really can
can you tell how fast you're going to hit it
you know if it's up on a slope that you've got to hit it not kill it
you've got to hit enough speed and the right angle that it's
you can feel that
i can get it within four or five feet or something
i don't have enough field
it just dies and rolls in
it's like i said
that tee shot it
when teeing off i'll go probably a hundred feet across the ground
it takes me awhile to get to the hole
you put it in
the t v golfers they do that
it's fifty percent
me it takes me five to get there and five to get it in
it usually takes me about probably two or three to get it there
that's according to the hole
it ju-
maybe one or two putts
the friends i play with they play all the time
they're really good
they're not joe pros
they golf in the high sixties low seventies
i guess they're pretty good
i'm usually in the eighties or nineties
i'm not good
when i'm in the nineties i'm feeling good
i can hit a great drives and think i'm going to do all awesome on this hole
it ain't going to happen
teeing off i either slice it
i hook it ever single time
i alternate
it's a good thing with me i slice it every single time
None
i think universal health insurance like national health like what canada has
is that what you're thinking the subject is about
did you read the article in the paper today about this particular subject
in the morning times
the state of washington and the state of minnesota is going to begin testing a state funded program for citizens of those two states
there's fourteen other states that are considering it least according to the article in the paper this morning
i think it's a trend that's probably may go nationwide eventually because i think national health is something that we all need
it's been interesting that we
we live in a society though where everyone if you ask them on polls will say that they think that everyone has a right to health care
yet i don't think we've ever quite decided who's really supposed to pay for it
that's the thing
unfortunately the ones that currently pay and pay the premiums for health insurance are paying for the people that don't have health insurance
i don't think you
through my company
i have been in a situation recently where i was laid off from a position as a sales manager of a company and was off work for about a year
my wife developed cancer
my goodness
it was a go to parkland type situation
because it was a life threatening situation it was very good
as it turned out one of the top doctors in the state that is involved in cancer treatment was at parkland
yet parkland is not free either
it's a situation that because i didn't have any insurance and i was on unemployment it was paid by the county
you did have a good experience
i was fortunate that there was parkland
no she passed away
it's very sad
in any event i'm in favor of national health
so am i
is that right
i'm really quite active in trying to be proactive at least for children's issues
it's very complicated
i strongly believe that all children have a right to immunization glasses hearing aids
when i grew up and
i grew up in south central kansas
my mom worked for the county health department
we had x-rays every year
we had a dentist come to our school and check our teeth once a year at least
we had all our flu shots taken care of our measles mumps rubella and all that other stuff
when my children were growing up we didn't have that
i'm sure that there were people that don't
so much has gone up so much
the cost of immunizations for example and just
i don't know
it is interesting
one out of every three children has nothing to reimburse them for their health care
i work in the children's parkland system
it's pretty overwhelming to me
it's pretty hard to be indigent and to be dependent upon indigent health care systems in dallas county
now what are your opinions on recycling
i definitely think that we need to start recycling
i think if we wait which is happening until somebody says we have to do it yeah
that is not too far away
i don't know how it is there
i can take plastic and paper bags back to the grocery store i can take plastic milk cartons or if they have water in them
there are some fire stations i can take newspapers to
that is very inconvenient cause i have to wait until i have enough of them to make the trip worthwhile
i started saving newspapers
i would take a ton of them i can't remember where i went to take them
they wouldn't take them
i don't know if you note even doing that the amount of trash we throw away is incredible
i know
it could be recycled
there is no place to
we have a pilot program in arlington going on i think in the north part of the city where they have people separate the trash as they put it out
i think that is what it is going to have to come to where we are just forced to
besides a law or whatever
that's how it is in new york isn't it
you get ticketed if you don't do it right
i think it is going to come to that because some people will just not go to the
it's trouble for me to do what i do i am willing to do it
you have to have a place to store all of it i live in an apartment
our garage is always full of sacks of newspapers
i don't know
also i have a real strong opinion
in iowa the state i am from i believe it has gone up to a dollar now
every time you buy a container no matter what it is whether it is glass whether it's a beer can or a fifth of whiskey or a pop or whatever you pay ten cents for it you take it back to the store
you get it back
that way it kind of forces you to recycle
you also don't see the litter there
i've just started drinking a new water called clearly canadian
i don't know if you've tried it they have on the ba- that they pay five cents it even shows the states that
some of them are five some are ten cents
texas is not one of them
i have to throw them away cause there is no place to take glass
i work at j c penny at their corporate headquarters
we have a paper recycling program that is company wide
i do the recycling for that
do they save the paper they use at the office paper
i know there is a lot of computer paper that you can't use
we use to have
i don't even remember the money that they've made from the recycling program
they have made a substantial amount of money from it
something else i think we can do is support companies that encourage
i have decided downy fabric softener now has where you can buy a little carton you add wa-
i image everybody else will start doing that sooner or later
i am going to stick with downey because they were first
i want them to have my business
i think packaging could be done much better
i know
when they come out with the new things you are like why didn't you think of that before
i think that it's just people have got to be aware
they don't want to think about it
i just look at it i don't want my grandchildren looking at me and saying why didn't you do something
i want to feel like i at least tried
i don't know
do they not ever burn trash or anything like
there were no
that doesn't do me any good because i don't have any place to burn it
just like the glass bottles that it says on the bottle i can get ten cents but not in texas
there is no place i can take glass to
i still throw away a lot of glass
the packaging thing really grips me
it's got a great big piece of cardboard and a great big piece of plastic
i myself am not in favor of drug testing in the work place except in this very specific examples such as transportation workers as in air traffic controllers bus drivers and that kind of thing
i don't really
i think it's a severe invasion of somebody's privacy to say we're going to look at your urine and then decide whether you're worthy of working for us
i really don't see that that's a very valid thing for a company to say
personally i don't think i would work for somebody if they were going to reject me on the basis of what's inside my body
i guess i basically agree that
suppose they found out some other way
i think the problem here is that a drug test does not necessarily imply that someone is taking drugs or not taking drugs
there's too many cases where it can
there can be false positive results and that sort of thing
i don't think there's any definitive
we don't want him here
like i said some industries though i think it'd be very necessary
i find it to be pretty offensive that it's such a big deal
if your employer's not going to trust you
it
i think it's a whole trust issue
have you ever been in a situation where you were drug tested
i was very offended by the whole process
it's very humiliating
i'm not speaking in favor of drugs or against drugs
i am totally against that sort of a
it's a pretty personal thing when somebody says i want to look at your urine before i'm going to talk to you
i just thought it was dumb of the company at a point where they were trying to convince me to want to work for them to do this
i'm just like
that's basically my opinion on it right there is that it's just
i was in the same sort of situation as
you had a physical where you were drug tested
i know people who have been drug tested and who have not been hired by a corporation which
the other side of it is besides its being an invasion of personal privacy it's my bodily fluid
i don't really want you to look at it or something pretty basic like that
i mean during the eight hours during the day when they're supposed to be there i think they have every right to say these behaviors are acceptable and these are not
when it enters into what they're doing when they're not at work i find that to be fairly offensive also
like you say if it's not a critical kind of job where someone could get hurt then really the employer ought to be judging you on how well you do your work rather than on these other factors
if you are doing drugs and it's causing a problem then they'll notice it for other reasons
also i just think it gets a lot
i'm a big supporter of personal freedoms and personal privacies
i think that it just moves down along a line that i really would find bad if most people went down that line into regulating employees' lives outside of work
we're not going to hire you if you smoke
i can see how they can say in the work place you don't want them to smoke
when somebody leaves work i don't think that it's the employer's right to regulate their life style at all
do you think it's should be illegal for an employer to do this
i really think it should be except as i've mentioned twice now in the specified industries or jobs because there are certain things where it's just vital that a person is clear minded at all times
other than that i do not think it should be allowable
i think it should be illegal for them to want to do that
it's kind of the big brother syndrome
i just
i tend to view it
even though i don't think i'd work for a company that did that i sort of want to defend an employer's rights in addition to an individual's rights
an employer really i think has the right to hire someone on any basis they want to if they say they don't want smokers i sort of feel like an employer should have the right to decide whether they want to allow that
i don't really
i do take care of pretty
i embarrassed to say it's pretty trivial
all i do is keep a list of things like debts that are outstanding and every two or three months update that and every once in a while make a list of what we spent that month
i doubt i do it more than three times a year
yet i do everything on paper
i don't even use a calculator for the stuff i'm doing because it's all pretty round numbers
mine is really simple because i got all our bills paid off when he was a marine
while he was gone i got all of our bills paid off
really the only bills i have is rent utilities insurance
they come in
that's it
that's about the extent of it
i'm real thrifty
i take care of two children and me and just real careful with the money what little we have
that's what i do
i can't imagine having to go into real complicated stuff and making fancy budgets
it seems like if you're getting to that level you're not in real good control
i've never liked credit cards and a lot of debt
you pay twice as much for it when you get done
i like using credit cards for everything but just paying off the bills because that way it's a record of everything
i don't have to worry about keeping
i don't have too many weaknesses
i found out a credit card was one of them
it's so much easier if something's on sale if you're a woman and you're a sale person
it's like it's on sale
let's go grab it
if you don't have the money then use a credit card
i got rid of them credit cards
yeah i guess if that's a weakness that's a good thing to do
i didn't have thousands of dollars and like that
i just learned that that wasn't for me
i self-employed
i keep
i just keep it in a notebook and write down what i've made and what it's going to have to go for that month
it's not that hard not at all
that's good to know
i always do my own income tax
i don't understand the idea of paying somebody to do it
all you got to do is read the little book they send you fill in the blanks and go
a lot of them
it seems absurd that people will pay some bucks just to get someone to
i don't
i don't mess with it
i don't use a calculator either
i don't have that many things to add up
i don't trust myself with using a calculator or computer too much stuff like that because i want to make sure that i keep on top of the numbers and understand what's going on
we have a
it seem
they have a number that you can call in
i always call in once every other week or so
i will check off what checks have cleared
i always check them off and check my balance and my book because i always want to know exactly what i have
what are your views on capital punishment
texas has one of the biggest criminal justice systems in the country
it's eating us alive budget wise
are they currently practicing capital punishment in your state
the nature of the courts and the appeals and the stays and all that means that it's a very long haul before anybody's ever executed
i was reading in the paper just this morning that it costs more to execute somebody than it does to keep them
because of all the costs of the appeals and all that
i guess in a way that it kind of defeats the purpose of having capital punishment if
i think capital punishment is supposed to be primarily a deterrent to other people
who would see it
i'm not sure how successful that is
i think it would be more successful if it was applied in a more expedient manner if there weren't so many appeals
if the person who's going to commit the crime knew that they were going to be punished severely possibly capital punishment
what kind of work do you do
i'm a research engineer
i work with georgia tech
i'm a school principal
in a very poor section of town with predominantly anglo kids
i see kids already that are going to be criminals in spite of everything we can do
i'm afraid i think if we would take the equivalent amount of money and invest it in young people that
course you couldn't do that because you got to do something with the ones that are already there i think we would make a bigger investment in kids
that's probably true
down the road
i guess there's other factors that
pumping more money into the school system is a good thing
it's not going to
i'm not talking about just in the school system
i see
i'm talking about
in
i'm afraid i think that there are kids who just ought to be taken out of their homes and reared
i know the institutions don't work that well
it's a bad day because
i have the same thirty-seven in my office every day
a lot of their parents are totally irresponsible
that's a difficult situation
you just see those kids going down the road
not all of them will commit offenses that have to do with capital punishment
some of them have already been in youth centers
if we had something to do before they get to be full-blown adult criminals
i'm not talking about necessarily in the school system
i think that's one reason we have problems in schools
some of them are our problems
a lot of it's because everything society wants we are supposed to do
that's another subject
that's probably true
i dealt with two or three kids today that are going to end up where somebody making a decision what to do with them
there's no easy solution for that
i don't know that there is an easy solution
if you could find a way to prevent some of it
i don't
i'm for it in some cases
what kind of crimes would you use it for
premeditated murder
i would consider it for sexual abuse of children on going
not one instance but perpetual abusers of children
you always have castration
somebody elected that recently
all the civil rights people are up in arms about it
i used to work in a day care center
i worked in all the different areas of the day care center
i did not work there long because i couldn't handle the treatment that the children got
this is supposed to be a very well-known center here in tyler who had two or three centers
all over the city
they would be one way when the parents were there and be another way when the parents left
i think if you do day care centers you should make frequent checks to check in on them when
because they do things differently when you're not around
the things that we kind of looked at is you want to see how many teachers you have
and how many kids they have and how they break it up
None
it was a really good one
in fact it worked out for us because we kind of bartered
we got our day care free
they didn't have enough teachers
this one was set up good
they had two teachers to every room sometimes three
they had a good system so when you walked in everything looks cool
the owner came and just chewed me up one side down the other
i said no
this child was crying and needed some comfort
did they separate them by age group
i think that's one thing that was important
they had the babies that didn't walk in one room
then they had the three year olds upper fours lower fours upper fives lower fives just like that
they really did separate them well
it sound
it sounds like to me your concern would be to make sure that they are loving people
affectionate people that they're may be parents themselves or something
their system was great
None
the one woman that did the babies i worked with her
she was fabulous
she loved them and cared for them
every one of the others that i saw was just screaming and yelling and would make me a nervous wreck
None
i think that's probably a really important thing because you can have doctorates and p h d's and all that kind of thing and know all the technical stuff
if they don't reach out and touch the kids then that doesn't do any good
these kids are just in a day care center all day and with any type of emotional getting care
going through this routine
the other group that we had was kind of interesting
the other one we went to it was a husband and wife team we knew them from other associations
it was kind of interesting because she was kind of the strict one
i think she'd put her arm around the kids and talk to them and stuff
he was actually the more demonstrative type
he would laugh with the kids and play with the kids
it was kind of interesting to see that it was actually the man in the group that did that side of it
they had a really nice balance
they also did some of the teaching things
they had
obedience was important
i think they used the
you probably heard where you stand in front of the clock and get your power back to control yourself
that's a new one
it's one
i can't remember what they call it actually
you just stand them in front of a clock
it has a second-hand that goes around
they have to stand there
do we
it all depends really on what kind of bracket you're in
my tax bracket is pretty high up there
i generally pay the maximum tax bracket
i think that we're paying too much
i don't have any children
i pay a lot of property taxes
None
None
there's so many people who want a dib of the federal money or the state money or whatever it is
i just
many times i end up feeling like i'm paying too much in taxes
no
i'm a student
i work as a co-op at georgia tech research institute
i'm going to get back most of what i pay in taxes
None
one of my parents is still claiming me
when you go out into the working world it changes quickly
you look at your paycheck
you go my gosh where did it all go
what kind of
have you pay a lot of in ta-
did you go directly from high school into college
i did work for some time
i didn't make enough money to really
have you been active in politics concerning this
have you worked on political action committees or something like that
i haven't done any of that type of work myself
every once in a while when i hear up here in d c area one of the radio stations has been talking about the congress
i guess it went defunct recently
one of the congressmen has written in the last three years about a thousand bad checks
we the taxpayers float him a loan for all those bad checks
it's causing quite a stir up here
i think we pay too much
i look at my paycheck
i make
let's see
they charge me sales tax
they charge me gasoline taxes
they charge me all these others
it's just too expensive
i'm just thankful that i don't get all the government that i pay for
have you used student loans and things like that that were guaranteed by the government
my father pays for my tuition
i haven't made use of that
that sounds like a fun field
are you in the particle research or
is it more applied physics
i haven't gotten too terribly much into my major yet
i guess you could call it more straight stuff than applied
maybe you can figure out how we can stop this inertia that's
are we pretty steep compared to most countries
like europe
they do have socialized medicine and things like that
i know i was reading in the paper i believe yesterday that they're talking
maybe it was on the radi-
here in indiana we pay county income tax state income tax
you name it they tax it
you get the whole smorgasbord
i actually live in new hampshire tax free or die
i'll bet that means your state sales tax is pretty high
they hit me up for the five percent there
we
the problem is that i'm paying state tax even if i don't live here
at least on things like stock options and things like that they don't tax me
that's not too bad
i really think that here in indiana at least we pay just too much tax
i worked in a factory last summer
on the average i was losing twenty percent of every paycheck to taxes
i don't feel that i really get a whole lot of return from that
i don't utilize any government welfare services
i went to the schools and stuff
i really feel that i'm just getting overtaxed
i'd consider twenty percent lucky because when you figure out just on feds i actually hit the thirty-one bracket this year which was no fun
that's not any fun
also then you figure out seven or eight percent for f i c a which is taxes where you
most people forget about them because you can't always get your f i c a back at the end of the year
a five percent surtax i'm paying forty percent tax
a lot of it
if you look at the way the government is run these days it just seems like a lot of it's going to waste
i think there certainly are some things where you need infrastructure
you n-
there are things government does better
i think you look at things like tax subsidies to tobacco farmers because jesse helms wants it that way
just tremendous amounts of
so much of it is now just going to service debt or is going into programs that
they are a fat
i think the military is really fat
i think that a lot of the h e w services although they're providing necessary services have too much fat in them
there is just way too much bureaucracy
we
so much of that tax money is going just to keep that bureaucracy running keep the paper shuffling around instead of real good programs
we spend a fortune for things like v a hospitals
then you look at how well they're managed
i don't think we're getting our money's worth out of there
i think it's all going into bureaucrats
a lot of it's feeding that
i'm really thinking a lot
it seems like everything is really screwy right now as far as the government goes and our whole economy in general
our taxes just are going to keep rising no matter what happens
especially when you've got the bush administration who has increased government expenditures beyond what any other president since world war two has done
yet he supposedly
between him and reagan
yeah
i just read something that two thirds or three quarters i'm not exactly sure of our national
they go and say i'm not c-
the other thing is it's tricky though
like in new hampshire they say all right let's cut the military budget
it's very tricky to balance that stuff off because then you hurt
if people lose their jobs then they become a load
they're not contributing taxes
it's very hard to say this is what we should cut
especially cuts in the defense is really a catch twenty-two double whammy because like you say if you cut defense that's great
then you're going to have people on welfare
they're not putting taxes in
that's really
in our
what's very funny is in our town meeting they were v-
this guy both for our school district meeting and our town meeting had this proposal which unfortunately violates new hampshire constitution for our local town to have people line item their taxes
i guess i can start
we're actually trying to find one now because our family's growing
i'm looking at something larger than what we have
we've got an eighty-four charger that's about gone and an eighty-nine horizon
i'm looking for something bigger
we were thinking mini van for a while
we're looking at some just four door five passenger sedans as well
you open to buying foreign cars
i don't really have a preference either way i guess
it
i haven't had any real substantial problems with the ones i've had
i really like it a lot
i think the japanese really build good cars i know that kind of rubs against the grain right now in the whole buy american keep american auto workers working right now
i feel that the japanese have really produced a much higher quality product than our car manufacturers have for a while
if i were to buy another car i would be partial to buying another japanese car
i would also look at american cars
when i bought the car that i bought now i did that also
i just felt that the japanese car was a much better product
if i were
even if it's just details it seems like they
there's a door seal that doesn't quite seal
you have to take it back every once in a while
it's clearly just a design problem there
i'm kind of
i don't need a mini van or such to
i'm looking for more a two passenger car that
like a miata or something like that
i like the miata
i don't like it enough to buy it
the car that i really like right now is an eagle talon which is an american car
something along that lines
i have an economy car right now which is okay
i think i'd like to move on to something a little better
i guess probably the factors we'd use to compare are a little different because i look for size and safety and then mileage
i was looking for dependability and something that was going to last a long time for the money that i was going to spend that i would get a return that was worth that money
i think in terms of computer terminology i look at price performance and things like that
it depends on what you pay initially
i've got a hundred and twenty-five thousand miles on the charger
it was my wife's car that she brought into the marriage
she got just a commute between cincinnati and dayton
it's
we had to replace the friction plate and the transmission at thirty thousand miles
the other ninety four thousand have been just fine
None
i've had one or two american cars i think
they were okay
i never had a problem with it
my mother had a dodge at one point
i had driven it a few times
i really did not feel that i would buy a dodge
actually i had a dodge omni at one point that was i think what really prejudiced me against american cars because i did not feel that it was a very quality car
i guess you'd have to say if i was looking i would definitely be looking for a foreign car
it's hard to beat some of the
i guess in particular we're looking at a ninety-one corsica buy back at a they say g m sponsored auction
i think they're obliged to have these things because hertz and avis and those folks have it in their contract that they can sell it back to g m after they've used it for six months and put twelve or fifteen thousand miles
you can get those for eight thousand bucks if you
i guess
ninety-two's granted but the new ones fourteen to sixteen is what they go for on the lot
all the depreciation has been taken off
the dealer comes out okay
i don't know what kind of hit they take on it
sounds like everybody's had their chance to make their money off it
it's just
we can get a caravan at twelve five that's a little bit more than we want to spend right now
it's interesting
i don't know
if it seems to be
julie are you in a situation where you'd soon need to deal with special care for elderly
i don't know
he is still living by himself
he doesn't want to move away
he recently had to have an operation
he just really doesn't want to go to a nursing home
is he able to still do everything himself pretty well
he was until this operation
now i don't really think he's doing that well
a lot of my aunts and uncles live near him
i have one aunt that really looks after him a lot
my great-grandfather was put in a nursing home when he was a hundred and three
died six weeks after they put him in the home
i'm sure that kind of thing would influence grandfather's feelings
for i'm sure a lot of people going into a nursing home it's like saying my life is over
i'm just here for the rest of the stay
None
yeah they can look after a lot of things
there's some of the day-to-day needs that they just are not able to deal with physically anymore
i know none of my grandparents were in a nursing home
they died
they were all goodness younger than your grandparents
they were in their eighties that type of thing
when i think nursing home i do think of people that are not able to take care of themselves physically
i just don't think that nursing homes really do a very good job
i think what they often get used as is almost like a very high level or long-term care similar to a hospital
a level four type of care would be someone that really requires long-term hospital care generally are not able to look after themselves to a very great extent physically
i don't
at least i think some nursing homes do that
i think a lot of nursing homes really are guilty of neglect
i think it happens more in areas where it's
i guess that's sort of my lack of understanding
i think that a majority of the places in the u s there is some government aid available
the majority of it is to the availability of the individual to pay
if you're not able to look after yourself then you have to rely
recently graduated from high school meaning like three or four years ago
i'm a senior in college now
i can't really talk too much about
i feel that my
i go to tech georgia tech
i want to talk to you about that afterward
the high school i went to was a good one also
i guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools
the one i went to was i'm sure a lot nicer than a lot of the inner city schools and the things around atlanta
it's a more or less a suburban school system
that was true for mine too
although i
i honestly don't think that's the biggest part of it
i know that in my town most of the parents they're valued education
the students were to some extent motivated to
i
i'm also in those places where the economy is really bad they might be more tempted to quit school and get jobs and that kind of thing because they need the money to put food on the table and stuff like that more than they would
now i think maybe it's started changing in the past few years because they have these sort of
certainly before that there were people that would graduate from high school and could barely read
that's just sort of inexcusable
you can't really
i just can't even picture how that could happen
except maybe to someone whose really badly learning disabled or something
these people obviously
that's hard for me to say since i didn't really grow
when i went to elementary school it wasn't in a great area
started learning to read when i was in kindergarten
i guess i can't say what it would be like to grow up in a really oppressed region
i guess the whole environment and attitude towards school and learning is different for the people
i think that's almost a bigger factor
i think people just
i guess the thing to do is to try to get some kind of motivation to learn
again i don't
they got to know how qualified
i think it'd be interesting to spend a couple of days just looking around an inner city school sort of maybe from elementary through high school
just sort of to get a feel for what it's like
i haven't done that
i can't say that i have either
i do think that public education in general i think can work
i think it's a good thing
i've heard statistics and things that compare a public education to a private education within the
if you compare the people that could have sent their kids to private schools and the people that did send their kids to private schools
i think they compare fairly well
i honestly don't really think i could have done much better than i did in the school system i was in
my schools there
once it seemed i got into high school they had a lot of accelerated programs and all kinds of stuff like that
that makes a big difference
i wondered when they're taking classes with people that are interested in the subject and stuff like that
in the
i guess in junior high it was still three
then in high school it changed into four levels of instruction in the major subjects
actually i think that works pretty well
that makes
i feel like i am from mars
i'm fifty years old
i've been divorced for eighteen years
i've two kids and all
i've never had a budget
i don't do any planning
i don't know
i don't have a long-term financial plan
i'm glad you're a stranger
really i'm curious how other people live
maybe we should start with you
we live from hand to mouth
they worked
i'm not disciplined enough
the best program we ever had is at the beginning of the month we took my check and divided it out into envelopes and then paid for the expenses out of that envelope
when the envelope was empty
that worked out real well cause we didn't have to keep writing down what we'd spent
we did that pretty successfully for about three months
we started
in about two months we were back to doing the same thing we always do
the
i had a part-time job around gosh fifteen years ago seventy-six
this was a sort of a career shift at the time
i was willing to take a half time job to do that
i actually did
my bank account would
i kept bouncing checks just at the end of the month
i had miscalculated
i didn't keep a balance
when you're only earning half the salary even though i wasn't spending much money i sometimes would just
sometimes what i would do is keep a piece of paper in my wallet
every time i spent money cash mostly i would write it down so i could see at the end of a month how much i spent on food so i could do better planning
i would forget to write the things down
i don't know if i ever went as far as three months or not
i even find now with the automatic tellers i'll go take money out of that i forget to take that
i leave a little bit of a slush fund in my checking account so the balance showing in the checking account is always somewhat different that what's really there
i figure that gives me room for the mistakes i make
i have to say that
it
i don't
i think my strategy if i may is to not spend money
i don't have expensive tastes
i buy a car
the last car i got rid of i'd had
people were embarrassed for me
it was a good car
it was great
my mechanics loved it because it was a sixty-five buick
it just wouldn't stop
it
i just didn't feel the need for a new car
now i don't
i don't mind buying a good steak
for me i only do that every week or
maybe once a month
you buy a tenderloin steak it costs outrageous twelve dollars a pound
you buy a less than half a pound so it's six or seven dollars
i'm just saying as a single person that's a drop in the bucket
if you're extravagant on how you buy food it doesn't add up if you're not going to super expensive restaurants which i don't care to go to
so that's i think one of the reasons i don't need to budget is that i don't have to hold myself back from buying that expensive thing because i can't afford it because i'm not interested in that expensive thing
one of the things they talked about was what do we think about a judge making the decision
i really don't agree with that
i think that the trial by jury is better having a
you know what i mean
this topic is kind of mute there's no way
we couldn't survive in a trial system without a jury
one man one woman can never be objectionable in every case
every person has their opinions
that's why jury selection is often very difficult
i feel the other thing too
they were saying what new ways could it change the system
i really think that we spend a lot of time going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal
if you go to a trial by jury and especially if a person has confessed if they have been caught point blank in the crime
there's no question
all these things
None
it can go on for ten twenty
i think this is a little ridiculous
that's right
i'm serious
i think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems that exist in the criminal system today with plea bargaining
if someone is ill
plea bargaining is a different story
that actually prevents trials or at least speeds them up
i know
i think all of the whole criminal system is messed up in that regard
people who commit crimes that they
they get lesser sentences
i understand that the jails are full of people and that they have to do something
i think that the reason they are full is because they know that they can get away with it
you know what i'm saying
that a lot of states don't have capital punishment
i think they should
i think if a person is guilty of taking someone's life and like you say there's no doubt whatsoever like drunk drivers that kill people
all they're caught dead to rights
i just think that they've taken a life
they should pay for it with their life
when you're saying as far as the appeal procedure was concerned
i'm sure you've probably heard of marion berry
his last appeal was denied two days before his sentence was up
his appeal was denied
two days later he got out of jail
i know that
there was no reason the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence
i don't know
what would you do to change it to make it better
the only i wa-
like i said as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence that's absurd
i don't agree with that at all
burned out
there's no possible way that you could feel good about yourself
i feel that everyone is entitled to a trial by jury
that right s-
supposing i come up to you and i just point blank kill you
were there witnesses
in other words you're saying that you have to find out whether it's premeditated or what the circumstances were
that you can't remove the jury regardless of the case
you could have fifty people in audience watching
there's still mitigating circumstances
i
the latest one i've seen had to do with basically a manhunt
it was called manhunter actually
the guy apparently had a mental disfunction in which he needed to go out and just slay people just kill them with as much blood and guts as possible
how awful
it did show some interesting things about the f b i
the characters trying to get him were f b i people
of the few good things that were in it it did show a lot about the f b i about the training and how they go through training and how they try to develop a mental picture of who they're looking for before they go out and do it and all the different ways they go about doing that
it was pretty telling about the f b i and their procedures
i imagine a lot of it had to be fictional just to keep the f b i going i guess
they keep it rather secretive
the most recent movie i saw i'm afraid was
two of them actually
the rain man was one
that was great one
i loved it
and driving miss daisy
i haven't seen that one yet
i need to go see it
you need to see that
this all took place in the south
normally never the twain shall meet
it really was a fantastic movie
as i recall it got some academy awards didn't it
it might have one best picture too
just as rain man with dustin hoffman
that was tremendous and tom cruise
i think it was more a lesson for tom cruise than anything else in terms of how to act from dustin hoffman
that was what much of the hype was that tom cruise learned so much from dustin hoffman
it must have been great just being with him on a daily basis and seeing how he prepares for his lines and all that stuff
a good bit of that was filmed right in cincinnati
which is just forty-five miles from where i actually live in a suburb of dayton
is the kmart there
that was so funny
was it kmart
the first scene in that movie that really got my attention concerning the disease and all that was when he dropped the the toothpicks
he was able to count the number of toothpicks just by a mental image
there are people referred to as savants also
who can do most phenomenal things
everyone feels they are totally retarded
that's the way they might seem outwardly
boy there's a lots going on in there
i think the best thing about rainman was the way that they put together the real awfulness of the disease
they balanced it with the wonderfulness of it
you need to work with it certainly on a daily basis but then again work with it toward a good end
not toward winning in las vegas for example
the warmth that developed between them
again it i think was a picture of relationships
again the relationship between the two that never would have occurred by accident
i was so impressed with that movie
i can tell you so much about that movie just because it really rang a lot of my personal background
i have a brother myself that's older
he's not
nothing of course serious is wrong with him
we have gone through these lapses of a relationship
for no real direct reason i guess we get into a really good relationship for a while and then back and forth
i was really able to relate to the relationship aspect of the movie between the brothers
that's tremendous
it's good because it does make you think about your own family
it did bring out a lot of thoughts between you and your brother
he's one of these guys though that doesn't really like to go see movies like that
it was like pulling teeth to go get him to see it
boy he gave the best response that i've heard him give of this type of movie for rain man
he certainly didn't
he didn't go back for more
he said he enjoyed it
he at least saw it one time
he really
he's kind of a dustin hoffman fan anyway
before he saw the movie he was disappointed that dustin hoffman would do this
i'm like come on
he will do that to research it and to be able to mimic a person with the kinds of problems that he had
i was believing it
it was great
i'm sure everybody that saw it was believing it right along with them
it's just been delightful talking with you
let's hear it for the summertime
they're predicting some more snow for our direction
take care
i subscribe to the paper on the weekends
where are you
i take the paper every day i read it on the way in to work in a carpool
actually i watch the morning news before i leave for work
usually over lunch there'll be a big topic of conversation on something from the news
i normally find that i'm probably the most news hungry of my friends
we don't normally talk about the news at lunch
i find that i have to only subscribe to the paper on the weekend simply because i used to get it during the week i would always end up arriving at work late because i would always end up skimming the headlines spending too much time
i have to cut myself down to the weekend plus after work
the macneil lehrer news hour is on public television i enjoy that quite a bit
one of the women that i work with her husband is iranian
here lately with all the middle eastern news we've had some very interesting conversations over lunch
i will admit i work with someone who's iranian
he definitely has a very different slant on the news
i will admit i'm reasonably skeptical also
he's much more so
it's sort of interesting though because he does bring a much different perspective with all the gulf goings on
he was always speaking in terms of american imperialism reasserting itself
i suppose it's a different attitude that we normally don't hear in the country
i like the print news much better than the television news because television news tends to sensationalize
sort of like the a b c's nightline
i guess they only normally stick with just the one story
they can do a much better job since they don't have to chop it into little two minute stories
they don't report on every murder and shooting that happened in every little town
a lot of times they end up with these panels of experts
they go back and forth where everyone's giving some opinions
sometimes that
i don't know the value of that because i saw plenty of jokes and editorial cartoons about all the retired generals
i'm only twenty-five
i've never actually been through a period of war i don't know anyone in the military
i don't have a lot of background knowledge in military strategy and weaponry and all that kind of stuff
i thought the generals were very interesting
when they started to speculate i saw that for what is was
i thought they were interesting
they shed some light on what was going on for me
i'm twenty-six
i don't have any more experience in that than you
it was very interesting that it seemed like some of the commentators had their axe to grind
they seemed to mold the events to their view of the world which i suppose just about everyone does
these guys had a national soap box to stand on and express this view
one of the best television news shows that i saw during the war was a show on a saturday morning on a b c
it was for children it was hosted by peter jennings
it was so interesting because they were relating the war to these children in their studio
they also had children calling in live from all over the country and asking questions
they had all their correspondents in the different areas in saudi arabia and israel and all
they had them all on
they had them all on hold if a child asked a question that the person in jerusalem could best answer they would cut to that person
that person would answer the question
i was real impressed at how a b c handled translating
i didn't see anything like that although i did
there was a big push with the local t v stations to have little hot lines with counselors to help parents learn how to talk about their war with their children
our local h e b stores here
they have videos that
they were free rental
it was
it was something for children that they had several advertisements on television pushing parents going and getting the video and watching it with their children and discussing it and that kind of thing
again not having lived through another war i don't know if that's a common thing that people thought of
if that was a new concern with people
back during the viet nam conflict that no one will have the guts enough to call a real war that type of technology just wasn't at people's disposal
i don't think there's ever been a war that's been so thoroughly covered by the news
they would run these extended two three hour versions of the program i was horrified and fascinated
the war start-
must have been thursday
friday night i stayed up until two o'clock in the morning sitting right dead center in front of my television just watching practically with my mouth hanging open
i was watching c n n
they would switch back to one of their israel bureaus
the people would be standing there in gas masks
you'd be hearing the sirens
it was just
i didn't have that experience
i don't have cable i'm pretty much limited to p b s which i thought they did a very good job
i've got one question for you
i found the newspaper situation in dallas very interesting
we've got the one relatively weaker paper the times herald and then the morning news which has a very strong subscription
do you have several
they're pretty close
the one that i picked is more similar in format to the newspaper
i grew up near houston there are two major newspapers there that run pretty much neck and neck
the one i picked here had the same format as the one that my parents took as i was growing up the same type of typeface on the headline and that kind of stuff
i enjoy
the other one has some weird ones that i've never heard of
i actually take both newspapers on the weekends
i can afford that
i find the news reporting in the morning news to be better
i sort of have a liberal political slant
the morning news just has an incredibly conservative editorial outlook
my fiancee takes probably six sunday papers
he's a football coach at southwest texas state university
he's getting all the sports sections
he has these stacks of sunday newspapers that go unread
i know that they have capital punishment for certain crimes
that's probably the way i feel about it
my belief all my life i guess has been
i don't
i tend to agree with you
i do also myself believe in capital punishment
if it's premeditated or if it's
that's kind of the way i feel
if you've got a guy
he's not going to get any better
None
the only thing
a lot of people have the opinion don't have capital punishment
give them life in jail
i could go along with that if i could be assured that it would be their natural life in jail and not parole after ten
they wind up
it's just
the problem is not
the cops are out there doing their job enforcing the laws
the prison system are just
a lot of people don't think it would be a deterrent to future crime
the way it is now it's not
you
the state of texas for example may execute somebody twice a year
that's no kind of deterrent because we've got literally hundreds of people on death row and many of them who have been there for literally for ten or fifteen years on death row
that's certainly no kind of deterrent
i would tend to agree with anybody who says right now that it's not a deterrent because it's not
you think of your chances of getting the death penalty after committing a crime
you can
that's where a lot of aggravation comes i think is these guys spend so much time
the last i heard it was costing ten twenty thirty thousand dollars a year
it's amazing
there's a girl i work with our secretary as a matter of fact
her father was murdered her father and three other guys up here in sherman
the guy that they tried and convicted and sentenced him to death he's been on death row for like eight years
this was her father that got killed just cold-blooded murder him and three other people
still
the state still can't bring itself to execute
to carry it out
it really does
she and they have to go back
occasionally she has to write letters to the parole board and lawyers
just ever so often she mentions she's got to do something else write another letter
she should be getting on with her life getting that part behind her
yet it's kind of tied to her the way it is now
she winds up being a victim
not only
it's ridiculous
she's an emotional victim
it's terrible
like you say the cops that are out doing the work
man i couldn't be a cop for that very reason because they do
the criminal gets right back out
the cop's just got to go back and do his thing all over again because so many of the crimes are done by repeat offenders
unless you've got something else
it's an older home
for the neighborhood i'm in
i live in the basic three bedroom two bath home
at least i have two bathrooms
it's pretty typical for the area as well
i've always been interested in older homes personally
i think you can end up doing more with them it seems like
do you have a big lot or anything like that
i see
that's nice
i have just those basic tract houses like that
i do have garden
it's extremely small
it seems like though for your area that is sort of different
in the newer neighborhoods and development communities the houses are so close together
one thing we have that we really enjoy here is we have a hot tub in the back
we have quite a few parties
seems like everyone that lives around us ends up hearing every conversation that goes on outside with everyone
that's true
it's fine for now
it's very difficult to arrange furniture and things like that
it seems like then that they built the homes much larger
they've got better closet space
at least we do have three walk-in closets here
that's maybe not so typical
you get those visa bills in
anything else about
can you compare yourself to any thing around there
it's
i got probably the biggest
too the only bad thing too is that then you have to keep up
i enjoy that though
you must have more time than i have
i'm looking at the yard and seeing how tall the grass has gotten
now that's
i almost wish i was in an apartment or something
i don't know do we just terminate this or do you have to talk for a certain amount of time
can you tell me anything else about the house
do people around that area seem to do a lot of renovation
that's nice
the town that i came from is a older town
the typical homes there are early nineteen hundreds late eighteen hundreds
i renovated a house there
that was so much fun
there if you don't live in a house that's at least seventy-five to hundred years old you're just nobody practically
that was a good experience for me to learn a lot of discipline
was considered typical for that area
it was quite a change for me to come to a house like that now that's just a very square little box
there's not a whole lot you can do with it
None
i have lived in a small town for
this town was less than ten thousand people
it was about sixty miles south of dallas
i didn't move out of there until i was twenty-seven
that was just
i love the big city
i had lived in a rural area for so long
i've enjoyed it
it can get kind of tough
i don't want to be a part of the rat race
i haven't planted anything yet
i usually have gotten flowers coming out the gazoo
i haven't done that yet
i'm just kind of trying to stick in with that
since that's over with now maybe i can get this yard in shape
landscaping is more than the gardening
i do plant a lot of beans because it seems like the bugs get on them so easily
i have a real problem with anything like pesticides or anything like that
the only thing that i use is soap
i water spray the plants because they say supposedly that will keep the bugs off them
i don't have luck with that tomato plant
i hate to spray them with anything
what do you do
my favorite one is putting on the tomato plant dust
that stuff has been around since the beginning of time
i've heard him talk about that forever
you have to really wash your vegetables after that
it won't make you sick
i've done some rewiring on it
do you plan on adding any rooms or
is it
do you not have a half bath
that was even just with two people
do you have any children
they enjoy where they're living
he doesn't know
i turned out okay
don't worry about it
you think that you want to move away from the big city
that's what i've always
you want to go back to that
after we got married we ended up moving to the houston area
are you from texas
it's not
you say you watch evenings mostly
sometimes oprah and sometimes donahue
now it's mainly evenings
two they're going to change
one they're taking
that's kind of young for us
None
we don't watch that type of show
we like l a law
i was surprised at the ending with all the funny things happening
i just wonder if they just want to go on to other projects and not be stuck in this show since it's gone on for so long
it looks like it might be one of these seven or eight year run things
do you mostly like a story type of thing that lasts an hour
i don't usually like stuff that continues
that's why i'm surprised i like those two shows because usually i like stuff that just ends sort of that you don't have to
have watched
you don't have to
i usually don't like that
we do that sometimes
i guess i'm not into real heavy stuff
mostly i'm into it for relaxation
i like things like golden girls or cheers
monday night is real good with me major dad and northern exposure and
what's that one with burt reynolds
that type of show is what we watch
we generally just stay on one channel for all of monday night just to watch those
mostly they're just little vignettes
it's really funny
they use animated
it's not a cartoon
it's dummies and things
it's really
there's always a moral to each story
what night is it on
we watched it
the times we've seen it it's been on friday night
it's
it's real
the first one we saw it involved a tradition of when a person reaches seventy-five
i can't remember what day they call it
the son-in-laws get to throw the mother-in-laws when they're seventy five over a cliff
the son-in-law and mother-in-law are sniping at each other and all
when it comes time for him to throw her over the teenaged son the night before tried to save her by hiding her
she said no
you can't do
he was running in a wheelchair to hide her
she said you can't do that
this is what old people are supposed to be thrown over the cliff
he said i don't understand
it's real funny that they give the teenagers as the one that questions what's going on
in the end the son-in-law when he did get the mother-in-law up to the cliff the teenaged son throws himself in the way and says no you can't do it and then oh well we've got to do it it's tradition
the son was why
in the end he doesn't throw her over
he doesn't
of course the town thinks he's just terrible because that has been tradition for hundreds of years and he's broken it
we saw one when a teenage boy comes into his manhood
they all go out and howl
the son refused to do it
he did
he didn't go howl
all the people that worked with the father ostracized him
how funny
it's real interesting to watch the show
the relationship between the family is really now the mother-in-law lives in the house with them
our oldest grandson is the one that got us to watching it
it moves real fast
it's real short
there's always like i say a moral to it
is it hour
half hour
that's all there is to it
they
they're trying to liken the father in there of the teenage son to jackie gleason show
the way he talks to his mother-in-law and so forth
i guess maybe there are some parts of that
i didn't really see that in there
what i've read about it they talk about that
anyway we've enjoyed that
i guess mostly i like the news shows too the news magazines like sixty minutes or twenty
twenty or prime time live or something like that all of those shows if i can do it
my husband likes to watch old movies especially war movies or sports which i'm not
i like sports
i like ice skating
i like gymnastics
i
i'll watch snippets of baseball games
i just don't have that much time to sit and watch the whole thing
no matter what's on i don't ever just sit and watch t v
i'm usually doing dishes
i may be sewing
None
i always have letter writing
i may be working around in the room somehow
i don't ever just sit and
that's something that comes from your old age
it's
i
before that there's not much time
at six thirty i'll watch wheel of fortune or something like that
if our grandchildren are with us they have to watch that
it's
the kids will get you started on stuff like america's funniest home videos
he wouldn't let us pull it
it got to the point he was eating a pear here
he bit into it
it was just hanging by a thread
i'd tell him it's getting ready to fall out
he walked around the house with his face down toward the floor and his mouth open hoping it would fall out because he wouldn't let anybody pull it
and
do you have p c
i can transfer data back and forth between the p c and the main frame
i sort of own a computer
neither one do we really own
actually i'm doing consulting right now because i just had a baby
my husband's working at bell labs
he's really from france
these computers actually are from france
i actually do some work working at m i t and at nist national institute of standards and technology in washington
i worked for dragon systems for a while
it depends
i work in the speech field
i do a lot metacoustic phonetics and looking at the acoustic characteristics of speech
i do that type of stuff typically for other people
here we use the p c to do that
more
word text processing
i don't use
i don't usually use a word processor to do it we don't have too much standard software
we haven't really bought any commercially available software at all
we don't use it for things like our accounts and addresses and things like that
we use it more for just writing programs when we need to or doing research looking at the speech signal and then doing writing and also
we connect to other computers to read our net mail and things like that
you've got a modem in it then
neither one has a modem
we have a modem
it's an external modem
when i got mine i had an internal modem in it i used it quite a bit when i was looking at information on a large bulletin board sponsored by a newspaper in fort worth went out of town for a while
sort of got off the bulletin board and off of my micro completely after a while the modem started making noises on its own even without using it on the computer
i finally
i didn't hear it
do you hear the beep in the background
that's an ambulance or something going on here i think
where are you
you've got a lot of traffic noise real close
it'd be interesting for the people that look at this signal
it'll be interesting how much of it actually gets picked up
often times that
i can't do this much later than now between sort of six five thirty and six thirty or something like that because the traffic outside they honk the horn so loud i can't even hear the phone call
about twenty after four
you're an hour ahead of where i am
i'm in central time zone
did you ever try using like prodigy or any of those systems
i know someone who has
she's very pleased with it
you can do a l-
you can save a lot of money too certainly cut down on long distance charges if that's what you have in mind
did you use commercially available software
i have used lotus
i have used word perfect i
i've used d base
i've used a substantial amount of shareware
i haven't done much lotus work connected with my job
i've been through three classes i have a great deal of respect for it
i haven't done much
i do some i
the d base work i've done was
i've heard both good things and bad things about it
it's probably the granddaddy of most data base management systems
i think by now it's a matter of personal taste
i've had a class on r base and also in paradox both of those seem very easy to use compared to d base
do you think d base is more flexible or allows you to do more
do you think the others are pretty much compatible these days
i wouldn't say compatible but certainly comparable
yeah
what do you work on at t i
i do mainly business data processing
sometimes i get called late at night at home because there's a production problem
that gives me the opportunity to come in to work and fix it if i can't think of some thing to tell the trouble shooter while we're on the phone
i also handle most of the calls from our users and other programmers who need to find out something connected
i guess first of all i could have asked that before
what do you think about the proposal that all young americans should spend a year or two
i think everybody should put in their time so to speak for the good of the nation and for the good of themselves
because i didn't know if that would make a difference yeah
i think it's
would everyone grow up and mature and realize what this country's all about
i just
i guess that's something that my family has always believed strongly in
i had opportunities in high school
to work in some programs i agree with what you said that
None
it gives you a little bit more a glimpse of the real world
it would certainly help the country too
i think that's probably quite a few things that the kids maybe not so much nowadays but used to go through
they did things for people
for their communities for their families for their friends where now i'm not sure they really do
i think sometimes through groups and organizations
when they asked the question i thought that sounds wonderful
i wondered if people were unwilling
i think even if you went in with a negative attitude i don't think it would stay negative very long
i do know through some organized groups like scouts and church they
i think that's a small number could
even through those groups do you think that they participate as much as maybe they used to
None
that was something i think in the fifties and sixties
i think it's probably more true still in the smaller communities then in the larger cities
where abouts do you live
i live in richardson right now which is just
we're not far apart
one of the calls i'd gotten before was down to austin
i know a friend of mine talked to someone in the midwest
i know there is the possibility that it could be out of the area
you're right
i think it was just
of course it was back in the fifties
i think it was real prevalent back then
i think people thought more of others than they do now
as far as doing things for them and then gaining benefits from it
maybe this would be a way to get that feeling back if we've lost some of that
it seems in the last decade or two that's true
if young people had to do it maybe that would start the trend back because that's one of the things i always
i don't know how young you'd have to go
i think by the time they're early teenagers anyway i think it's too late now at least around here
None
they're things even just starting around the home
just watching the parents do things too it can start a pattern
that helps develop that attitude
i guess i would really like to see this happen with families more
i think this is certainly a possible way to handle it
i wish
i think that's a good place to start again
i think it has to start in the families first because if you don't do it for your own immediate family you're sure not going to do it for anybody else
i do think the schools
sometimes what richardson and plano both
when you live in areas like that where there's so much they don't realize what a small percentage of the world that is
that's
it's
i know our church youth group starts with projects young
they have a high school group that works in the appalachia area every year
that's great
it's
they've also see that there's a different way of life and those families are really close
that we talked about that were common in the fifties are still there
it's changed their perspective
that's just the two weeks during the summer
that's great
if two weeks could have that kind of effect i would think
i'm glad that there are still some areas that get the youth involved in that sort of thing
even a small amount of exposure can make a vast difference in their attitudes
i guess
i enjoyed talking with you
good talking with you
i hope you have a good evening
have you ever had to put your children in child care mary dell
i had private care for both my daughters until they were two
i was really lucky to have put them in a
it was a wonderful environment
i just wish all kids if they have to be put in day school could have that kind of place
it worked well
i have a nine year old and a six year old
neither one of them has ever been in day care for the reason of me working they both went through preschool
half day programs
many of the churches have really strong preschool and children's day out it was a nightmare back when cheryl was little
this is one of the few churches that did it
they seemed
what i liked about preston hollow is that the people that were there when cheryl was two which was fifteen years ago many of them are still there today
these people that had changed her diapers when she was three were still there
my gosh
it was really neat
it was because they had a director that had always done it as a labor of love
my goodness
she just kept good people and real cheerful place lots of arts and crafts
i'm really glad my kids had it because plano schools do so little of that
that is a big drawback i think in the public schools out here
to
if you do
pay for it after school
they started a pilot program where we can pay private tuition so that they can take french and music and art
is that right
i willingly did it
i thought
my goodness
with our budget cuts i'm sure that's
that's the only way they're going to be able to do it
parents who really want their kids to have any humanities are going to have to do that
my goodness
in some ways i think the day schools do serve those purposes
even the preschools they get so much of that in preschool
when they hit kindergarten it's like wham
get the computers out
you were able to have somebody come there
that was hard too
i lucked out with really good people both times
i know so many people that are never able to find that
i'd practically give my paycheck away to do it
did you have someone that lived in with you
the first one was an
elderly lady who was putting a daughter through nursing school just purely on baby-sitting money
my goodness
she kept cheryl during the day and then did more baby-sitting at night
she was neat
that was a plus from that respect as well
with emily it was a neighborhood friend that kept her
i have
i guess it was on the home show
they were talking about
i can't even think of the name of it
it's some kind of advisory board they've put together for parents and children
the doctor that was on there the pediatrician said i can't imagine leaving a three week old and taking them to a nursery day-care and leaving them there
that would be hard
None
they give a lot more leave
our benefits for maternal and parental care and even for elderly people are really expanding
we have more options now then we did when my kids were born
boy that's great
with being able to take off full-time longer you can phase your schedule in so that it's not full-time for up to six months
i've had a couple of assistants that came back just three days a week
they've
that helps because you don't have to just wean yourself cold turkey and say okay i never get to see my baby for eight hours a day again
the bank has a lot of programs now for child care referrals
i think we're finally beginning to make progress but just not very fast
i would think since big business is supposedly why the government makes the decisions they do the people that work in big business have families they have children
it's only to their advantage that they get these programs going and working
that was the rationale they gave when they were giving us information about our employee assistance programs that they want us to be happy and want us to be able to cope with trying to split ourselves in fifteen million pieces
i hope it helps
good
that's hard
have found a private home to take their children to when they're young until they hit the preschool age
usually you'll find a woman that's keeping six children or four to six children in the home
my future sister-in-law's mother does that too full-time
in plano though the problem is you find
this is what i found with emily
from the time she started first grade i wanted her out in plano area
i kept finding
they'd move
i finally decided
this year i tried kinder-care
let's see
we keep our paper bags lined up in the garage for glass and plastics
we make the dump over to the wal-mart bins there as soon as they're full
i guess we collect milk cartons and whatever other plastics are acceptable
are you in the part of town where they have gotten into the other containers yet for recycling
maybe they don't
i know that was supposed to be in may
i couldn't tell whether some parts of town had started it or if it was just everybody
i thought that it had all been delayed several times
i have no idea what they look like
i'm kind of anxious to see them
that's going to be interesting because we've gotten so convenient and conventional in trash disposal which is
i say they work fine
i keep mine outside the garage so that i don't have any odors
it's clearly a place where
i'm glad the community is doing it
it's one of those things that kind of has to be forced on people
i don't know what you saw back years ago
for me the thing that strikes me is growing up in rural south dakota where the farmers brought their eggs to town and the local hatchery would candle them and package them is that in the fifties you could say we had the recycling going on then that we should have now
you got a nickel or dime which in that time was a lot of money when you returned them
of course
we had milk delivered to our house in glass bottles
we had a milk shoot at the side of the house
you just put the empty ones back out there
he took them away and put another gallon of glass bottle in there
yeah
i look back at my childhood
i'd say they were doing things then that we should be doing now
it doesn't bother me at all that we're kind of starting to put the pressure on people to get away from all this throwaway society that got developed in the sixties and seventies
it would be nice to see it take a good turn here
i hope that this time it stays
when we go dump our things we collect newspapers too and then take them
seems like there's a pretty continual flow of people coming and dumping glass and dumping plastics that's kind of encouraging
i didn't know if we started to do that
i'll have to say i'm the only one i'm good at at this point is the newspaper taking that to the boy scouts and my aluminum cans getting rid of those
on the plastic i don't have any habits there yet
guess i'm waiting for the city to push me in that direction
it just seems like on the larger scale that we always talk about in our society is that economic strife things
i think if we just start to put the nickel deposit on things like was the case years ago that it would have more immediate effect
i remember searching ditches for beer bottles because they were worth money it seems like beer drinkers are among the worst for throwing things out the window
outside my little town
we would go out and look for long neck beer bottle because they were worth something
do you know in tom thumb yesterday i saw the return to the small coke bottles
i don't know if there's a deposit on those or not
that's interesting because
they were the glass
let's see
they'd be i don't know maybe six ounce or ten ounce
sort of a small size and we didn't stop and look at them a long time
they were packed in the old sort of six pack stick them down sort of a basket type thing
the paper carton
i hadn't seen that in a long time
i mean the
we had all the mechanisms in place with the fold up paper cartons the wood
i'm not really say going back to good old days
certainly we were doing things the way we think we should do
it will be interesting to see how over the next year this all works out because on the grass i know your husband
he likes to pick the grass up too
he doesn't
i'm the same way because otherwise
i generally listen to neal sperry on saturdays and neal's a person who says i like to pick it up
i don't believe in throwing it into the landfill
i have my compost pile
most of us don't have the sufficient
lot size to do that
i'm glad the city's willing to take that on
there's someplace
really when i look at what my grass does in actually about twenty-four hours knowing what the farmers do in rural areas they just take their hay and just build a big mound of it and it naturally composts or stores
all you have to do is just place it somewhere and churn it
it will naturally decompose
you just have to kind of keep in separated
who knows
it's certainly usable material
they must keep it separate if they have this date in
they have this day now that it's separate from the other trash pick up
the thing i don't understand about that is when
i've trimmed trees and other things which end up being something that clearly won't decompose nearly as rapidly
okay
i was thinking about it for a long time
i like basically almost every form of music and type of music
i don't have a whole lot of dislikes
i like jazz especially the blues
i like a lot of of course the classics everything back from bach and beethoven and chopin and just in general everything
i enjoy a lot of the modern forms
do you like rock and those kind of things punk even
some of the punk when i was in high school that was one of the big things was punk music
some of it has a lot to say the lyrics do
the actual
it really expresses some of the opinions of the people who enjoy the music as far as a musical art form i just don't see a whole lot of art to it
some of it
the two types of rap i enjoy to listen to and one is the rap that is just funny
they usually do a lot of satire
the monotonous
i don't enjoy that at all when they're just talking about i'm better than you and blah blah blah
some of it actually gets into some serious discussions of problems in urban society
it talks about race relations and police relations
that uh-huh
i'm with you though
i like classical i don't like to listen to it all the time but some of the time anyway
i like easy listening just kind of
i don't really care to listen to it any more for some reason
let's see
country western i'm not quite as big on that
that's about my opinion of that
some of it's okay yeah
it's okay
the thing about country western that i don't enjoy is doesn't seem to be any imagination behind it one country and western song sounds like every other
sound really similar
country and western the musicians don't get to really get into their music
you have a country and western song
that's kind of the way i feel about rock and roll sometimes too i guess
the other thing i don't like about it is they have a tendency to play the instrumental so loud that you can't understand what the lyrics are you can't understand what they're saying on some of those songs which probably is just as well on some
i can't say that i like a lot of the very modern rock and roll
i really enjoy the fifties the sixties and some of the seventies rock and roll i really enjoy especially the sixties
where are you from
that's neat
did you understand what it was for what we
television shows
i don't watch too many
we can try it
i don't really watch too many t v shows other than occasionally i'll turn on donahue because it comes on in the morning when i seem to be getting ready around here
if there's no one else around it's just me and i have a chance to listen to something i'll turn that on but just
i think i enjoy when i catch it i don't even know what night it's on but designing women sometimes
i love that show
there's a new one that started out that i've caught a couple of times called good and evil i think
i heard they just canceled that
it's different
have you seen the show it's new this year called home front
it's really good
i think it's on tuesday nights from ten to eleven it's set in post world war two times
it's about how the servicemen come home and readjust to civilian life here and the changes everyone's going through
it's kind of like a nighttime soap opera type thing
it's really well written
is that on what station
i prefer oprah winfrey to donahue
she comes on later
i usually have kids around so i don't end up watching that one is the only problem i have with it i guess
i work full-time now and can't catch those anymore
now when i watch them i think why did i ever watch those
when i did watch them i was addicted to them every day
not anymore
do you know of any other shows in the even or something that you enjoy
tonight i'm looking forward to seeing golden girls
that's always fun
if i can stay up late enough i like to catch saturday night live every now and then
right now we're watching a penn state football game because that's where we live
that's really exciting
i think
i also course like to catch the news during the evening hours it's a little tough because that's when i'm usually making dinner and the kids are wanting to talk all at the same time
usually i don't get a whole lot of news watching in
what have you seen interesting on oprah winfrey lately
sometimes they come on and say
that's right
today on c n n they were talking about something like this about learning to recognize voices and words and stuff and the research
just doing this as a fund-raiser for our church
that's nice
it kind of makes it easy to do a little something for it
we've talked to a lot of people from texas it seems
we thought maybe they work for dallas
outside of that rent a lot
i have a v c r
i see most all of mine there
i don't know
earlier tonight we were watching to live and die in l a
i live alone
consequently i don't like these psycho things
it is to me an outstanding movie
he is an attorney and his daughter is an attorney
she has a suit against his company
it's one of those things
there's a lot of l-
None
gene hackman's a good actor
we saw her just the other night too
did you
i live with a roommate and my girlfriend the three of us
have you seen the movie crossing delancy
that's one i have watched six or eight times
what business are you in
i'm an electrical engineer
all right
is everything going all right up there
it's only about half an hour
i live on the border
that's that bad then
we live up in tax free new hampshire and drive down to massachusetts to work
we
i live on that little ten mile spot
sounds wonderful
not up where i live
further down the coast in massachusetts they got hit pretty bad
we got the backlash of that thing
they had record high waves thirty year high waves come in there
it was quite an experience
what movies are you looking forward to seeing now
i'm only twenty-seven years old
the doors movie that's out on video i want to watch that
it really just turned out nicely
i would recommend that if you have a chance
we often sit around and say what movies should we rent
we don't know
if you can get green card go for it
i have been working as an accountant at the medical school here in dallas
i have watched gross anatomy
i don't know
i hope you have a very merry christmas
to begin
i guess space is real important i think
it's real vital to the future of not only our kids but every generation until the end of time i guess
i agree it's definitely new frontier stuff
i'm not too up-to-date on the space frontier
i guess they're going pretty far into it now
star wars is not too far
have you
i worked on some of it at t i once upon a time
what do you know about it
actually i'm quite versed lately
people are talking about the current space program all the time
they're talking about new rockets that they're designing now that are just like science fiction
take off
they land with the
the afterburners are going not like space shuttle landing gliding down but straight down to the landing pad
my gosh
i don't know
you think you'd go up in space if you had a chance
yeah i think i would
if the time came it'd be real nervous
i had a tire come off of a car
i know what it's like to
i guess they're talking about people going to the moon and stuff now wherever
at least we're going to have a space station supposedly in the next few years
they're going to put
science fiction books
you look at the jetsons cartoon show and it's not too far fetched what they all had in those cartoons
you never know
any of that stuff from the jetsons from that cartoon that you would never imagine would become possible and now we have a lot of those
you never know what may occur
as far as me seeing it
i think it's real vital important for the future generations to come
it's something definitely that
it's got the extra little oomph of interest
i'm sure it'll draw a lot more interest too once it's more possible
when they start showing the drawings and all that i'm sure when they
i wish
boeing or mcdonald douglas or something like that was supposed to buy a space shuttle sooner or later and just make it purely commercial they'd go up and do things
did they scratch that star wars deal they one we was all worried about
i don't know whether research will go on
the economy the way it is all over they probably cut back on that because it's not
they're going to be cutting back so much on just the number of troops we've got in europe and the number of troops we have here
russia's still going to have missiles
we don't know who's handling them now that's a whole different story now
latest i heard it was just going to be russia itself that was going to have them
at least that's what everybody says
now they're saying yeah
some crazy hit man over there
with those little republics or whatever
one of them crazy guys get a hold of it
the guy that's taken over for gorbachev he's supposed to be on our side isn't he
that way
None
michael what do you think about funding for aids research
that's something i've thought a lot about
i work in a hospital
i've worked in the hospital for fifteen years
i've taken care of a few aids patients
when they asked us did we want to keep it the same or spend more spend less i think right now what they're spending is adequate
for my personal opinion
i think it's something that's going to take them a while to come up with a vaccine for
i don't think it's going to be that easy to come up with i think they already would have by now
i don't know if spending a lot more money would really make any difference right now
i think they're doing as much research as they can possibly do
what about you
i guess i'm not too aware of how much they're spending right now
that's something i've never really kept up with at all
i
i'm not sure
i know i've always thought more about the disease rather than the research
that sort of thing
if we were talking about the money i'd just have to say what they're spending is probably enough simply because i don't know that much about it
i can see that research is needed
None
it's becoming a major problem
i guess the area that i think more about is i would like to see them focus on preventing it in more
that's true
that's true because it's such an easily preventable disease
i feel like just saying safe sex is not the answer
it's abstinence in certain cases
knowing
myself i'm about to get a divorce course i'm not all ready to just run out there and start dating everybody i can or anything
it's sort of scary to find yourself single again
because you never know what's going to happen
you don't know who you're going to come across
course i'm not going to want to go and have sex with everybody
it's something you got to think about these days
it certainly changed my attitude about that in a hurry
i know that in some of these larger cities they're passing out free syringes and all of that sort of thing so that the drug addicts won't be getting dirty needles and everything
i don't know
i know it sort of doesn't address the problem of drug addiction
i don't know
i don't know
i think that's
i'm not too much against the passing out of the free syringes myself
i definitely think that it's the drug problem that needs to be addressed
as you say people in the meantime
if they're perpetrating the aids problem passing that on to each other then
i guess if you consider the two problems drug addiction and aids aids would have to come first i guess as far as something to do about it
i don't know
course there's so many things in the world where if you solve one problem you may be creating another
i guess you just have to take the two problems and see which is worse
i've never looked into how much money they're spending
i have no idea
i know a lot of our tax money goes to that
i really have never looked into it
i've heard different voices speaking up and saying we're not spending enough
i don't know
yet i know it sounds like big money to me
it probably takes a lot
it seems to take more than for any little thing they do
i
a lot of my family they fear me working like that and under some of those conditions
i don't fear it at all
i work in the operating room a lot of course when w-
i'm lee with
where are you at
there's a lot of stuff going on in arlington these days
i'm not personally
do you work
you are
i work for myself
i miss insurance and the steady paychecks that come
is that right
i enjoyed the freedom of having that
go to work when i wanted to or not the benefits weren't there
i own part of a roofing company
do you
in the dallas fort worth area
unfortunately we were part of a bigger company we had all the benefits there
i do miss that
on the other hand i enjoy having the time that i have with my family and being able to work when i want
i think today the thing that i would appreciate the most
my husband gets
we have to pay for mine
i'm the only one that's being insured
is that right
we pay the same amount that someone over there that has four children has
it's kind of
i would
the way medical expenses are i think that's probably one of the biggest benefits you need to have
that is the single most benefit that i enjoyed and i do miss
i looked into picking up some medical insurance just for my family
yeah
yeah even at a group rate
it's unbelievable
the amount that you have to pay for kids
if you want to add dental to it that eats even more
i guess the other benefits that i miss i guess is some of the bonuses and stuff that goes on with just being involved with a big company
i'm sure it will be quite a few people are affected by that
i will personally tell you i used to work at a bank
i would see the g m people come in when they would shut down to retool
i don't know if you're aware of this r-
they go off fishing and stuff and come in every friday and go to the safety deposit box
i'm sitting there making a hundred dollars a week
they had all these gr-
i really believe they have done this to themselves in a way because of the unions being so stocked
right now anybody's that's laid off from g m will have a full year's paycheck
plus probably an additional six months through the worker's stuff that they have through the company
i'm sorry it's happening because it's going to hurt
i don't feel as sorry for them
really the
that would be it
really the ones it's going to hurt is actually the businesses around in that area
that's the ones that's going to hurt because they depend on that
i think there's a case
they got so good like two dollars for a prescription no deductible on the medical all these things it made the prices of cars go up
the
i believe in unions
they went too far
i can't make eighteen dollars an hour
i'll tell you i've had my fill of unions
i know someone out here that makes eighteen dollars an hour
do you want to go ahead
they are really big on women's rights
and equal treatment
i've seen a lot of rallies and things like that
i'm not that liberated
i mean my mom is kind of old-fashioned
you pick up some traits from her and stuff
i think it's interesting and better for women to see that there's more of them doing men's fields
i don't like to see women waiting on men hand and foot
i believe in sharing and doing things for each other
i see a lot more
they're all married
i love seeing the men help the women so much
they both cooperate together on
me too
i don't mind doing stuff
i have a boyfriend
i got to make him dinner and stuff
he'll help me do the dishes
i don't want to expect to help to clean up then after
if they did that
they're good about it
it is neat to see them all work together
a big thing that i see most of the women getting married now have gone back to
they stay at work or go back to work or whatever
they're well educated
i believe we'll see a lot more c e o in companies
i think we'll see a lot more don't you of upper management
i think black women now
in fact i work at a high school
boss is a black woman and has only been there a couple of months and already promoted
she's very sharp
i think that th-
and the ethnic thing is a good thing now
me too
they're sharp
you're going to see a lot more of that in leadership i believe
it's just too bad that some people still look down on them just because of their color
they wouldn't know what they're doing
i'm not big on subserving as far as
i never have gone along with that even far back
i was brought up pretty good in a home that
ther-
some people say the boys shouldn't have to do those jobs the inside jobs
we never were taught
that was good
i think that's good to keep the equal as far as not necessarily by sex type thing
i think the attitude is a lot better towards the parents raising the younger ones now
you see a lot more of the mothers and all saying to the young girls you can do it
i see more men participating in the family things with children
helping to take care of them more and doing the jobs equally
i'm kind of disgusted this year because i don't see many women into the political scene
i really think we should have more political leaders in the women than we do and even for president and vice president this year
i think they're all scared out
what was the lady's name that ran a couple of
i don't know
you know who i mean
their tax deal and
at least she was strong to try it and
that's good
i wish they would get some more on that
that disappoints me
right now i don't think we have too many in the forefront
other th-
it would
do you think it's possible to have honesty in government or an honest government
i suspect that it is possible
i think it probably is more likely if you have a small government unit where everybody knows everybody
other than that i think maybe it just depends on how you define honesty
that's interesting
it was just applying to governments in general
i thought that was interesting
it was just government in general from times past on
they're saying that government officials would tend to be power seekers
that would be a next question to ask
how many do you think are in there for for bu-
they want to be a service to us
are they in there for their own gains
personally i feel there's probably some of each
i think maybe a lot of them
how good a name can i make for myself and so forth
i guess it would be like anything else
they talked
third question was how serving for their own gains do you think goes on
i agree with you there's a lot in business
i think that's very normal
i think a little more honesty in the campaigns would be
if you knew what you were getting when you voted
i'm taking a texas government class right now
one of the things
if they tell us the truth we don't elect them
especially with all this stuff coming up here lately about people's past
i don't know why anybody would want to get under that scrutiny anymore
because i think it's gotten just care-
we're getting away from what we ought to be looking at
it almost seems like in order to avoid some of the scandal you would have to have the kind of wife that you would only find say in the bobsy twins or
i also think it would be funny if we could know everything about the people that were in there and throw them out
at it's t c j c
tarrant county junior college
it's really enjoyable
they also do you think we could make laws to eliminate all corruption
i don't think we can make laws to eliminate anything anyplace totally
that doesn't eliminate it does it
i don't know how many laws you would have to have
they've got laws against cannibalism that didn't stop that guy in
i think there's no way that you eliminate it all by legislating
we would end up with so many more laws that
i just think that's human nature that you're going to have corruption in government in business personal life
the japanese government is always having some kind of a scandal
when i think about where i'd want to go this is still the best
i can
i have not found one yet that i would rather live in
i think
it's worst i think we've got the best
okay chuck do you have any pets there at your home
what kind do you have
i live alone in an apartment except for the cat
we have a cat
he's probably a good two years old big old fat and sassy tabby
it's they're just aggressive by nature he's been neutered and declawed
he's an indoor cat
that kind of calms him down for the most part
he has been really aggressive especially towards my little girl for some reason
he's been so mean to her
you say you've had him how long
we've had him for about two years he was so mean to her right after we first got him
we had him neutered and declawed
now he bites her
he's a very possessive cat
he loves my son
he's the only one that allows him to touch him pet him love him he's so funny
while he showers it's so hilarious
he's quite a animal
as long as he doesn't get too aggressive i guess with the daughter he's all right
we did actually take him to the pound a couple of times because we just couldn't have him being so aggressive towards the girl
he seems to have mellowed out a little bit
we do keep our daughter away from him
we tried a dog about four years ago we ended up with malamute and some other kind of mix
anyway it ended up being just a huge dog that ate us out of house and home
we gave him up and tried
do you live in a house or a place where you
we're in a subdivision where we really can't allow the dog
he was just chained up all the time
it was unfortunate
have you tried any other pets
i live alone in an apartment
my word
it's not that big that although i've heard rabbits are pretty good i saw something on c n n or on cable here a while ago that showed some people that had rabbits in apartments and in houses
they apparently
my word
especially when they're young when they bring them in
do they just paper train it or something
i would imagine that they don't have many more than one to start with either
did you see the c n n the dog show
we don't have cable
they have they call it the westminster dog show
i think it's in new york city at the gardens
there once a year live they had that on last week
that's really kind of something to watch
it's on i think two or three nights for maybe an hour or two some of the weirdest animals you ever want to see in there
you live in utah do you
it's north of salt lake city utah we really love it out here
it's kind of country
we're only about ten minutes from ogden
we're kind of country but not too
do you all work for t i or for
see i'm getting so many calls to texas
this is the very first one i've talked to
great
no my
how do you get most of your current event information
see i'm going to school right now
while i'm working i don't get a chance to read the paper a lot
i don't watch t v as much really either because my free time is kind of
i do other stuff with it
while i'm at work sometimes on the computer network i read the news sometimes
that's kind of helpful
my roommates and stuff people around me talk about it
the people i work with are pretty up-to-date on that kind of stuff
i'm a housewife
i get most of my information probably through just the news at six o'clock and then talking with people and just hearing what's going on
do you watch major network news
do you watch the macneil lehrer hour
just channel eight
that's the eyewitness news
see channel where i am channel eight's public t v
it's kind of different
i think the
i think a lot of the commentators on the major networks right it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on
it seems that they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they report on the news
i think even in the elections they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not
basically if a candidate can get them to follow then the news will kind of publicize his name
because they can only report on
they give each candidate perhaps ten second blurbs in which to say you just can't get a full picture of their message unless you have time to sit down and probably read something on it
the news too it just doesn't cover that many stories
it just covers your basic violent crimes and your catastrophes with weather and stuff
other than that you really don't know what's going on
i will read our current letters that come out on elections
i guess i do read that
i do study who's running in our area
i do study what's going on in the economy
it
i guess i do read other magazines too to get my information
i subscribe to science news
that's real good because it gives a brief summary of the updates of what's going on in science without getting into a lot of detail that would bog me down that i wouldn't know about other than that i don't really read
i don't really subscribe to anything else
i used to read every month a reader's digest now i guess i just have friends that clip articles
if i am interested in something i read up on that just a little in the newspaper to find out what was going on
a lot of the times i wish i had the time to read all the stories in the newspaper
i just can't seem to find the time
i remember back during the war everyone here at work always had the radio or the t v on because they were going constantly with that stuff
people said that they wanted to see more on outside of texas news
we just don't want to hear every night all the killings that went on here in dallas that we want to hear what's going on with the economy what's being done to help it what's going on in other countries what's just more information
if they reported every violent crime in atlanta it would probably take the whole news hour
i guess we'll get pretty good news coverage in a couple of years when you host the summer olympics
already they're having
in the newspaper they have a section i think every now and then on the olympics
they've got a countdown
i can't believe
they're stretching out the olympic news for that much coverage over
also big in the news right now is the braves because they're in spring training or whatever they did so well last year
they spend a long time on sports
i think that's fine i would like to see more time spent on other things
they way they do the newscasts i wish they kind of separated it
i don't have cable
we have one rotten cat
i like cats
this cat is a
he's a one owner
he'll follow my oldest son around
when he is in the house he will come up and he'll jump on his lap
if anybody reaches over to pet him or whatever he'll just kind of look at them like what are doing
we bought the cat for him
he's been the one that you know spent the most time with him
i've never owned a cat like that
that's interesting
it's a weird cat
we have a mutt
we named it hooper because that's where we got it from
a lot of people drop off abandoned pets at her house she use to work for a veterinarian
she would neuter them give them all their shots
we saw an ad saying it was free
we went down there and picked it up
it's been an excellent dog
it's my first dog i've had
we got it because my wife stays here at home alone while i go to work
that's mostly why we got it to keep her company while i am away at work
is that kind of your child right now
right now it is
we have been trying for kids
right now we haven't had any
it's pretty good training i think really keeps her on her toes
have you had dogs before
my brother has
we didn't do a lot with them
i never felt like it was mine or anything
that did more responsibility when it's yours and not your brothers
when i was growing up we always had a dog
we had mostly mutts
not mutts but mixes like one or two mix
those dogs always seem to be the best dogs
ours is a cockapoo
it's a really good dog
they seem listen better or something
it's just an accident
from my son's friend down the street
they're cat was an outside cat and just end up with some kittens
i would
we had a dog that was a mix between an alaska malamute and a labrador i should say a pup
he was just too big for our kids when we got him
when we moved into our house that was the first thing we wanted to get was a pet
it was a dog that we gotten
he was just too big
the kids couldn't handle him
i was still going to school
my wife was working
i was working
we just didn't have time to really train him
he was too big for the kids to handle
he was just tied up to a post we gave him to
there is a place out here called shorties lane out here in harrisville they have
he just takes a few the animals in
some he destroys
some he keeps
we took him up there
he ended up keeping him
cause he has had him for six or seven years
we've saw him just about a year ago
i thought boy that sure looks like that pup we gave away we asked him about it one day
he said yeah
he would have been a great great dog
they just started a recycling program here i think
this is my first experience with recycling program
instead of just tossing everything away which i always felt bad about i am starting to split stuff up
they make me drive it a mile down the road and spit it out down there
here in saskatoon
there is no curb pick up of any of the recycled products
we're in a community of about one hundred and eighty thousand people
there are areas where we could
actually we have a couple of the handicapped societies types of places where the
we are able to have drop off bins for news papers and cardboard and that kind of thing
there's a deposit program on plastic and glass containers primarily soft drink bottles
we are able to take it to one of the rehabilitation centers
they recycle the containers
the deposits only on drink stuff
primarily on soft drink pops and that kind of thing they induce recycling of plastic and glass soft drink containers
we do have one of the scrape metal dealers that will accept tin and aluminum cans as well the recycler with the handicapped group will also accept those
it's fairly extensive
then again it's the initiative of the individual person because there is no coordinated pick up by the city
did they
are you giving these products to the handicapped group
the handicapped group is getting the the money
are some home distributing the funds back to you
there's the opportunity for both
generally the handicapped group takes care of the things that
actually the government has placed the deposit which is the inducement to recycle the bottle so that you get your money back
the recycler run by the handicapped society pays back the cost of that deposit
they in turn will get some money from the bottlers and from the the people that do the canning of the pop and the beer as well
i heard about a similar program in new york city where a thing called homeless incorporated or something like that
what they do is employ homeless people to go out and collect all the recyclable cans
i think it's mostly cans
there may be bottles as well but beer cans soda cans and what not
they bring them up to one centralized location and are able to collect the money from the various beer and soda manufacturers and get more money to these people that desperately need it
i guess partly because of our climate
here in saskatoon at least the majority of central
i want to say central canada
central canada tends to referred more to ontario and quebec
we certainly have a fair number of people that are on welfare and unemployment insurance and that kind of thing
we have actually quite an extensive network of collecting news papers
people can drop their used news papers and other papers in the bins
the bins are collected
some of the
jimmy how do you get most of your news
i watch the national news every day for one
i'm pretty much a news junkie
i tune in to c n n a lot
when you say the morning news or evening news or national news is when
every evening at six thirty i believe
i would probably be a junkie or watch
i don't subscribe to cable because of the poor service and also because
i give to the united way
i figured that amount of money i just donate to that
i take away a addiction
overall i
the quality of the news you get off of most sources i would say is pretty low
that's one of the reasons why i try and get as many sources as possible
if you hear the same story from three different sources then you get a much clearer picture of what is going on you would hope
still hard to say that what you've heard is what really is
what newspapers do you read
i read the local newspaper
i also try and read one of the major dailies like the chicago tribune or the new york times or something like that
for a while there i subscribed to new york times actually a couple of newspapers because my fiance
she was unemployed for a while
she really needed to look at
i don't know
when you read a lot of this stuff the quality of the writing has definitely gone down in the last ten years or so
they say it's like the sixth grade reading level
i swear it's at least second or third grade
i think if you listen to n p r or something like
i really like n p r a lot
i like listening to that on
when i get a chance when i'm in the car a long enough time to listen to it because i
i n p r a lot also
i really like them because they give
they also
they're pretty good too
i guess a year ago you're probably watching c n n a lot right
i don't know
i guess it's still a lot of hype
look at the smith trial
that was a joke
then you also have things where they broadcast the clarence thomas hearings basically the whole length of them which i thought was really good
i had some visitor
he was just i don't know fixated on that just listened to it constantly
i guess that's good when it's live if you'll really want that
that's not really providing you news
it's more like a media event rather than reporting
the news that you would get from any other source is being generated from that event which is something that's good also about c span which i tune into every once in a while
it is really kind of boring
that's
if you don't watch it there then you're going to hear somebody else's canned report somebody else's view about it
that's what you're supposed to
if you watch the news your opinion is going to be formed on what somebody else thought about it as opposed to actually watching it yourself and forming your own opinion which i would be much more in favor of forming my own opinion as opposed to following someone else's
one of the ways that i get information is every day when i log in on the computer i subscribe to this thing
they basically type out abstracts which are really literally
i've actually read the actual articles
i just got done reading a couple magazine articles about the new saturns
although i can't afford it right now i would just love to have one
you like
you're an american you want to buy american
it's the best car in the class for the cheapest amount of money
i'm interested in having it for doing a little autocross racing closed circuit racing it seems to just blow the competition away
it terms of handling acceleration
it just got the top rating
it was compared up against
there was the mazda m x three nissan's whatever their n x two thousand the civic s i
it dominated over all of them
all the raters loved it
i like the styling
i seen a few of them actually race
they seem to be really good cars for it
can't afford it
you're talking about ones in a lower end price range
let's face it
you can wait till you graduate
you'll have plenty of money
i've got a pontiac sunbird turbo that
trying to get it prepared for racing
it would be nice just scrap it and go for the saturn
i'd use it for both
the nice thing about autocrossing is you can do both
just like a set up a lot of times
it's like really large parking lots
you set up the track pylons
i've seen a lot of mustangs compete
it's interesting
what are you thinking about buying
i think i'd like to get b m w if i go the german route which i'm kind of leaning towards right now or maybe a acura legend
a lexus s c three hundred maybe
i haven't really determined if i like the japanese or if i like them enough to purchase one
because your b m w your german cars have good reputations i think
i was actually in
a lot of the b m w are produced in stutgardt and munich i was there this summer
i was really impressed by the factory tours and such for b m w
they have the whole philosophy
they kind of even brainwash themselves into thinking they're better
as you're walking through that little tour in munich it's kind of
it was interesting
i also went to the porsche
it was amazing how they were completely opposed
the b m w is really like we have all these high tech things
everything is put together with exacting tolerances
you go to porsche
it's like these cars are completely handmade no two of them are alike
it's like completely opposed
unless it's a toy
if you can afford that kind of a toy then i guess
b m w good for that
what kind of driving just like commuting you'd want to use it for
no heavy mileage
it's pretty minimal
i was impressed by the mercedes too
i really like the mercedes
if you have a problem with a mercedes you take it into a shop they're going to hit you up for just all kinds of things
is it different for the b m w
i think something on the order of a three series it's probably different
i'm kind
this is the big issue with us although i don't recall marking it on my little things to talk about
you're married
we've been married for two and a half years
i know we're not supposed to do this long distance
i'm getting a call
i don't want this to be a unilateral
our children are sixth fourth and third grade
the school years are wonderful
they are interesting
they have all their own activities
i think as parents we really enjoy them in our personal situation
they're pretty good kids huh
i'm sure that's coming though
we had ni- wh- growing up
my dad
the time that we spent with our dad was he owned his own business
we worked with him most of the time
that's how we spent most of the time with him
we're catholics
everyone always asked if the girl got spoiled
i do think with working parents there are some real issues here
that i think
i happen to
i talk to parents about this a lot
i think working mothers or mothers who choose to work outside the home need very early to come to grips with any guilt
i feel when my children were very young i had jobs that helped me be flexible with my schedule and spend time with them and all that sort of thing
i long ago decided i'm a better mother because i work outside the home
it has helped us to afford some things for our children that we couldn't otherwise that i think are wonderful particularly at this age
i think our kids are real secure
i know it sounds like a rationalization
i really think it's true for our family
i think it has worked very well
it's like you said to each his own
we're planning on having my wife stay home
if a woman is happy doing that
i would not have been real fulfilled
it's wonderful to be a mother
you can do that despite working very easily which is one of the things i preach all the time to mothers
i think we choose very carefully the alternative situations that we had them in
i really do think sometimes they very early on are around lots of other children
they learn to share
that's good
your wife does she work right now
we just moved down here
then wh-
what do you think about recycling programs in atlanta julie
it's hard to find places to go
kroger does a couple things
do they do newspapers
there's big bins out there
i really don't know what the details are
as a matter of fact i'm pretty sure there's a place you can call and find out the closest thing to you
i think there should be some kind of curbside service
they pick up newspapers and milk jugs and aluminum and tin cans like soup comes in and stuff
during the summers around where i live the homeless people see-
they all have shopping carts and stuff
they're go around and collect cans and aluminum and stuff
we used to just save them up
they'd come around
we'd give them to them
during the winter time i think they move south or something i don't do that anymore
the recycling at georgia tech like that outside the student center they never empty those things
what's a guy to do
now they have bins and stuff that are a little more convenient because until seven o'clock you got to pay to park at the student center
yeah
you do recycle don't you
i'm kind of bad about it
if i see a pile of cans or bottles or something i'll throw it in there
i don't ever take anything
it's real
since we go there all the time
by the way may name's julie
is there anything else you'd like to share me about your recycling philosophy julie
what about
they have
i used to just save up the ones that i got one time go and hand them to them the next time and use them over and over
also most places like big star does
i'm not sure if kroger does or not
they have little boxes that you can put your old bags in
those petroleum products i think are the great satan of the recycling
did you know that something like fifty percent of the world's landfills is filled with paper
paper doesn't seem threatening at all
it is though
they do treat paper with chemicals
yellow paper takes something like twenty times as long to decompose
you can bury a piece of yellow paper
i can just forget that from now on
i'm going to switch to the white ones
white paper's bad too
they treat it too
what about papyrus made out of bamboo stuff from the banks of the nile
i think we should just abandon the written word altogether
None
i think we've kind of
None
like dick tracy
how do you
it sounds like you've got a television going on there
i can assume that you probably watch the t v news
what station do you listen to
it's a local radio station
it's called k l i f cliff
it's not affiliated with anything is it
it's not a network station
i listen to public radio a lot
they have k c r w which i saw a thing recently they may be trying to start their own cable tv outlet
they're getting a little feisty now
this station has a lot of just ongoing news
i hate watching the ten o'clock news
you have a paper or something or
we have dallas morning news which is the big paper in dallas
i read it pretty much from cover to cover
it's been a while since i read the dallas news
fact last time i read the dallas news i was in arkansas
the times herald went out of business here we really only have one dallas newspaper and one
that must be pretty bad
how did that happen anyway
financial trouble
when did they
when did it happen
how do you keep up
me
they're speci-
if there's something you want to know it's in the times
we used to have two papers here in town
the herald examiner collapsed about two years ago because of i don't know just nobody was buying it really
there really is only one major l a now
there used to be
fact i think there still is the daily news which runs out of the san fernando valley
they're not bad as far as a local paper goes
in fact it was kind of weird because i met the editor while i was doing jury service in santa monica one time
None
he was a really cool guy went to columbia university and all this stuff
it's a pretty good paper
it's not the times
although i'm sorry to see some of their
there's a daily news rack right around the corner from where i live which means that they're expanding i guess
occasionally i pick up time magazine or something i think if they've got an interesting lead story
it's
i don't have time
i don't read it much anymore
that's kind of a problem for them
we have a local rag here in town that i pick up periodically and read just to see what's going on in our little community
it's just sort of four or five pages that covers what's going on in plano
it's still not an awful lot of news
it was a big discovery when the times found out there was a place called orange county
the way they've been handling it before they practically acted like their reporters needed to shots to go south of the l a county border
i would imagine in dallas they have plenty happening in dallas to cover that it gets hard covering all of the suburbs
of course they tend to cover the county
we're not in dallas county
they tend to ignore places outside of the county
i find that attitude kind of arrogant though
you're not bothering to cover the things that are interesting to us
i'll let you start i guess
i'm employed by a company that does do random drug testing
i've got some
are you involved at all
i'm not
my employer does not do that although i had an ex-employer that
the previous job i used to have they
i guess a few years after i had started with them they made it a condition of employment that you pass a drug test
i don't know
for example
there was an incident several years ago where an amtrak engineer he crashed and
in that regard where it's not an immediate threat to life and limb or property i would seriously question it
that's mine
it
i go back
to me no matter how much our company claims it's not a constitutional issue that because this is between a company and an employee it is not a government
our company's doing it because they're a government contractor
it's required for certain some form of drug program is required to get the government contracts
i'd
it's the government that's mandating it to a certain extent
our company has taken that and gone all the way
first off we don't have enough courage to pick out the people that have some sort of indication of possible drug usage because that would offend them if they weren't
we'll just accuse everybody of using drugs and
they
it's a complete random testing
it's random in the sense that you don't know when
i sit at a terminal and write software all day
it certainly
yes
i agree that there are jobs that are definitely life threatening
there needs to be a line drawn somewhere reasonable and proper
i-
there's also the issue of
out here i remember hearing a year or so ago that a lot of
i shouldn't say high i mean several percent
that i will give credit to our company for in that i think there's a couple of levels of tests in terms of drugs
essentially the first thing is on the order of paper in the urine or some
it's fairly simple
there's a much more refined test spectrography or whatever it's called the chemotography to determine exactly what the things are
now let me ask you this
at the time you hired on with this company was that prior to any
i've been with this company for sixteen years now
this is obviously not a condition of employment that you subject yourself to this
it has
None
on the other hand someone new coming in that knows they're going to have a test
i called from the t i data base calling instructions
there's really a lot isn't there
i guess the work force would be the main wouldn't it
we can start recording it
like i said i guess it would be the work force as far as changes in the generations
i know because i know when my mother was going into the work force there wasn't very many opportunities for her i guess
i've never faced that at all
i think now you go to work when they're six weeks old
you stay there
i feel like the next generation you'll probably just work right along with your husband
i do to much
it's just going to get better
women are in every field now
i can't think of a field that they're not involved in
i can't either not a one
i know at least in the medical field it seems like they've come out with a lot further advances as far as female medications and things since women have gotten into the doctor field
even in washington
people will just look at you as a person and not as a man or a woman
i do too
that would be it
i guess it's kind of an ideal world though
i kind of think maybe in time that you'll go by social security numbers
that way they can't say they picked a male over a female female over a male
or the way you
just go by your social security number and then look at you qualifications that you have
if you get it then
also with women in the work force they've gotten a lot more options as far as what's it called job sharing
if you and another lady were to share the same full time job
a lot of women i know now and one of my supervisors when she went on l o a to have her baby we hooked up a terminal at her house
and we could send her messages
she kept in touch like that
i would just take her the actual paperwork once every week or two
that worked out great too
that's a real attractive option if you have the technology for it
all it was
she just used a phone modem
she was sitting in the office
i think that's real nice too to come up with different options
i do
one week she'll work three days and i'll work two
the next week i'll work three
she'll work two
that's great
we just share off like that
that's wonderful
we've just really got a wonderful system that we're working under
that way we're not really missing any thing out
that would be a nice way especially if you have young children
it is
both of ours is school age
we don't want to miss any of those p t a and all of that
even that they have extracurricular activities
the older they get the more that you're involved in that
i look for more of that in the next generation
i do too especially as women get up in management and can be in on those decision making
when that subject comes up they can say yes
i do too
plus i bet it cuts down on your absenteeism because you've got two days off that you can do everything
you don't have to unless you're just really sick or the child's sick
most of the time now it's just the weekend
just forget it
what i've done is found doctors' and dentists' office with extended hours
my doctor stays open til nine in the evening
that's real helpful
you don't have to do it during office hours run out on your lunch hour
i think we've really come a long way in that because
i know
i can remember back growing up my mother
it was
it wasn't that easy for her to just take off
i can remember my mother getting in trouble if one of was sick
i know she probably didn't make hardly anything compared to the work that she did
i think there is still some discrimination there where men and women work in the same job
i do too
i think that's improving
you just want to make it right
at least the wheels are moving forward
i should probably get back to my job
i've been waiting for about ten minutes to get connected to somebody
are you in dallas
not detroit i'm in california
you're on the
i guess we're supposed to talk
how did you get to know about the t i thing
one of my instructors said that they were doing something like this
what are you working on
a masters in information systems
i'm doing my masters in computer science and computer engineering
i don't because i come from a bigger city than this one
i'm in raleigh
it's really small
all you have is like towns built around universities
it's basically a bunch of small towns anyway
they don't have a whole lot there
i'm in monterey california right now
it's like this town probably has two hundred and fifty thousand people
that's about it
it's a lot bigger than monterey is
we're just south of san jose and san francisco
it's only a hour away to a large city
where do you go
it's the naval postgraduate school out here
because i was looking at the
they're asking for a g p a of like three point seven or something like that
they're looking for g r e like ninety-nine percentile and this and that
it's like
that's what they look for
that's why i didn't apply
for me it was practically impossible to get between ninety and
ninety-nine percentile on the verbal part
let's face it
i did the
i found it a lot of times with regards to education the school only takes you so far
i don't lose any sleep over stuff like that
are you going to go for your doctorate
i'm in the navy
most of the navy funds that i probably won't do it until i
probably be another twelve years
i like what i'm doing right now
what if they pay for it
i think they have maybe two people a year go get get their p h d
because i know a couple of people here that work for
they civilians or military
i think they're military
the guy is still in
he works over in maryland
he's doing his masters here
they gave him a scholarship for a year
he's doing it in in a year and a summer
he's getting that
they said they got a lot of benefits and that
this guy
you can earn a lot more money
you say
i go why you still there if you can earn a lot more money once you've get your masters
they go they got a lot of benefits that would go with it
a lot of times it's not the money
they like what they're doing
they feel good about what they're doing
you
once you get your masters you can be earning anywhere between thirty-seven forty-five thousand a year
that's not what they're paying
it depends on what rank you are of course
like i say if you're at an upper level in the rank category you're probably pulling down close to seventy grand a year
that's
it's like in i b m
in i b m you can get certain points everyone's a manager
nobody can get one more point to become whatever you need to earn so much money
i b m is like
there's a joke about i b m which says it's like
all the major companies get into a boating race right
i b m says we have to have a team right
they come in last
they have this whole team analyze why they came in last right because the person asked for it
he goes the problem was that there were five people saying row row row and one person rowing right
he goes have you come up with a solution
it's like everyone's a
it's like one person does the work
that can really slow you down
that's the way it works
that's why they're having problems
everyone's a manager
it's like the people that actually do the work there are very few
the other people just plan it
it's like have you ever seen the commercial for federal express with the think tank
all these people are just sitting around just going what shall we do
this guy from federal express comes along
they can tell you where your package is anywhere any time
it's the same thing with i b m
they have this think tank
they got to come up with ideas
the thing is that i b m is so stabilized that everybody will buy their stuff
they've got basically a lock on a lot of the market
a lot of times you figure with the support that they provide
people generally go with that because they figure that you probably won't get fired for getting i b m material
it fails
you're dead
where's if you try something different they'll say yeah
why didn't you try something more mainline
i b m doesn't fire anybody
what they do is they put you in a different job
which you actually are like sitting around not doing anything
you quit
that's their policy
if you're stealing something or doing anything like that
they won't let you off
what they'll do is
they'll put you into keeping up the paper
you say that's not my job
you quit
in other words that's the way they force people out
that's why they can say there's no layoff policy
they don't really say that
you're always going to have great career conditions
hey that's kind of sad
it's like they have just different policy
it's like i b m never in their commercials they never put down any other company
they're the standard right now
as far as that goes people think of computers they think of i b m a lot of times
the main
what happens is they have a good backup policy
anybody can fix it
that's what you're going to go for
that's a big thing
it's like for example leading edge
they made small personal computers
what they did i don't know is buy all the parts that i b m would throw away
it can last five
that's
they're still around i think
i've seen them around anyway
they buy all the things that i b m throws away
that's why they're so compatible
because
by the time you have computer for five years you're going to throw it away anyway
they have to anyway
there's
one of my teachers got this computer which
it's voice synthesizing stuff
he got that
he said it's like
it was wonderful
when you tried to erase and correct all the errors in your voice it takes up all your memory
i want more
it's like jesus christ
because it's one second of recording
you put into wave you want to correct the errors into wave
it's like
by the times it transforms into wave by mark off model
you put it in there
you want to correct those
you're trying to make the wave smooth
you can approximately
imagine what it is for us to make mark off models
when you get right down to it the more they can do for you the more memory they're going to require
both in terms in ram as well as standard memory or disk base
like they say nobody can get enough
it's like i was watching this program on t v yesterday
they were showing this three d graphics view of
with just graphics on a
this is like video game stuff
the only thing was that it was just lines
i guess i'm going to school while i'm working at t i
there's not a whole a lot of time that i've got for hobbies it seems like lately
one of the things that i do when i've got some spare time is i do some woodworking
that i guess ranges anywhere from carpentry work to some types of furniture and i don't know what you would call them knickknacks i guess stuff you hang on the wall to put a mirror on
i made some candle sconces that you hang on the
there's something about working with wood that i enjoy that
because it's out there
i don't have to worry about getting stuff on the carpet except when i track in saw dust
the wife gets kind of aggravated about that
then i get the opportunity to vacuum
i guess i get some of both
when i have time i do like to sew
i had been doing a lot of crocheting
i would help her with whatever she happened to be doing
she would go to these arts and crafts shows and sell her needlework
a lot of times i'd help her with that
i think the temperature has been pretty good so far for working outside
do you find you do most of your crocheting or your knit work around christmas time
my husband says i do it make afghans so i can keep my lap warm
that's kind of what my wife says
she enjoys doing it during the cold weather because she's always got something to cover her legs and feet with while she is working on it
i think she made three this year one for my father-in-law and then a couple of brothers and sisters
those things they take some time to make
it's
you make it in strips
it's real easy to do
it's just that it doesn't keep your feet quite as warm because you do it in strips like that
that's kind of like quilting
i'm not sure what she does
first thing that comes to mind is some kind of chain stitch because she starts and goes all the way across back and forth until she winds up with this big piece of afghan
usually single crochet always starts it off
we have a very small phone company down here
i guess that's one way to end a conversation
it gets a little aggravating
sometimes they get disconnected when i'm talking to them
we planted potatoes and onions and bell peppers
what else did i get in there
i think i had four jalapeno plants last year
i chop them up and put them in jars and usually give them away because there is no way that i can eat all of those
always got to the keep those planted
my husband doesn't like them either
i can always give them away
that's kind of the way i am
i planted zucchini last year
i planted four hills of them
those things just flat took over
it wasn't until late i guess in the summer
i'm not sure when a good time to plant those is if they should be planted early or later
i would think so
seems like they all went to leaf
it wasn't until late in the summer they started making fruit
i don't know if i
i hadn't looked at a farmers almanac to find out when a good time for zucchini is
probably the same time the other squash is though
that's true
most of the okra that is growing around higher is later okra
well that's about
i was just going to say it's a little over six or seven minutes
whenever you feel comfortable about concluding i'm
just any time
all right
thanks for participating
i've enjoyed talking to you
they range from let's see about a year and a half to nine years old
i lost one one time
he'd never been outside by himself outside
it started raining
i was hysterical
i was
you would have thought a child had died
they laughed at me
we've gone through the same things with ours
they've been ill
i take off work
to take care of my cats
we had a baby
its like all right who comes first the cat or the baby
when we go to sleep at night it's like my husband and i have to try to get any space on the bed because we have all four of them up there with us
how funny
they didn't used to be actually
they got kind of wild and weren't doing very well inside
i put them outside once i got a house
they're doing great out there
the first one i got he doesn't want anything to do with outside unless you're there
lord knows what happened to him
we started out with two outdoor cats
our neighbor decided he didn't like cats and shot one of them
he lived through it
i couldn't believe it
we went through twenty-two hundred dollars worth of vet bills
my gosh
the cat almost died
he turned out to be such a wonderful cat
he loves life now
i imagine
he's like thank you so much
that was a traumatic experience for us too
i can imagine
from what we can tell it was a pellet gun
he started chasing him with a bull whip
my gosh
luckily enough we found the cat in time and rushed him to the vet
it took us about six weeks of in and out of the vet and surgery
he started off as a stray
we did all this for him
he's been a wonderful cat
we wouldn't have them
i don't see us without pets without cats
they just fill this void
i keep talking about getting rid of my outdoor cats because i feel like i can't take care of them as well because they're outside
it worries me that one day one of them won't come back
i feel like they need a big home a nice place where someone can have the time to play with them and things
i can't give them up
i go hysterical when they don't come home
you worry about who's taking care of them
yeah
every time you see one hit on the side of the road you say is that my cat
you go crazy thinking it might be yours
i didn't realize my husband was such a sucker for animals until i brought one home one night
i had one we had to put to sleep he got so sick
i fell in love with this it's a chinchilla persian
and brought him home
my husband just died
we've got to keep it now
my first one that i got
i found this one
actually it was on a sign at taco bell drive-thru that said free kittens
i thought
he was the only one left
his mother had been killed coming back across the road to make sure she'd gotten all her kittens
he was the last one she carried across
of course i had to take him
you can tell he was weaned too young because he'll nurse on your ears and your fingers
he said he was probably weaned too young which he was because his mom was killed
he is the lovingest cat
people who don't even like cats like him
he doesn't have any front claws
he doesn't bite anybody
he's just kind of there real friendly and docile
that's good
we just love them
they get to feeling so lovey and dovey
they'll come up just start kneading in our chest
it's like your claws need trimming
we call that doing biscuits
it just drives us nuts
i just love cats
i had a dog when i lived at home
they're a lot more trouble than cats actually
they have so much more personality than a dog
they're so much fun to watch them play
they are
they just act so funny
we've got
the two that were outside they're like brothers
i've never seen two cats so close
they will get to playing chase through the house
it is hysterical
the other two cats will follow in pursuit
it sounds like a train
it just sort of echoes through the house
how funny
they're wonderful
we have bonzo bear poindexter and felix
how sweet
what do you have
they don't look a thing a like
rascal is a black and white short hair
they came from the same litter and everything
we have tortoise which is a black and orange
she's so ugly
you can't help but love her
she's the oldest one but very possessive
it's like nobody messes with her mamma
it comes bedtime
she's right there
in fact i got her when i moved out of the house also
yeah
if something happens to her
i know
i'm like no
that's okay for weekend
cats are good all the time
i said you do like cats right
have you seen those
it had this man sitting on a couch with his date
there were cats hanging all over him hanging on his clothes
the couch was ripped up and down at the bottom
they were just all over him and sitting on his head the whole nine yards
the whole time i was pregnant they kept saying are you getting rid of your cats
i'm like no no no
i wouldn't either
we just love them to death
it's been nice talking to you
it was nice talking to you too
you take this subject much more personally than i do i suppose
take it back thirty years
if you were educated you might teach for a year or two before you got married
if you were a teacher then that was it until the kids were little
you weren't supposed to want a job
there's not supposed to be any reason to use this education or this brain that
of course today it's supposed to be all the other way
your kids should be totally happy in day care because everybody else goes to day care we have these wonderful people who are totally prepared to teach your child everything they need to know in day care we'll see how the generations go
a really good day care is probably going to cost more than you're going to make at the job
at least for a lot of women depending on what she did
i was mechanical engineer with t i
i did it for six years
for one
i had one while i was pregnant
one while my oldest was a year old
it just drove me crazy
i couldn't put in enough overtime that was necess- or things that would come up at work that would require me to stay late or to come in early or to do something on saturdays as is needed because my husband for a long time was out of the country also with work for three months
it was you and the kid
that's the thing
the technicians work the eight to five job and know when they're going to be there
if you're going to be more professional oriented then you've got to have this to be able to perform well on the job
it was
in my case i just decided that as long as my kids were little i would be better off at home with them instead of driving myself crazy trying to do everything at once
you figure one of these days you're going to go back to being an engineer
actually i've found out that i'm not going to go back to being an engineer
i'm a photographer now
i have branched out
when i went to college i felt like i couldn't support myself if i decided to be a photographer that it would just have to be a hobby
i'm very mechanical
mechanical engineering interested me
i did that
i did that for six years
i stayed home with my son and did nothing
and found out that it was great
i was bored part of the time too
i wanted something else to do
you figure there's got to be more to life than sitting here playing with this child
it's great while they're really little
as they get older and they're more independent and there's things to do then it's good for them to go to different
he goes to a mother's day out program now once a week
they get the socialization with other kids and not really school but a different authority than mom once in a while kind of learning how to deal with society
they need that to be able to relate to other people besides the same person every day
i need it for the break
that's the other thing
still taking care of the children is a very important job
someone's got to do it and be able to do it right
that's the whole thing
if it's not mom then dad or somebody's got to move in there and do the job because the kids really need it
i think the biggest thing we're going to see coming up in the next ten year
i think it's going to be more in the next ten to fifteen years is that there's going to be a lot of women
they're going to have to work it out to working part time
if i had been allowed to work maybe thirty hours a week instead of fifty hours a week i might still be working basically full time or part time if there had been some way to work it out
i liked my job really well
i was just pulled in so many different directions
it was just driving me crazy
now with the photography it's working
that's what i'm doing is working part time because i can put my kids in a day care situation for a few hours in the week and use those hours to do
the thing that i'm doing is taking school pictures in day cares and in mother's day out programs and also soccer teams and different stuff like that
my kids can be in day care for a few hours a week
my husband when he's at home can take care of them
jobs have to i guess become more flexible
i think they're really going to have to and not just for mothers for fathers as well
that's another thing that has to adapt is the father's attitudes about whose job is this
it's his job too
as far as housework goes men can do housework just as easily as women
thanks to a lot of new inventions housework doesn't take as much time as it used to
it's just convincing your husband that it's important enough for him to do it
you
if he saw mom doing only that all the time he was growing up then it's hard to think of it that i should do it or just to think about doing it rather than having someone tell him to do it
i know that was a big thing in our house for a long time was that if i wanted my husband to do something to help i had to come in there specifically and say this needs to be done
a man might say out loud i understand this
i agree
still he was raised with a mom taking care of him that's a very hard attitude to change
it's just they don't look at things
they just scoot it on another spot on the sink and put the next plate down and in a while get around to it
i think most women walk in and with got to clean all this up got to get this out and this in and this taken care of instead of having someone say now this is the time this needs to be done
a lot of that is how it was drilled into you when you were a kid
which brings us back to the idea someone's got to be there taking care of the kids to drill in the right ideas to so that they know that male and female are both responsible for doing this
i think that's going to show up a lot more now in the next generation of boys and girls
the boys in this next generation are not going to have to be told as much this needs to be done because mom was there saying that dad is there
they were both working at whatever things needed to be done
i think in between we got a generation of kids who didn't learn to take responsibility because mom left to go get a job and dad didn't move in to fill the gap
basically no one was taking the responsibility i think that's happened in a lot of cases
it's going to
some time day care is really good
sometimes it's baby-sitting
it's someone keeping an eye on the kids
the kids are basically doing what they want and not really having any relationship with the adults to say here's what's right
here's what wrong
here's what we expect of you
i felt like when they were young that was the time to instill it
that it could be added to and strengthened as they grew older but when they were little
this is the way because that
if you teach them when they're little the way you want them to be and the things that are important to you then you add onto it as they get older
if no one does anything when they're little then it's twice as hard i think as they get older
she's usually in bed by this time
she's staying up late tonight
my dad was a very traditional dad
when i was a child i didn't really know my dad very well
i miss that
i want
like we said if women's roles change drastically men's roles will too
men have to be convinced of that
a lot of it's for the better
some of the women's roles i think are almost for the worse because we're losing out on some things
i think if we can expand the men's roles at the same time like your taking care of your child and your dad probably didn't very often i know mine almost never did
we went and saw the rescuers down under over the break
do you have kids you take to movies
it didn't get as good a reviews as the little mermaid their last one and got all kinds of academy awards and things last year
this one i thought was excellent
i can't believe how good they're getting with their animation now
it's just the special effects
in this movie there's this boy
he rescues this bald eagle
it's a huge eagle wing span of twenty feet or something like that
the boy actually rides on his back
he rides through the clouds
you see him coming out of the clouds his head coming out and then the bird coming out
they're flying all over with it
i know there must have been computers or something for animation this day
it was just so real realistic and lifelike and good animation
roger was a composite one
there's a movie i've seen roger rabbit
i enjoyed that show
that was made i don't know several years back i guess
latest one i've saw which was a mistake to go see was lionheart
of course i guess he's trained in this martial arts of some sort
the plot was bland
chop them up
he's singular i guess
you know how they can make any single one of them in a movie to be a superstar of any sort
chuck norris of course could be just about equal
all of them i guess could be in that fashion
it was about a
french foreign legion fellow who deserts to go help his brother's wife who became a widow because he was selling drugs
he got killed
really uplifting
he deserts and goes to new york
he starts out by fighting to make money
he moves on to l a to where she is to just help him out
the hollywood really must think there's some real dummies out there or something
i hadn't heard much about that movie
i guess that's one i won't go see
it was worth the buck i guess
you went to the dollar movie
they show up at the dollar movie right after they come out
they're usually not that great or didn't do that great anyway
i want to see that new one that won all those academy awards this year dances with wolves
what
i absorbed all of that movie in one sitting
i guess what made it so good was the cinematography
the wide open the spaces
it had an excellent story line
i thought an excellent one too was misery with kathy bates and james caan
that was a well directed and acted movie
it's a little on the violent side then what movie isn't anymore
p g used to be r
seems like the rating system is kind of switching that way a little bit
i have no objections to it
it's just
it's a matter of your taste
it's just that the rating system seems instead of having x now they have what n c seventeen
they just changed it because x had a connotation with it
even on those type they don't show what you expect
what the hey
i knew the story line going in
they changed some things in the movie
i thought the movie was really good as well
that's about all the time i can spare
that was a good show i thought
i read about how they did an article on how they did all the special effects with the submarine
that wasn't a real submarine you saw in the water
it was all done in studio with smoke and mirrors and all the hollywood magic
i thought
that was in the water
i hear this movie f x part two coming out is pretty good
it was
you ought to rent the f x part one
it's f slash x
what's that about
a special effects man who somehow gets involved in this
i'm not sure
he gets involved in some sort of bad dealings with somebody
he has to go underground
he uses all of his special effects knowledge in doing what needs to be done
to fool people
and using makeup and using all the props and whatever to get to where he needs to go
you need to rent the first one first
if that is that the second one follows the first
i don't know if they have the original actors on that first one to that one
they were doing their dealings with that before they even got over there i think
they had some
in some of those i guess they retitled some movies that were going to be about lebanese and americans
they decide make it iraqis and americans
they just change the title and reshot a few parts where they could
i guess they figured we can't tell the difference between an
eventually i'm sure they will come out with the proper names
i guess they'll probably come out with a lot of movies
it was such a rout though
i don't know
they probably do the story of someone who was shot down early in the war or something and how he survived or about those two newsmen or whatever that got captured
i think we've probably
keep on watching those movies
we'll
my husband and i just moved here recently
we bought this house about i don't know year and a half ago
what we have here now is just a basic three bedroom two bath brick house which is completely different from what i had had before
when i was working and before i married i lived in a little town south of here that is just full of old homes and historic old houses and things like that
i tried to
i was in the process of renovating a house that was about seventy-five years old
it had to have everything done from top to bottom to having it leveled jacked up new plumbing new wiring wallpaper paint
you are experienced i would say
i really did enjoy it
i agree
i have done something like that too only not nearly as extensive
it must be interesting now trying to do something to a basic ranch
that's true
when i met my husband he was living in an apartment at the time
the town that i was living in only about eighty miles from here
we
as you probably heard in the dallas and texas area period the housing market is just unreal
you can get things for such a song
that's really why we ended up in a house like this
this is not what we want to stay in forever because i've found that after doing this other house i have to have my hands into stuff
i'm always just wanting to paint and wallpaper and redo and redo
i'm ready to get ahold of another one that i can have a little more input into
maybe you can make that one charming and make a little bit money
that's the key
the thing is when we moved in they had just painted we're wallpapered new carpet and everything
i feel sort of like it's sort of defeating my purpose to go rip everything out now
we'll see how much longer we're here
we just moved to charlotte
oklahoma of all places
i know
as far as the market was concerned i'll tell you we had kind of a charming house
but not really traditional looking
i tried to make it after i sold my business
i in
it is
i considered it a full time job when we did
we kind of had planned this trek to the east
i think some of the things that i did paid off
one thing that i did that might even be a good suggestion for you was something i did on the outside
i love old estate sales
i happened to go to just a little estate sale
where the couple was very old
all the men started going down to the barn
i th-
shoot i'm going
they auctioned some tools and
then they went over and started auctioning this big stack of bricks
i thought gee i've been wanting to
do some brick walkways for a time
it ended up after some pretty heavy bidding
my word
my husband and i loaded bricks in his
my word
what we ended up with was about four thousand
what we did
it needed
it was quite large into the yard
how fun
how nice
for
he did the digging
i figured the sand and all
leveled it and
it turned out beautifully
i bet
what satisfaction to know that you did it in such an inexpensive way
it nearly killed me
you did stagger back and say doesn't this look nice
let me ask you
they're fixing to sell it again and move again
she's a renovator a lover of old things they have to be doing something constantly
the patio that came with that house was not laid on a
i don't know if you can put some sort of a plastic sheeting or something on top of the sand and then lay the bricks
they have a problem with these little sand bugs or something that drill in between all these bricks
of course you have the weeds that come up in between the bricks and things like that
i didn't have that trouble because we laid the
we laid those bricks about as close as you can get them
when you start
we put them on a base of four inches of sand
we swept sand in between
it was an error to leave like an eighth of an inch or whatever
that's probably because they had
every spring my mom says we're going to have a barbecue and tell everybody guess what
we're going to redo the patio
they just haven't brought themselves to do it
i also used a rubber hammer a lot
rubber hammer and prob-
if they have problems with sand bugs of some kind i think all they need to do is probably put some insecticide down in there on a fairly regular basis
the thing that's funny is they've done things like that
it's like in two days time they'll come home from work
those little things are back
i don't know what they're finally going to do
she won't have to worry about it
i think she needs to take them to the extension agent and ask him what they are
what is it that will
what it is that'll
i think in this area or most all areas they use
they're
that's true
my dad farms
she's always telling him isn't there something that you can bring home with you that kills everything that you spray out in the field that you can get rid of
it might do it
she's got just a gorgeous yard so many flowers and her four cats
she's sort of real funny about what she sprays
i think you probably just need to make sure that it dries
very very well
gosh deb we could talk all day couldn't we
it just seems
as i said when i heard what the subject was i thought gosh i haven't thought about what i went through at that other house in so long
i don't know
i thought that would be the hardest thing to do
gosh i ended up wallpapering every bedroom in that house up the stairway
i just had a ball with it
i've sworn up and down
my mom's great grandparents had this huge victorian house in paris texas
the one thing that she ended up with was the old door
that was on the front door of that house she has that up in her attic
i have sworn that it
as far as looking toward the future that's my plan
i think though because as a
i guess it actually changes
i do a number of different things simply walking with my wife sometimes my daughter will come along on her little bicycle
moving up i run in the mornings
not every morning it probably averages about two days a week with my wife i actually go to the gym and lift weights which isn't i understand quite exercising
it's along the lines
that's a hard question to answer because i do physical things but i don't always set out for them to be exercise
i play racquetball
i haven't since i've been out of school
that's going to start soon again i play softball once a week which is kind of more recreation than exercise
i really don't like to exercise
i think that's the basic point of it is i don't enjoy it if i know that it's exercise
if it's like a social activity or a recreational activity i don't mind i have to disguise it
you look at it more as a task
i'll voluntarily clean the bathroom
i won't do it if i have to do it
i'm thirty-two years old which is probably different than yourself it's interesting that as you get older you begin to understand that you need to exercise
my job at texas instruments i have to sit in front of a computer all day and make phone calls so that i don't get any exercise doing that plus there's a build up of stress i need to go out and take those walks after dinner
i need to go out in the morning and run
i'll just get nuts that's kind of a motivator
even though i can look at it as a task i get some kind of global benefit from the whole thing by saying i'm lowering my chance of heart attack and that type stuff
i do all that
i'm doing that more and more than i used to i'm getting better about this knowing that i need exercise and doing it it's still at the task stage
are you
it's a
it takes
during that time the stress from the day goes away
i get to share whatever i did with my wife and vice versa
going to the gym is actually something different than
and the running
i enjoy that too
running i'm at that point which you probably get to after about six months of dedicated running where you don't feel your muscles any more you don't think about the pain of it
you take the time to relax some how
you think about other things
that's no fun
it's so hard to get past that for a lot of people
the weight lifting on the other hand is actually
i'm not a huge person
just going to lift weights on occasion with my wife
my wife thinks the same thing about both me and herself that get that little bit of definition in your muscles is attractive that pays also
i guess that aspect of that takes away the work with my wife which is nice
i love her
also that long term benefit of a little bit of tone in your muscles
i haven't really brought myself to go to the gym because that's very stressful to me
i felt real competitive there
i need to find some place i could go and not feel like there's all these people who are just huge and hulking that are
i don't let that bother me
i'll tell you the sit ups and push ups are excellent
you're struggling against your own body weight you can have variety by putting your feet higher or lower by putting your arms further apart or closer together by doing them real quick or real slow you can actually get a good wo-
i know in the push up at least you can get chest muscles and the back of your arms quite built up just doing push ups
i do have my ride
is that right
i'll do those once in a while just at eleven thirty when love connection's on and i can't sleep
i'll get up and stair step for half an hour
it's i guess pretty healthy
i don't have a regular plan that's i need to get started on that
maybe not
i'd say at twenty-two you don't necessarily need a plan as long as you're getting the exercise otherwise
what's real funny about plans is that there's a struggle when you add a plan to your life
the answer's sleep right
star trek it's always trade offs
you actually as you get older you have to really think what can go and what to replace this thing
it's not just exercise but anything
i don't think you should worry about not having a program yet
i guess if you care or if your future wife gives you a reason to care which helps
i hope so
the biggest problem in this part of town seems to be the attitude and the atmosphere in the schools that you can throw money at it
to me it seems like the schools are reflecting society in a bigger way because the general values that we're teaching kind of conflict with what we expect out of people in school
do you think it's the values that they're teaching in school or the values they get from home
the values more or less at home and the t v just a general
learning is not a revered endeavor really
it's a lot more
it's i won't say socially unacceptable
whereas like in a person that stud-
things like that are a lot more glorified generally in society
i think that carries over to school a lot
i think that the biggest problem is with the home environment being part of it
if
i think too many parents expect the school to teach the moral aspects of things to the kids while we're not going to worry about teaching you manners or teaching you respect for anyone or anything like that and then expect them to pick it up at school
you're not going to do that
you're going to carry to school out into the world what you learned at home
i think that that part of that showing up now with things because kids i think have probably less respect for people in other things than we may have seen in the past
part of it's the family i think
part of it's the living conditions certain people are subjected too
i think that's another root problem
i wonder if that's a root problem or not
i think about that a lot
it's just everybody likes to blame everything on drugs now
i wonder
that's kind of side tracked
i just remember seeing on the news the other night they had the thing about how catholic schools are doing so much better i thought of course they're doing better and not so much when i was growing up
they still had a better success rate simply because they started with a lot better raw material
everybody that went to a catholic school at least had education as a priority like you said and kind of had a whole conducive atmosphere to it
i wonder if not so much that
i think like you say it's the socioeconomic mix
they're
you look at the schools like that where you've got a lot of kids that might be more well off going to a private catholic school or whatever
they're not all that way
some that are they're not quite the same as the kids that are going to the inner city public schools
this was actually inner city people were sending
just because their kids had the ability and the drive to try and get an education they didn't send him to a public school
in a lot of cases like that where if kids are going to a public parochial school like that it's because the parents are more interested in them receiving an education i think it shows that the parents have some desire for the kid to do well
that may be passed on down to the kid as well
maybe they pick up on that
from the other aspect maybe the school itself has more emphasis on trying to do a good job because the classes may be smaller
they may be able to give the resources that's needed to do a good job
what would you do to fix the school systems
with
i would try i guess to see about getting parents more involved try to come up with more ways to do that stress the importance of education to both the parents and the students and more classes i think that are
i think this is happening some around the country in terms of morals trying to teach the kinds of things that aren't getting taught at home and respect for other people
i think that's a big part of it
people
if you don't care about property and people you're not going to care about learning i think
i wonder a lot of times people literally tear apart their own schools vandalism wise
you get
it's been a while since i been in high school
i can't remember exactly what goes through their head when they're doing that
you got to think in a way it's kind of a outward showing of that they don't think they have a chance of doing anything and take it out on the school
i
that's not an easy task
that's why i say it's a tough question what would you do
because even trying to instill those values is kind of hard when you're growing up in a home which may be just the pits
you don't have any kind of a good environment to live in
it's kind of hard to say you need to take care of other people's stuff as well when you barely have anything yourself
i think it's
i guess because i work quite a bit with lawyers that i find a lot of things are so specialized that i'm not sure
i look at it more from the civil side of things that juries have any sense of the value of and worth so that they have real problems when it comes to
they can find guilt or innocence then when you quantify things and might also hold criminal trials for how many years is appropriate that they might leave it to somebody else who has expertise in that
i don't think the jury should be the ones that put the sentencings down
even a panel of lawyers if it got to that point might be better than just regular civil people
not knowing exactly what things are from murder on up to like tax stuff
because i find that
as a say i tend to be around civil cases because i've been an expert witness some
many matters are so complicated that it's so hard to come up with the fair value or the fair sentence
one thing that you get if you have some expertise is the range of possible values or terms or how heinous was the crime
that
most juries over a period of five or ten years you might sit on three
how do you relate as to whether this particular armed robbery was worth five years or twenty-five
most people that do sit on juries
some people just sit on them once in their lifetime if they're that lucky sometimes
or whatever the case may be and may not have any idea of what the standard punishment would be for it
they may have some different idea
it might be more important for them to put a sentencing down that was longer that the punishment didn't fit the crime
or not long enough or whatever the case may be
i think the judges do have that better knowledge of it
the only thing i worry about sometimes is if you get somebody in there that has a name that is the defendant and sometimes might have more pull which does happen
we can't say it doesn't because it does happen
not everybody has the right morals sometimes
people can be paid off politically or whatever the case may be
sometimes that's not real fair either though
one of the others things that gets me on the juries is that often in the newspaper i tend to hear two things that go on
many of those get overturned or get reduced in terms of sentences or get changed by a judge or an appeals court
that never makes the press
when you or i as an individual gets on a jury we tend to have certain mental images of what's what because we see the headlines
we don't have again a lot of knowledge
we don't know what is really going on what is really the range of sentences or awards that are actually in the end applied
also what i don't think is fair either is when you have say a rapist come in
his attorney gets his sentencing reduced because he's gone to a lesser charge i don't know what assault or something or
which doesn't make any sense to me either
the person that was raped or whatever doesn't
they're put on they were the ones that caused it or whatever
to me when you do the crime then you should pay for whatever you did
you shouldn't be able to go on the lesser charge
i don't think that's right because all's that's going to do is say that was a breeze
i can go out and do it again and have the same thing happen
that's not right
that's where the role of juries is restricted
i'm not sure i'd want to change that aspect of it
one is it's restricted in the sense that juries only decide the charges that are actually brought if it's first degree rape second degree rape or whatever they only get to decide on that
okay this person has been charged with first degree rape
you can decide guilt or innocence on that
such like maybe in murder they get to choose whether it's premeditated or one or two of the lesser degrees
the other thing that juries are restricted on and at least to me this has been one of the frustrating things even in my own experiences that you usually don't get to hear all the information
i don't know that juries have a right to know more because in a sense we call those safeguards
often juries hear only a fraction of the story when they have to decide guilt or innocence
to me how can you make a decision if you don't have all of the evidence in front of whether it pertains to the case or not
somebody thinks it had because they've got it there
the two lawyers are the ones that have all the information
the truth that's brought out is as i say when i've heard about
the whole truth and nothing but the truth is that they want
they don't want the whole truth
you can say
because stories look very different when you hear different parts of the truth
that's just like that old witness game
it's a game kids play too
somebody did it just for your train of thought where they showed something
they asked
there were four people
okay let's see
social changes
that sounds like not as recent social changes too back to the sixties or fifties i guess
there's plenty of things to talk about there
i was hoping that you would
it seems to me that
areas i think
true today
there is a big difference in the economic status of people although i think that has been true always
they start out very poor
i think
we're home schooling
things that relate to education
for instance
things that are being taught in the home are not taught in the home rather more not than are and children being put in day-care centers from very early
i think that a lot of these things that have been happening such as the day-care centers and things are having a big effect on the social changes
they don't have the self-esteem that they need to have
they don't have a solid family life that they need to have to confidently deal with the things in the world
i think we're seeing a lot of rebellion and things because of that and the things like the gang things that are happening
None
it seems like
some of these even ladies that'll work and have
a baby and then after two or three months
that's very young for a baby
they think they have to
i think that if they really tried they wouldn't have to
i think that if they didn't and it became more of the standard not to that i don't know maybe companies would start paying men more so that their wives could stay home and have a more solid foundation for the kids
they're going to
you said they might be saving money
even if they had to pay more now in the long run it's going to cost society more to force two people to work even though it's higher productivity is short-term
it already costs society much more because of it
it
trying to do all these programs like headstart and things like those you wouldn't have to do that if mothers would stay home with their children and do things with them
i think a lot of it is selfishness
there are a lot of two parent
rather than she needs the money just she wants the stimulating environment
she does it partly because of the money but partly for herself too
it's interesting w-
is it like a preschool level then or through grade school or
i have one going into fourth grade and one starting kindergarten and then a preschooler
i s-
you sound busy
you're teaching them
i think it's becoming more popular then it has been for a while i think
i can see more and more families going to it because of the problems in the schools
a lot of it is discipline problems
you can tell which kids have been in day-care centers
it's really obvious to look at them and watch the way they act and things
that's pretty sad because i don't know something's got to change with the schools
that's where it all starts
if we don't start making changes in the homes
educating
i know they do have some classes in high schools
the aids issue is a bit of a problem
i guess the first thing that comes to my mind not having any immediate friends with that problem is the financial end
how can a country stand to spend as much or much more than they already are on such a problem
then that kind of thinking is also tempered with the knowledge or at least the rumor that we're not spending as much per let's say afflicted person on cancer
there's some
it seems to be doing much more damage and affecting many more people than aids
yet more people die of it
yet the funding has already exceeded
aids has more money than breast cancer
that's interesting isn't it
if it's true
i've always heard these things
i've heard it on more than one documentary that they were complaining that whoever's sitting up there making these decisions or whatever institutions raise the money and
let's give money to aids
yet we've had breast cancer problems for years
it's just
course one of the shows i saw was taking it from the angle that since it doesn't effect men it's not going to get funded
having thought about that for a while
then i got to thinking the number one killer of men seems to be the prostate
there's only one test that just recently got developed a antibody test for the antigen in the blood
that's fairly recent
yet men have been dying from prostate cancer for years
it's not really cured
it's not that heavily funded either
that seems to be one of the major problems that men have in the realm of cancer
i don't know
i guess there's just some strange public opinion as to who they want to give to be it through different organizations march of dimes type telethons or bicycle rides or whatever how they fund whatever illness they wish
it's kind of hard to get an even keel on that
it's really hard to say
there's a hundred thousand per year affected by this one
let's give it this amount
this other one's only a tenth of that
give it a tenth of that and just keep
i'm glad i'm not the one that's in charge of making those decisions
you wish that there could just be money for all these problems because they're all so serious
it's not so serious i guess until it affects your family
all of a sudden it's the most important thing
then again we really do have it as a society to decide which things we need to address
i guess it frightens me to think
many of those things if they're not able to be insured then the country's going to pay for it one way or the other
whether it's through prevention or
the other thought that i had
i've had several minutes to think about this after i
while i was finding people i could think about the topic longer than the person that receives it
it's kind of a unfair advantage
the other thing that i thought of on this is i wonder if there isn't enough money in our economy or in our system
it seems like there's so much that goes to things that don't really do a whole lot of good
yeah
we have such an affluent society that i wonder if we took a little from here and there and the other if we might wind up with a cure for just about everything
you hear these ridiculous figures for pizza
you hear these phenomenal amounts of dollars spent for this that or the other
you have all the arts that are nice and aesthetic
are they that enhancing for the masses
had all that donation and time and labor and effort gone toward something else
me too because i eat out a lot
i travel
i do about forty percent of my time on the road
you eat all your meals out
i'm also married
my wife is an a one cook
she enjoys eating out
i have to share it with her
actually it's very easy for me because i make it a practice when i am out
i look for just about anything
it's a lot of fun
i don't have to really worry too much about price considerations because i
i was going to ask you could you go to nice places
it's really great
i like different types of food
what are the memorable places you've eaten
okay you name it
you've got one down near addison
there's two restaurants that i particularly like that every time i get into texas or i get into atlanta georgia i make sure i go
that's houston's
it's great
there's a restaurant right outside of reading pennsylvania that does not look like a restaurant that you would really want to recommend to a lot of people
it is fantastic
there's a restaurant in panama city
of course not too many people want to rush back to the country panama
i was thinking
i grew up in panama city
this is the country panama all right
i have gotten to quite a few
i go to canada and get quite a few restaurants up there
i know the locations
i know the places
lot of times i don't remember the names
particularly down in your area i'm looking for some more restaurants
i don't know what's down there
which one were you going to recommend
there's so many places here
it's just lots of good mexican restaurants here
in the addison about everything that you could want in dallas is in the addison area anyway
now there's a new italian place sfuzi it has a great reputation as one of the best restaurants in dallas
now there's one in addison
i'm writing it down
it's s f u z i
it's in addison
it's a great place
also a great place that they have cajun food is copelands
i really like copelands
one down there is i think it's an old schoolhouse
the i know
i like the food
i don't care for the clowning around
None
when i went i thought the food was not good
i've had
when i went i thought
the people drove me crazy first of all then i just thought the food was over priced for what it was
that's great
do you like southwestern
now there's a good place in addison too called blue mesa grill that's on belt line that's close to houston's as a matter of fact
it's great
they have i think
sometimes i've been when i thought it wasn't as good
i went there recently
i thought this really is good
that's a very good place to eat the blue mesa grill
this is great
they haven't beeped us have they
they don't always
i thought sometimes they say this is three minutes or whatever
they've been doing that when the circuits are busy other than that they leave you go about five minutes
that's about it
thanks for calling for helping us out
i've had one for quite a few years
i've not had one the last couple of years
it's something i've always enjoyed
do you like boating
we were using it less and less and less
we decided to sell it
i heard that's the second happiest
i loved having a boat
he needs his weekends free
you take care of them
you couldn't complain about that
i had a hundred sixty horse
i did fish out of it occasionally
i'm not too much of a fisherman
i did enjoy owning a boat
None
i just like fourteen foot sunfish
i'd want to be with a skilled sailor
they offer classes out at ray hubbard
i've always thought i'd like to
at this stage of the game i'm not that interested in it anymore
we go out and take them out on their barge
they like us to take them out on their barge quite often
that's nice
we get out on the water occasionally
None
i do enjoy the lake
once the children were grown
we'd go down there
i'd get the boat out on the saturday
we'd go for a ride and enjoy it so much
i'd say i'm going to leave the boat out because we'll probably do this again tomorrow
it got to where tomorrow the boat was still sitting there
we never did go out again
i'd have to go load it up the next day
mount vernon
cypress creek springs
what do you take i thirty-five
you go down
did you
we love it up there
i think you'll like it better
of course it's hard when you don't have any family around
we got two kids that are under two
it's kind of tough when my folks call and they want to see them
it's hard on your folks too
your wife's folks still live in colorado
there are supposed to be some people moving down here from colorado springs for t i
that's right
a friend of mine's dad was a program manager up there
it's a good company
we're supposed to be talking about boats
back to boats
tell me the last time you went for a boat ride
actually i went canoeing down the brazos this weekend
my gosh that's boating
what are your hobbies
actually my hobbies now are t shirt making
that sounds interesting
what kinds of sweat shirts and t shirts do you make
right now i'm making christmas ones with poinsettias and bears and all that kind of thing
you
there's this stuff called wonder under that you iron it on
you iron that on the t shirt you paint around it
i see
it's real fun
i started doing it as just something fun to do
now i'm selling them and pretty
how's it going
i sold seven
i wasn't expecting that
that sounds great
somebody has to do it
that's right
what are your hobbies
i kind of have hobby fads i guess
when i was growing up i was into coin collecting
that dropped off about the time i hit puberty i guess
my hobbies in high school went just to the sports
i had a sixty-six mustang i was rebuilding
i went ahead and sold it
my gosh
it was fun
you just
how'd you learn to do that to fix them up
all i did is i bought the car
you can
i was just in a supermarket
i seen a magazine for
basically it was called mustang magazine
i bought it
they had some names some companies that sold mustang parts
i just started ordering some parts
basically what i did was i redid the whole interior
i didn't do too much to the engine because the engine was pretty good but the whole interior and then part of the exterior
we lived in south dakota
i bought it up there before i moved down here
it was kind of rusted out there
that's true
that sounds neat
gee i guess there really isn't too much to talk about on hobbies
that about covers mine
t shirt making about covers yours
let's see
i collect dolls
let's see
probably about twenty
do they all play different songs do some of them play the same song
they all play different songs
that's neat
i usually get them for christmas gifts and when people go on trips or something
that's interesting
i never collected those
that's interesting music boxes
i have a lot of dolls
i did that when i went to europe one summer
i was in high school
i was in a tour
we went all
it's kind of to establish better rapport with the different countries
it was called people to people
we'd stay in people's homes
we got to also tour big cities
i really enjoyed it
was that in high school was that a college thing
i'd like to go back because we had
everything was rushed everything was an hour or two hours at the louvre
it really
that sounds real neat
you haven't been back to europe since then huh
who knows now
does you husband
what does he think of your t shirts and
he likes it all right
i guess cadillac
why would that be
i guess it's a general motors product
i like general motors because they're made in the united states
we've had general motors for years and have always had real good luck with them
that's good
if you had no financial requirements if you could buy any car in the entire world no matter what it cost what would you buy
i think i'd still go with the cadillac
i don't care about a big fancy
which type of cadillac is your favorite
i don't know
it always has been though
i've always liked
i liked the
a couple years they had where the trunk head would look like belt buckles across the back of it
i thought that looks sharp that looks real sharp
i think the ones now with all of the fancy gold lettering and all i think they're very pretty
course a vinyl top i think those are pretty
the
i've never ridden in one recently
they're supposed to be just real smooth
they're just always
they look like they're sturdy
now they've got a unique feature in them now
if you have a front end accident at such a rate of speed the engine will actually drop out of the car so that it doesn't go into the inside
i didn't know that
that's a big safety factor they've got in them now
i suppose they all have the balloons
that's great
you say you've always have preferred general motors products
i go for things built in the united states rather than foreign countries
what kind of
of course if i have a choice i'd still have the cadillac
i've been very satisfied with the oldsmobiles
i don't think
let's see
that's got that big v eight engine in it doesn't it
i don't know
it's a very good car
it's not had one minute's problem with it
now i have twenty-three thousand miles on it
that's great that's great
that's always nice to get reliability in a product especially when you're spending anywhere from fifteen to twenty-five thousand dollars for a single item
you expect it to do its job
i think a lot of car manufacturers don't take that into consideration
that's been a key factor in me is how reliable is this car going to be
price is an issue
it's not the most important issue
it really isn't because now you can get five year financing on them
None
i would go with the general motors any time
i've always been a ford man myself
that's all right
it's american made too which is good
i've
ever since i guess i was growing up my dad's always had fords
i grew up in south dakota
everybody has a truck my ford trucks have just
i've just never had problems with them
let's see
invasions of privacy
what most annoys me are all sorts of phone calls trying to sell me things
my sense is that something may just have been done about it by congressmen
i guess in some cases they just consider pickup your phone and not let you use your phone for a while whether you hang up on them or not
i thought i saw something about it having some kind of provision that people could specify that their phones were not for commercial using
businesses would be prohibited from calling for business selling you things
the phone company
some of did too
i think government can do that now
and especially with possibly children around
that could be useful protection
i don't have children around
i just don't like those nine hundred numbers
i used to deal with
it does not stop you from the dialing services
where they intend to sell you things
where people just call you
leave again that canned message on the
those problems has been eliminated
i did not like giving it out
i gave out my work number i think i'm not sure if it's by law just
that's the thing i hated too about radio shack
i don't think they're going to call me and ask me how it's functioning
i don't give that out
i don't
that's one solution
you nonetheless often get people calling you
you actually have your number
are they just calling a number that happens to be yours
companies can purchase this list
what that is is people who buy from the mail
they have a whole list of addresses and list of phone numbers
is there anything you can do about that like give out a phony phone number
some of that unfortunately is legal
they can't stop people from advertising
that's what it falls under
i don't care for it
is it a legal solution for some companies
that's the way things are
they
the telephone is not the only invasion of privacy
you've got all kinds of people knocking on your door and who want to either direct you to the right path or want to sell you paper routes whatever
it's not just the telephone
it's right up your alley then
i sense that it's not going to happen anytime soon
i wish it were
i got my bachelor's in mechanical engineering
all we do is metric stuff
everything's metric
you go to read some order book or something
it's all confusing
i don't understand as much
i think we should get one adopted permanently
i guess that is the policy
it's been the policy for a long time
nothing ever happens
i suppose some things happen slowly simply by having it taught in the schools more to the extent that that's happening having a new generation come up that's more used to it
i guess it's easier to switch back and forth than it used to be because of computers coming into everything
i think people need to understand more what a meter is instead of how many feet in a meter or something just get used to using all the terms
someone says a kilogram
everyone wants a conversion of that before kind of recognizing it as a concept to hold in mind
i don't see that it can change it very quickly
we're not the kind of society that something can be posed upon by government will
metric system no one wants it at all seems like
the public is just very conservative that way in refusing to change measurement systems money dollar coins anything like that
None
it's pretty tough when you get everything confused though
i know we do a lot of problems and things
they're half english and half metric
even if it's english they should just have one
unfortunate- i think people like you are relatively rare who are coming up against this problem every day
your average guy jogging down the highway wants to know how many miles it is to his destination
we have signs up on the n i s t campus here speed limit twenty-five miles per hour forty kilometers per hour
that hasn't been adopted very widely
it says metric signs next hundred miles
you have highway signs saying speed limit eighty eighty-five whatever would be the appropriate number
it would be more like ninety i guess
you suddenly
do you know where you are
down like in the elementary schools
in the elementary schools
i think
we never actually went out and measured anything or did anything on one system
i think my children learned the metric system
it doesn't get emphasized over the other
that's about it
what kind of vacations do you like
i haven't been to many places
i have a opportunity to go to paris france with my friend in april
her family lives there
she's only been there once
i'm praying i get to go
that's great
it will be probably the most exciting place i'll ever get to go
have you ever been to new mexico
no actually
i have been to europe once and to haiti and
it's in the caribbean
it's the western half of an island
i was down there with a program from the college that i went to where we would just spend three months in a foreign country most of them third world countries
what did you do when you were in europe
i went there when i was in high school actually i mostly went to germany and visited some friends of my family and hung out with them worked a bit on one of their farms and also went to a youth camp
not that much
are you just kind of sight just kind of
i wasn't a great asset to them or anything
i drove a tractor helped them weed beets and that sort of thing
yep
i went to a youth camp that included working at an old people's home
that was pretty interesting
while i was there i visited my aunt and uncle who were staying for their vacation in france in nantes which is on the west coast right across from england
where in france are you
how long do you plan to be going for
two weeks
we're only going to stay two weeks
that might be fun
cooking class
what else are you planning to do if anything
museums
actually no
the closest thing i did was go to some restored castles and stuff
there is some on that west coast of france
i went to a vineyard or two in germany
that's neat
None
where have i gone that's anywhere
short term i don't think anything's going to be done about it or probably should be done about it
are you saying you don't think anything should be done in the short term
the short term the recession is getting top attention
i think that you're absolutely right there
the other thing is is that we've got all these bank defaults going on and savings and loan defaults and
that effectively adds to whether it's officially on the books or not
that's got to be paid
this creates a pretty serious problem that's going to continue to be with us for a while to come
i'm not really sure that i even understand why the administration is proposing for instance tax reductions because it seems to me that if they're talking about reducing the tax that needs to be paid or the tax that's currently being paid then it seems to me it can't possibly help with the deficit picture
the severity of the deficit picture already limits the options available or limits the degree of tax cutting you can do without bringing on serious problems for the longer term
that's the current predicament
it seems like it's a kind of a catch twenty-two
it's the
my understanding is what supposedly they're trying to do by reducing taxes is to kind of jump start the economy the idea being that if people have to pay less money in taxes they'll have more money to spend
if they have more money to spend then that will be a spur to productivity particularly commercial productivity which in turn will generate revenue
it seems like it's sort of an unending spiral
it
i'm not sure that there's any real genuine truth to the idea that decreasing taxes particularly the kinds that are being recommended bye-bye the bush administration and things like capital gains taxes and so forth is going to result in substantial amounts of money for consumers to spend
i'm not sure how i feel about paying on the long term quests that tax cuts are worth at this point
it would seem to me that there are other things that the administration could do
first of all you look to the fed to fight the recession as indeed it has with interest rates
i think what that's done is it's help keep inflation from
at the moment we're doing very well on inflation
what kind of things do you think can be done in the long term
can be done or will be done are two different things
at various places to look for cutting the budget first of all i consider more defense cuts than are already planned depending on the world situation
there are various other areas such as farm subsidies that ought to be slashed
a lot of entitlement programs like education aid i think they should put in
the reagan administration took all such entitlements to the poor but left them for the middle class
in the longer term we'd do well i think to make reductions there
i think that i agree with you certainly in the second situation
i think certain entitlements i'm inclined to agree with you too
education happens to be one place where i think that we would foolish to
i see what you're saying
schools that teach you trades beautician often exists only because of the federal programs that they can take people and tell them they can get loans for their full tuition and the school gets paid off immediately they don't provide very much education
the people default on the loans
i would have to agree with you if there are circumstances like that around
i can't confess to having any substantial knowledge of that sort of thing
taking what you're saying at face value then i would have to agree with completely
i do too
i like to cook i don't like getting too awfully fancy about it just because it's too much pressure
i don't like when they arrive for me to be completely worn out
it's like yes
people would come and say would you come over and make lasagna for me
it's like i can't really give you a recipe i can just do it
it's fun
we did lasagna and garlic bread and yummy
boy i like that
i do too in fact
i'm planning a
naturally this is appropriate because i'm planning dinner for people tomorrow night and then the next night
tuesday night there'll be eight people here altogether
actually one thing we have done quite a bit through the holidays just because it's real easy is just baked potato dinners
have three or four couples come over
i'll do the potatoes and butter and cheese and stuff and have everybody else just bring a couple of toppings whatever they like it turns out great because you've got hot sauce and taco meat and barbecue and bacon and all that good stuff
it's inexpensive plus it's real easy on the hostess because you can just have the potatoes ready and just have a salad with it
you got a great dinner
it's real easy
i'm in favor of very little clean up very little planning
it's fine because then i can just say okay fine
it's pretty cool
one of my favorites if i don't want to have other people bring stuff i just want to treat them is to make chicken and rice
i love it
you do
you put rice in the bottom of the pan
you pour bouillon or chicken broth over it you put the chicken in then pour the broth over
you can put mushrooms in if you want
you just
over uncooked rice you can either microwave it
it just
how neat
it's really moist
i've done it where cook the rice and then take a can of cream of mushroom soup or cream of chicken soup and put a little bit of white wine in it
every once in a while i'll slice white grapes
i'll put in there
that's just because i'm not a real big wine person
i like it
just bake it
it makes a wonderful sauce over the rice
i'll keep that one in mind
that was one of the first things i made for my husband because i was
yeah i could actually find something i could cook real easy that would be sort of elegant kind of
you know semi
then i hadn't thought about doing it with uncooked rice
just in a thirteen by nine pan
you put in let's see what was it three quarters of cup of rice
you have to put the water in proportionally
i think it was three quarters cup rice to two cups water two cups broth
i use that for rice
for when i cook pasta or something i'll put a little bit of bouillon in there just to give it a little extra flavor
that would be good
let's see
i've done it in the microwave so often lately because it's really easy
i do microwave too a lot
i think it's about an hour
maybe it's only half hour
how long would it be in the microwave
you just
until the rice looks fluffy and not overdone
before it gets overdone
do you just brown the chicken to get it colored do you go ahead and let it cook through
i'd let it cook just a little bit just so that the cooking goes a little faster
this is a beneficial call
that one's an easy one
a friend of mine makes it where she goes ahead and seasons up with the soup and the wine put in garlic and onion powder or chopped onions if you want to do that what ever however much effort you feel like putting into it
it makes a great
i've got a two year old and a four year old
they love it
my daughter calls it her gravy
None
did you watch the bulls this morning
i watched a little bit of the bulls game
i had to leave
in fact i think the bulls were ahead when i left
they won by two points
they were behind as they headed into each quarter
they came back in the second half
at the end i think they looked like they were closing it out
detroit kept coming back
isaiah missed a three point attempt
i think the bulls won by two
one of the commentators said that they expected that the bulls would if they continued at their current pace set an n b a record for seventy wins in a season
they do
they
i think by relieving some of the pressure off of
they don't have to rely on him to score thirty or forty points at every game
they're balancing their attack
i think they look like they'll repeat although here in the bay area people are real impressed with what don nelson's done with the warriors
i know
None
i saw the second half of the game last night
they were impressive
i haven't kept up with what was going on with the
they traded away mitch richmond
is it tim hardaway
one of the two who along with chris mullen was
they made a heck of a threesome
they traded either richmond or hardaway to sacramento for billy owens
the warriors have got a team
i think that will be real interesting to see what they can do
the lakers are down i guess in fourth position in the west
i don't know
in the east i don't know
is it boston in first place
i think boston's in first
i'm so depressed with the dallas mavericks
just this whole year has been just disastrous for them
i think they're going for an all time record of how many losses in a row
actually the dallas area here pulls for dallas
san antonio pulls for san antonio
houston pulls for the rockets
there isn't much crossover
not a whole lot
you find them to be pretty loyal with the local teams
i guess it's kind of like there in the bay area you don't find a whole lot of sacramento fans
san antonio isn't that close to you are they
it's about the same distance from here to san antonio as it is from there to sacramento
it's not something you'd drive
it's not really a local
he does a lot of local stuff there in san antonio
they have got a great club
of course drafting a franchise like him certainly
that's i think that's the way it works now in basketball
magic was a franchise for the lakers and bird for the celtics
i used to think that one player really doesn't make a club
it really does
you can see the decline in that team
once he left it's not the same team
i think you're right
i think isaiah thomas would fit in detroit
i think those things do make a difference
there are marquee players
i think jordan and the bulls have to be considered the likely favorites
i don't know how good portland will turn out to be by the end of the year
i watched only a few minutes of it
i wasn't paying attention
i don't know
phoenix and portland have both been very good clubs
i guess we're forced finally to do a lot about air pollution
low polluting fuels are being experimented with ethanol and other types of fuels
i assume
i don't know for sure
i just know that acid rain apparently is a big problem in canada from
i think the automobile definitely is an area and any industry that burns
i don't know about chemical pollution
i don't know if that affects outside
i think seems to me that's what they were asking about was outside
the only thing i can think of would be cars and factories
i guess there's been a lot of pressure to do away with the c f c's in these spray bottles which
that's destroying the ozone isn't it
again that's what i hear
there's this big debate apparently about whether there's a hole in the ozone or not
at last i heard it was discovered that the hole was bigger than they thought
it is scary
i think it will continue to force us to clean up our act
i think something too that you probably see in older states all we do it down here once in a while we will have a cold spell is where people will use their fireplaces
i'm wondering whether it's going to get to the point where you can't
they've passed laws that for habit for example people using barbecues prohibit
gasoline lawn mowers
it's really bad in places like los angeles
it's not too bad around here although you see it more and more in the sky
people in this country are really wedded to their cars
our economy seems to
this i think is one of the big problems
in this area too since in texas we're so spread out
i know in colorado i have witnessed that where it just stacks up when the rockies starts
we're even getting it here
we can when we've been on vacation or something drive into fort worth or dallas
you can tell it in the mornings too
there's just a brown fog here
we don't even have any mountains that are
they also said that more dense the population and the more we crowd together the worse it gets
that makes a lot of sense
i hadn't thought about it that way
it
they making more and more high-rise buildings
yeah
we didn't see this a few years ago
i think
i think that more and more it's becoming apparent to people that the earth which includes all the people on it and everything that's going on it is an organism of sorts
and that there is a whole set of organic relationships that if we start to destroy one part of it it's going to tell us about it
we're going to feel it
i think it's going to be real interesting and particularly in light of what is obviously going to be a big structural change in the economy
in this country whether people are willing to get out of their cars
in this country the solution that people seem to think work are politically unacceptable
i have a little sports car that i enjoy using
i know just like anybody else how much fun it is to drive
i think we're going to have to make some fundamental changes
i'm not sure how long it's going to take or what it's going to take because they keep saying that the economy is going to depend on how many cars and
it's a shame too when you do see somebody driving a big car just one person in that
are you married
do you have a family
yes i am to both questions
do you and your wife have a budget plan for your finances
we
basically there's the expenses that are fixed during the month the ones that come every month
we enter those into a spread sheet
whatever is left after that we sit down and agree on kind of what sort of range we are generally going to shoot for
i see
that's basically what we do
about every three months or so
we sit down and just write from the largest bills down to the smallest we divvy them up between our four pay checks
i work part time at night my husband works full times days
we have four checks
that works out nice because we get paid every week
that does help
we don't have a lot extra for extra spending
we have found that works the best
in fact we found it easier to divide the major bills up cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half
we are not taking a huge sum out of one
the next pay check we're real short
we found that
it's definitely helped get a handle on kind of the unnecessary expenses
we
it helps you to focus where your money goes i am sure you felt the same frustration before you got on a budget
you're saying my word where did all that money go
also we have found that if we write down
we did this
we did it for about a month
we wrote down everything that we bought
it was really interesting to see
like i say we haven't been real consistent with it
the other thing that we've found that helps is we tend to fudge on the budget a little bit it's just to get up the money in advance and put it in so long as it wasn't unreasonably high but for things like food expenses or whatever just put it
that way it kind of forced us to
just stick to that
and then
if the entertainment amount was gone for the month say it's gone
that sounds like a really good idea
it really helpful
have you developed a savings plan or i r a s or anything like that yet
we haven't
our initial goal was just to completely retire debt for car payments and
we are just at a point where we could start thinking about it
that's good
are you still going to school
i am actually
i guess we're talking about exercise
first of all i have to ask you how old you are
i am twenty-seven
i am quite a bit older than you are
i do exercise on a regular basis
you do
i do jazzercise which is an aerobic
it's a national company
we have a jazzercise center here in plano that has classes all day long
you can
is it the same thing
it's an aerobic routine
you warm up
you have thirty minutes of aerobic activity starting slowly and then working up to a high heart rate
you gradually go down again
you do that every day
this is a club
do you belong to a group
you buy as many classes as you want to
you just go in whenever you can
i usually choose to go at nine thirty in the morning or a nine fifteen class or a ten thirty class in the mornings
do you go alone
that's one of the frustrating things cause i can find very few people to go with me most of my friends that are my age don't exercise
they might play tennis since i am not a tennis player i don't get that
i am in my late forties there aren't many people that want to do that
most of the people that are in the classes are young mothers with children between the ages
young women
what do you do
i really don't have a routine
that's what i do every day
who do you play with
that's about it
when i graduated i haven't done much
i don't have a problem with weight
that's really good
i think that keeps some people from exercising
i don't have a problem with weight either
i think i don't have a problem because i exercise
people are always saying to me how do you stay thin
it's because i
you'll come
being twenty-seven you don't really have to worry about your heart rate and that yet as you get older you will
i everyone's told me my waist line is going to expand one of these days
it might not
everybody's been telling me that too
so far it hasn't happened
i just feel like
that's why i've kept active in that way
you don't play any other sports but basketball
do you ski
i use to
it got too expensive
did it really
i know that skiing in utah is suppose to be
a lot of people do that
i have never skied before
i have friends that go to utah all the time
they come up here
they think it's really they ski
is it tahoe where you ski from
there is a place in utah called a funny name
it's like heavenly
i've never heard of that one
maybe it isn't in utah
they said they've skied heavenly
do they exercise much for skiing
i've talked to people
most of these people ski enough so that they don't get sore
i am really sore after
is it your quadriceps that are the worst
it's strange that you can do like i did aerobics all the time
i went horseback riding
still i was so sore
i couldn't get over
to tell you the truth i think jury selection is a prime discussion topic in terms of possible improvements on finding of guilt
i certainly can't argue with that
definitely does need some improvements
the lawyers can throw people out for no reason whatsoever just because they want to
the peremptory challenges are limited to i don't know how many
you can
only i got kicked out as the last selection
typically everyone gets involved in the jury process
i suppose an elitist might say you really want someone who is well educated to be able to winnow the facts from the prejudice
it still has to be a group of your peers
if it's your peers and you're not educated then
if you're a nincompoop on trial you'd have to have nincompoops to
you want a nincompoop jury because they'll sympathize with you a bit as well as hopefully being honest people and do their best to comply with the facts as they were presented to them
that's why the defense is there picking through them whereas at the same time the prosecutor sitting there picking through them because he wants somebody who will give him a guilty verdict if the facts warrant
i think the jury selection process is pretty neat
i don't think that the jury ought to be the ones picking the punishment afterwards
you're talking about the person's already been found guilty right many times i've seen on trials they have on t v the jury will make a recommendation as to leniency or as to the death penalty or whatever
i think that it should be up to the judge and the lawyers to make the decision as to what the actual penalty will be
i think that would provide a more fair sentencing procedure
i suppose you may be right on that
matter of fact i've heard that some of the information is prevented from reaching the jury like mitigating circumstances or preceding criminal record or things of this nature that
preceding criminal record according to the judicial process has nothing to do with the current crime
when it comes to sentencing for punishment of course if the person's never done anything bad before according to the judicial system then they're going to lean towards a slightly more lenient side
the jury's supposed to be notified of criminal records when it comes to sentencing by jury
is it
i didn't realize that
when it comes to what kind of sentence you're going to lay down i think that they should
i don't know that they always have because i never sat all the way through a jury trial
what you're saying is this if there is the second offense then you execute them
if it's a second offense the punishment should certainly be more severe than a first offense because obviously the rehabilitation process did not work the first time
you got to give them either more time in the system or a different process that will hopefully work better
when it comes down to things like alternative sentencing i'm all for that for small crimes infractions and misdemeanors or parking tickets or traffic tickets that have gone to warrant
what about white collar crimes like theft of trade secrets
say embezzlement right
you get a guy down the street who comes up carrying a kni-
with regard to jury trials i really feel as though whatever system has been used historically in particular jurisdiction is really the only kinds of things that you can use because the jurisprudence is based on accumulated body of law
if you have a situation where you change that body of law then all of sudden they could start going back and digging up all these cases that would be handled differently were they judged by today's standards
i really don't think they can really do much of anything to change it
it makes you wonder had the jury been a different group of people what would have happened with that outcome
the problems
maybe they used a little bit too much force with stuff like that
then the defense lawyer addressed each and every one of those blows apparently
that's bad
the other two guys sat in the car they didn't get beat up
rodney got beat up because he involved himself in some self-destructive behavior
None
everybody says this is the nineties
they're going to rebuild
it'll be even better
some black guy with capital is going to come in and invest in that area
with everybody with that mind set that whole area is going to be turned into residential ghetto
you might even be able to use it for a bombing test site
they're only going to suffer
they've defeated themselves with their looting and violence
i understand why they were upset by the verdict just because even those of us that aren't black or don't live there or whatever we all saw the same thing on the tape
everybody is saying this is going to be a new era
we're going to reexamine this thing
hey the average person is going to take a look at that and say suspicions confirmed
they're a bunch of animals
there are forty people that are dead as a result of that
i'm just trying to determine how you weigh rodney getting the hell beat out of him against forty deaths
there's no other
i'm not exactly sure what the circumstances surrounding the deaths
i'm very upset that the news media has not identified those deaths and pursued it because i'm interested in the circumstances surrounding this thing
i
or just an innocent bystander or somebody got actually beat to death or what
i suspect a number of them
you see film of people being pulled out of a car and shot in the street
or beaten
my reaction is i would have run over fifty people rather than stop
there would have been just nothing but carnage after if i'd been at the wheel
that's exactly how i feel too
they wouldn't have stopped my car for anything had i seen them coming
i was just wondering since you're back east and a little closer to the bigger cities than we are in idaho here
how capital gang they always say inside the beltway they think thus
i say wait a minute
i don't think like that
in what section of the government do you work
that's interesting
the reason i'm doing this whole thing is because rick
whose another government employee wanted segments of my speech
that were done a year ago
he wanted another collection a year later
this is my seventh call
i see
None
around here we have a program where we separate the bottles and the cans and the plastic stuff from the newspapers
we keep the newspapers in a
they're collected twice a month and the trash and this bottled stuff that is put in a little blue bin that's picked up and sorted out into a truck
they actually have about three passes at this collection one for the regular trash one for the the bottles and cans and one for the newspapers
i gather you do not separate the bottles and cans
they do that on the truck
they separate them as they dump them
one guy comes around with his truck and dumps it all in there
i think they're running out of
the sanitary landfill i think is running out
of course you being from new mexico you've probably been to washington especially if you're your present location
not only have i come to washington but i find it very amusing that the thing that was just instituted here is very similar
we also separate newspapers from all of the other stuff which goes into the bin and gets separated in the truck and landfill space is in deed the driving factor here
in fact despite all of our open space out here landfill space is still very hard to come by
my you've got a lot of nothing out there
there's got to be a crevice between two mountains that nobody gives a doggone about that you could use for landfill
if somebody can make a regulation about it they will
None
other than nuking it
in fact los alamos has done a fair amount of research in recycling things in general
it involves for instance creating biological organisms which can remove heavy elements like selenium and barium and other things from waste material in general and purify the waste of specific nasty elements
that's pretty upscale trash situation
i don't think anybody around here would understand all those exotic techniques getting rid of the heavy metals
the thing that just was in the local news bulletin was
they've looked at plutonium and uranium and some other similar things to try to remove those from radio active waste
again this is driven by all of the documentation and e s and h considerations that people are worrying about i think much more than they should
i've been involved in recycling for long before it became fashionable
back when i was in graduate school i did all of the recycling of the paper from the computer center
in fact i think i was the first person in our department to have my thesis published on recycled paper
that's certainly getting into the swim of things
i think it should go to the heart of the matter though and say okay guy
everybody gets five pounds of garbage that they can throw away
more than that every week you've got to pay by the pound
i think they'd be very careful about how they bought stuff
the only alternative i would see is if you did it by volume rather than by weight it would speak more directly to the space needs and the landfill
limiting the volume is probably a little bit closer to the real problem than limiting the weight
of course those big trucks probably are far more efficient in packing than any kind of little household compactor
my exercise program consists of
it's a opportunity to stay alive really
instead of trying to exist on the good health of my youth
what i like to do is i like to stretch out
i like to run m-
i like to run get my heartbeat up
i like to run about two and a half miles
i like to work out on the bailey life cycle machines up here at the holiday spa
i think that
i've had a regiment now for about ten fifteen years of doing that
i kind of think it's a lot of work
i think it's a lot of work
i think it's the amount of effort that's required to stay healthy
unless you do something like that you're going to get sick
i need to get
i'm pretty bad about that
i always say that i need to start running
i'm going to try and do that this summer
i never have time
i always put it off
i don't feel like going back over to the gym and running on the track or whatever
i'm getting a gut here
two years ago i started having trouble with my knee
i've got
i figured it'll go away
i've had to reduce my program
i've gained fifteen pounds
it's e-
i need to get back into swimming instead of running
i can't run i should be able to swim
i'm such a terrible swimmer
i really feel i can dedicate about an hour and fifteen minutes to this effort
if it gets longer than that i start not doing anything
i got a real problem in that regard
you obviously are not an exercise buff or else you'd be out there doing it
i do it i guess
i'm going to do it because i want to get in shape
it's not something i really enjoy all that much that i'll probably
once i get into it and if i get into better shape then it won't be as much of a chore to me
it's always a chore
i started doing this when i was about thirty-five now i'm fifty-five
i just know that i'm going to get blown away with some piece of nonsense
some health related thing is going to blow me away
i need to lose fifty pounds
i need to lose at least twenty
it's just i'm busy
it creates a problem when you're on the road
what other programs other than say running
have you ever done anything at all
also last summer i was doing nautilus
last year
got kind of expensive to renew they wanted another fifty dollars
doing a mix of nautilus and free weights i like that
what club are you with
it's called
you're downtown
i go to george washington university
you're down there on twentieth and eighteenth and f g
it's plaza
i'd
there's a holiday spa down there on k street i think something like that
i go to the holiday spa here in alexandria
that's pretty good
evening time it gets pretty busy
generally i can get in and get a program
i need to rededicate myself to doing this
i got a problem ever since my knee went bad of getting back solidly into it
i've been doing this for fifteen twenty years
i know it's going to bite me in the ass
i really don't want to back off on it
i think i'm young
at one point it's going to be too late to do it
you can recover
when you get to be my age and you start abusing your systems you get blown away
and just wind up having to kiss your ass good-bye
the object
the topic is to discuss the sources where i receive news
for me that's mostly newspaper and radio
i don't get news from television
why was c n n the only
it was unusual not to have the different sources of news coverage
i don't know
i guess i don't even know why i watched c n n
i know even if you watched a b c n b c or the other
what's the other one c b s
they all were tapped into c n n
like you i listened to radio on my job at work
all this week they have been having a discussion about that is why c n n was
i listen to a christian radio station
they were saying that c n n is definitely a world news service
they
you can't really be sure of the quality of what you've got
we had some people from our church went to israel just for a tour sort of thing
i was watching on tv
they broadcast this terrible riot
we got all fearful for our people come to find out they came back and said they weren't even aware of it
it really made me question as to how do we know if the news we're getting is any good
i'm from california
i can remember being in these earthquakes
they were very minor kinds of things from my point of view and it seemed from anyone else's point of view
they get all blown up in the news
i find it depressing to watch our
specially tv
it's just
we have a lot of bad stuff
then you wake up one morning
you are in war with somebody
you don't
what newspapers do you read in dallas
we have the dallas times herald and the dallas morning news
i don't read newspapers
i find it hard to follow from one page to another
it's just something i have never developed an interest in
i live in kind of a bad area where if i have the paper delivered it's stolen before i can get out and get it
gosh that sounds pretty bad to me
who would steal a newspaper
they just come by and pick them up even if it's just for the tv selections of the day
you're right
from los angeles
i live in raleigh north carolina right now
i grew up in l a
you work for t i
i know some people at t i
i have a couple of students who have graduated and gone to work for them
i'm in the computer business
let's see i've never done this before
i've never
i don't know
i think we've been talking for three minutes
nobody has interrupted
i got into a conversation last night with a lady
they interrupt at ten
if we've done our three minutes
all right
i guess i would first identify myself as middle aged
having seen the last generation i guess it gives me a perspective on that
there's no doubt about the fact that when i was first graduated from college the impression was that a woman's career would consist of a childbearing years and perhaps a return to the office but not necessarily
i think the change that i've seen as much as anything is one where couples are more carefully planning their intention on how to both share homemaking duties and also how women will have their children and then deliberately sort of plan how they go back to the work place
i guess that's a significant change that i've both participated in and noticed
i agree
the equality of the roles now between the sexes i guess has been dramatically demonstrated with this war especially compared with the vietnam war
you see women going off to wars as well as men
i have wondered why they allowed or let both the father and mother go
the children are left without either parent
to me that's kind of a drawback
i guess it's a price you pay
i also wonder about the children that are being brought up in the day care centers
from what i understand there's been studies that these children are more rebellious
they term it as more creative
but that they are much more contentious
i guess we'll have to see another generation to see what differences a child being brought up in kind of a community
i guess one knows one's own storly
i know in my children's case it was one where pretty much up until the older of two was let's see i guess basically starting junior high
the younger was in fifth grade when my wife reentered the work force
i guess my experience is just with what we did
they didn't really go through the child care route
we never actually experienced that
in terms of changes relative to women in the work place and the potential changes over the next generation or so i guess i anticipate an increasing equality greater presence of women in management roles i don't know whether there will be an increased amount of surrogacy that we see
deliberate childbirth by surrogate mother
None
not to be crass about it but
whether one might conceive
i could envision a society where that would happen and make an interesting story or whatever
i don't think i have a philosophical problem with that
i don't have other than a reading and male perspective on the biological urges involved relative to being a mother or not
my sense is that i have very much an interest and had one in being a parent
i don't know that i felt myself necessarily encumbered with the necessity to have heirs
i don't have boys
that didn't bother me
vision more women deliberately raising children either in surrogacy or as a professional nanny as you put it
it would be more of a family setting
i know that there are young people characterized i guess as being half my age so by definition that means
they're young in my work place who are both of them earning rather decent professional salaries who probably would consider paying a woman eight or nine or ten thousand dollars a year to take care of their child
or to put their child into a home setting
where they would leave at eight in the morning and drop a two year old off in a home where you knew there were going to be four other kids
you were paying for really high quality care
i have acquaintances of mine where i know that they are paying figures on the order of what i quoted to someone because that's the experience they want
i would imagine if there are more of people like that with an opportunity that's a possibility of a change that we could see in the next few years
you might have more control over the morals that they would be taught rather than in a classroom or a day care center
they're
no
of what they cost
i know several single mothers who absolutely can't afford it
they have to go with a baby-sitter more or less
i think it's about sixty dollars a week for two children if i'm not mistaken
you have to pay that whether you're on vacation and taking care of the children or if the children are at home
that is just a rate that you have to pay
what do you envision for the next twenty years as far as women in american society
i think that they will be more in the work place because the door's open
it's just human nature to walk through an open door
i would be glad to see that
it seems in my experience i'm running across single women all the time
i'm noticing that too
i notice a terming emerging called solo parents
that i'm very aware of the number of solo mothers that i encounter in the work place
that is a little troublesome
because the pressures on them are
rather formidable
maybe that's a change we'll see
maybe the possibility of women who deliberately say no
we'll let the man take care of the children perhaps
i think we've done it
i think we're about done
are you a freshwater or
i used to fish when i was real young down in galveston with my parents
i never really got into that too much because you have to get in the boat really to do anything
i didn't know anybody who had a boat
i don't fish too much in saltwater
mostly deep sea fishing for grouper and bottom fish i have caught one or two small sharks yes
the ones i caught were never large enough to really do anything
is that like a sport fish
there's no limit
my home is in pensacola florida they do a lot of shark fishing in the gulf there's a certain period of time during the year all along the gulf coast i guess from galveston to mayport they have shark tournaments
there's part
either as part of or separate from the bill fishing tournaments they usually have i have not done much lake fishing for bass and so forth but maybe some what they call brim and those sorts of things but nothing
a friend of mine no
i usually ended snagging my fishing partners or
do you fish mainly for trophies
do you eat what you fish
when i was working in florida i used to do a lot of surf fishing mostly for relaxation there are people who fish
there are people who catch
i'm a fisher
occasionally we'd go out on a full day trip three or four other people and do either again bottom fishing or for grouper
i've caught a few worthwhile snappers red snappers and gray snappers and so forth
what about you a
most of my fishing is done at area lakes around here freshwater lakes most of it
it just wasn't working with my freshwater tackle
we went fishing there last memorial day
i caught my first bass that was actually big enough to keep
that's really about it
i fish to take home and cook
i don't get too much joy out of just sitting and watching
mainly i want to say i brought something home
the last time i went bass fishing
i was with my daughter a friend of hers and a friend of mine and his daughter
i was the only one who did not catch
i did not even
i was out on a party boat a few years ago
we were grouper fishing
actually we were snapper fishing
everyone on the boat was catching snappers except guess who
couldn't catch one to save your life
the party boat captain could not understand
even he started baiting my hook
and holding the fishing rod
it was really really really bad
as i said i am a fisher
i enjoy it though
i don't really get out as much as i would like too
they do of course
we're forty five minutes to an hour away from the eastern shore here in maryland they do a lot of fishing there
of course what i used to like to do though is go snorkeling for scallops in some of the bays or for oysters
that i was able to do when i could go in and go down and actually pick them off the bottom
we were in rockport which is close to corpus we had been fishing in a canal
we'd been fishing in the canals
all we were catching were catfish
we were pretty bored with that
we thought maybe there are some crab in here
i got my chicken and all my little net and everything
of course there's no hook
it can't be a fish
crab they don't bite like that
i netted it
it was the ugliest fish i've ever seen in my life
it looked archaic
i had no idea what it was
it had the rock in it's mouth not the chicken
the rock itself is what it had grabbed
it was brown with these little white dots it made a loud almost a croaking noise like a croaker does it was the strangest thing
i'll never get over that
we used to
i guess the weirdest thing i've ever caught is in some of the inlets and the rivers around delaware
i don't know if you've ever heard of it it has a huge strong mouth
they actually use their teeth to open oysters
that's where it gets its name obviously
this is the ugliest
they come in all si-
i've caught them from three or four inches long up to
i don't think i'd want to even if you could if they're that ugly
they just look as though you do not want to do anything with them
it scared me to death
it looked like it was something out of the dark ages that just never died
the first time i went surf fishing was in
i threw my line out
the first thing i caught was a sand shark which was probably a foot
and a half or two feet long
scared me to death
i fished for another half hour or forty-five minutes caught a few white fish and so forth
then i felt something relatively heavy
i thought here i'm really going to get one
i try to refrain from their use as much as possible for a number of reasons one of which is the extreme interest rate on most of them
the one i use of course mostly only for business purposes is american express
not for my own personal point of view
plus from an economic point of view it has increased our debt tremendously to the tune of somewhere on the order of five to ten billion i believe at least that's one number for this range of numbers i have heard
me and my wife when we have extra money that we know we're going to have and we can put it in our budget yeah we'll use it
last year i think we paid
i think this year i think we used it for christmas
we got caught just a few days on our grace period
we'll pay a little interest this year but maybe two dollars
we don't like to do that at all
i think we feel about the same way you do real strongly
we have several credit cards though
i think we have a couple of department stores
we use it the same way
i find the one i use mostly
as with the american express i try to pay it as it comes in
it's not uncommon for us to have paid it before we even get the bill
i know when i used to travel overseas quite a bit what i would do on my american express card is before i left i would mail a check to american express and have some idea of how much was there
for hotels and so forth
i knew that it was paid
i knew that i had that much credit going in
sometimes i would go over
it wouldn't hit me in a big way because i knew that i would have it covered in that respect
i don't think we've gone that far
to pay it in advance before we spend it
i guess if you foresaw that you were going to have to use it like that
i found in traveling overseas that often it would expedite things to have an american express credit card for hotel bills and so forth
plus when they would send the bill they would automatically convert to the exchange rate
now the only time that got to be a problem was if the exchange rate changed drastically
for example i remember on one trip to france
just in a matter of a week or two the dollar fell against the franc drastically
when i finally got over there it had fallen two or three francs to the dollar
i got caught a little short in that regard
i was anticipating my room would cost let's say
there's a little consternation in trying to get them to compensate
as i said most of all i try not to use them lavishly in that regard
that's good
from where are you calling
from the dallas area
you're from dal-
i wonder how t i got g t e involved
i know jack godfrey
i'm also in the speech business
when i heard that jack was going to do this i called him and asked for an
that's how i got
you have a very
your speech is very exact
thank you very much
as jack said i'm one of the old hands in the speech business
i've been doing it for twenty some odd years
i was very much interested in getting involved in switchboard
you work for t i
i think you get ten
i think we're okay
you have a good evening
you too
what would you have at a dinner party
lately since i have children i've cut down on having dinner parties
i have one recipe for a really good type of a meatball
it's made with red wine and
it's really good
you can make it ahead of time and then make the sauce when you're ready to serve it
that's one of my favorite things to serve
i think it would probably depend on whether this was a formal or a informal dinner party
if it was informal my first choice would be crawfish
i guess being from that part of the country
crawfish everybody over here likes crawfish
i wouldn't have to worry about satisfying my guest
if it was a formal dinner party i would probably think of something else like
shrimp fettucini is real easy to make and everything
it's usually well liked by people i guess
None
make how do you cook crawfish
in fact i just came back from the grocery store
being in texas we don't have too many people that eat crawfish
they had live crawfish
you're not supposed to eat them dead
you eat them dead
because if they are dead for too long
you're not supposed to eat those because they're bad for you
i'll remember that
if you ever go in a restaurant order crawfish
every once in a while you'll see on-
it doesn't happen very often because it's just an accident
if the tail is straight on it then yeah
you just put some cajun lots of pepper
they're absolutely wonderful
they're a pain to peel for some people
i don't know
we'd just have crawfish and beer or something
there's a
it would just
it just depends on what type it was i guess
you can buy
usually you use those for frying
or to put in salads or to
you can go ahead and buy 'em cooked and shelled
they're more expensive of course
just the crawfish it just has a taste of its own
i think that
also to get totally off the subject of crawfish lots of vegetables and hors d'oeuvres and stuff like that for a dinner party i think that that really helps
in our family i am the one who who cooks
i really enjoy it
i really do enjoy cooking
we have them over for dinner
before i had my second child we sort of had a contest going where
he would cook and then the next time it would be my turn and i'd try to outdo him
that got pretty competitive
as
it was a lot of fun
it something unique
we got into different themes
or sometimes it would be
sometimes it might be the picnic out back
that's fun
we threatened to make the other two make us dinner one time
just to even it out since we seemed to be unfairly doing all the cooking
they were doing all the enjoying
ridiculous and terrible just to make sure that they didn't have to do it again
i'm doing a lot more cooking now
that's only because my mom just started working
i try to have things cooked for her
that's nice
i usually try to stay out of kitchen
it can be fun if you have the time
a lot of times it's too much of a rush really be able
of those meatballs again she owned every christmas and easter
whenever we have the big get-together over at her house she makes this meat ball sauce
it has
i'm sure she puts wine in it because she cooks everything with alcohol
i would be interested in getting that recipe for you if you have it around
it's in the other room
one of the unique things in this it's like a pound of ground beef some bread crumbs an egg whatever seasonings
salt and pepper and chopped up water chestnuts
which is something different
it makes them crunchy
that adds something new to it
the sauce is just made with
water burgundy wine and cornstarch instead of flour
it's not a thick
when you use corn starch in gravy like when you have chinese food
it gives it a bit of a different consistency
how long do you cook the meatballs
drain off all the grease
then what i usually do is i freeze them
when
probably you have to heat it up for a good
if they're frozen it may take a half for them to thaw out
then heat them thoroughly in the sauce itself
especially the fact that you can prepare the meatballs so far in advance
if
i'm sure that i'll be involved in a big company
i know that my
he's going to be
invite the boss over
None
have to take 'em out to eat
i've been doing a lot of things wrong i didn't know
they're wonderful
i will
i'm sure my husband will be surprised 'cause we were talking about them the other day before
what basketball teams are you interested in
i guess i'm a big l a laker fan
the college ranks i guess i really
that's b y u
they don't have much of a team usually
you never see them on nationally basketball
that's true
last year they had a really good team
they made it to the
they usually lose in the first round
i'm originally from the saint louis area
the only basketball team pro anyway in that part of the country is chicago
i do pull for chicago
of course this year is a good year to be a chicago fan i guess because they're doing pretty good
as far as college teams i know it's really easy to say
i've been pulling for duke for about four years now
i finally am feeling better about
they're on probation this year
you can't do much about that
did you watch the final four this year
None
i was very pleased with all three games because kansas
i was pulling for kansas on the other side
it was real nice to have the teams that were there
i
u n l v kind of gave me the impression of being a macho team
they seemed to think they were better than everybody else
maybe they were
i was real happy to see them get knocked off
i watched that game
it was a good game
it just
it looked like u n l v may have had more talent
as far as playing together as a team that day duke seemed to have them off balance
that they couldn't
they play the pro style is
the fast breaks and
u n l v wasn't used to that
of course i knew whenever u n l v went in at half time
i don't know if they were necessarily behind
they weren't ahead as much as they normally are
that meant that they had to play a second half
they've not had to do that all year
they didn't have to go through some tough games during the year
that's a terrible time to have to deal with that when it counts so much
duke's schedule was so much harder than u n l v's that it just made them a much tougher team overall
that had to help them a lot
i think that probably was the difference in that game
it really could have gone either way down to the end
do i take it that you think though that the lakers
portland's pretty good
they've got perkins
i don't think he's really been a super star for them
he's
he to me is not a center
he's more of a real tall forward
they'll make it
it's going to be a war between chicago and boston celtics
i think that's going to be one of those that's won by the home team
one of those two will probably be in there
let me see
detroit's in that same division
i don't know
detroit hasn't been having that great a year this year
as i heard isaiah came back this week
that might help them
they have the play-off experience
do- all three of them do
with larry bird back
they say he's starting to play
yeah he's been kind of up and down all year
one game and he'll be playing to where everything he throws up goes in
the next time he can't seem to hit the side of a barn
i don't know
i'm not sure about him this year
that's when
starting to be more consistent at the right time of the year
any dark horses i
the dark horses
san antonio is the dark horse that could really flip in there i think
anybody who has david robinson
he's got to be pretty much
i use to say akimo lija was the dominant player when he
robinson's getting up there where
it looks like he's going in for a dunk
they kind of just scoot out of his way or take a step back
nobody's got enough beef i guess to challenge him when he's driving hard to the hoop
he's
then he's gone now
i thought he was gone period
i didn't read the story
i read that
that might have been what it was
i guess the headlines said something about him that the mavericks released him or something
maybe i misunderstood what they meant
if they did they'd still have to pay his contract
yeah you never know
he was making
that's what he was being paid
boy what a good job he had
i'm looking forward to the pro play-off
is that portland
all i can do is hear about
they've got the two johnson brothers
they're not brothers
i mean there's two guys named johnson on their team that are really good or doing good or something
like i said they're doing extremely good right now
it ought to be a real interesting play-off
i don't think there's any clear pick
those are what makes a champion i guess
it's been nice talking to you
when you baby-sit what age group children do you sit with
all kinds
a few summers ago i kept two children every day for the entire summer
they became like my children
they live in an apartment complex
we swam a lot
we played on the playground a lot
we would go to a movie on thursdays
there was always an activity
they had their favorite t v shows and things like that that we watched
we took naps
i don't know
it just seems like there was always something to do
they just keep you going
was this a one parent or two parent family
one parent
i would get there at eight o'clock in the morning
she would get home at five thirty in the afternoon
they would have dinner
it was time for them to go to bed
at this particular time the children were two and six
then i also
i've been baby-sitting this child for about eight years
i've watched him grow up
he's like a little brother to me
it's changed over the years
we do different things now
now it's he likes to watch t v
he's into wrestling
i kept him on friday night
we went to go see a movie and things like that
i feel like i don't know when i have children i want to be able to spend a lot of time with them
you say you go to school
what are you studying
sounds like your
i love children
i don't know
when i was growing up my mom stayed at home with me and my brother until we were in junior high
i don't
i think it was very beneficial to us
in the summer we were always in the library programs reading books
we went skating a lot
she was just always there for us
nowadays if there are two parents to a family the mother works just as hard as the father does
the children stay at home and get into trouble
they're stuck in a day care
i just don't want my children to have to be raised like that
all my friends their parents worked all the time
when i was younger i thought they were lucky because they got to get away with things
now i realize that it was better because they have got into a lot of trouble
that certainly can happen now if
you say you're in communications
what base of communications would you be most interested in getting in to
i'm majoring in public relations
you would have a job with a company
rather than radio or television or newspapers or
then you'd be willing to give up your job to stay home stay with the children
i would like to stay at home with my children for at least the first five years
what i plan to do in the future is go ahead and get my upper education as far as my masters
and work on my doctorate and teach college
in that case then i'll be at home when my children are at home
i'd like to stay at home with them until they get at least into kindergarten
i would be at my school
that's is an advantage of being in the education field
i started out with college and then went to high school
i preferred the high school age level much better than i did the college
did you
because you have a closer relationship with the students
i started out as a p e major
i found that it was a perfect combination from the standpoint of having vacations off at the same time
it worked out fine from that standpoint plus the fact that when i left
usually my husband was seldom home for maybe forty-five minutes or so
our son he had to get on the bus
he did get on the bus
he never ever thought of not going to school he said in view of the fact that he was certain i had a hot line to his school
because i
i was in physical education then
i just kept getting pushed into administration
he thought surely that i would have bought a hot line
i wouldn't have checked on him
however there are points both directions in that from the standpoint of parents working and not working
i listened to more than one parent say i don't know what this child wants
i think out
that is the way of getting attention
whenever my mom stayed home with us we did without a lot
we were
we did
we lived in a trailer for eighteen years
we only had one car
we only had one telephone
i feel like that it helped me now because i appreciate the value of the dollar
i also had the supervision that i needed while i was growing up
i hope that i can provide that for my child too
we need more of that
we've had such a breakdown in the family structure
we have
from the standpoint of church and school and everything along the way
that i think has contributed much to the delinquency that works grant and the poor school results that we're having that the students parents have just not really taken enough interest in them from the very beginning
i think my feeling was that the very best teachers should be in grades one two and three to get the students off to a good start let them have positive experiences
from the lower levels so they want to continue learning and keep going and not wait until they're in the ninth and tenth grades
while parents very often will be involved with the school activities when the child's in the elementary school
they get into the high schools so often they seem to drop away at that point
that is just as valuable
the parent really needs to be there for the child
the child needs to take pride in the fact that their parent is doing something
we were fortunate in view of the fact that my son did play football
i did keep statistics for his team
we tried to be a part of it but not overshadowing him or making him feel that we had to be there all the time
i feel that i learned a great deal from my students with regard to what their biggest complaints were with parents
a thing such as
was carrying their
i never ever said that because i knew that that was one thing that was really irritating to young people
i guess that was good that you were hearing it from other students
i had to deal with their problems
i could talk about the kinds of problems which they were bringing that they had just in general aspect
our son would share this
he would have to make decisions for himself along those same types of lines so that
he works for a different company
when he went away to coll-
he was on the lawns from the time he was in the seventh grade and a small and all the way through college
he held three jobs wally was in college
we didn't even know it
that he had three jobs
when he graduated he had a five thousand dollar bank account
we had told him that if he ever wanted to go to college he could go
that was it right
who wants to start this one
i've been sitting here thinking
because it took a couple tries before i found somebody
i'm not really sure what i think about this
the first thing is if it's going to be mandatory it's got to be mandatory
everybody not just poor people and all that but
senators' sons and all that stuff too
everybody's got to do it
i don't know
it'd probably be good
i just don't know if i was eighteen or whatever i'd want to be stuck doing it for a year or whatever
that doesn't sound right
i guess i see overall beneficial if we're going from that point of view
in the past
i don't know how old you are
when i was in high school it was the beginning of vietnam and so forth
many of my peers were being drafted
i could see that many of them had conscientious objections to war or whatever
i felt strongly then that even if they didn't feel like they could kill someone or go into a military situation that they could help the country in other ways be it cleaning out lots in their neighborhood or
i guess i see that as not so much a demand but a privilege
None
it is
since we live here and we all benefit rich poor or in between i just see that as maybe a good idea
i find ways to turn some of that back to others
i guess i can't see that as being something to really object to
i guess it would still depend on how
if you're talking about something that's like one year full time this is what you do
you're going to go and fill pot holes and all that stuff
i could see a gamut of different kinds of opportunities
that could be done in an hour or two
a day or several hours of the week like a half of a day on saturday or something like that in addition to what one does
besides that
i can't imagine what kind of bureaucracies we'd get into and expense having it be full time
you're going to go to this camp
you're going to
back in the depression the c c c
we got some great public works out of it
i don't see that as being necessary now
i can see it being done on a regular schedule
everybody has to put in so many hours of public service in a given time perhaps
i guess i see all of us benefiting
i don't see it just relegated to the young
i see so much going on that that's bad
this would give them a chance to have some positive self-esteem
also you feel more like you're actually part of the community if you've done something
you take pride in that and get some positive feedback from those who benefit
i see it being most beneficial if it's in at least the area where the person lives
it might not be the same neighborhood but the same city or county because then you're coming in contact with it
it almost needs to be something that has more impact for the individual on going
as far as putting that into work
that would
just getting it going
i see a lot of things like scouting
boys clubs girls clubs things like that that kind of get into that citizenship the looking after the environment sort of thing i guess i don't see this being that different but even more beneficial because it would be something that everybody participated in
good
you'll have a little time think about that
i guess i have
when i was teaching school i saw so many kids that were at loose ends and that didn't really have a purpose
i can see some really significant things coming out of it
i know you've got to get past that grudge attitude that many have
that would be a part of selling it to the community
the adults ahead of it would probably never serve and to each succeeding generation there definitely would have to be a major p r campaign in each community each county
parish or however the state was divided up
i may
i don't know
boy scout troops or church groups or civic clubs will police a couple of miles of the highway and kee-
i've seen it in other states too
that here
they've got in most of the states around here i think
down in north carolina there was a big controversy for a while because the local chapter of the k k k wanted
to participate in it
there were those that said no
it was interesting because that's an interesting question
i hadn't even thought about the other end of that
that's an interesting situation
i thought i had seen when we were traveling around the state some similar signs up that indicated that certain sections were being policed and cleaned up
i know maryland does
we went to indianapolis last weekend and back
i'm pretty sure i saw yeah stuff in ohio and indiana about it and maybe pennsylvania
i don't know about your part of the country
down here in the last year plus there's just been more of a turn toward environmental concerns
i work for texas instruments
they've started some recycling campaigns that a year before that had been turned down because they said it's not feasible
then they lost
i see that as being a change for the positive kind of along the same line as the mandatory thing
it's just a part of everyone's consciousness
the thing about that is though it's got a
because it was big in the early seventies and all that
it kind of just went out of vogue
i'm worried that the same thing will happen
it's like environmentalism was really big for a couple of years
people
i'd rather spend fifty cents less on such and such
even if it's not environmentally safe who cares
there have been too many other things that it's done that for just in my life
if you look at history at all you see that we go from one side to the other on just about any subject
that one might care to bring up
it is comforting to me to see more concern about some of these things that cost us money
especially when we have dwindling resources such as oil that's burning out of control in the persian gulf and so forth
just every little bit does
it makes me feel like there may be something left for my children my nieces and nephews and so forth
yeah
wouldn't
it's just probably a good thing that the oil's burning and may make some people realize that hey this stuff runs out
that's right because
of course that's probably blasphemy for you to say coming from where you are
what was it seventy-four when we had the last oil crisis
we started getting smart
we were looking all these alternative sources of the energy and so forth
as soon as the oil prices came back down the pendulum swang the other way
we need those reminders
we'll suddenly be in the dark and say my goodness now we don't have the ability to go on to some new technology
my dad's in the solar energy business
we're acutely aware of a lot of this
on the other hand he voted for george bush
i thi-
makes decisions that i just can't go along with
that's why they're there and not me
i don't want the stress
the thing with bush
i was just trying to think about how i dress for work
what i usually do on the weekend is lay out five outfits
on monday i wear the worst looking one
because it doesn't seem like people are that alive on monday
progressively through the week i'll wear nicer looking things
on friday most everybody wears jeans and sweatshirts or jeans and blouses or something like that
mostly what i wear are skirts and blouses or skirts and pullover sweaters or little two piece dress suits like
that's a good way to approach it
i've never thought about
i don't repeat an outfit
i've never thought about wearing your worst outfit on monday because really no one's paying attention
i don't work outside of school
i work in the computer lab at school
i can just wear whatever i have on for school
really it's
i try to dress presentable but very comfortable
in the warm weather it's always shorts and a t-shirt or a button up or something like that
in the winter time it's jeans or pants
i usually
you really don't want to dress up unless you have a job
you have to be there right after school or something like that
where i work it's pretty casual
i guess it's more like a college campus
also there's hundreds of people work for t i
a lot of people just wear jeans and sweats all the time
they dress up when customers are coming in
or when we have department meetings or something like that
a lot of people like those that work in the legal department for the real higher ups
like the t i lawyers and those that work for the higher executives those secretaries they really dress up all the time
there's a good combination in the hallways all the time
that's good that they're so casual
my brother works for t i
he's a computer engineer
whenever he was going to school he was expecting to having to wear a tie or a dress shirt everyday
he goes to work in his blue jeans t-shirt
he just loves it
that's very acceptable at t i
i believe at i b m they make you wear a blue suit and some kind of colored shirt and a tie
i would hate to be in that atmosphere
they just moved into the new building
they were going to try to take their blue jean code with them and trying to get all the upper level to start wearing blue jeans
he just left for italy today at four
he'll be over there until july first setting up some kind of computers for them
for t i but over in italy
t i is everywhere
he didn't carry any ties or anything because he just went over there with that attitude if i don't take it then they won't make me wear it
because he didn't
his preference is blue jeans and a t-shirt
i think that's great about t i
also to get off the clothing the smokers how they have the different designated areas for smokers and stuff
if you happen to go into one of areas that is a smoke area you don't smoke you almost strangle
the smoking area it's closed in
if you don't smoke and you go in there
everybody that goes in there smokes
it's full of smoke when you go in there
i think that's
you mentioned your daughter had graduated from college
when she was in high school did she always have to have all the new fashions
yeah she always had to have a lot of clothes
that's how i am
my mamma was not raised like that
i wasn't either
my daughter she's real good at finding sales though
me to
she'll buy a lot clothes at the end of seasons
and just have them for the next year
she finds all the outlets and all the discount places and buys clothes
when they were coming up i didn't sew
now i've learned how to sew
i'm still learning how
i'm getting much better at it
i'm going to be able to make my own clothes
i just haven't fit it into my schedule yet
that can really benefit
that's something that i'd be very interested in learning
because clothes are really expensive
they're outrageous
a little simple shell blouse that you can make for about say ten dollars at the most out of a decent fabric
just a little shell to go under a suit
yeah it's marked up
it is really outrageous
whenever i was growing up and all my mom
i do now
she never would buy me like the new designer jeans that had come out that were thirty dollars
she wouldn't buy me the fifty dollar tennis shoes and stuff like that
she always told me it was because i was still growing
she wasn't going to buy me something i was going to grow out of next week
i have a friend who
she had a little boy
she used to dress him out of neiman marcus
she dressed him fabulously
seems like every time she turned around he was outgrowing stuff
she finally learned that you just can not do this cannot
now she finds the basement sales just like everybody else
i always thought my mom was being mean to me
i look back at it now
my child is going to
i'm going to raise mine the same way
i don't know
they're just so outrageously priced
i try to always catch the sales
you just have to keep buying them
if you're not buying the most expensive clothes out there the quality is really not that great for the price that you pay
it depends on
there's always a reason why they're on sale
that has a lot to do with it
i bought the most beautiful sweater from i believe it was ross dress for less
it was really pretty
it was just a plain round necked sweater
it was embellished around the top
it had leather designs some other little things on it
i just thought it was so pretty
i got it at a real good price
that's great
it was so pretty
after i wore it a couple of times i realized
in the middle of the back of it there was
they had just sewed it back together
right in the middle of the back
wasn't a seam or anything
that's why it was so cheap although it's not really noticeable from the outside
still it's really not a good quality
then i was told by somebody that works for j c penney's that ross is just one of those places that sells seconds
they don't really buy the first quality
places like j c penney's they'll reject the seconds
places like ross dress for less and t j max
the roles have definitely changed in the last generation or so
i think a lot of it has to do with women working
in the future i think all women are going to work
they may let you off for a day or two to have your baby
that will be it
either they'll have a computer at home and in the hospital where you just continue right on with your work
it really is coming to that because most women now days cannot afford the time that they could take off unless the company pays them
they can't even afford to take off to have children it seems like
it seems if you're going to have kids that society has decided for you how many you can really have and make it
if you have two if you go to work you're just working to pay for day care
two or three
i was real lucky because my husband had a good enough job where when i had them and when they were small
until my youngest got in junior high i didn't have to work
that is good
i didn't work
i needed to
i didn't
steve has a sister who has four
she just had her fourth one in march
she doesn't have to work either
i don't know how people do it with one
obviousl-
i think that's part of the role reversal is it's okay to get married and not have kids
i think society for such a long time said you're married now you need to have your family
i don't think it's been until recently that they had decided that two people was a family
None
it's getting where if you're going to give your kids any kind of education and stuff you can't hardly afford to have over two
it's hard with two
my youngest one
my youngest one is going to be graduating from college soon
if i had a third one
it
still it cost a lot
just the cost of living and loans don't pay for groceries and stuff
cars and all their books
the books are outrageous
i know
absolutely outrageous
they're getting worse
my daughter brought home a book the other day that she was going to have to have for one of her next classes
it was like ninety-six dollars
this book is a little bitty skinny book
i said my goodness what is it lined in gold
it's getting worse
if i'd of probably had three or four children i don't see how we could have made it without me working
that's probably because if you had three you would say if i'd of had four
i guess it's always not being able to picture one more
in essence you probably would have worked out fine
i think i would have had to work
even though he brings in a real good living and everything in order for me to keep up i would have had to work
i think it's getting more and more like
when you have one child now that's it
you work
if you have two or three kids by the way the inflation's going i think a woman's always going to have to work
it's just going to be an accepted thing
there isn't going to be any of this very few people will ever stay home
that's all right with me because i don't want to stay home i think i'm just part of the new stuff that is just
i think i would just go nuts sitting at home all day long
i can't imagine how i did because now i work all the time
i work all week
i can't imagine how i stayed home
i think to myself what did i do
i think it revolutionized where a woman thinks that a way just like
my daughter there's no way that she can imagine herself married at the age that she's at now
to her everything is you've got to go through college you've got to get a job
when everything's set up then you look for somebody that you want to spend the rest of your life with
it is so far down the road
when i graduated high school
that's what you did
you got married
you had a family
that's just the way it was
that's like when my mo-
the woman stayed home and took care of them
i like the way it is
it's being
we're from houston so it's not so hard for people
you've been married three or so years
you don't have kids it's okay nobody does
you come to a place like belton
a lot of people in our su-
they can't have children don't have children
they can't imagine why we would want to have children
i'm going there's life in there that's
not everybody has to have kids
i'd rather spend the time with my husband than spending time
it's your turn
you know that even
we got married right out of high school a year after i got out of high school
i didn't have kids for four and a half years
that was because i wanted to work
i wasn't ready for kids
everybody thought my gosh what is the matter with her
they're probably going i bet she can't get pregnant
they thought that it was terrible
when i'd tell them i'm just not ready for children yet
that you better just get ready now
you don't just get ready
i was kind of odd because as a general rule the people that married during my time they had kids within a year
i just was not ready for kids
i wanted to travel and stuff like that which we did
kids didn't fit in right then
it's getting more and more like that where there's more and more couples
if you don't want the kids then it's not the time to have
i think that more and more the attitude's getting that way
that's like my daughter
now she says that maybe when she's thirty she might want a child then
even though i'd like to have grandchildren i can see her point
steve's mom finally said that god will take care of us when it's our time
she finally told me it's okay if you don't
it took every nerve in her body to say that because she's from a very very old fashioned family
she stayed home and raised her kids
she expected all of her kids to do that too
their wives to be the housewife and have dinner ready by five and be there at every beck and call
i was raised totally opposite
my mother had six girls
she worked too
i guess i just
i saw how life was when she stayed home
it was rough
it really is
just like now there's so much more now
it really does
accept for what we give to my daughter to put her through college and stuff
the rest of it
we go on trips the more or less like entertainment stuff
i think you've earned that though
i feel like i have because we're just a age now
i'm older
i got to stay home with my kids which i really wanted to do
now i could not go back and do it
i did stuff
i think it's just the new way that people are thinking
i think it would be neat if they could incorporate into small and large businesses both a built in day cares where the children were there in the facility but not necessarily right there with you
more and more of them are
where i am just all the hospitals
the reason they had to do this was because so many women could not afford
more and more of our hospitals especially over here are getting them
then some of the bigger companies
it's mainly the hospitals
i know nobody around here does it
it's too small around here
i can go ahead and start and tell you mine
that's where i grew up
i was used to the heat out here right now
it gets to about high seventies
it gets very cold at night
monterey it's right on the coast
i don't know if your familiar with california coastline you're
we're about a two hour drive south of san francisco
it's really nice
it's a big area for people to come from the different countries mostly like japan germany and england
they usually go to carmel and vacation on the beaches
it's pretty nice year round
always cool in the evenings and warm in the summer
it's stays pretty cold even during the winter for as nice as it is
we usually get a fog right about four o'clock
it kind of rolls in over the coast
then it usually breaks back off again the next morning
if you go just a little bit ways in i'd say about a fifteen minute drive in towards salinas
the weather completely changes
it gets very hot and dry
the fog never makes it that far
along here it's
right now we're we're having the little bit of spring that we have
at least you've got some
we had one of those blow through tonight
that's good
i think we got the same thing in the forecast for the next two or three days
have y'all been having any heat waves or the ninety degree
it's gotten up to ninety a couple of times
basically it's been in the low seventies and eighties
do y'all have many bluebonnets and stuff this year
the season is just about over for that
in fact we drove down to corpus last week there were still some paint brushes and bluebonnets down along the way
i miss that
i spoke to somebody else this morning from san antonio
we came back
they had a big rainstorm come through there part of the same thing we're getting now i guess
that's real nice because i can remember two years ago that in about february the hundred degree weather started in san antonio and just continued
we've had a few down here but not anything like kansas
this is the season for that
they do pop up occasionally
we get a bit of a relief
when it's july and august i'm pretty well used to the
the biggest problem with the weather and the rain in this area is the soil
is that what dallas is
it's not sandy like most of the state is
it doesn't absorb the water real well
once it rains a little bit it's filled up and everything else just runs off
it's a complete mess everything floods all the under passes
there's a section in south dallas that's had a whole lot of flooding problems because of the rain
we could use some rain up here
we're in the bottom of the fourth year of drought
they had a pretty good early spring
we got quite a bit of rain
it wasn't enough to offset what they lost over the last four years
they're still talking water rationing this summer
it would seem strange because in san antonio
we had lived out west of san antonio in castroville
the water in medina lake and that area was really going down that they were considering that they might have to do water rationing
i thought gee i'm so glad to get out of there and get up here to the california pacific coast where it rains and everything has flowers
there's no problem with water
i came here and found out they were in the four year draught
i said this is pretty much like texas
it pretty much is in the middle of summer
they turn to golden dead grass
it's a really nice area
it's just such a change from texas because i had grown up with the heat
used to essentially
you have the hot summer spring
to come here it's kind of the temperate weather all year round
it's kind of like spring i guess year round
in the winter
it seems sort of like a san antonio early winter or fall
it seems like we only have two springs or two seasons
that would be spring and fall
it's a really nice change of pace
we do a lot of
when you do a lot of outside running and stuff it's just so much easier
you don't have to worry about the high humidity
is it pretty dry
it's nothing like i guess san antonio summers
east texas is a little more humid
i had lived in san antonio for about twenty years
it just seemed like every year it just got more and more humid
here it's right by the ocean
it's not the same as corpus
here the water is extremely cold up here
if you want to go wind suffering or diving or swimming you have to wear a wet suit
for some reason because of the cold ocean water the air is always cool
i really like that about this area
we just hadn't expected it
we were used to what gulf coast weather was like
it's much nicer
the air doesn't feel anything like it does along the gulf coast region
you
we like it
it's a nice change
we'll be here a couple of years
we thought we'll take advantage of it and see what all the pacific coast is like
it's been good
my wife's originally from virginia
we lived there for about nine months
that was a real change for me
i imagine
parts do
we're over in the western edge in the mountains
they have of course some pretty severe storms winter storms snow and that type of thing
they're so good about clearing the roads that it doesn't usually bother you very much
i've just never really been in that region of the country
i guess i'm going to have to try that area sometime and see what it's like
a lot of people that are from that north carolina region really like it
they get the snow
they said it doesn't really get messy
it doesn't really hang around that long
the people i know that are from there they always miss it
they want to go back
None
as we were talking the weather came on
there's a flash flood watch and
i hope it moves up this way
i'm sure it won't
we could sure use it
you think that takes care of the time and
i sure appreciate hearing how things are going in texas and
i enjoyed talking with you lisa
what movies have you seen recently valerie
we haven't seen that one yet
don't bother
from a woman's point of view it was very chauvinistic as far as women go
it was entertaining
i don't think the general audience would go for it
the most recent one that my wife and i have seen was the city slicker
it was just a really funny movie
it just ran the gamut of emotion
it was just all around entertaining
it's still on to the best of my knowledge
time wise how long
i think it's less than two hours
we rented one recently that seemed to go on forever
this one it was fairly long
i'm guessing probably an hour and forty-five minutes maybe
it
was it good
excellent acting by billy crystal and bruno kirby
who was the
jack palance had an excellent part in there as the old cowboy
we really enjoyed that
i'm looking forward to seeing that one
i think that i can highly recommend that movie to see
we generally rent a couple a week
in order to get a decent movie to have on a weekend you've got to rent it on thursday
they get taken up at the store
with luck you'll have one or two that are good
we usually have
quite frequently we have our grandchildren on the weekends we'll try to rent something that they can see as well as something else that we can see
generally try to stay in the at least p g range
the oldest is nine
the nine year old will watch anything that's on t v
we've been waiting for a good movie out this summer for the kids to see
they enjoyed that
i missed that one
my wife took i think the kids to see that one
we can generally find something at the store
that's a good deal
we saw this movie
presumed innocent was the one we rented last weekend
he is a prosecuting attorney
course it's one of these with a twist where it looks like he's the one that wound up killing her
it's an extremely long movie
it's over two hours long
my wife she likes the suspense movies
my husband wasn't going to be able to watch it with me
i thought i better save that one for another day
i think he'd like that one
it's something i think you would enjoy
that's a good one to put on the list
it's like most suspense movies
once you seen one that's a suspenseful type movie like that then it's not good for a second watching particularly
it's a shame
my one grandson and i
we like bill and ted's excellent adventure which is another funny one
we haven't seen that one either
i have a theory
i don't want to go away depressed from watching a movie
i've certainly enjoyed talking with you
you too jim
i hope you see a good movie soon
i guess i enjoy eating out here and there
it's a good change from cooking and eating at home
i guess i like a variety of restaurants
sometimes it's fun to go out and just have a hamburger and french fries and sort of a hamburger and french fry meal
sometimes i enjoy going out having a formal meal
sometimes it's nice to go out and have a salad
something
do you usually go out with the children or without them
a variety
i like to go sometimes without them
sometimes it's okay to take them along
it just varies
it wouldn't even really matter which restaurant it was just to have a moment of peace and quiet without
where do you like to eat
we don't have any children
we tend to
we're very attracted to exotic food
we like indian food and thai cuisine and sort of gourmet mexican and things like that as well as tex-mex and italian and chinese and things and things of that sort
we probably go out one to two times a week
we're pretty much regulars at an local italian restaurant
which one do you like
it's been a long time since we've been in there
it's good
there's an italian restaurant over by plano parkway there
it's good
my husband had been in there several times
actually we went in there for lunch one day
their pastas were great
that's one of the things a good pasta means a lot to me
i like different kinds of food
when we go out i'm always looking for something other than the standard menu even if
it's a mexican restaurant like something other than the standard tacos enchiladas tamales and fajitas
once in a while things backfire
we've gone for romanian food and lebanese food and things like that i'm not fond of some of those things
we'll try anything
we've had ethiopian not in plano of course
we really do enjoy going out
i'm pretty adventurous in cooking too which also occasionally
i think we're supposed to say what will bring us back to a restaurant or what attracts us to a restaurant
how do you usually find a new restaurant
my husband's he's the ethnic fan
you know what we read the d magazine we check that and the friday section in the newspaper the pull out section there
we often save those and ventured out on from there just for something that had a high rating
we have found a number of restaurants either through d the
friday paper and sometimes the observer which my husband usually picks up
when they say buy one get one free
that's right
we'll go in
very often we'll
we'll stick with it
once they no longer give coupons we'll stay there
we've found probably half of our sort of regular restaurants through coupons
and the other half through the newspaper reviews
yeah
we use the coupons too
it's wonderful particularly if you have more than two people and you've got say four or something like that
that is really one of our
i think that's ex-
sometimes i think going out to eat it's sort of a recreation
just a change of pace from eating at home
i guess as far as service when we go out it's nice to have someone
it's kind of nice to
a waitress or waiter that waits the table
it's not nice when they're too attentive
we've had experience with that too
my sister who also lives here in dallas tends to chat with waiters and waitresses and become their best friends during the course of dinner which drives me absolutely batty
chili's is always fine
i guess if we go into dallas we like the is it routh street cafe
we've never been there
that's supposed to be wonderful
we've taken people there several times
they have a good choice of things that are very different sounding
we had venison chili one time which was absolutely wonderful
i guess it must be seasonal
we've been back
i guess it's in the winter season
they've never had it when we've been back
you ought to try that
it's very good
it's just not
that's supposed to be a wonderful place
here in plano we tend to go to momo's fairly often
sometimes we'll go
we also go to chili's and colter's bar b q
there is a little thai place that's over on park that we go to
a lot because we're both were from the richardson north dallas area up until fairly recently
we'll go down to blue mesa grill mexican food
that's good
you probably have a job you need to get to pretty soon
you are
i'm already on my job you reached me at my job
how do you dress for work
my dress for work most of the time is rather comfortable and casual usually slacks and a soft colored shirt
the thing that distinguishes me a lot of the time when i have to dress real professionally for a meeting or something is i wear a clerical collar and a suit and all of that sort of thing
when i don't need to dress up for a meeting or a service of some sort i don't
you're in a church there
i'm working this is my first morning to work down at our little church preschool
they've told me to wear just something terribly comfortable because these are two year olds
they have bible lessons
they have all the things during the morning
they still have snack time and play time
i'm going to be dressing just in casual slacks and t-shirts probably not blue jeans but little bit short of that just tennis shoes and play clothes
around there you can probably wear t-shirts and other things
around here at this time of the year we are into sweaters and coats
it's a beautiful day here
it's in the sixties
we still have a lot of hot afternoons
you'll still see people
it's kind of an in between change that they're in their summer clothes during the afternoons because you just can't stand the sweaters
in the mornings people are dressing for work in their sweaters because they just want it to be fall so badly
today we wear coats
as the day warms up we may go to light jackets
i don't think there's an escape from light jackets
are the people around you dressing similar to you
you don't have to buy the lot of the wardrobe that some of the people in banking and that kind of thing do
that's good
i'm not stuck with that kind of a situation
yesterday i had to dress up and be more formal because i had a formal meeting at noon time
that's wonderful
then i can go home later in the day and be a little more casual if i have a meeting of people that i know i can be very casual in the evening
my husband has to take the bus into dallas and doesn't return all day
he has to dress
he just really hates it
even when his job is not going to be with people all day long he said it's just part of the uniform and the expected image that they have to dress
around here in a lot of places that's the way it is there are expected dress codes the people need to follow that
i think years ago i used to be far more committed to the idea of a dress code i've relaxed a lot more as i've gotten older and become more comfortable with myself
i think that's great
from that now that i've broken away from it i'm glad i have
another interesting thing on our end here is how much younger i dress than my mother would have in her forties
i will run around to the store in things in slacks and tennis shoes
she tells me i dress young
that's okay
there's not a lot more i can think of to discuss on clothing
there
what kind of shoes do they wear down there
we wear
of course like i said if my husband's going downtown he's got the whole men's dress shoes for as out here just anything that the moms
we all kind of have our own little dress code of just either tennis shoes or little loafers and tights and things that feel comfortable to us around our kids
we can wear pretty much that although tennis shoes are kind of out in almost every every situation unless you want to look like a gook
you all have a nice day there
thank you for calling
her name is thumper
i got her for christmas from my family back when we lived in nebraska
i thought that if i had a good hunting dog like thumper that i could just go out and get all kinds of game
except we live in plano texas now
for many years i had a dog that was part springer spaniel
she isn't alive any more
we had her for fifteen years i think my family did and just loved her
she was the greatest went through two generations of children in my family and was always very gentle
i got him in arizona when i used to live there
he is huge
i got him
he was born in the wild in a shed and had never been in a building when i got him
he must be cross part with some kind of desert animal because he's very long and lanky
he's a very tame spoiled house cat now that i've had him for seven years
he's really spoiled though
he's really big
lots of times he seems to get in fights
when he was younger i think he started them
now i think he barely makes it
we went to a cat show at the plano center here in town
we thought that we have a cat now
we thought if we ever get another cat we'd want something kind of unique
we kind of looked around
they had everything from hairless cats to siamese cats and persian cats
we sort of fell in love with the maine coon cats
i've seen them
they were
i can't remember
they used to be used on ships and for mousers
they're very nautical too
i think i'm being accurate in the area of folklore
i'm not sure
that's interesting
my family didn't necessarily like them as much as i did
the manx is that the one that doesn't have a tail it sort of has a bob tail
i'm a real cat lover
i'd have a lot more cats if my boyfriend would let me
i'll tell you an interesting story about how i got my dog
i suppose our five minutes will be up
i went to omaha nebraska to recruit students
i had some time off in the afternoon
i went to a pet shop
i saw these little springer spaniels i decided this would really be a nice dog to have
when i got back home to carney nebraska i told my wife about it
i said this is just a
i can just hear the dog crying for me now
christmas is coming up hint hint
i had to go back the next week as well as a bunch of other people from the university
one of the people that we went with they were friends of ours
we got to omaha
i decided i'd take my friend over and show him the dog
i got over there
she said that's too bad the dog has already been sold
i didn't realize it
this guy had somehow worked it out so that he got there a little bit earlier bought the dog
she was in the back room
that night we had a reception for some of the potential high school students or college students
he had the dog the whole time in his room
i had no idea
we headed back to carney that night
the dog rode in the car
we stopped along the way and had a bite to eat
they left the dog in the car
i guess while we were inside eating thumper just tore the heck out of the inside
finally we made it back to to carney
i guess we're recorded
cycling computers backpacking just about everything
in fact he's out there right now before it gets dark trying to get in his miles for the time
do you do any handicraft type things i think was the question
i do some things
i like to decorate things
i do sweatshirts and t-shirts
i've gotten to where i have started selling them at craft shows and things
that's pretty good
i have done fairly well at them
a few of my little hobby projects have totally bombed
my only craft work is kind of like computers and go off to the little computer club meetings
it's kind of nice because i've made money at it too
considering i work for it a living
i've got a couple of articles published
it's kind of neat
what does a computer club do
they just get around and talk techy or else
the other half are really not
we kind of help out the people who are really not
you're not into hacking or whatever
i think i'm a hacker
i'm not the dial around randomly trying to break into computers type hackers
i belong to a boy scout troop
i just donate a whole bunch of my time to the boy scouts and have fun
we have done that
our two older boys were in boy scouts
my daughter was in girl scouts until just about a year ago we've
that's a great thing to do really
just last weekend went to davy crockett forest which is kind of out in east texas
we go to places out in
let's see
what's that state north of us
that one
by fort sill there
to a old indian fort that's out there
have you gone to fillmont with the boy scouts
when i was a kid we'd do the equivalent thing in the high sierras
does your whole family like to do it
for a vacation you'd go backpacking
None
you volunteer for the boy scouts
sometimes
it's better than owning on them and making payments on them
and things like that
you said you did it in the high sierras
do you ever just vacation someplace where you strictly backpack
not recently because the boy scouts makes it so that i go like once a month
there's some stuff that i want to do with sierra club and go down to grand canyon or something like that
they have lots of tours where they get a bunch of people together and off you go
which seems kind of reasonable because that means you don't have to take twenty thirteen year olds with you which seems just a tad more relaxing
i also
i've always been
i tell you what count your blessings because it really is good when someone can do some things to a car themselves
although i'll tell you over the years the cars get more complicated
that's why i don't do as much as i'd like
because they've gotten complicated haven't they
which after awhile i could take apart in my sleep if i needed to
it got to be pretty straightforward to understand
now since then the closer a car is to a fifty-six buick the more i know about it
start getting into these nissans and the like
i just can't keep up
i agree
i used to always change my own oil and do the points and plugs and
course they don't use
brakes i've always done a lot of changing brakes
i have a lot of times
it's one i did not do myself
i have a seventy-nine el dorado took it to be inspected the parking brake failed
i got under there and messed with that adjustment
to tighten it up
that didn't do the trick
i got there and tried to
that wasn't even eventually the problem
i did everything that i could think to do
eventually i brought it up to a place called just brakes it turns out that there's a
the parking brake in the rear
there's disc brakes
the parking brake is a piston deal
because the parking brake hadn't been used in so many years the piston froze up
they ended up having to pound it out
one of them they
were able to get running kind of oiling it and playing with it
the other one it was just frozen solid
i ended up having to buy one
all total it was just under two hundred dollars believe it or not to get all that done
it really wasn't quite as bad as you thought was it
actually i think it was a lot of money
i don't like i s-
it was a lot of money
do you still do much work on them then
that was just at the beginning of september
whenever i can i do try
i've gotten to the point where i don't change the oil anymore only because
that is one problem
also these fast oil change places you just can't beat them
for sixteen bucks not only will they change the oil in ten minutes and do as good a job as i can do but they'll lube too
i've quit doing that myself
one of the main reasons was the disposal of the oil
the main reason that it's quick
have you seen a new movie lately
i am a student
i have been actually watching more movies on video
than being able to go out to see movies at the theater
i want to see the fisher king and catch robin hood
i haven't seen either one of those
what are some of the shows that you have been able to rent though
let's see
i'm trying to just think of the ones that have come on
white palace which i thought was over hyped recently
you're catching me at minds end here
maybe you have seen dances with wolves
i thought the cinematography was excellent
the story was
though it tended to be a little one sided it was good
it was believable
i just moved down in fact from south dakota in june
that's when the movie was filmed
when the movie came out we went
my dad lives in the state capital which is pierre it was filmed right outside of pierre
in fact the big buffalo herd scene that was a live scene
there's a guy that has got a buffalo farm
he has got over ten thousand head of buffalo my dad has got a little plane we flew over it all a- looked at the buffalo
we are watching the movie in the movie theater in pierre just every time i would start to get into the movie and it was getting good someone in the crowd would yell hey there's john red eagle
they'd start recognizing people
they knew the extras or the
i'd go which one could that be
i'd start trying to focus in on people instead of picking up the overall
i thought it was a good film
you are right
i think it was very one sided
it was
it's a side that hasn't been told as far as telling it from the indians as the good guys and the the white men as the bad guys
i really thought about all the westerns that we have seen for years and years
it's just shoot the indians
they are always the savages
it was a similar situation with the iroquois indians attacking an army fort
it was an interesting movie
have you seen pretty woman
i thought that was a good show
that was a good movie
it was just kind of a get away movie
it didn't have any real social bearing
it wasn't really a comedy
it was an enjoyable movie
it was kind of like the star wars series just something a little different
i sure did have a mind lock about the movies i've seen
are you much of a star trek fan
i think i've missed one
they showed all five in a row
they had it everywhere
every major city had one theater that did it
we had one here in dallas
they did it in houston
they did it everywhere
it was really good to see all the movies and how the story developed
the thing that i didn't realize is that if you watch the movies in a row time wise they happen one after another and just no time between them
you can watch the characters develop
he was in arlington virginia
None
anyway we've got a easy subject
i used to
i have one favorite soap opera
i tape because i'm not home
let's see
at night i don't usually sit down till almost nine o'clock when my kids get in bed
then i watch
what do i watch at nine o'clock
tuesday nights i guess we try to catch a couple of the shows that the kids like
we usually catch full house
what's the one comes on after that
it's a new one
my kids are older i don't know some of those shows now like i used to
other than that i watch knots landing on thursday nights
i like the comedies
that is a good one
if i'm home on mondays then i definitely watch her
i really like coach
i think when it's good it's just a scream
he's a good actor
he's probably playing himself
half the time you see these people on an interview show they act just like they do in their parts
he acted about the same
he could very well be
do you watch much t v
i watch more now because i had been going to school for years and have really been too busy this semester i'm only taking one course
i see murphy brown and coach and the wonder years
i never see that
i've got a friend that says that is just wonderful show
it's fabulous
they are just gems of shows
really fabulous in every way
what night is that on
that's wednesday at seven thirty
wednesdays i go to church choir
maybe your husband could tape it for you sometime
it wouldn't take much to get hooked on those
i watch those
i haven't
it's not really new
it's still kind of new
they'll have some things in there almost like supernatural or something
somebody will see a figure from the past that nobody else does
it sounds weird
it's very unique show and very well done
i guess we just
it came on after something we used to watch i guess we just kept sitting there
now we make a point of watching
then it will be mostly reruns i guess
by the end of february the way they do it nowadays
we used to watch a lot of designing women
i haven't seen that much lately
since they got rid of delta burke and brought on the new ones
was she the best one on that old show
she was just funny
her character was good
that was awful
who knows still what really happened
i know
you never will probably
i think the latest soap opera for people is the kennedy trial for those who have cable
i know
i told
i haven't been able to catch any of that
just what little we caught on the news
i know it
i think he's guilty as the devil
i don't see how he couldn't be
they said this lawyer is unbelievable
they said she held up so well yesterday
in the paper said it
the national enquirer says
do you watch any sports or anything like that
i don't either
i can't watch it on t v
occasionally some ice skating will come on on a sunday or during the olympics i always watch that
i suppose we both have credit cards
i do use them
i have a few favorites that i use more than others
i try to keep my balances fairly reasonable
i could probably pay them off any month if i wanted to
occasionally they can get out of hand and get higher when you start using more than a few they all can build up
i think they're handy
i just get
i don't carry a lot of cash with me i hate writing checks when you go shopping
do you use credit cards
i watched my grandmother go into debt
i've
i guess my mother
my mother learned from that
i guess she taught me
basically i just keep them
i use them so that i build up a credit rating
otherwise i generally
my husband it turns out
he has the same habit
we just keep a few of the major ones and then use them once in a while for something
that's wonderful
we always pay it off right that month so that we don't pay any service charge
that way we keep out of debt
we keep on top of what we're spending
the interest rates in credit cards is so high now compared to what you're savings is bringing
i know some people can get carried away with them and let them get out of hand
it's really easy just to forget that you charged that or charged that
sometimes i forget
a bill will come in
i'll think no i didn't know it was going to be that high
so far we've been able to pay it off every time
that's good
right now i'm kind of looking for a visa that has a lower interest rate
it seems that some of them have gotten higher i saw on t v they had a program on credit cards
they're supposed to
i don't know if it was tennessee or arkansas or some other state had a visa card that was the lowest one in the country
i didn't write it down at the time
i went and looked to see what my visa was
i think it's eighteen percent or something think i want to find something that has a lower rate
None
i think sears originally put it out
it's pretty well taken all over the u s now
i've haven't found many places that don't take discover
there's no annual service fee which is good
they also give you they say cash back at the end of the year
they give you money back for using your credit card
i didn't know that
i think the service charge is pretty low too
i'm not sure
sears was one of the few department stores that never would take any other credit cards
i worked at sears for over ten years
it was only a sears card that they would take until i guess they decided to join the club and come up with another credit card that was accepted
now they'll take the discover
i still don't know if sears will take visa or mastercard
i never did apply for a discover card
i've got some that i haven't even used at all past few years
i do like my dillard's
i do use dillard's probably more than any of the other department stores
it was good talking to you
got any problems on mockingbird with crime
is that a crime free zone there
one evening i decided to retire early and heard sirens and noises and thought something's happens on mockingbird and then heard yells and screams
the next thing i know there are policemen all around my house
they had stopped a stolen car and caught one of the men in the hedge
the other one was on the roof in the back
on my house
my goodness
None
i'm very much aware of crime in the cities and the concern about it
that's got to be a frightening way to spend an evening
i kept hearing noises
i knew that i was not going to sleep until i got up and went out and checked the garage
i got my gun and walked through the house into the garage
i wanted to be sure
i think as any city grows up you get the hoods and the riffraff and everybody else in there
i think
fortunately the sirens and everything we hear are over on spring creek
we've lived here sixteen years
now you can tell the change for sure
i was thinking if you've been there that long you've seen plano grow from what was really a small town to a city
central expressway
with all the stores and the restaurants and the convenience stores and all that kind of stuff it's just prime pickings for people driving by
None
i was appalled to read the other day about the shooting on the tollway
that couldn't be too far from you neither
it's farther west of me
it was really frightening to
think that it's not even safe to drive onto the tollway
i never thought about someone robbing those
apparently they do
i don't know how a few bucks can be worth shooting somebody
it's kind of stupid isn't it
i guess when people do those things they don't really give a thought of the consequences at the time
away you go right
i think the drugs play a tremendous part in the theft and the violence that we see
i think you're right although i think that may be an excuse for people too
it is convenient isn't it
i think when you have haves and have nots you're always going to find people that are too lazy to figure a way to earn money and find it's easier if you can get a gun to go out and hold something up than it is to figure out a way to legitimately earn the money
i work in south dallas for the dallas school system
None
do you know where oakland and hatcher are
is that amelia earhart school there
not far off south central expressway
my goodness
you watch the people
the kids see that
they know that they can earn several hundred dollars in a day running for drug dealers if
definitely that area that's big time
that's the worst neighborhood in the whole area
it's a little scary sometimes
i manage the
i live in texas too
do you also
you ready to begin
how do you feel about putting someone in the nursing home
i don't think that any of my relatives would really like to go there
i believe if i am in a position when my mother gets to a point where she needs special care that i will be able to just bring her into my home uh-huh
and my father also or have someone go into their home and look them
i would find it very difficult to place my father or my step-mother in a place like that particularly since i know how they feel about it
it's more how they feel about it
it is like they feel like somebody had thrown them away
i do think that there are some significant kinds of things to to look for if you are faced with placing someone
in a place like that aside from the cleanliness and the medical care that is offered and such
attitude of staff makes such a tremendous difference
i have a a friend who is partly paralyzed and is in a nursing home and has no family who could care for her
i know that the cheerful pleasant people who treat her kindly make all the difference in the world in how she feels about her situation
another thing to think about on the positive side of the nursing homes here
i use to work in one of the offices in a nursing home i got to see a lot of the things that they did they had a lot of crafts they had a lot of games
they get together and they do all sorts of things
there
some of the people that are in there are very nice and friendly to everybody then there are others that are
it is just a job
they just want to go in and do what they have to do and get out go home
the attitude of the staff as you said is really very very important
i think it would matter too kinds of disabilities that the nursing home accepts
because there are some who poor things don't have any real grasp on reality any longer
they may be ambulatory
they tend to behave like small children that would be very difficult i think for an adult who wasn't in that situation to to have to deal with on a daily basis
it is like the one that i worked in you would see some of them just like in wheelchairs all day
they would enjoy enjoy themselves with activities
you would see some of the others that were distant from the other group
they they just didn't participate together with the others because they had some i guess slight mental disabilities and things like that
that can
frank what type of budget do you or your family have
i have a set amount that i save
actually there is a way
my wife gets so much to do shopping with every couple of weeks
we allot each of us so much money per week for our personal stuff gas and things like that
besides that i have a set amount that i save every month
that's sounds like probably a tighter controlled budget than what i have
i basically
it makes it a little bit easier
also i try to save a certain amount each month as well i try to have an idea of what my expenses are
i am pretty consistent from month to month whenever that changes i am pretty well aware of it without actually having to maintain a budget for it
i found that things as i have gotten older
before we use to have a very strict budget
we planned out how much we were going to spend for food and how much for this and for that
i guess one interesting aspect of the budgeting i do now is that i kind of fence off areas of my check book
for instance there are certain things that i know come up every so often
every six months i have to pay my taxes
i take a set amount
i've got a money market account that i do a lot of saving in
i also have got a checking account besides that
what i do on my money market account my taxes for instance which amount to an average of two hundred and twenty dollars a month i will just take two hundred and twenty out
i put it in parenthesis
i guess that's a way of budgeting
i guess i kind of do a similar thing more medium or longer range
i am
i kind of have an amount in my mind
i am making every effort to put a little bit away and increase the amount that i need for a down payment or whatever
we've got two cars
i like to drive pick up truck
we are on a schedule where i try every three or four years to buy a new one
i am constantly making car payments
i figure that's got to be the story of my life is making car payments
i get one paid for
actually i am saving up for another one besides
it's kind of a never ending thing
you try to schedule those things so that you're not paying for two at the same time i guess is what i am saying
have you thought about leasing
i have thought about it
leasing wouldn't
i don't use it for my business
i use mine just to go back and forth to work which is only ten miles away
if you are rolling it over every three years
typically if you purchase your own car you tend to make the best returns after you pay it off
i have been know to keep trucks or cars for ten or twelve years
i find that after about four years they kind of start going down hill
you got to put put stuff in them
mine's seven years old
i think last year that was a rough year for it
i am hoping that most of them were just kind of
the
i just went through that whole set last year
those things can really upset your budget when they come in
it's nice to have a little bit set aside for the unexpected shall we say
so that it doesn't kill you all in one month
i start
we keep a budget to an extent
we were really forced into keeping a budget because i'm paid once a month which sort of forces some restrictions
you need to make sure all your bills are paid
about yourself
i have to say i really don't have a budget
both my wife and i grew up in families of rather modest means
our family income at this point is comfortable upper middle class i guess you might say
we're both so frugal that we really don't need a budget
i guess that really is sort of keeping a budget
we stay within our means
you stay within your means
we don't do it by conscious effort
we just moved to california
the cost of living here in california is i would say rather pathological
housing prices are from four to ten times more expensive than
you moved from dallas to san francisco
that presents a real shock
actually our standard of living has gone down somewhat since we've moved to california
you have good sour dough
it's a beautiful place to live
one way you know that is that only god can afford it
budget is not a problem for us
at least it hasn't been
it may be at this point
up until this point it really hasn't been
when i was in undergraduate school a long long time ago i noted that the starting average monthly
i noted at that point that if that's what my salary was that i drew then i would be making almost twice as much as my father made during his best year ever
i stopped worrying about money
that's a system too
sometimes it's a bit of a problem because i guess i don't really manage my money the way i should
i suppose i've lost money on not taking good advantage of investments
then again you said you are able to take trips
you do obviously have enough to live on
i guess you're indirectly budgeting
just the fact that you said you're both very frugal in spending the money
that's a form of budgeting i would think
it's kind of a strange topic for two people who don't really have a budget to talk about budgeting and how they manage their money
i guess we're both lucky in that regard then
we have one on the way
my wife
we're having one on the way in september
once you get ten children though you may have
all right
one nine and one thirteen
they are beginning to be a budget problem but have not been really up to this point
do you have them on an allowance
i give them an allowance
None
i put half of it in the bank
i give him the other half in cold cash
he has a teller card so he can do what he wishes with the money that i put in the bank
at least it isn't burning a hole in his pocket
that usually
capital punishment i guess out in california has had a lot of discourse in the paper
apparently they haven't executed anybody since nineteen sixty-seven i believe
that's as far back as i can remember
that's before my time actually
we lived in redwood city when we were out there
we found that
i really feel that the law enforcement community puts these people behind bars
these lawyer groups get together
they i think extend beyond the normal appeal process and just drag this guy his ultimate demise out for ten or fifteen years
i think that there's something that has to be changed in the system to do that
i think capital punishment was probably stringent enough
i think the appeal process is really getting in the way
do you feel as though there should be
i think that currently the way the law stands isn't so much that the laws are enforceable or not
it's at that point where they're saying here you're going on death row
you'll stay there for twenty years
nothing is being done about it
the laws exist and are frequently upheld in appeals court just because of technicalities
it's really getting out of hand in many states
has to separate the difference between somebody who is being set up in which grievous
and whether the rights of that individual have been impuned
the merits of the case in terms of
i'm at this juncture
i'm not sure what constitutes a technicality
that's what all these hearings are about
that's what all these court cases are about
our glorious mayor here in washington is six days away from getting out of the can
it didn't work
be that as it may everybody who got enough money will pump the appeal process dry
in the old days and say round about times of battle of hastings and the villages if you were a transgressor they either drove you out in the woods or you became a ward of somebody
you were his slave
if he didn't like what you did he killed you
that's pretty effective
it's not good for civil rights i guess
it's pretty effective in that you've got to get along in the community
if you don't you'll perish either by the hand of your master or by being pushed out in the woods
as man has gotten more complicated so all of the imaginations to protect him from being dumped on by civilian authority in criminal actions especially murder cases and that sort of thing
None
the whole idea behind the current criminal process system
for instance there's a case a few years back where
where his
old evidence was there the witnesses were there everything was conclusively pointing to this individual yet
i know the government gives drug tests to all new applicants coming into government
i quite frankly don't see anything wrong with it
i guess i'm not a good civil libertarian
i feel that if you're a drug user you have a hidden agenda that's difficult unless you really go into a deep background
of course we're
being involved in my organization we have deep background checks
sometimes drug use can escape that
i have absolutely no compunction about using any and all means to figure out who has a drug problem and putting that guy into therapy to break this activity
there isn't anything
getting stoned or high is the only thing in life that seems to be meaningful then maybe there is no hope
what's your feeling
i guess i'm probably a little more toward the other direction
i guess mainly because i
there's two sides to it i guess
one is that if you're coming to work under the influence of any sort of drug alcohol whatever or even if it's smoking inhibits your ability to function then i think that i don't have any problem at all with testing that individual on the spot
i guess i feel more like whatever you're doing in your own private life is your own private business
i guess part of the reason there is because of the fact that things like drug laws seem to come and go
we had prohibition for awhile
we didn't have prohibition
we've had i guess laws against various other forms of drugs for the last what sixty or seventy years i guess
i think the first morphine laws were like ninety or nineteen ten or nineteen five something like that
eighty years or so
i
it's hard i guess for me to justify what seems like basically a breach of the freedom from search and seizure on something that may or may not stand as a law fifty years from now or even twenty or ten
prohibition certainly didn't last
the thing of it is that is in many respects just i think an over simplification
i think there's so much criminal activity that people go into to support drug habits
you got to look at prohibition though
they support drug habits with things like burglary or prostitution or stuff like that
it goes back to that again
if you look at prohibition because it's illegal it costs more
face it you can buy pharmaceutical grade cocaine for what ten or twenty dollars an ounce
i
clearly if you're into coke and all you want to do is snort your brains out all day long if it was legal you could do it real cheap
you'd be a menace to nobody but yourself as long as you stayed at home and did it
i must admit that the production costs of these drugs are zippo compared to the street market costs and the costs to society
that's why there's people dealing it because there's money in it
i think that being in law enforcement i probably have a kind of a draconian philistine attitude toward it
i really feel as though the interdiction effort is
as soon as you get rid of one goon that's involved in drugs and tha-
another one will jump up
there's no way you're ever going to win that
we see
that's a losing fight
as soon as we wind up for
if we can just destroy the market by destroying the demand
people want to get stoned
i don't see that
it goes back to what can society impose on people
can you force somebody to be a good productive citizen
was raised with being a very strong bible work ethic
i'm one of these ten twelve fifteen twenty hour a day type people
yeah
i don't have any love lost for people who are on the public dole just because they're too lazy to get a job or that kind of stuff
None
the pay is regular
sometimes you don't get tuned in to what's going on
i think the biggest benefit or the biggest benefit other than wages that anybody could get in dealing with a large company is to be in a situation where you get to know what's going on
maybe that's probably the toughest thing in the whole world to do
what's your feeling about benefits
my husband works for mcdonald douglas
his medical benefits are so excellent
i work for a bank western financial
they don't let me know really about anything that's going on
all of a sudden we know we've got changes made
we're changing doing other kinds of things which to me is disturbing
i feel like if i don't necessarily need to be involved since i'm pretty much on a low level
you are right there
i'm pretty much on a low level as far as the company is concerned
i do kind of like to know what's going on and what's happening
i think i can be a better and more effective employee if i had a little bit more information along that line
i work for the government
actually i work for the f b i
my gosh
there's lots of things that we don't get told for good reason
basically there's lots of things that we should know about projects
i'm an engineer
i'm a cotr
i worked in the same lab with a guy
we didn't really know that much about each other's projects for two years
we should have
we're now collaborating
it
our organization is doing something else on monday
for all unclassified programs we're having little tables put up in front of lab in the hallways
all the other employees are going to come around and see what sort of things we do which i thought was kind of interesting that sort of thing
i think you can tolerate a lot of problems if you understand what's going on
of course most of the time management has a hard time distributing or getting the word out to the people who must know
if you don't really count if you're not part of the program you might not get told for months
you might if it doesn't impact you directly or if your management doesn't think that
regard to benefits most big organizations have decent benefits like retirement and that sort of thing
in the private sector i would think that one of the major situations especially when you reach the mid-fifties is
engineers
it's very much like the military
you think boy i'm getting more money
i'm getting more responsibility
as you climb up that tree pretty soon the branches get smaller on the top of the tree pretty soon somebody falls off
i've fallen off twice in the private sector
it seems to be kind of scary because you think of
my son's eighteen right now
None
the branches of engineering that he wants to go into is now kind of open
he's interested in basically three different areas
it's difficult for me to try to give him any kind of advice or to advise him or anything like that
he needs to do his own course of investigation and see what he can do because who knows what's going to happen in another thirty years
in thirty years it becomes pretty critical
my brother-in-law he's sixty
his company is closing up
because of the defense cutbacks and all that kind of stuff and all the nuclear and stuff which is what he was working on he's getting cut back
he's not ready to retire
budgeting activity in our household is kind of an informal kind of situation
we put
actually what happens is my check gets automatically deposited
all those people are counting on me to have my wife pay them
our budgeting
we really don't have a formal budgeting situation
every time i've ever tried one i've just got wrapped in my inertia
i've just decided not to pursue it
what's your budget situation
actually i've had a couple of different situations
at a certain point in life
my ex-husband was an alcoholic
we got divorced back in the mid-seventies
that left me with three teenagers
None
at any rate what happened was that i just absolutely put away all the credit cards
there was one that it was really handy to have
mostly we just spent cash whatever we had
if we didn't have it we absolutely didn't spend it
as things improved
once i got them all through college it came to the point where
my parents too
you were born in the late thirties or early forties
my mother hardly ever spent anything on herself or on the house
that's kind of the way i was raised
i'm not a very demanding person in that aspect
for quite a period of time i just flat didn't spend any money
meanwhile i had a building bank balance
my intent was that whenever something went on sale that i really had to have i would have the cash to buy it right then and there
that's good
that's the way i've operated ever since then
if something goes on sale and i don't have the money i still don't buy it
we put twenty-eight hundred dollars on the charge along with my trip to japan which was fourteen or fifteen hundred dollars
None
we got a monster bill coming in
we also have zero interest being paid
we pay it off as it goes
that's the way i do my credit cards now
we never really get that much over extended
it's the fact that i have enough of a cushion in the bank so that when they come i can pay them in full
we're doing that
we have
this is our big
two new pieces in the family room and new carpet
we've just been spending spending spending
we haven't really done anything for a long time because we've had two kids in college that just have graduated in the past year
we don't have that
it's about time that we did that
the terrible part about it i've looked at it all
it all looks still pretty good to me
i say it might go for another thirteen
too late we'll never find that out
you're lucky to have her because if you're like me and you have difficulty spending money you need somebody to help you spend it
certain things really do need to be done whether or not you think they should
None
we just sort of have had too many obligations to
we sort of take care of the kids when they were school and they got through school
that was the major decade of expenses
we feel as
as far as any formal budgeting we just apparently have been very fortunate
when we want to go out to eat we go out to eat
we don't have that uproarious a lifestyle
we have gone through what might be called the four seasons in the last week
i don't even want to tell you what ours has been like then
then today the wind has dropped off and also the temperature very cool
that's cool for u-
it feels cool compared to yesterday but very pleasant
our yard work everything is in bloom
our yard work is pretty tough the ground being dry
i guess it also brings about allergies
the weather
i think a lot of people have contracted spring fever too
had a lot of people out at work for fishing
as i've said we have had variable weather
also we have a lot of green
if you look outside you would like to go out and mow your lawn
fortunately it rains
you do not have to go out and buy the spark plug
we've had an unusually warm spring
i guess we're still in winter
to speak of
we usually average anywhere from six to twelve inches during the winter
this year as well as last year we have had less than four inches total accumulation
it's been inordinately warm here for this time of year
in that regard it's fine
of course we are about two hours from the northern border straight south
very windy
i have only lived in dallas for three years
i cannot believe that the wind blows all the time
i can't remember a day that i walked out and the wind wasn't blowing
i spent six years in graduate school in indiana in the flatlands
it was that way every day
that
you became accustomed to it i guess
otherwise as i said we have had a relatively mild winter
where did you go to school in indiana
i have a brother that lives in south bend indiana
i had to always
i didn't
you are not from that area originally i can tell
we lived in south bend for eight years and then moved to tennessee
i thought i heard a little tennessee in there somewhere
i spent thirteen years there
then moved to dallas about three years ago
you've moved around as much as i have
i see
i worked for the government
i moved much more frequently than i had intended for sixteen years
i guess this is my first conversation in this series
i received a call last night because of the
i had not received my personal identification number
i had to call jack godfrey today to ask him what it was because i had to abort the call last evening because i couldn't get on the line
is there any
it's just as long as you want to
it's just as long as you want to just a reasonable lengthy conversation
do you work for texas instruments
i was sent an application from jack
i was very much interested
in being a speaker for this
i work for texas instruments
i'm an environmental engineer
i see
that's really strange
i was wondering why we had somebody from maryland though
i have been a speaker in other similar type of activities
i know the reason why this is being gathered and the program and so forth
as i said i was interested in being a speaker
really
i always thought it's not necessary to measure your time just to go ahead and enjoy the conversation and end it when needed
in environmental engineering
is that with regard to work place engineering or just the work place environment
it's actually waste water
i see
taking care of
we monitor
we do have customers that their concerns are in the work place
we take care of that
within our department we take care of everything waste water solid waste and recycling and air and
i had
the call last evening was supposed to be concerning recycling
i had thought a little bit about it
that's interesting
i have a friend who is a planner
a city planner
one of his
he models city districts and so forth
does computer modeling
one of the
he gets inputs from an environmental engineer
our division is corporate wide
we take care of just the dallas area
we do air modeling also
i see
i take care of all the air modeling specifically for the dallas area
what we do we have a weather station that we get all of this information temperature wind speed wind direction
we have a huge chemical data base
that's interesting
and
it's concentration
if anything ever happened god forbid a building explosion or something we'd be able to track chemicals from that building with our weather station
okay
what do you think you would offer as far as information about selecting a school
first i think they've got to have a pretty good idea of what they want to do
once they have that then they can start looking in all the various publications that give out all the information about schools and write to the schools themselves and start finding out about the different requirements for the programs and what kind of job assistance and all that other kind of stuff they offer
do you feel that the
depending upon the field i know there are some fields which a person should go to that school all four years
i know there are some fields where it's really not necessary
it's your core education your general education requirements
if they want to get a liberal arts degree i don't know what advice i'd give them
political science
political science
i have a friend
u t d
something i think that i've noticed that
i have a friend
i think if you're going into law or medicine a very particular very specific field even engineering you can meet a lot of the requirements at a public institution
it's a lot cheaper
my parents made a mistake in sending my sister to a private institution for the first two years
she found out after that
she said my parents they really wasted a lot of money
right now i just
as far as selecting a school i feel that a lot of it depends upon the major
it does
i didn't know what i wanted to do after i got my degree
originally i had planned undergrad degree in political science and then a master's in public administration
i went ahead and pursued that
i as far as the thesis and decided to hell with it
from that point i went to law school
after a year and a half of that i decided i didn't want that either
i really did enjoy the law
that's where i wanted to be
i didn't want to go through the hassle that the law schools put you through because i never did want to be a practicing attorney
i've since discovered that i would be far better off being in the paralegal field
you don't have to put up with all the b s that the lawyers have to
that's what i'm pursuing right now i'm pretty happy with it so far
i'm pursuing what's called an interdisciplinary field
i'm a speech therapy major fortunately i have a good medical background
it's actually turning out to be more useful than what i thought
i also have a good languages background linguistics
it's all working together
good grief
the only field i'm not familiar with really is education which requires about four or five different fields really
it's a
i quickly dispelled that idea when i became a substitute teacher for a while just to get my feet wet
i said i couldn't do this everyday
maybe being a tenured professor would be one thing but being a public school teacher is entirely another thing
you are a disgruntled graduate student
i am just a disgruntled person all around
i'm the original mister scrooge i guess
i think
i think law would be a fine profession fine field to go into
i know one time i was in a political science class
talking about fields people going into different fields i made an off the cuff remark about lawyers
that was like a can of worms
you probably got everybody on you because they were probably all going to law school
it was just
that remark in itself is a slam
my best friends are blacks
it used to be jewish
now blacks i guess iraqi now is the
law was a lot of fun until you get to law school it doesn't become fun anymore
None
she's going into law
i'm really concerned about
all of her dreams will be dispelled
if you've ever seen the program paper chase it's very much like that except worse
i think it's probably more embarrassing and very painful
i see that happening
it's a lot of that it was enjoyable for a while
it's such a grind you begin to wonder
if i'm not
i wasted a year and a half of awfully hard
i aged ten years
i wouldn't trade the experience for
it was an i guess
i think probably the biggest
for myself i think that military experience
i just wish that there was something else
i got tired of the service after a while
what was your job
command post
i was a linguist
i thought maybe you might have had some experience with the r c one thirty-fives
i didn't go flight crew
matter of fact i didn't make it completely through that field
after about eighteen months of talking about the year and a half training it's something
i think that's why children really need to think about the field they're going into and spend a lot of serious reading not just thinking about
they actually should do some reading they should study it
and if it's possible even get some experience at it at least watch some people do it
i think there's a lot to be said for kids working after school
they find out just how much of a people person they are
i tell you what
i can tell you one thing
there are just some people that i
i eventually worked as a lab technician
i worked front desk
somebody could walk in the door
i knew exactly what they were going to do say
i hate having to play such a nice guy
especially when it's all phony
especially when you got some jerk coming in
i deal much better in research and books and stuff like that which is why i'm going to enjoy the paralegal field a lot
i was just wondering getting back to the school thing i almost wish that there was something
i'm not buying a car any time soon
i just bought mine
i like where all the controls they're in good spots
i have an automatic i can't drive a standard
it's supposedly real reliable
i had a mazda r x seven before that
that was the worse car i've ever driven in my life
the buick was great
that was the only major problem that i had
i had little piddly things like i had to replace the muffler
i had replaced the tires
seems like it had a radiator leak once
i never had any major anything
it was a standard also
the clutch went out on it toward the end
the last two years it seemed to go out really easily
that's a lot
i went ahead and bought another standard when i bought the honda
i don't think i'm going to do that again
i never
i've never owned one
i don't drive one a lot
i don't feel comfortable in traffic with it
for everything i've heard it's a lot easier to sell an automatic
resale value is really important to me
i did pretty well with my regal because it was in really good shape
the interior was still really nice
it had some nice features
i ended up okay with the buick
i anticipate the same thing with the honda whenever i decide to sell it
that's what i did with the mazda drive it until the clutch went out and the wheels fell off
probably what i'll do again
i really like the hondas
it was so small
it's really impractical
i wanted something with a real trunk and four doors something easy to get in and out of
i looked at the galant
those were really nice
i can get them for a great price
i found it hard to deal with the dealership i was going through
that's how i ended up with a honda
i was thinking about buying a prelude from a friend who was moving to new york or something
she was going to sell her car because she didn't need it anymore
it was only like a year old
i had never driven a prelude
i went to a dealership because they had the same year and same model
i went and i test drove it
i just fell in love
with this brand new white prelude
i love all those little things that you don't need
they're so wonderful
two days later i bought this car
i felt like that was largest impulse that i had ever made
the two
i got it right after high school
by the time i traded it in it was ready
i got my buick as a high school graduation gift
i guess this wasn't really an impulse
buying it right then and right quickly was kind of impulsive
i'd been thinking about buying a new car for about three years
i was just scared to
None
i was going to buy one once
i worry about who's driven them and what they've been through and the warranties and things like that
like on hondas they
you can request whatever maintenance records exist on cars
you can have them checked out by mechanics and stuff
they can't stop you from doing it
even if they didn't you can still get a good idea if you can get a good mechanic to
i guess that's all
i enjoyed talking to you
what are your first comments on that subject
i would cut the prison systems and let them self-support
have private enterprise do it
they're talking about having it as a business so the government doesn't have to deal with it
yeah
i think it's all funded either state or federally funded
obviously
None
to me it
there's not enough room in these prisons and that to continue funding it
they think they need to maybe have private enterprise come in
the other way i'm thinking about is they should be self-supporting like the prisoners make
it's the same thing like the whole the whole police department of the united states
someone gets picked up for drunk driving
it's self-defense on that point
as far as my defense budget they're cutting it back now what twenty-five percent
again i'd like to see something on the other
i'm lost on that one
its tough to say what
i was just talking to somebody else
all those european countries they pay all the way through college and stuff like that
not so much pay
i'm just saying that even the differences is that some countries pay for students to go through college and etcetera
here it's just up to high school
we don't even push the fact to the high school kids that there's other means of education out there rather than college
why not an apprentice out to a company and learn from down on the bottom as a wood worker or just a technician
of course which would mean
in a few years it's not going to be overnight
that would come down
i think that's one reason we do have the education is that what it takes for these companies to bring somebody on board
they're not willing to put
it's as far as the technical side
even
one of the biggest things now is paralegals and stuff
they're trying to get more people into that field
they can't just bring somebody in without even having gone to school in that area before they can work for a lawyer as a paralegal
i see it being done
she's training her
i'm assuming that it can be done
my perspective is that i've been with a couple of big companies now
it's like they'd are unwilling to put the time in
they want somebody when they bring them in that they have something a certain amount to contribute
obviously there's a lot to learn after that
that's true
i'm sure there's a lot of
businesses are small businesses that could
all of a sudden we had a bad frequency there or something
we had some interference
i changed that
None
i think maybe they need to help promote that more give incentives like if they do bring somebody on they will pay some of their costs or give tax breaks or whatever it is for them to train people
stuff like that programs like that
i don't know what kind of options they've got
that's something about what germany's supposed to be doing something similar to that right now
they have jobs out on bulletin boards so people know what is open for an apprentices in different fields
that again would cut some of our budget down for education but build up our education with the people at high school level
they go on the unemployment list before we have turn around
i'm for college
there's a lot of people that don't want their higher education as far as quote college is concerned
it was only it was either sixty percent or forty percent go to college
out of that percentage only so many can get their degree
i thought that was interesting
most people i knew have gone and got their degree
there's a lot of them out there that haven't
i
was basic in a upper middle class area
i think that demographic area there a lot of them do go on
they go to college etcetera
it seems to me that kids that get out of high school that parents have gone to college and college here and college there that are really not interested in going to college and forced into it usually are your drop outs where if they're said hey it's just as advisable to go into something you enjoy and you like
you can get just as far as being a journeyman carpenter or an electrician or plumber or anything else like that make as much money
if they enjoy it more they'll make a lo- happier life for themselves
they have so much to spend
there's not enough money to spread around
the deficit basically is that the trade surplus between the other countries that we have more money going out and too many goods coming into this country
japan still does not let us compete fairly in their country
obviously the demand for their goods is quite high here
they can get their goods in here
to start even that out we need to continue to at least threaten that
we're going to give them higher tariffs etcetera to raise their prices to ours
it's just that they're
i think you're going to find that just because the united states there is such a demand here the market
the money being spent and the goods flow in and we don't sell products abroad as much as we bring in
i think
one of the news stations they had on there where the output from the united states was basically from smaller businesses rather than the larger ones are exporting
i think she's mostly german shepherd
she was
a person lives across the street from me brought her home from work because a coworker of hers had this dog appear on its front doorstep
somebody abandoned her
she's only six to eight weeks old
i can't understand why anyone would abandon this dog though
she's this young
she's almost housebroken
she actually asks to go out
yeah
i can't imagine what would have been wrong with this dog
i have a dog that god gave us too
we've had her now for about three years
i just
i had a
last year i had another german shepherd
this one was purebred
when he was about seven months old got a gastrointestinal virus and was just about on death's door
managed to get him to a veterinarian in time
on huge doses of antibiotics
he actually got over it with
he had actually was able to get him over that
he was gaining weight again was just getting healthy
he put on about fifteen to twenty pounds after the thing
he got hit by a cadillac
i couldn't believe it
that was really hard
that was even harder for
the dog was being house sit or dog sit whatever by some friends of mine down the street
they just felt absolutely awful
i bet
i felt probably worse for them than for me
gosh this fellow's wife who was watching the dog i think she loved that dog more than i did
she was really attached to it
it's unfortunate
now i've got another one
it was just over a year
it was in march of last year
yeah
didn't have one for a whole year
i had a german shepherd before this one
when she died it just absolutely destroyed me
i was just
i decided it
god gave me this dog
he had a beagle that he loved
when that beagle passed away he wasn't going to have another dog
the beagle died in i guess about october
by christmas time we went down to the i gue- humane society and got another one a stray
she turned out to be a great dog
we had her for six years until she just passed away recently
again dad went through the whole thing
you just do
it's like a kid
hopefully this one here cocoa will live a full life
when
my doggie that we have now she's mostly golden retriever
the vet called her a golden mix
who knows
she's that sort of strawberry blonde reddish color
her nose is that pink
she's sort of unicolor
i named her rosebud
a friend of mine said that she gre-
this friend of mine grew up on a farm and said that she had a pet cow named rosebud
she said there's a lot of longevity in that name
they're always happy
she's so easy going and so sociable
she loves everybody
little kids can just maul all over her
she just thinks it's great
this friend of mine has th-
it's the same guy that was watching my german shepherd when he got hit
went fishing with him on friday and took
he's got a pure bred golden retriever
i had the puppy a little tiny puppy
we went and took the two dogs up fishing
they had a ball romping around
you can't get a golden retriever near water without it jumping in
this golden retriever jumped in the really fast moving river current
he's just about a year old himself and never had really
he jumped in the river
the puppy jumped into some of the pools but not into the
that's good
i was careful to keep her away from the fast moving water
if she fell in then i'd had to go in after her
up here the waters probably about forty degrees right now
i would not have been fun trying to retrieve her
this dog dennis jumped in and got this look on his face like what do i do now as he's floating down the river then finally discovered that he could swim and actually paddled up against the current and made it back to the shore and climbed up
he jumped in again
he was swimming for quite a bit all afternoon
i pulled her out and then had to wrap her up in a sweatshirt because she was shivering so bad
she got over it
the german shepherd that i had before
we had a little pool
she did not want any part of swimming
she liked to get in the pool on the first step
in the summertime when it's really really hot
she'd just lay there on that step and just cool off
i live right across the street from a big lake here
i'm wondering if she'll want to go out there and go swimming next year
i've got
she doesn't run loose
she could go in sometime if i'm watching her
the one that we had just didn't want any part of that
gee she hated baths worse than anything
it was just really a fight to get her clean
have you seen canine
the movie
part of the movie is where he's trying to clean this dog up
it's just hysterical
my dog last german shepherd it was a real chore trying to give him a bath too
that was the thing i couldn't figure out
he would go in the lake
normally he didn't seem to have a problem with getting wet
if you wanted to get him wet forget it
that's how cleo w-
that was the only time she wanted to get wet
she didn't want you getting her wet
you really need to see that movie
we bought the movie
i don't know how many times i've seen it
it came on t v the other night
i was watching it again
my husband heard me laughing
he said i can't believe that you're still getting such a kick out of that movie
i saw the previews for it and all
it did look like it'd be a good movie
really haven't had a whole lot of time to get out to see the movies lately
i got to do more fun things
we always wait until we can rent them
i'm a second lieutenant in the air force
i travel a lot
i'm a engineer at the rolm laboratory griffis air force base up here
that's how i got into the switchboard project and all that
it's nice having a dog here
un-
what's the word i'm looking for lots of affection unconditional affection from the dog
it's been nice talking to you
i don't have strong feelings about changes to be made in the jury system do you
not at all
this past semester i've taken two criminal justice classes and have discussed a lot on trials
then you must know a lot more about this than i do
i don't think the judge should have
i don't even think that it should be unanimous either
what about the idea that one is only guilty when proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt
i thought that was the point of a unanimous jury was the idea that if everyone agrees then there shouldn't be any reasonable doubt
if there are some people who don't agree it seems to be there must be at least a reasonable doubt for some people
you hear of course there's cases where someone has been put in prison falsely accused
more than likely the people that are on the jury know what they're doing
you
my few friends who have say just the opposite
they say they're remarkably incompetent and don't know what they're doing say one thing in the courtroom and then as soon as they get in the back room they just start letting all their prejudices hang out to air and all that
you would think that they would get that in the
i know they automatically
when you're chosen is you're automatically like a professor in criminal justice or something like that
they don't want
they tend
since anyone can get out of it who basically says they don't want to do it
it's anyone can get out of jury just about
it's not really my peers that
let's say i were arrested falsely or not and put up for a jury i wouldn't feel that i would be being tried by a jury of my peers
i'd be tried by a jury of
i get a little bit nervous about it
None
i was called once
i was out of the country
apparently they thought i served
i didn't make any noise about it
they said the record showed i served
i was out of the country at the time
i'm pretty sure i didn't
i guess there's a lot of problems with the legal system
it seems to me that if you could just have a simple majority or something you could pretty much
a majority of the jury
it's saying look we don't like the way he looks
let's throw the rascal in jail and stuff
you also get a lot of juries are extremely
from what i hear
i have some friends who do expert witness testimony
they say that juries are extremely vulnerable to sort of emotional pitches
if it's a corporation that was harming some individual or something like that they get very much
it's just a big faceless corporation
let's make them pay as much as possible
i'm
the problem is i can't guarantee that a judge would necessarily be much better than a jury
i'd be real nervous having a jury not at least fully agree on what the settlements would be
i don't think the judge should just make the decision alone
least with the jury you have twelve people that are going to decide
you're the person's fate
how about having a jury and a judge work together on it somehow
no
it's sad though the people though that
somebody's life is in twelve people's hands
sometimes those twelve people could care less
they fool the defense in thinking that they're
when they go through those processes they kind of pick out who they want
of course
it's political maneuvering
the one side is looking for someone whose face they think will want to hang everyone
the other one is going to look for someone very sympathetic
they want to find a juror that's going to be most persuadable by their arguments
i wish it were a little bit harder to not serve on juries actually
i know it's tricky
i know an awful lot of intelligent people who just
i'll tell them that
they just answer one of the questions the wrong way because you can do that
i guess it's just that maybe people are upset at court
if it was a family member of theirs though that was innocent
they'd want to be on that jury
course they would be barred
it sounds like we both need to get out there and serve on a jury
they will eventually
it was nice talking with you
that's a good question
they did a full blood screen
they didn't call that a drug test
i've had
really i don't mind them
they get drug tested randomly
that would probably bother me to wake up
i guess it depends on if you got something to worry about
i come from kind of a biased opinion because i'm a therapist and a drug and alcohol counselor
i've done employee assistant work
i know the kind of cost businesses go through in terms of accidents
it's in the billions of dollars every year
the only way that they can prevent that
the problem in the work place is that people are
if your boss is your drinking buddy or whatever you can come to work drunk and get in an accident
he'll cover up for you
ends up costing the company lots and lots of money
i think anyone in a public job like bus drivers and cab drivers and police officers and
secretaries aren't really going to cost the company that much money if they fall face forward in their typewriter or something
i'm kind of biased too because i don't do drugs
i guess that's kind of biased
it's i think one of the problems with it is it affects a lot of other folks on the job if somebody else is impaired
generally you know it
you find out one way or another if somebody's got a problem on the job
like you say even if it's just the secretary
if her work or abilities start affecting her co-workers then it's still a problem
what do you do about
it's been the whole weekend since they've done anything
they happen to be tested monday morning
they could be fired for that
that's kind of unfair also
in terms
you're breaking the law anyway
probably the biggest problem with those is they don't do a real good job of assessing for alcohol
that's probably the biggest problem there is
i know a lot of companies that will
they would pay for an alcohol they don't always pay for drug rehabilitation
i guess that's one of the positive things that have come out of it some of the employee assistance program
i think the company benefits in the long run
what kind of testing do they do when you went
it's a urine test
you have to seal the bottle yourself and label it yourself and
that happens
it's hard to believe
i guess it does
there are people that pay other people
those are expensive tests
it depends really on how strong a test it is
as far as how far back they can check
they've some companies that are doing hair tests
they can apparently test
because some of the residue ends up in your hair follicles
that's weird
they've got it pretty precise now
they can go back and look at in terms of growth in a hair when you used and that type of thing
i guess if they perfect that is not quite as cumbersome as having to go fill a bottle or give blood or something like that
i did too
tell me about china cry
china cry was basically the true story written by this lady who
her time frame was prior to the nineteen forty-nine revolution
although she herself had never really accepted jesus or gone through any of the other christian portions of the faith repentance baptisms et cetera et cetera she had always felt a very strong leaning in this direction
whenever the cultural revolution of nineteen forty-nine occurred and most churches were either banned or all the clergy and so forth were killed or imprisoned and the property confiscated she was safe because she had not officially joined the christian movement
he was rather well to do in the old regime
the communist chinese didn't like this at all
the bourgeoisie was out of style then
they kept picking at him picking at her mother and finally started picking on her
and getting her to
they were starting to accuse her of crimes and atrocities before the revolution and had her write her own story over and over and over
i think i'm leaving out a portion
she went through college and graduated very high up in her class and had gotten a job as an instructor
they were starting to have her teach history for the soldiers
when they decided that she needed to start recanting of all of her pre
they kept on and on at her
in the meantime she and her husband were expecting their own child
the people kept harassing her over a period of months
finally they carried her out into the courtyard either really to shoot her or to go through the motions of shooting her executing her by firing squad
the lord just said no
this is not going to happen even though this lady has not really
she's one of mine
the soldiers were blinded when they shot
her life was spared
this frightened the commandant
he called this kind of stuff off and just put her in the labor camp
course here's this woman who is heavy with child dragging rocks around
she put in for going to
her husband had escaped to hong kong
she put in to go see him
over time she
finally through her perseverance and writing enough letters to enough different people embarrassed enough of the middle bureaucracy that they finally let her go
of course she had to walk
they stripped her of everything practically besides the clothes on her back
she went across the border to her husband and other child that they'd already had to freedom
they knew that she wasn't going to come back
she did years later when the liberalization of china happened
she was not persecuted or anything else like that
interesting story
very moving too
i don't even remember seeing that advertised
it was probably here and gone fairly quickly
it was within ninety days
that recent
it was advertised over a period of about ninety days
i see what you mean
it wasn't
they didn't have it in too awfully many movie houses
it was in the
it had large
i guess what i saw most recently and luckily i saw it only a week ago
my husband and i had this great desire to go see a comedy
we ended up going to see green card
he chose it
it's got this wonderful french actor who's
it was his
he's been a star in france and a wonderful actor who we've enjoyed for years
he's never made an american film
i see
this was his american film debut he speaks very broken english
basically he played a frenchman who married an american girl in a marriage of convenience so that he could get his green card which is what an alien needs to work in this country
because she could claim she was married she could get an apartment or a condominium in a very exclusive building in new york that had an outside garden which is very unusual there
she was a horticulturist
that was sort of her dream
i see
of course they got married
they never saw each other again
except fate through them together threw
the immigration and naturalization service started investigating
they had to get back together and get their stories straight
there was no proof whatsoever
it was
they fell into like at any rate
when they went to the query or inquisition or whatever
he said something because his english was so poor for the most part
he was so proud of himself for giving all the correct answers that on the last one he said i never remember that answer
that clued the investigator that he had memorized a series of answers
did you go to college
where did you go
it was sweeper college of about seven hundred and fifty students
i had gone to a small school growing up
a lot of my friends went to university of michigan
my parents were retiring in south carolina when i graduated and were looking for a southern school u of m seemed overwhelming in size
what about you
you're from the midwest too
i live in texas now
i'm in texas
my brother's in austin
he lives lakeway
he had moved
austin is so pretty
i love it
your daughter is going to be a sophomore
my oldest will be a sophomore
because you live in austin is she thinking about the university of texas
having gone to the university of minnesota i know what a big university is like
one thing that i did this summer which i thought might benefit both my daughters is my youngest daughter got involved in band
baylor has a band camp
she went for a week
it was overnight
they lived in the dorms
i thought this would expose both of them to what it's like on a a smaller college campus
my oldest one just wasn't impressed at all with the idea of a small school
i still think the exposure was good
the reason i ask if you went to college is i thought
there's all of these areas to look at in making the decision
those were several that we did consider
my parents certainly didn't push but wanted me to look in the south
because i had been in a small school they suggested that probably i
they suggested that i might want a smaller school because i was used to a lot of one-on-one small group situations
i did pick it because at the time i was interested in majoring in biology
i also wanted to spend one year studying in europe
how exciting
i had had an a f s student from germany live with us our senior year we just thought that would be a wonderful thing
i ended up majoring in french
i'd always loved working with children
i found that i couldn't fit everything in
because i had had a fair amount of french going in i was able to do my year's study in france and able to take a lot of the other courses that interested me
that was some of
that worked out very well for you
several of the things you mentioned were the things that our son has talked a lot about texas a and m
he thinks he wants to be a writer
i don't think that
then he should come to u t
really his graduating class will probably be in the neighborhood of eight hundred and fifty to a thousand
he's used to a bigger size my brother he would have family close by
there are advantages
i also
i had so many friends who did go from our small school to university of michigan which was so large
they really felt like they were numbers
i went from a large high school to a large university
i definitely felt like i was a number
it is a different feeling
that was my only option
i just really couldn't look at anything else
that was the one and only thing i could really afford other than a junior college which i didn't want to do
that's how my decision was made
that's certainly
especially today with the cost of college
that is a major consideration
i do feel fortunate that texas has so many good schools
even though baylor
when you mentioned that we have friends who have children there who just love it
for a private school it is not as expensive as most are
it is a smaller size
i do feel like there are a lot of options
even this year jay had an aptitude test
what does
he's really strong in math and science too
we keep encouraging him to keep an open mind
she has interests that are just going in all directions
i don't know
she may end up doing something with that
i am a single mom
i've been
i made the mistake of dropping out of college to get married
i'm trying to have my children not make the same mistake
i'm showing them if you're strong in math science kiddos this is one area where women can make some decent money
i'm kind of really putting the practical application and saying yet do something that you enjoy
by all means go get that piece of paper
it sounds like he's got some really good strong ideas of what he wants to do
he has even
now that he's in high school
of course there is still time
he's beginning to feel that as much as he enjoys writing he wonders if he can make a living at it
the it's
do you do a lot of dining out
we do it more when we have company come
what about you
we do some dining out
i do a lot of cooking
mostly when we go out it's my husband and i
we don't go out too often as a family
we do enjoy dining out
one of our favorite places here in the dallas area is atlantic cafe
i haven't been there
i've been to cafe pacific
now that's down in highland park
i love it
the area my brother lived in dallas for a number of years
we came up one time when my father was visiting
we all ate there
their seafood was wonderful
it's fabulous
where is the atlantic cafe
atlantic cafe is down i believe it's on mckinney
originally the two the guy who owns the cafe pacific and the guy who owns the atlantic cafe were partners in the atlantic cafe
they separated
the guy started cafe pacific
i loved them both
what we'd really like if we just have a casual evening is houston's
i've heard that's really good too
you have to expect to wait at least an hour
you have to go knowing you're going to be sitting there there for an hour waiting to get in
as long as you know that
they have i think just about the best prime rib anywhere
my husband really likes their ribs
it's hysterical
we sit there for an hour waiting to get in
we get there
we don't even look at the menu
i know right away what we want
we really enjoy prime rib too
actually the steak and ale out here
we've gone to
my in-laws also enjoy prime rib when they've had some of their specials on sunday monday or tuesday night the time we went the prime rib was really good
i've been there for like lunch i've never been there for dinner
it was good
that's great
another nice place for prime rib is baby doe's maxwell's nice
i've heard about that too no
one place i'd never been that i would really like to go to is lawry's
i had heard that too
i've never been there
i've heard it's real good
have you been to the little not for prime rib but the cafe de france right here on central expressway
they have one in richardson that i've been to
they have real nice lunches
have you been there for lunch
yes primarily lunch and breakfast sometimes
during the week they often have a limited menu choice but very reasonable complete dinners for six ninety-nine that included the soup or salad entrees and accompaniments and dessert
the
my husband and i like veal a lot
their veal dishes have been good
i keep hearing the advertisements of it they keep saying it's wonderful it's wonderful
i was thinking it's supposed to be a family place over near plano super bowl
i've not been there
i haven't either
i've only been there for lunch
i went with a friend
we met her husband down on greenville
we just we-
we both enjoy mushroom soup
linda had told me they had the best mushroom soup
they did
we just had soup and salad so we could make room for the dessert
s-
i've heard of it
where it's made
it's like a
it's all chocolate made like a paper bag it's filled with what whip cream and strawberries and something
it had strawberries kiwis and raspberries in a raspberry puree
it was plenty because it was very rich
i wished i'd had a camera
i bet it was
we took another friend with us
they had a berry assortment
it was raspberries and blueberries and strawberries on a plate with a custard on the bottom
they did the raspberry puree just kind of like in a decoration on the
it was really relatively simple
it was good
that's one of the things that i do enjoy when you get a good restaurant
i love fresh berries
their fruits are always exceptional
know
they must have a special source for getting them because even at the farmer's market
i was home a few years ago
my sister and brother-in-law were going to take us out for dinner
i was really amazed
the restaurants up there were kind of quaint
they were real real pretty
they lacked
they lacked just the i don't know
the restaurants down here seem like they have
i thought
we don't go out very often
when we do go out in a way it's like a little mini vacation i guess
it's a whole experience
the atmosphere and service i think are important too
because the ones that aren't so good just don't make it
it is wonderful
it's at plano road and campbell
is kind of fun
i had more of that in my childhood days than i have now
i grew up in an area that was just a few feet from a rather large lake and a few more miles from that was a even larger lake
we had
we had every kind of things from canoes to paddle boats sailboats speedboats
we did a lot of
i think
couple of guys restored an old wooden boat that was built back in the mid-thirties and got a new canvas sail for it and had a real big old four- foot center board that went down in the middle to keep you upright when the waves
the wind came from the side
we got that thing in the water and had a real good time with it
it wasn't like the newer ones that have nice chambers that keep it afloat or keep it upright again
sailing was kind of nice to learn the maneuvers you had to make to work your way down a lake or work back up against the wind as it were tacking back and forth
more than once we'd get out there on a really stormy day
the storm or the wind was due to the front blowing
as soon as the front came over it was calm so you're out in the middle of nowhere with a paddle
you paddle your way back in and hope it doesn't start raining on you right away
that didn't always work
it's a nice hobby to have
things change i guess
about the only memories that i have of boating
my husband's family had a motor boat when we got engaged
they took us out on the lake several times
i really did enjoy that
i don't know that i ever learned to drive it or anything
we did some water skiing of course and driving around the lake in the boat and just the basic safety rules and things i found real interesting
they just didn't patrol you like they did with the automobile or whatever
the laws were there
if you didn't obey them
i found the motor boating was real fun
i remember learning how to ski
the lake that we learned on was the smaller of the two that we had access to
it was maybe fifteen twenty acres
None
i got all ready to go
i was down in the water and set to go
just as that boat took off a turtle bit me in the middle of the back
it bit enough to where i let go
the boat went off without me
i reached back there and pushed him away and got out of the water a while
it didn't even leave a mark
i told everybody what happened
they go yeah sure
i get back down in there
i'll be if he didn't do it again
this time a little earlier i had let go before then and before they took off this time and swatted him away
i moved over a few feet in the water and got out of his little realm where he was living underneath the dock and managed to get up
i got up
it was a nice long skiing career
now i've gotten to where skiing is just kind of wears me out more than it does thrill me
i've done about all i dare do on skis skiing on one and jumping around here and there
i know how you can get injured doing much more than that
i just can't risk it right now being a head of the family and the breadwinner and all that
just can't take the risk i did as a dumb teenager i guess
life just changes a little bit in that respect
i'd kind of like someday to maybe end up on a pair of skis that doesn't have a
i haven't managed to get a hold on that craft yet
it would be kind of nice
just from what i've seen you just kind of work your way up to it and turn around real quick
i don't know
maybe someday
my son
we haven't traveled outside the united states that much
we usually take family type vacations
that's great
when both of my kids were much younger
this time we're going to be going with just one daughter
she's nine
it ought to just be a ball
that's a perfect age for disneyworld
that's great
we've been there a number of times
we're going next year
we go on a lot of business trips
i don't work
you travel a lot
we do
in the position he's in they don't care if i go along
it's great
disneyworld is the one for a week next year it will be at this time of the year
this year matter of fact we're leaving next saturday for new orleans
that will be fun too
have you ever been there
i know they've changed it a lot and upgraded everything
we used to have a lot of fun there
we went there once
we were on our way home
we were driving
we said let's go to new orleans
when he said this year i have a week there on a project
i said i'll going along
that can be fun
that's probably
they do have a mardi gras night planned
i'm kind of anxious for that
yours to disneyworld sounds
with a daughter nine it is just
if you're working then you're probably on a limited amount of time per year that you can go
not really
i just save vacation for things like that
just travel whenever we can
i really i think travel
when i heard my topic today i thought okay that's my favorite
really at our point of life our children are grown
it has just
it depends where he's going
it's
i like to sight see
i love to shop
that's perfect
got to pick and choose the places
one of my very favorite
i would have to say we both end up going to las vegas probably once every maybe year and a half
presently we have quite a few frequent flyer miles i've just requested that they send us two of our coach tickets
we have a lot of flying with continental they're recommending that you use those because they don't know the future of continental
i said now that we have all the miles
we are thinking that we might go to las vegas during the winter this year sometime for just kind of a quick trip
when we normally go that way we like to go to california at the same time because we really don't get out there as often as you could probably from texas
our last big trip we drove through new mexico and colorado and went to the grand canyon and back through silverton and durango
it was fun
the kids were old enough to really enjoy it
really for the children to learn as well for a family vacation that would be excellent
it takes a while just to even get to what i would call the more picturesque part of the country
we rented a car for two weeks
we went through the northern route and through utah and as far west as las vegas
we returned through new mexico that you just mentioned
it was just great
there's too much to see really
i think that's
i work at t i
we have of course started
i haven't gotten called yet
i feel that it's pretty good if they feel like there is a vast majority of the people at the company doing drugs
i think that they thought that there was a lot of drug usage here at t i
i think our latest statistic said something like ninety-nine point nine eight percent were testing negative on all the testing
yet that can be carried to an extreme too
i think it's a good idea
i think just the idea that you may be tested might keep you off of them or get you off of them because you're
i think they may put
you go through the program
i'm in favor of that type of thing
that
it is possible that they can't do as good a job as they might do
of course they can also cause injury to other people
if they're not fully functional mentally while they're doing their job they could cause serious injury to another people
you never know they could just go off the deep end on something that
it would be out of the question
i guess you can get the wrong kind of stuff and kill yourself just by having a wrong mix of or watered down or whatever all kinds
they talk a lot about drugs there
i think it's good that they're trying to start some programs down in the elementary schools
i think they can test all they want for drugs
if they need to do that as a condition for employment
i know many of them are doing it
i know my son has had to do it for both sam's and wal-mart i don't know how many others are doing that
i think that's good because
it's just a problem that no one is sure just how to handle i think
i think personally i'm for it
there's several reason why i could think of right now why we shouldn't have it such as drug testing
yeah
i didn't get a raise this year
nobody in our company got a raise
yet they spend all the money on drug testing
if they weren't spending all the money on drug testing people could have got a raise
there's different
i think that's more of a personal view of mine other than a yes sir we should have drug testing because there's really a problem
i know that
i have other views to it
i didn't think it was that expensive because my son was in probably a week and a half period sam's and wal-mart are owned by the same people he took one for wal-mart for job hiring
sam's called him
if it's a thousand dollars that's a thousand dollars they wasted
maybe they run
i don't know
maybe it's under a health type program that it would catch a lot of things
for all the pub-
i just can't imagine them screening all these employees paying a thousand dollars to get them
have you done any painting projects lately
was not a big deal two little deals
the first one
it was very easy
was it
i've never painted anyth-
you'd have to hire someone if you needed to paint inside your house or something i know i can do it
the second one was i bought some toys at a craft fair
i decided to paint them
that wasn't as easy as painting the apartment
that's half the problem right there is that it was a oil base
i had to get
when i painted them i didn't realize that we didn't have any turpentine or paint thinner or anything in the house
i had it all over my hands
at first i didn't realize
i didn't realize that i needed that
i kind of knew in the back of my mind
you can't use oil on wood
i just had it all over my hands
i went to wash the brushes out and wash my hands
you can't wash it off with water
you have to get a solution
i had to drive to the store with paper towels all over my hands to go buy some paint thinner and everything like that
downstairs in the apartment we just used a latex base
you can drip it on
is that what you usually use in the house is latex
it just like
it's just important to look for one that doesn't have lead in it
i guess a friend of mine had a
she just started up a day care center
one of the real strict restrictions was the fact that she had to have a special kind of paint that was fire proof and lead free and all that other good stuff she had that done
so to speak i had to paint the inside of this warehouse thing
that you keep some farm equipment in what i had to do is just coat this bare wood with a sealer
i had this big five gallon jug
it was like paint thinner
it looked just like it was the viscosity of paint thinner you just took a roller and put it on there
if you saw that the wood was getting wet that was all you needed
i guess it worked out
i think though we're lucky that we didn't have to do any detail work because i don't know if i could
what about the trim in your house
it was really easy
i just what
we had a couple of different size brushes real easy
if it
there was wall paper
i was just doing just the trim around the doors and windows
there was wall paper
it came right off there was no major mistakes
did you have one coat or two
two actually it
there was
around the windows if you got it on the glass we let it dry and scraped it after that
that would be really a time saver
if you just
it wasn't
i don't know it's funny
it's like if you just go slow at least i didn't get that many mistakes i didn't make that many mistakes
me i would have had to have taped the whole thing and then brushed around the edges
i'd have probably rolled it on
it would have taken me forever
the first time it'd probably would have taken me forever
my friend said just go ahead you just go ahead
how long did it take you all
a couple of week ends
there was two of you all
they were doing all sorts of repairs
i was just painting because i don't know how to do anything else
there's a whole bunch of people
now i feel like if i ever buy a house i can probably paint if nothing else
i think i could probably do it as long as the hardware store told me what to buy then i could do it
i went in to a hardware store to get paint for those toys
the guy said get this it's a nice shiny gloss which was true
i didn't realize what pain it is to clean the brushes and everything if you don't have latex
how did you like that topic
i don't know
i think a company should be able to test any employee any time they see fit
i just don't think there's a place in our environment in the work force for drugs or alcohol either
i don't believe in drugs or alcohol
if you'll remember when the teachers had to take the t cat they were talking about drug testing us we were laughing that we'd have to go to that examination to prove we could read and write with a specimen of urine we found it belittling
uh-huh i can sort of understand that
not being a teacher as you are i was not quite as sympathetic as i probably would have been if kay were a teacher or something
then at the same token i'm not against
i look at airline pilots bus drivers people that really have other peoples' lives in their hands truck drivers it's supposed to be a huge problem with truck drivers using drugs and alcohol
that's right i think it is a big problem with them using drugs from what you read
in those areas i really do believe that maybe we should clean up our house
i agree with it
i know kay's company
many of the people even the professional people boy they were so against them doing that
i thought jeez to me it's quite simple
you either need a job or you don't
the job is what provides all of your needs
if they say hey you can't do this work i'd say hey i agree i won't do that
i think most of them have agreed to that now although they didn't like it at first
i think it's just like anything else a new concept
that is belittling i'd probably feel the same way if i had to do that
at the same token in education we can't do random drug testing on kids their rights are protected
gosh they would really raise a stink if that was to happen
what if you're going to do teachers or professionals why not do the kids
when we see them and they're under the influence
i wouldn't be opposed to it at all
the clicker comes in when it's time to
we'd better keep talking because i've not heard it have we
do we agree or unless it's not me
if you agree that
here we go again yeah i believe that truck drivers and people that have
even though teachers have other kids lives in their hands if they come in stoned or they come in drunk there was an incident in my children's high school where a teacher stayed drunk
when i think of drug testing i'm thinking of the outside of education
no
you don't think of that first hand normally
we are as susceptible a society as anybody else yeah
did you hear on the news where the teacher of the year was up for child molestation
isn't that mind boggling
it's mind bog-
i know teachers are just like everybody else same problems the same good qualities as anybody else
then i think if push came to shove i'd probably be drug tested
it does
you think the benefit would be greater than the
as i say i'm sitting there fussing and fussing
yet i know of one teacher who was an alcoholic in school as well as i presume out
that was in your children's high school
my children brought it to my attention
if it was true there i'm sure it's true with just about probably to some degree every school there is they represent a pretty good
that's not giving a good example to students
i'm a putterer
it's very
i was just in the shower after finishing mowing the lawn and removing some old petunias out of the garden
this type of thing is working right in to start planting fall bulbs
many of the summer flowers are still pretty enough that you hate to pull them up
you need to pretty soon
that's the way this was
the petunias were really great
our mums are beautiful
i don't think we've had a frost up here
i was down in for a week
i don't know what happened last week i don't know if it's late
i can get a lot of stuff down out here
i enjoy it
we moved in november and put all the landscaping in this year
we came from nine years in a condo
working in that condo you didn't have to do anything unless you really wanted to
now you have the chance to really create and spread out
i can't
this is my third house i think i've owned
it's interesting
it sort of gets away from me if you're not with it
i enjoy most of it
about this time of year it starts getting a little old
i start looking forward to having other things to do with my
it is for me
i've been doing a lot of fertilizing
we had a drought took a lot of watering and a lot of fertilizing
now it's really growing
i'm trying to establish a good root growth for the winter
ours seems to have slowed down here
we're not having to mow every week religiously we're still fighting bugs and ready to change some of the summer flowers out i still have caladiums that are pretty which is a surprise this late in the year
today it's eighty-five degrees it's really strange
yeah yeah
that'll change real quick
he always
he calls us
my gosh
texas has gotten to where it's a real problem as far as plants because our summers are so terribly hot we have ice storms every year
there just aren't that many plants and shrubs that can take both of those extremes
i was conditioned to it they have to be hardened to it
that's strange with me
you think dallas almost semitropical you wouldn't have that kind of problem
for the most part we don't
we have usually just a pocket of really bad hot and really bad cold
the summers have gotten where they're a lot hotter the ice storms really are stressful on all the plants that we have around
do they
we've noticed that crepe myrtles don't do as well as they used to and pittosporum
that used to be the kind of things we could plant all the time you really take a chance with them freezing
i love the landscaping
i really enjoy getting around and seeing the different areas with different gardens
texas is
dallas is very nice
my wife and i
when we get to other parts of the country where the trees are so beautiful we really miss it
that we have ohio's a very pretty state
in seventy-six we moved to chicago
i remember the first time i took my wife there on a house hunt
we were coming in
before the plane landed she looked out the window
she said there's no trees down there
when we got out to the area where we decided we were going to live and buy a house there were no trees because the farmers had cleared all the land now all of a sudden it was being developed
the first thing i did was planted all kinds of trees
discussion on child care
they're all grown up
you know all about it then
i have grandchildren but haven't really been into selecting child care for
it's been quite a few years since i've had to think about that
do they stay at
that's nice
my daughter that has three stays home with her children
one of my daughters has one
an aunt keeps the baby
that's nice
i would not really know how to go about selecting one nowadays
i would imagine it's very hard
i think so
i have worked at some other ones that were not very good in my opinion
this one that i'm in now is very good
one of the key things is how many adults are there in ratio to the children
in pennsylvania for babies that's what i work with there has to be a one to four ratio at the most
we keep it down to like two to one
that's good
i've always thought it would be really tough
i know
you'd have to be able to get them all out
what we do is we have these cribs in the back room where they sleep that are low to the ground
they're reenforced real strong
they'll sit four babies
they roll real well and maneuver
that's a
i was thinking my gosh if they had very many babies they couldn't possibly get them all out
you could put them in one of these cribs and then roll the crib out i guess
that's neat
do most of your day-care workers really care about the children
is it just a job for them
most everyone has a college degree in early childhood education
really there's only like eight children per room
there's like two or mostly three care givers in each room
that enables them to spend more time with the children
it's nice to be able to play with them and really get to know them
how old are the children go with this center where you work
in my room they go from eight weeks to nine months
throughout the center it goes up to age twelve
i have the real young ones
those are the probably the best group to have
they're wonderful
they're fun
they're not quite big enough to be getting into everything yet
and you have to be real careful everything is baby proof
all the doors have latches and stuff so they can't get into anything
they try
i live in a college town in penn state university i
there is
in general though i've been really disappointed with a lot of other centers i've worked at and all
it's not my choice for when i have children
some people don't have a choice
i hear a lot of the girls i work with constantly
i wish i could find someplace i really felt good about
it's really bad
they called her one afternoon and said we thought we'd better call and tell you before you got over here
we just now found her
my god
immediately she says i can't have any confidence in them anymore
one of the teachers happened to walk by and see her pounding on the window trying to get out of the bus
my god
this was four hours later
None
she has switched to a different center now
just to let you know i have two children of my own
i've got two boys one four year old one two years old
i'm just starting out
i guess in one of the things that i like to do with my boys when i get home is i like to try and spend a lot of time with them
they're not very old
they couldn't do a whole lot yet
they like to spend time with me
we just just do various things nothing really
the weather's trying to turn now
are you down here in texas
i'm in dallas
you know what i meant with rain
what
one of the trends i've noticed is that it's always too easy to just plop your kids down in front of the t v and let them watch movies
one of the things we try to do is we try to avoid doing that as much as possible
although it really is very easy to do that type of thing just plop them down in front of the t v and let them be entertained that way
seeing as you've got some older children i'm wondering how did you handle that
in fact i think things were quite a bit different
when my big kids were little all the mothers were home
the kids got up in the morning and ate breakfast and poked around
when they felt like it they went out to play when they were little like that
other than that there was not educational t v
you got some cartoons
that was it
they were never that interested in it anyway
they'd take their trucks out in the backyard
we did a lot of stuff like that
course when they got bigger they were both quite into sports
whatever they would do we'd go along with
they're very different
y-
kind of the same thing our
is going to
last night was a band concert she plays on her school volleyball team and stuff like that
we still like to pack up just go someplace for the day or just stuff like that
that's nice
one of our older kids now is going to graduate school down at college station that's
we go down there fairly often for a weekend for family get-togethers and stuff like that
i know i'd like to get into do more camping and outings and things
i think we probably will soon as the boys get a little bit older
for right now they don't
they like just being outside
i think our kids just always dearly loved that play bounce the ball or just
course when our big ones were little we lived up north
this time of the year the fun thing was to go out and swoosh around in the leaves
come winter time we'd stick them on sleds
we had a pond across the street
from little on
it's so different down here where you go take lessons to learn to ice skate or something
when our kids were little you got them a pair of skates
i'm in an urban area
we're finding that crime is going up very quickly and has become a major problem even a more major problem
in dallas some of the major problems
drugs seems to be related to quite a bit of the crime we have now
there is a lot of theft a lot of assault dealing with people trying to get money for drugs
i think that's a national problem though
it's pretty bad here too
now we're pretty close to the golden triangle aren't you
i'm sure you have a lot of students there and a lot of researchers
you may have perhaps a little better economic climate
in all your cities now it seems like there is a crowd that's really effected by this bill
really it's
i've seen in more in durham than i have in raleigh or chapel hill
chapel hill is kind of a ritzy city or whatever
it's kind of
i'm sure there is problems with it
it has a pretty low crime rate compared to durham has probably got the worst
they've had forty-eight murders since the beginning of the year
over half of it has been drug related
here i'm not sure how many dallas has had
i don't know
a number every week
dallas is having quite a few
seems like most of ours are occurring in late at night or like i say drug related
i guess the other thing was that are causing a lot of the crime now is the decrease in values
seems like a lot of people don't hold human life quite as high as perhaps they used to
the economy is so bad
many people have been laid off and stuff
we had a lot of bank robberies and lot of break ins and stuff
i live in a town house which is
this lady was going to work
nobody thought any different
boy that really takes someone who is bold to do that
it's pretty bad
now do you find that security is very good in a town home
i would say so for the majority in my little section of the neighborhood because there is always somebody at home we all know one another
on our one little section of the street we all know one another and know that we're not moving
i'm probably one of the youngest people that live over here
most people are retired
they're in their forties or whatever
i'm in my twenties
i'm out more than they are
they're at home at night
i really don't worry about anything
i think you hit on one point there is you know each other
i'm in a neighborhood where we try to keep up with everything
i am about three blocks off a major road and a couple of blocks off another road that kind of runs
i guess you would say the neighborhood road it runs between the high school and the commercial districts
i'm over the northeast part of dallas
it's in a nice neighborhood
the houses here before the recession were running two hundred thousand or so
course everything's down ten to twenty percent now
that's the same thing here
we have
one thing that effects us is we have apartments that are probably about a half mile away
now the economy is bad
they've dropped the
course that's kind of like a cancer in an apartment complex
before you know it you have drugs and a lot of other things
i'm sure that aggravates it also
unemployment now in dallas or in texas is up around six point
lots right
what do you do now
we have saved our newspapers for years and years because the boy scouts our boys have been involved in have had a huge recycling bin
since the price of paper has gone down
it's about a fifth of what it used to be the boy scout troop quit doing it when the city took it over
now we just put ours out for the city of plano
i'm so glad when they brought out those recycling bins
although just about a week ago some of my volunteer mothers that work in the library for me said they hadn't gotten theirs
that's why i asked you
i guess
it does go in cycles
not everyone got theirs right away
i was so relieved because i've been making a real concerted effort recycling the aluminum and the newspapers and even got into plastic because wal-mart collected it
my garage was just getting overwhelmed
of course i didn't go weekly
it became quite a big thing
i do news mostly newspapers and plastic two liter diet coke bottles
i don't use as many of those
i guess the ones that are hard to convince yourself to do are the ones that are really dirty that you have to wash out
i found out after washing out many a peanut butter jar that they're not a recycling number one or two
it was wasting a lot of time
i guess there are some places in the north in particular that have a real definite way of encouraging you to recycle
let's see they charge you for your garbage pick up by the weight
if you recycle things of course then you don't have all that weight in there
i do find that i don't have as much to throw away because all the bulky things are being tossed in with the recycling
i don't know what they could do more of exactly around here right now other than
one thing i thought about the other day were batteries
supposedly leak and contaminate the landfills
yet what am i going to do when i have a couple double a batteries to toss out
they don't take
there are places that take car batteries
i wonder if they would take
not that it would
kind of a pain to drive over somewhere special for two little tiny batteries
i think the city one could possibly look into that or something
if they've got these bins for all the other little items
i'm sure if people will have batteries quite often to toss out
when i was home those few days around thanksgiving and the truck came by we all ran out to watch it because we'd never
is that right
one thing i thought was interesting was that the driver had something on his belt that he scanned across the little bar code on our bin as soon as he took the stuff
he just pulled this thing kind of out of his pocket and just scanned it
i don't know what that was reading it for they must be trying to keep track of who is doing it or what i guess
for those who are really cooperating
that would encourage it
except i know it would just not be cost effective
they've already got all this money out on getting the trucks and hiring people to work them
the garbage
there is just one garbage man that comes on the truck instead of two
that's interesting
also slightly off the subject but our big green garbage thing got stolen
it did
None
they did not charge us
they said that between three and four hundred have been stolen
my goodness
they must be
our taxes do
really expensive
of course we were hoping we weren't going to have to pay for it what would somebody do with them
since i got somebody from arlington virginia one day
i never thought about that
there is an arlington
i had a call the other day from birmingham michigan
i was thinking
it's funny how many names have been used all over the country
tell me what kind of books have you read
to tell you the truth i've been going to college for the last four years
i really tend to like biographies a lot not necessarily always heavy ones sometimes biogr-
it's really and truly a true thing
i read one about bob hope that i liked
if it's not a heavy biography i enjoy it
when i was younger i read about every king and queen that lived
i was trying to think
i read a novel that used the names of like princess di and prince phillip coming over here to be entertained and all
there was a murder
it sounds like fun
it was a lot of fun because they used these real names
wonder if it was by one of those famous writers
i thought this will be great
it was
i've heard that her books are really interesting
they always sell well
when you use real people like that i think royalty especially
i know some of the british people laugh at us because we're so enthralled with their
that's like them being enthralled with our football and so forth
it's totally different concept to us
i haven't had a chance to read a lot lately either
i have read mostly novels
i went to visit my daughter in florida i took a novel with me and read it at thanksgiving time
i always like those
it was one of those generation novels starts out when they're small and continues through generations i like that
she is wonderful
once you st-
i just live to read
i'll skip everything just to get back to the book
i stayed up one night i think until two in the morning finishing one of hers because i could not put it down
how often does she come out with them
it seems like she doesn't write as often as like danielle steele and those silly things
she can turn them out overnight i swear
they're the same silly things
if you've read one i mean it's practically the same thing over and over
think how rich she is
wouldn't i
wouldn't i like to have her money they go from hardback to paperback
she has millions of them
mini series and so forth
it seems to me like susan howatch does not write as often
hers are so involved
they're such a higher intellectual level because she quotes a lot
she couldn't possibly turn them out like some of these popular writers
her books are just incredible
i've often wondered why haven't you
i
yes no
there's just
maybe they're just too involved for the average person to go and sit through them
they're so big they're such
maybe that turns people off
look at gone with the wind
i know
have you gotten into scarlett yet
in the beginning when it was on route coming out i heard mixed publicity kind of good and bad
when it came out all i heard was just how bad it was that i didn't even want to get it
it wouldn't surprise me
tell me your favorite team
i don't follow baseball that closely
since i live here so close to arlington that's the team that i've been kind of following
we'll have to talk about the future with the rangers
i think that with so much controversy over ruben sierra not signing and asking us for so much money it's i think
do you know anything about ruben sierra's
i heard tonight on the news that he is willing to come down
he was willing to come down a little bit
if the rangers will go up a little bit
the rangers go up a little bit
a little bit from thirty million dollars or thirty-five mil-
i think this is absolutely ridiculous
i really think that they ought to
i think they should pay him what his salary is going to be and let him
he's got one more year before he turns into a free agent
who knows
if he doesn't then his market value will go down
they can pick him up for a lot less than they would if they paid him the six million dollars a year this year
buechele was back just to visit
what he
i'm sure it was
he just signed on
i think it was like a five year deal with pittsburgh
he's real happy there
as far as the rangers are concerned i think they definitely need some pitching
i
what do you think of howse who is the coach for the pitchers
i was just looking at the news tonight
they showed a black guy that was helping out
i think that's a great addition
he seemed to know what he was doing
None
you don't like howse
i'm not going to stand up on my
i'm not fond of grieves
tom grieve
i'm not sure that they're ready to get rid of tom grieve yet
howse might be a different situation
i think you're probably right that they need some changes in pitching coach maybe
i'm just gullible enough that i think bobby valentine is doing all right
i'm sure
you do
i would like so much for these rangers to get their act together give
it's too bad that it has to be a forty-two year old guy to lead the rangers
they need to have some young guys that can take the lead
None
i think with their new stadium they should go and let
if you're from iowa you must be very artsy crafty
before then i was from utah
i didn't know anyone ever moved from california to iowa
i grew up in california
i went to school in utah
i got married there
we stayed there for a while
now we're in iowa
i like the midwest
i married a texan
they have a way of dragging you back home
do you have any hobbies that you do things with your hands
i crochet
i do water color
i sew
i do fabric painting
you do a lot then
i've done some cross stitching
actually i'm pretty untalented
i used to do a lot of knitting and crocheting
i don't know
i have all these friends that wherever you go they sit down and the next thing they pull out of their
bags their most recent needle craft in december everyone was doing stockings these gorgeous detailed minute tiny stitch stockings
those take a lot of time
i only can do things that are pretty fast because we just got our baby last year
i just don't have the patience to just do something
i crocheted an afghan for our bed
i did a quilt
i've done a quilt for our baby
i've done a quilt for our bed
None
how did you make a quilt
our baby's quilt it was like the design
you actually hand quilted it yourself
did you need a loom
were you a-
i put it on the quilting frame
are you familiar with that
again my mother back in indiana
she would quilt whole quilts by herself
my god
i have one of them
to have the quilting frame and then to actually do that it's a tremendous amount of work
i haven't done tons of them
i used to do more before we got our baby
you think children
you can use crafts to make wonderful things for children
i think afghans and the crocheted little sweaters are wonderful
they'll wear them
i usually sew around the flower whatever first
i paint around it
you can't see the stitching as much
does that make sense to you
it's funny that you said
they were matching
they were lovely
when i washed them although i took the precaution of turning them inside out
truly everything fell off or most of it
i went and bought just some cloth glue and glued it all back
i bought the paint and redid most of the edges it was salvageable
i'm familiar with that
i think you're very clever to sew around the edges
someone told me that they had done it both ways
after hearing that i always sewed it on even with a loose zigzag even helps
how do you just figure
it depends upon our weather here
it was like summer day
i dressed in a light weight skirt
it's a ultra suede skirt and a blouse with a sweater cardigan over it
i had to dress up anyway
i wore heels
when it rains a lot which is has been doing here a lot lately very often wear pants and boots
how do you dress
when i was a teacher in utah i would generally wear dresses and heels and things like that
even when it rained and snowed i just braved it
i wore heels anyway
i can see
i've been a teacher so has my daughter
i know that we very often wore heels despite the fact that
you're going to look nice for the kids
it always makes you feel like you're a bigger person than the kids right
yeah
i need all the height i can get
we too
i would change into heels
of course we wear an unlined boots
we wear them
as i said they have a regular heel on them high heel
we wear them a lot with shirts and things
it's kind of a
they're just a real pretty boot
they keep your feet nice and toasty from the rain
as i have a private high school that i run here when i'm interviewing a parent of course i feel like i need to wear heels and look like i'm a business
because the children will tease about where's your motorcycle
if you wear boots too often
None
i did
my goodness
then you had to
the third year we got heating
it was nice
of course here we wear a light weight jacket a lot
that's nice
that's very seldom
it depends upon our winter
we have a few days you might wear a winter coat
most of the time you can wear a sweater
we just don't wear coats much
we moved to iowa
i'm working at a day care right now
the way i dress is really different because i'm working in the nursery room with kids from six months to like twenty months
you don't wear heels anymore i'll bet
i wear tennis shoes
and jeans and things that are sort of
when you were teaching did you ever have a blue jean day or anything like that
i never wore jeans because i thought that was too casual
i know that some of the schools they have country western day or something like that one or tacky day
i always thought it got out of hand when the teachers looked real
i didn't think teachers should
do you like iowa
i've seen a lot of things i'm not used to yet
we lived in utah before
i grew up in california
that's quite a change from california to utah
what is your favorite kind of music
i have to say my favorite type of music would probably be classical music
same here
what
i guess i like a wide range everything from baroque through at least some modern music
my wife and i these days are especially into opera
do you go to the operas that they sing english or go to the ones that they sing other languages
we generally
i haven't gotten into that too much because if i don't know the story line and i don't speak the language then i have difficult time comprehending what's going on
one thing that's helped us a lot is that you can buy a lot of these operas now on video tape
we have quite a collection of those
you watch them at home
they have subtitles
you figure out what's going on after a while
you can enjoy it in the theater
the dallas opera now has super titles on all their performances i think
they give an english translation on a screen up above the stage
i didn't know that
i'd say
vivaldi is probably my favorite composer
i really like vivaldi
he's definitely one of the top of that era
i like full body music with brass and winds woodwinds instruments
course i like also string instruments
i have two string instruments in my house instrument players
the other one plays the viola
i get to go to at least four or five concerts a year
how old are they
they're doing this in school or what
you've got half a string quartet there
i try to enjoy all of it
since you seem to like italian music have you ever gotten into gabrielli or anybody there in that era the period right before actually before vivaldi i guess
a little bit
a lot of the music i don't know about as far as the titles
i have to listen to it and figure out
i do belong to a musical heritage society
i think i know what it is
isn't that a
they know have them on compact disc or cassettes or l p
they do a lot of original recordings themselves
i think
they also go to the different composers or the different i guess
they go to conductors
they actually have them perform the music
they record it
they're actually commissioned performances
they will find out when they're performing
they will record the music at that time
it is high quality grade music
of course now they also have a jazz section
they also have a more contemporary and american composer section
i had heard good things about the music heritage society
if i get involved in one of those things i end up spending all my money on music
you can control it
i almost bankrupted myself out of college as a freshman when i got into the columbia record club many years ago
i got a lot of bills
we have to watch that
that's good
do you play any instrument yourself
i play guitar and early years played saxophone
i guess it's pretty deep feelings
i just went back and rented the movie what is it good morning viet nam
got some insight there to kind of help me put together the feelings
i really appreciated the whole english class where the fellow just wouldn't do it
the guy's gouging your eyes out
what for him to finish me off
it was good to remember that kind of asian philosophy that
were you ever in viet nam
i was kind of an in-between finally drew a high draft number
i was much too young
both my brothers were draft age
neither of them wound up going over which i think they were very happy for
personally i just went in limbo
i had a passport and was ready to go out of the country or join special forces either one
i just didn't know
do you feel that it was worth what we did over there
mark what was that again
do you think the investment in lives and money was worth it
not really
i totally agree with that
what effects do you think it's had on our country
downside
the says we should go into the grief that's there
presidents have always avoided that as a country
it's pretty serious really
i think that's pretty typical of the entire involvement over that nothing was really addressed
it was never
we announced that we were going to war
it was such a gradual and subtle increasement of force that
gulf of tonkin resolution
was it a dolphin or a torpedo
i vaguely remember we had a spy ship torpedoed or something
only it was foggy
finally president johnson said they're weren't really sure whether it was a dolphin or a torpedo
do you think that for example in this past war in the persian gulf war you see it seemed to me that bush was going to extraordinary lengths to prepare the country for war
hey mark i've got to go
i wasn't really keeping count
i guess
mike what are your opinions on trial by jury
i work for an insurance company
i see a lot of verdicts that are
i know in england the judges set all of the awards
juries will decide the guilt or innocence
then they leave the awards up to more learned people
i think maybe that avoids some of these totally ridiculous millions and millions of dollars
that seems to make sense
leave it up to the more experienced person who knows how it fits into the kind of the rate for different
then really doesn't wind up penalizing the person that they went after
they're not going to sit there and lose money
they ha-
it all comes filtering down to us all individually
granted some people need to be compensated if they have really been wronged
how do you feel about setting for example some incident where someone loses a limb
some of the health insurance is written that way that if you buy an accident and death or dismemberment policy it s- pre specified in the policy so much
i don't know that you can necessarily put
i think maybe you look at the age of the person and their station in life and how much longer they have of work years that they would have to put up with that
maybe you don't award an eighty-five year old guy the same thing that you would award a twenty-one year old
i think it has to be some kind of common sense applied there
there may be where the judiciary is a little more learned about that type of thing because they can be schooled in that kind of thing
to get into the economics of things
if they wheel somebody into a courtroom and the jury's heart goes out to that person and they do one of these mega awards
it really ultimately is not penalizing the person that they're trying for get away
out of thei- r-
i think those should have to be paid by the corporation itself that did the damage
as opposed to the insurance paying the bills
for honest mistakes where they've done something and something happens
that's what they buy insurance for
do they get insured from other insurance companies
how does that work
i was just talking about any company
somebody is on the premises
one of the employees actually is driving by with a forklift
he pushes the wrong button
he drops a load of lumber on somebody
it injures
in some instances you're going to put companies out of business by taking that stance if they have to take it out of their own retained earnings
i'm not talking about any loss
they are awarding a second amount as punishment to the company which is usually a lot less
it's an amount their designed to sting them a little
for th-
unfortunately the
again it never really penalizes
if they know some practice is wrong
i'm talking more about the thing that they know
they continue to do it even after they become aware of that
the subject is child care and how to determine child care
that's an interesting one for me to talk about since i have no children
i did run a child care facility for a while
have some
you should have some opinions on that then
it's an interesting experience to be a surrogate parent for a lot of people there
it's also very interesting in terms of how people choose the child care facilities
i guess if i were going to choose my first consideration would be safety
i guess my third consideration would be
in texas we have to meet certain state standards in order to operate at an institutional level and at a small home level
then after that there's a lot more
i think it's important as the safety and health and that kind of stuff is qualification of people who work there and in hiring people who would work at the child care facility was very difficult to find qualified people in terms of not just
because somebody has a child or likes children doesn't really mean that they're qualified to give the child the kind of supervision and training that
as a matter of fact i believe that the safety and health issues depend in a very direct way on the people who are working with the children
that was the most difficult thing of all to find the right people the qualified people
it's the most difficult of all for a parent judge because a person can be very nice and warm and loving
if he's a space cadet and doesn't watch the children and be aware of what the safety hazards are
the other thing that's difficult in a day care center is to find the right program of enrichment for the child because you don't want to just warehouse the child
i didn't want to run an institution where that was the case where all we were doing were warehousing because the first four five years or so important
you have to have the right kind of enrichment
that includes an atmosphere in which the child is safe and he's watched and his physical needs are cared for
also his developmental needs are cared for too
maybe the right thing to do is to
in other words they probably may end up not working at all in the twenties
that's an interesting thought because
they have to work from age thirty or forty to age seventy or eighty or ninety
that would help on the other end too in terms of not warehousing people and letting people be productive for as long as they can be
the world is changing from industrial base to information base
what that means is you don't have to be physically powerful to work
i believe that mental acuity is easy to maintain if you just simply continue to exercise your mind
if they didn't have to do a lot of physical labor they could maintain
i don't think they should abolish it
i think if they put it into force more often they wouldn't have as many problems as they've got
not for petty theft
for major things like premeditated murder mass murders that type of thing
should it be used
to prevent further crime
by some technicality
they go down the line ten years
on some little technicality they get out and on the streets again doing the same they did before
that's about the only thing
like for theft and stuff like that or manslaughter
there's this old jewish saying about an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
i guess
if it was someone in my family i'd probably feel that way
i've never had anybody in my immediate family murdered
i really wouldn't know
i feel if i did i probably would feel that way
one of the things i was thinking about
if you have someone that destroys that value then you want to take steps to minimize the loss
if you terminate him that's a loss of value
that's true
if you weight everyone equally then you have to say the likelihood of not terminating him
in other words you'd have to murder more than one other person in order to justify taking his life
one way of doing it is by income
which is often times the case then he's obviously not worth very much
the likelihood that maybe expected murders by him is integrated over the income of the people that he murders is maybe a loss of
if he only integrated income over the expected remainder of his life of is
of course one of the things that happens if you use that algorithm is you find that it's easier to terminate older people than younger people since the integration of their income over the rest of their lives is going to be less
which means
i suppose you could say that has something to do with potential
that's the key right there potential
are they rehabilitative or not
that's all fine and well and good philosophical
if you're involved yourself personally i know i have a friend whose son was murdered on the night before his sixteenth birthday
let me tell you i knew them personally not intimately but quite well
the father
he is on trial for capital murder
it hasn't been a long time ago
he was convicted
of course now you go through two or three hundred years of appeals process
that appeals process it's what really just drags out and out and out
my brother-in-law here in texas my sister's husband his sister was murdered down here by a guy in houston
he
i think public service is a worthy thing
as a matter of fact there are a lot of programs such as peace corps that promote that
probably the most popular one but one that is not typically recognized as such is the boy scouts
i know that because my son is a scout now and is thinking about his eagle
in order to get eagle you have to have merit badges in citizenship in the community citizenship in the nation citizenship in the world
you have to do a public service project
in which leadership is the key element
of course the peace corps the boy scouts is a voluntary activity
i think that might be referring to something kind of alternative to the draft
either you have military service or some sort of alternative nonmilitary service for a few years
of course military service falls under the category of a public service
one of the things that would fulfill at least the nominal qualifications set forth in the charge is military service or draft
i agree with you that probably is not what was comprehended
there are other things such as civil service which many people are lifelong employees of i suspect that was not what they had in mind either
for years there has been an idea batted around of having some sort of alternative public service for young people to go into after high school
kind of in lieu of the draft for people who are conscientious objectors or don't otherwise want to be in the military
you can go into the military
you can do this other thing for one or two years to kind of serve the community and learn about things
it's interesting because i'm not a particular fan of the military
i have seen a lot of young guys go in that don't have really a clue as to what they want to do with their lives and aren't terribly disciplined even just personal discipline about what they want to do
they come out
now they have at least some marginally marketable skills and more discipline
in some cases they have a greater self-esteem because they can see that if i do something or submit my own will to the will of the sargent or whatever at least for a short period of time i can accomplish a lot
it's a good lesson for a lot of young men to learn that they don't need to be cowboys
they don't need to be out there constantly flaunting their ego to get things accomplished
for some young men that's good
for me it would have been lousy idea because i did have the personal discipline
i went to college for four years and got out
for some people that's good
i don't particular like the fact that it's the military
the whole point of the military is to kill people essentially as an instrument of u s policy
that's another debate
it's
it depends on whether we figure that we have a defense oriented military or an aggression oriented military
it seems pretty aggressive oriented
you look at the last military action which was in the persian gulf and wasn't anywhere near the united states
it was definitely a projection of u s power on the other side of the globe
at any rate this is getting off the topic
my point was that for people who don't want to do the military service it would be neat if there were an alternative that could instill the same sort of personal discipline and sense of purpose and sense of community that the boy scouts
i have really resisted the impulse to
up until i guess maybe about a year and a half ago
i got one for my son a macintosh l c
it's a real easy to use color computer
i got a very nice printer that goes along with it
he uses it for his school work
i'm currently in school
i've had an i b m clone i guess for a couple of years now which i've been trying continually upgrading i guess
i've found that i pretty much become addicted to it
i can't really
i've found that most of homework assignments really require some sort of computer simulation or analysis
it's very essential for me
lot of times so difficult to get on them at school
it's much more convenient to have one at home
that explains all the computer assignments
do you use your p c for things other than explicit computer work
None
i can check up on the weather around the country or whatever which is a hobby
it provides other means other than just strict computations and so on
do you have a computer for yourself at home
i really sort of have the feeling that word processing is a big market for home computing
at work
i in the past have done a great deal of system development just through software development programming
now i find myself using the computer
even the computer at work is primarily a word processing system and a communication system
emil probably pulls down a third of all my time
i i have modem night computer
i can log into the network at georgia tech and access my account through there which can be useful
yeah
that and word processing is
obviously i do almost all of my report
it's i don't know really become my mainstay i guess
i don't think i've ever used a typewriter in my life to do a report because my family when i was growing up we got a basic computer t r s eighty when they first came out
i even used that to do my first reports when i was in junior high
i'm a old-timer
i did my master's thesis on a typewriter
i rented an i b m selectric
it was a pretty big deal
i did my master's thesis last year
i did that on a computer
it seems like
it must have been just so much work
it was just a completely different world then
you used your son's macintosh then
do you like that kind of computer
i see the packages on it that are available
it's nice
when i come home from work i like to stay far away from computers and electronic things
i let my son do it
of course there's an intellectual evolution taking place where
it's really true
the kids they just take to it like candy
if the interface is there so that it's fun to use the challenge
regarding taxes i
taxes are really a necessary evil in a civilized society
really people get upset at taxes because it's more efficient to do things yourself
as a result it's a trade-off for the common good for the benefit of others
how much of your resource should you dedicate to making things work for others
have you ever thought just how much of that money should go to other people that really don't deserve it
i know it's a lot
they're giving it to other people that don't really need it either
yet they accept it
the thing of it is
if i wanted to just permanently become a book reader i guess i could just go on public assistance look for people to take care of me
probably a good woman
you don't have to be on the tax roll
taxes are very difficult kind of thing
everybody really hates it
i always over pay my deductions
i wind up
getting money back from my withholding
that's always a smile
of course i've paid it in
i should calculate it better
i work for the f b i
i'm a federal employee
guess i don't sound like it
i think that people that work for the government are just as against taxes as everybody else
i've got all four feet in the trough being a federal employee
i can understand that who gets benefits
every time there is a bond issue i vote no on every one of them
this is not tax revolt country
there's too many
most of us have all four feet in the trough plus our snout right up to our ears
it's not exactly that kind of a place that you want to get into a tax revolt situation
the local taxes here i
in this particular area i think i pay about thirty-five hundred for taxes on my four bedroom house
which is a lot of money
as people get older and older they think about retirement and that sort of thing they're building old peoples homes at tax expense
i think the old people ought to just bail out of here and go where it's cheaper
i could go down to bulverde and probably rent a house for that
instead it's the taxes here
course i don't know whether i want to go to bulverde or not or seguin or someplace like that
there's certainly lots of inexpensive places where the services are poorer
i think really the only place you can really reduce the amount of taxes you pay is to move to an area where the services are poorer
if you're not going to use them then you want to be in environment
that's a strategy i think that the people have to take is how to be able to lessen their cost of living
i'm five or six years before i'm eligible to retire
i'm saying i really can't stay here as a retiree
i'm going to have go out in east fork someplace
and do my thing
my parents are in the same situation
their home is paid for
still their taxes are so high that my father doesn't feel like he can
they have no children in school or anything now
they redecorated in nineteen seventy-five
they're not doing it again
it's certainly
i don't work
generally i get most of my news in the weekly magazines like time newsweek and u s news and world report with occasional smatterings of the wall street journal and of course the local paper
my only complaint is i really don't enough time to look at the articles every day and go through a paper exhaust the details
that's why i concentrate on weekly magazines
i don't think i have the time to really become a student in every article
i like the weekly magazines because it gives me the high points of what's going on
many times
here i am cheek by jowl with our nation's capital
it's almost a bedroom community for the capital
when the capital gang always talk about the people inside the beltway i'm saying to myself hey guys i'm inside the beltway
it turns out that the c n n i think is great
and for things like hurricanes and fast breaking events
generally they're more sound bitish kind of thing
i don't really feel as though i've a gotten sufficient dose of news that way
which i like
i think it's fairly objective
i always like the letters that they read which tend to accuse them of being too liberal and too conservative
while there's an inherent filtering process going on just by the letters they choose to read i always figure it's a good thing when any given group is being accused by each side of favoring the other side
that's potential indication of balance
generally i really do believe they are pretty balanced
i also read time magazine
we get one of the daily newspapers around here where we go through various sections of the articles and the front section
the mercury and the chronicle are the only things that are really can stand up there
you st-
redwood city
we get the mercury which i generally think is actually a pretty good newspaper
the newspaper i really been impressed with it when i've read it at times at the los angeles times
which i've found to be
i like a lot of the articles there
the other thing that you referred to that always sounds really interesting to me is called c span
i enjoy
we have both c spans here
really on the public t v macneil lehrer is an hour's program that i always
if i watch any news program it will be macneil lehrer
and occasionally c span
i saw the tapes that were run of marion berry's drug bust
the whole thing was run on that
also they have the parliament's question and answer period
i think that's always fascinating
i wish we had something
when it first tuned in on that i
everybody was making noise in the background
it's usually the prime minister
here's this dude in a wig i said to myself it's another monty python that i didn't know about
up jumps margaret thatcher off her green bench
i said it's parliament
i thought to myself i can't wait
i'm going over to britain in mid-may
i'm going to approach my
this is how i discovered the prime minister's question and answer period
i have seen that
aside from the level of wit which is much higher than generally in american politics which i really enjoy i really like the fact that they have a chance to ask hard real questions i think
it's unlike the fairly controlled press conferences that presidents of the united states have here where they always seem
it has been for a long time
i feel almost ashamed to say that to anybody now because i have never met anybody who likes it
wouldn't you know
i particularly enjoy the english comedies
i like
that's the reason why i like both of those programs is because they're kind of based on books
the plots are more challenging than the sitcoms of regular t v
unfortunately for us at least here in the united states the only access we have to that of course is public television
i'm not a great television watcher in any respect
the watching
what i do watch is usually news and whatever is on public television
i also am very fond of great performances
that was a scream
as a matter of fact turner broadcasting
has been broadcasting all of the james bond movies
i have concentrated on watching james bond movies
they're showing live and let die at this moment
it is the first appearance of roger moore as double oh seven
he can never cut it
in some of the later movies he looks very effeminate
whereas sean connery has maintained the ruddy look
he can even be in movies that are not sexually oriented
he still comes off great
he was voted the sexiest actor in movies
otherwise we
with p b s and so forth
i particularly enjoy i don't know whether you've had a chance to watch it on p b s but the series yes minister
what's that about
that was about the interior minister
the interior minister in england
i've seen it several times
i have to go to bed
i have to get up and work the next morning
it should
i'm not much of a television watcher
i read as i said
quite a bit
what do you do
i work for a tire service
i see
the last two people who have called both worked for t i
i just wondered
i needed the money
we're not even supposed to be talking about this though are we
i work
that's my field of work also
i know the people at t i who are doing this
i heard about it
i called them and asked if i could participate
send in the forms et cetera and so forth
i've heard that it's coming out with the idea that the bible's not true
i think what they are trying to say is that there is a great deal of historical truth
the interpretation that actually got into the writing of the bible itself is probably
for example in greek there are seven different words for love
you can have
there's one word for love of your brother one word for love of your wife one word for love of your father and that sort of thing
as to those types of interpretations really made a difference in how one might interpret the bible now and what it's at
that's
there's too much historical fact involved just from the histories that were developed around that time that are available
it depends on how you look at it
you can look at it
you can interpret the t v show in the same way that you can interpret the bible
as far as that goes we at least agree on what we enjoy
i don't know if there is a time limit on this
have a good evening
my favorite probably all time t v show is star trek
i would it like that
i like the adventure of it
and the idea that we would survive long enough to get to that point and be able to do these fantastic things in space
i the
which it's an all new cast but kind of the same idea going out to new places and doing new things and finding out about different people
i've always liked that show probably the very best
i think i've actually seen a number of star treks one way or another over the years although i never watched it regularly
i'm certainly acquainted with the characters
i've seen some of the star trek movies
i guess most of the shows i like are are kind of along the same line because they're all adventure
when i started thinking about this those are some of my favorite shows mcgyver because it's only one person there instead of a cast of people
he's always going out and inventing new things out of scrap and grabbing what he can and pieces of baling wire and a few tires and all of a sudden he's got a hang glider
i don't think i've even heard of that show
what is he
he's like a semigovernment type agent who works for the phoenix foundation supposedly
his big thing is that he can take little bits and pieces of string and baling wire and turn them into fantastic different things
do you like the news shows twenty twenty sixty minutes those kind of things
i used to watch sixty minutes as a matter of fact
i used to like the show very much
unfortunately i find getting rid of your t v set you do throw out some of the baby
i just decided i had to do that i think in part because it was easy for me to become addicted to it
i could just sit mindlessly in front of a t v set for hours
i just realized i was sort of like an alcoholic
i have my favorite shows
i usually make time in my day or my week to watch those
for the most part i have small kids and i try and keep it on just a minimum amount of time really when they're up
i guess that falls
one of my other favorite shows is sesame street because of the kids
when my kids were little i did have a t v set
i did watch a lot of sesame street and a lot of electric company as well
that would be a shame
i remember it when i was younger catching it on p b s
i don't think they show
they're not making new ones
sesame street is still really good
they repeat all the old ones
that's still a real good show too
sesame street comes on from nine to ten which is a good time
everybody is up and had breakfast and dressed and ready to go
the timing of it is good besides the amo- what's on
they like that
they come on from nine to ten and then from five to six
another thing that's
when it comes on right in the dinner hour i can feel i can let them sit in front of the t v and watch
they're watching something worthwhile while i can make dinner and do things i need to do without them under foot
with little kids the t v set really is a
they turned out okay
it didn't hurt them any
i think some
the idea i think that's one of the things i like about star trek
is the
the imagination of look what we can do in the future perhaps this will be possible
i think we've covered most of my favorite t v shows
i'm trying to think if i ever even had a favorite one at one time
let's see how about man from uncle
is that the one where he always got this tape recording that self-destructed
i've seen some of them on repeats
it kind of kept you guessing on what was going to happen next
i remember as a kid my parents watching the ed sullivan show
i guess it was a saturday night
i went to see the movie the doors a couple of days ago
they had this scene portraying the doors appearance on the ed sullivan show
it was very very funny
i think it was the funniest part of that movie
i don't know
i was
i guess i have to admit that i am
my folks
they probably didn't have a t v until i got to be grade school or so
the shows that i like now they wouldn't let me watch
that's interesting
i think it's interesting that parents think that their small children learn violence from tv
i guess that's a different topic
i think that's about covered it for me
i think i'll say good-bye
we'll talk another time perhaps
it was nice talking to you
tell me where you're calling from
my goodness
i hope they're trying to do it all over the country because they need to collect all kinds of different dialects
it was nice talking to you
the last movie that i saw
i don't go to that many
i'll just have to talk about the ones that i went to see
it was awakenings with robin williams and peter deniro
the show is about these catatonic type people that
this doctor discovers a drug that brings them back to the living more or less
it wears off
the way it wears off is he goes through all these spastic
it gets to where he can't control his movements at all
it was just so realistic
the way you have to just keep reminding yourself that he's an actor
what does
robin williams does he have a funny part in it
it was very se-
how does he do serious
he's talented
what was that show
that wasn't it
the world according to garp
i didn't see the movie
what have you seen
i saw it
it was telling a friend i said i only cried twice
each was about half an hour long
let's see
each time that i thought that the indians were going to get killed i cried
i cried the first time when the wagon man got killed when they attacked him
i think from there on all the way through the movie
let's see what else did it what other parts
the next day he looked out there and saw those buzzards
that horse has been such a pal to him
i thought it was awful
i hadn't even imagined it
i had a friend who had fixed some buffalo chili about a week before went to see the movie
of course they raise them now to eat
we were both feeling so guilty about enjoying this chili after seeing that
at least you know that it wasn't same situation that the buffalo died in
i thought the scenes when the buffalos running though were beautiful
that was great
there were so many of them
that was pretty
to think about how it just changed the whole landscape you could follow this beaten down path
it sounded like thunder and earthquakes and that sort of thing
have you seen any of the behind the scenes of that movie
they tried to keep it as very close to real
kevin costner did all of his own scenes
they had to teach a wolf how to howl
that's all they'd have to do
that's funny
i think we've made it
is that five minutes
i think we've done okay though
thank you for calling
thank you
i hope you enjoy some more good movies late-
most of mine's been pretty good although i guess i'm like a lot of other people now
i'm trying to pay off my credit cards
i've done pretty good at it
i do fairly good until i go in the store and i see something i want
not need want
most of mine that i use is strictly gasoline
i do that
like i said the rest of them i've been trying to pay off and get back on a cash basis except for gas
it's too easy to run into the gas station
it sure is especially when you work out of town and everything that way
i've talked to some who's really had some bad experience
i haven't yet not bad
i'm just shocked at the end of the month
i've been pretty lucky in that respect
like i say i've been trying to not charge except for emergencies
i haven't really had any bad problems with credit cards
there's
they have wonderful features
like in emergencies or whatever
they have bad drawbacks too
it's awfully easy
high interest
i did switch to one sponsored by the credit union though that seems to be a pretty low interest
compared to some of the other ones
you don't have an annual fee there
that helps
we used to have several
right now we're just more or less at american express
that way we can go ahead and pay it off when it comes in
that's one way to do it because that forces you to pay for it instead of saying i'll just pay on it this month
when you pay fifteen dollars a month it sure takes a long time
now without the benefits of being able to deduct interest off your income tax that's
this is the last year you can take anything
i've enjoyed talking to you
i've enjoyed talking to you
maybe we'll get to talk again
i can tell you pretty much my two favorite shows they kind of are in different spectrums i think
one of them is quantum leap the other one is night court
i think they're real different
quantum leap is kind of a comedy in its own way i guess
mostly it's kind of science fiction
it's adventure and things like that night court is just pure weird fun
it's nothing serious about it at all
i don't know why the two of them happen
that's the way it is
it's funny that those are my husband's two favorite shows too
i enjoy watching both of them
i used to didn't like night court i
the only reason i think i like it now is because i've seen it so much
i'm involved with the characters
i used to think dan fielding was just too vulgar and too crude for me
i told my husband that's the whole point
sometimes it just
they really have changed him though
if you've watched it this season he still is in his own way degrading and everything
he's involved in that charity
it's taking up so much of his time and so much of his thought that he really has
in fact there was one show that he even turned down a date with some beautiful woman just because the idea that his mind was on the ozone layer and global warming and all this other kind of stuff
he was too depressed to
that was part of i guess his character building or whatever
i think it probably adds a little bit of depth to his character
i haven't watched yeah
even though the person is involved in so many other people's lives you still see a real person in those situations
he's doing amazing things he's doing them within the bounds of what a normal person would do i think that's
what do you consider your favorite shows
i think my favorite show is hunter
i like the old series better when dede was in there
yeah the blond that they took out the one that got killed yeah
i think that's what they try to do
i think we wanted to see dede there or somebody like her
i read an article in t v guide about hunter and about his three girls whatever you want to call them they say that that there was a conflict between her and him that they never really could get her into any character that they could use
yeah
the second one the blond if you think about it they didn't really interact hardly at all they were never partners
he would do his
i think that's what i didn't like
even at the beginning dede and hunter would decide that one of them would go do this while the other one would go this
it seemed like it was almost two different organizations
hunter was the boss
this other girl was not
you're wondering when did this happen
i kind of agree with that
i like the new lady better
i'd just as soon that they didn't have the romance there
i'd just as soon have the police story without all the romance
i'm afraid that's what they really wanted to do
they went away from it now they're starting to go back to it
maybe that's what the public wants
i like the cut and dry solve the mystery
that's what i always enjoyed about it
there was that spark between dede and hunter for a while they started it
they'd pull it back
they'd start it and pull it back
that really made it a very interesting show to where you never really knew which one was going to show up whether it was going to where they're going to be real close or whether they're just going to be partners that i kind of thought was good
it's i guess
you see these two people together
you always wonder why they don't get together or whatever
i guess that's what they decide to do yeah
it's always been a formula for t v that the two main stars get married that the show ends up dying
a good example of this is probabl-
they had get smart for ten hours a day from seven o'clock at night until six or until five o'clock the next morning
the last day all they did was the last season to where the two of them got married that was the killer
go ahead
i was going to say i didn't ever watch moonlighting
i heard that's what killed it that interplay died when they got married
the show died
it seems like you can do so much more of the subtle hints and the subtle little plays on things before they get married
of course another one of their mistakes i think is they have a tendency to change characters or to change the characters' personalities especially after they get married
couple of examples would be like i said this one about get well smart the female character barbara feldon she had been at the beginning the intelligent one the one who always solved the things and figured out and kept max from getting real messed up
in short whenever they got married she got dingy
why would they do that
i'm guess it's falling back into our traditional stereotype which a lot of shows yeah
do you you watch who's the boss
that's on tuesday nights i think
i don't watch it regularly
i hardly ever watch it
as i've seen it they've done sort of the same thing to where they started to let them get together
they pulled them apart i think they're thinking about that exact thing about the idea that if the show lets them get together then you lose part of what the show's all about
i always thought that was kind of weird
it's funny how we romanticize people for instance where as the teenager you romanticize a rock star
when he gets married then you don't care any more or something like that
i think it's the same with your characters on t v
i don't particularly like either one of them their marriage was so highly publicized that there was no way that they could stay together at least that's the way i look at it
i don't know
i just the publicity in and of itself much less the
having twenty million people watch you do that
that's kind of interesting
i guess that's about all we need to do isn't it
this is a change
i think i've
you've had a little bit of variety
thanks so much
like i was saying burlington's crime it doesn't involve children
what you see on the t v in washington and new york
what i believe the people want
the subject is big city crime which is something that i don't have any first hand experiences about
i have concerns
i have a few ideas of how to combat it
i don't think ideally you need money to do everything
that's one thing
that's crime that you can't fight it if you need that money
when we lived in san antonio
it's always been a very large city and increasingly growing
there's a lot of retired military individuals that live there
there's a very large hispanic population there
the one thing that we noticed that over the years has gotten worse and worse is hispanic gang crime in the city that has been the worse thing that we've seen happening
does it spread out of the neighborhoods into the retired people's community
does it stay in the bad neighborhoods
the majority of the actual gang crimes like the drive by shootings and stuff stays in the neighborhoods
the crime spreads out into the more affluent divisions through robberies rape car crime
there's a very high percentage of car theft
san antonio's not far from the border to mexico
a lot of the cars go to shops
they take them apart
a lot of them go over the border especially like mercedes
a lot of those in the z cars the datsun cars end up over the border
that's a big concern if you live there
very much so
in fact for a while there they had downtown if you were to come to a stop light they had a rash of when people were stopped at stop signs that people would get in their car and hold a knife and hold them up
now ever since then when you drive into the city most people keep their doors locked while they're in the car until they get down there
once you've reached the river walk area which is the tourist area it's usually pretty safe during the day if you're just kind of cautious and don't go down the back streets or alleys or alone
at evening again they have the high tourist area the river walk area which is nice
you don't want to get off the beaten track
there's a lot of parking garages there because parking is very tight
you don't want to get caught in the parking garage alone
it sounds like san juan puerto rico
we were there just for a lay over it wasn't a lay over
we were staying at the other end of the island
we drove into san juan to catch our plane
this boy really wanted to go on the beach
they look at you crazy you don't go on the beach
it's a big tourist town
don't people go for a walk on the beach at night
they said no
it's very safe in the daytime at night they even have the policemen come around at dusk and sound their sirens pretty much telling people be wary and get off the beach
it's just so sad
it is just really so sad
in san antonio i don't know what the answer is
so many of the kids are drop outs
there's a lot of drugs that go on and that they just have hopeless lives
they lead themselves down hopeless tunnels
then again i don't know really what steps there are that they
what they say they try to do is to get the kids early and young
what we have here in burlington which it doesn't cost a lot of money but they have a kids council that they have all these after school activities for kids
they have also organized fun activities like gyms going to the beach and playing volleyball at the beach in the summer
they have gyms open
it seems that the younger you can get them and get them involved with programs after school you might keep them again you need that one on one like a big brother trying to tell him hey stay in school
it'll get better
so that your mom doesn't have a job she doesn't work
you don't have to live for a street life
it's so cheap they don't have a problem here
they can deal with that scale
when you have five thousand troubled youths plus when you're getting into the kids now it's twelve years old
they're selling drugs they've got a fifteen year old that's their boss that is carrying a gun
it's the morals of the people which i guess everybody's responsible for the society
if i had a child that did things so bad
it's not they don't care about anybody these people they're stealing from they're just the big bad rich guy we don't have it
we deserve it
we should take it
i don't know where you start with a lot of these kids
so many of them all they see is just the gangs unless you can take them out of the environment enough to where they don't have the peer pressure from the gangs as soon as they come home from school
i think a lot of it is the parents are totally irresponsible too
the parents might be thirty years old i'm thirty years old
i'm kind of irresponsible
i have the morals that keep me from
these people they bring their johns home
they bring their drugs home
the kids are just sitting there in the same room
it's just that they have absolutely no morals it's really sad
i don't know how you combat that
i don't know what the answer is to that problem
i like your idea of education
what do those kids do
i feel for them
because they can't remove themselves
they can't just leave and say okay it's not acceptable
i'm going off
if they did have a big brother big sister program those people trying to help the kids
the parents might have hostilities towards them
i'm not good enough to raise my child which basically is true it's
i'm glad i don't live in a big city not just because i wouldn't feel safe
i might see it on a sixty minutes special
in san antonio it was every day
san antonio is considered a nice clean city believe it or not
they have all kinds of nice write ups about it any big city has a bad section
there's a lot of them
there's hardly
those that aren't
there's a lot of crime there migrant hispanic farm workers people that are down and out
they all seem to congregate in celinas not so much here in monterrey
it's pretty quiet
people run in the park
you're just
even in the worst crime areas in burlington
i can walk the streets
if i did it every night i think there would be trouble in our house
you wouldn't get confronted or anything i don't think you would
they're not going to grab you steal your money and slit your throat which in a lot of big cities that's what your going to have to expect that to happen
i believe in the trial by jury
i think if it was up to the judge alone that there would be real possible for payoffs briberies
i also like the unanimous decision because you have to persuade everybody to be a hundred percent absolutely sure before you convict somebody
i really agree with the innocent until proven guilty theory
i think that's a good way to do it
i think basically
for anything involving that trial by jury certainly should be mandatory
there should be with our overworked judicial system
it seems to me like there ought to be a means of not having to take everything before a
maybe there ought to be some kind of
maybe instead of
during that week you're kind of an ad hoc group of i don't know twenty-five instead of twelve each case is presented to that group of twenty-five
those cases are lesser degrees of magnitude
he had his pockets full of stuff when he was caught that kind of stuff you can just turn to the judge and say your pleasure your honor
there's not a lot of discussion about that kind of thing
the way our court system works that guy is going to have to hang around in jail or out on bail or something like that for an extreme period of time
we're starting to stretch the true meaning of right to a speedy trial
that's a good idea
maybe this pre group of people could decide where they could go from there
do they need a big lengthy twelve person jury
do they need a six person jury or those kinds of things
the degree of the seriousness of it
is this open and shut like you were saying
do you need somebody to go off for three months
we
kind of off what we've been talking about here i believe that we've become almost a litigious society where everyone is very quick to sue or to threaten to sue and that kind of stuff
although we supporting a whole segment of society called lawyers maybe we don't need to do that
maybe instead of being so quick to sue you if you have a disagreement with someone instead of tying up court and time and that kind of stuff maybe you
if you want to your lawyer or your opponent
let's get rid of some of this harassment suing
that's a good idea
in the bible it says if you have something against somebody to go to them first
if that doesn't work then to go get somebody a little bit more wiser and older and take them with you and go to them
if that doesn't work to take it to the whole church
that's right off that same kind of principle
that's a good idea
if we could all deal with those kinds of beliefs we wouldn't have half the
that whole biblical concept like
it's based out of that
that could work
there's a real name for that like the judean law or something like that
what is that called
that may be right
too the
that's sort of the old testament version
i did a sunday school lesson one time on the difference between the old testament and the new testament where there's a vengeful lord in the old testament and there's a loving lord in the new testament
that's a whole different subject
i think we have exhausted my pitifully small knowledge on the legal system
it's been a pleasure talking with you
what part of the country are you from
in texas
that's quite all right
i'm from the dallas area
so am i
that's neat
are you really
i'll let you go
it was nice talking to you
for instance jobs that require use of heavy machinery and things like that where there's endangerment to their own life and other people's lives
i agree with that
people that are driving like truck driver's and things like that
i'm not opposed to any testing
because i know i certainly wouldn't want to be endangered by somebody in a company that accidentally dropped something on me or because he was on drugs while he was there
how do you feel about companies drug testing prior to hiring
i was tested within my company
i think it's kind of a push to weed out drugs in states
i don't know of any other countries that are doing this i feel like it's really just within the united states
it's okay
i think your record should stand for itself that if you've been tested at other companies you've always come up negative whatever then i don't see what the big deal is that they have to go to all the expense of testing you over and over and over
once you've established the fact that you're not a drug user and especially if your personality proves that you're not i think they could save money by not doing that every time
if you change jobs you wouldn't have to do it if you'd just been tested at your other work place
what about random testing though
do you feel like that's an invasion of certain people's rights if not everyone is tested
not if it's done fairly
that's probably my question is how do you know it's done fairly
if it's random then it's random that's not necessarily fair
they might tell you it's random
it's kind of like a lottery
i know that for instance in the n c double a they drug test
it's not random
i see
how do they pick their people
i think all college players have to do an initial drug test at a certain point prior to the season from that point on the n c double a does have something to do with it
it's almost discretionary on the coach's part of each individual institution to identify the ones that have the problem
i see
do you
the ones that test positive have to retest after a certain period of time
do you think that should be implemented in the work place as like a manager or supervisor thinks or has suspicion that someone is using drugs
not being a drug user i don't have a problem with that personally i think that might be a violation of someone's rights
if someone's having personal problems for some reason that's causing them to behave differently their manager assumes they have a drug problem if someone assumed that of me i would be upset
it would almost be like a
it's based on a perception as how a drug user would behave when some drug users behave normal
how would you feel afterwards when you came up negative and your supervisor has accused you of using drugs
i think almost the only way that drug testing can be done fairly is if it's across the board from the janitors to the executive management
i know personally myself i've been in the same job for three years
i've already been drug tested three times
i'm an environmental engineer i've been drug tested three times
i know many people that have never been tested in their lifetime
the company i work for is sixty thousand people plus
for some reason i've come up three times
does your job require you to drive company equipment or to operate any type of machinery that might endanger someone
that doesn't
i
it's a legal job it's really strange
i was drug tested not for the job i have now but for the prior job
i know that the job i had before that
the job i have now requested
for instance does the company you worked for before have the right or do they have the ability to say hey we've already drug tested her
she came up negative
i don't think they can force another company to not drug test me just by saying that i didn't
i used to work for a power company
it was very important that they make sure their employees especially linemen were clean
since i was just one of the office folk i guess it wasn't as important to them that they test me regularly
i know they test most of the service people fairly regularly just across the board
are they tested random
again it depends on what job you're in
the men that drive the trucks with the guys that fix the power lines aren't tested as much
i see
they make that clear to them as they hire those guys what the drug testing schedule is
they say we're testing you tomorrow
we'll test you every three months thereafter while you work here
they know that
it's made very clear upon hiring
have we spent our at least five minutes
what kind of car are you thinking about getting
none at the moment
when you decide to
i currently drive a ford taurus
i would imagine that if i change or if i get a new car i will go with the taurus or something similar in that regard
you like the ford
i have had it for about two years now
i haven't had a minutes trouble with it the only thing i have against it in that's it's a taurus
even after two years i still feel uncomfortable driving it because i had a honda before that it's a little bit larger
that's the only difference that i see really
i would
my criteria at the moment it would be american personally
i loved it
i finally decided to go check out what the foreign cars were
i bought myself a nissan a two forty s x
even though i love the car i've got now i think my next car will probably be american again because if i can at all do it i'd like to stay american
my wife still has a honda accord
it's an excellent automobile
price and so forth
i do not opt for something that would be
i want something that's serviceable something that i can use i
with the taurus
i have a taurus l x
it's
as i said as far i'm concerned it has been extremely serviceable and everything i wanted
ford's done a real good job in the last ten years or at least the last five to six years of really turning around their quality i think
i think so too
i
in travel and renting automobiles in
i've driven chevrolet automobiles and dodge
i had a chevrolet before i bought my taurus
i purchased
i was ready to get rid of it
i shopped around
if i had thought i wanted to pay the amount of money i probably would have gone with an accord or even a civic or something comparable from nissan or toyota
it was just
i have a friend who has an auto shop
he purchased one of the first sables that was manufactured for his wife a sable station wagon
he just absolutely swore by it
it was upon his recommendation and so forth for comparably equipped with cruise control and air conditioning and a m f m radio and all these other things it was just
there was no comparison
the only thing that i find if i would have anything against it is that it still has that soft american ride
not
that's about the only thing i find disadvantageous to it
my criteria is simply something that looks good something that's serviceable
i drive around a lot
it's very comfortable on the highway
i can drive for ten hours or so and not really be tired in any way
those are my criteria
i probably in another six months to a year or something will probably start looking around again
if there's something out there that is comparable to what i have now i'll go ahead and get it
the only thing i'm looking
at right now
i just bought the nissan that i've got about nine months ago
the only thing that would get me to change cars right now would be if
at the moment i'm single
if i were to get married and have a family that would have to have something to do with it
i don't have any plans for probably another two three years of even looking
cars are too expensive right now to even think about buying new cars every couple of years
in our parking lots two or three days ago i saw one of the new honda sports cars
i can't remember what the name is
it resembled a mazaratti very very closely
to pay that much money for an automobile is just
i can't conceive of doing that
i went to a car show down here about two weeks ago
of course they had the normal the ford the chevrolet that stuff
then you started looking at the
they had ferrari there they had b m w and all these other kinds of cars
ferrari didn't even let you near the car
they were
then you saw hundred thousand dollar cars
even though i do enjoy cars i enjoy driving them i enjoy riding in them and everything i can't see paying more for a car than i would for a house
that's true
the difference there between us is that i am not really crazy about driving
i never have been since my parents had to force me to get my driver's license when i was young when i was sixteen
i've never really cared
what i was
it was never my own car it was always someone else's
that sort of thing i enjoy
to go out and drive never has really had any appeal to me in that regard
we won't get the recorder or the system to shut us off tonight
it's very easy when you get on a topic that you enjoy
i think the one time i did it was on the mid east the crisis out there
that had a great conversation
then they came off and
i was talking to a lady last evening
we were talking about fishing
we were cut off
you have a pleasant evening
what do you think about it
i guess i'm more concerned about public safety than i am about the concern for the private the idea of
the individual
i can't really see why anyone who has nothing to hide would object
there is always the possibility even remote as it is of
of course that is certainly true
that bothers me
i'm very much for drug testing
i really am
i'm going to take the negative side just for a second
i have to take medication for kidney transplant
i'm going to be taking that the rest of my life
i don't know how that's going to affect
i haven't had one yet
t i
i work for texas instruments we do have the random drug testing
i've missed it so far
in the back of my mind it always bothers me
what happens if they catch it
they think that i'm on drugs
they send me and have me go through this
thing
it seems to me that there are ways to accommodate that
i agree that some innocent person might be victimized
i would think that some guidelines could be set up to avoid that
for example that one positive would not be accepted as an automatic reason for whatever they might be going
to do if they found a positive dismissal or treatment or whatever that what it would do is it would trigger perhaps one or two more stages where further tests could be done
there must be people like you or in other circumstances that could come up with false positives for certain kind of drugs
on the other hand i think there's certainly some professions that ought to be tested because of their responsibility for the public welfare and certainly people in industries the transportation industry
specifically
in many cases whether or not an individual has a problem with drugs it's not even going to effect anybody but himself and his own family perhaps depending on the kind of drug he might be on
eventually that's going to show up anyway in the way he works
there's so many things that it would make a difference
i guess i would not want to have anyone in my family victimized by a bus driver or a train engineer or something like that who hadn't been tested
i said i'm very much pro testing
this is why
number one is i'm kind of
we are in a war against
it's horrible
you don't know whether the person sitting next to you anywhere is on drugs or not
it takes some drastic steps at this point
i think personally the drastic step has to be that you can't work if you continue taking drugs
it's as simple as that
ma- not necessarily difficult
make it so that it's not glamorous
it's glamorous taking drugs
at least it seems that way
according to what you hear
the people who have serious problems
we have
i guess we're kind of lucky
we really only know of one young man who's a fam-
it's the son and so on
he was friends with my children
he's really the only one that i know of personally who got himself really messed up having been involved with drugs
i know of a number of other people who have gotten all messed up
i have a little more contact with that
the effect that it's had on this young man's life is so dramatic that it's heartbreaking he may never really be a productive member of society
sadder than that he may never be able to have a normal happy life because it has strung him out so that he has anxieties now that are almost uncontrollable
he puts himself in the hospital fairly regularly thinking that he's not sure if he's going try to commit suicide or not
he's so messed up
this was a nice sweet young man who teenager
he's now a young man about twenty i guess who just got really down the wrong path
i don't know that his problem would ever have been detected by drug testing
seeing what drugs did to him makes me realize what it could do to people in the work force as well
it's horrible
let's answer the second half of the question
the limits would i think have to do with what i'd alluded to before that one positive on a drug test
would not constitute dismissal or grounds for whatever the company or agency might have set up for those who genuinely have a problem
in other words there needs to be more than
there needs to be some measure of certainty before anything drastic happens
there are lots of things that are involved there such as perhaps denial of insurance for someone
undoubtedly there are people who would be victimized by this that
people who are on medication for example or even people who might be of the gay community
i'm not an advocate for that particular
i think that there doesn't need to be fuel to the fire for discrimination it makes a bigger problem
it seems to me that there needs to be some rules that protect
i'm not sure though when we talk about what rules if any that we should say certain segments should not have to be tested
it
i don't know why it would be bad to test just every-
it may be
certainly random testing the fact that people know that they
the bottom line is that if you're going to stay clean and straight
there's going to be some measure of incentive reward or whatever
the reward ultimately comes down to what you want
i've got to agree with that
it sounds like we agree anyway
i think we did pretty good
all right
i guess that's about it
i guess we've talked long enough
it was nice talking to you too
do you own a p c
i have one at
i can work at home
it's just an old compact that is super slow
it does it's job
i don't know
i do television ratings
i process some ratings and do graphics for their television stations
it's basically just data entry and running some software
it doesn't really have to be anything sophisticated
i work for t i
i have a fairly fancy one
it's an s p one thousand which has a fast processor in it a three eighty-six
the job that i do
i have to develop functional specs
it's kind of fun
i always say that i need to buy a computer for the house
i just haven't got around to doing it yet
sometimes my husband says usually i work on the computer all day at work
your husband what group is your husband in
something with the defense
i work on printers and
the peripheral products division basically
i work in the airline marketing group
we do a lot of
i learned so many things that they do
in for a while
he had one of those what are they top secret things
where he couldn't talk about what he did
then he switched jobs
i have
software design engineer as they call it
i have a degree in information management
which is computer
it's basically the more the business end of it than the programming end of it
i've been at it for five years
everything's changed so much i probably couldn't even
they've made such advances in computers
does your husband ever use a laptop or a notebook
sometimes he brought home a portable one
it quit working
brought it back
he just hasn't brought another one home
they did give him a new computer at work
i see
we build laptop and notebook computers here in temple also
those are really handy
they have modems in them you can send a fax from your p c
how nice
they're really
they're pretty handy because when i travel it's easy to check messages
just
my husband doesn't have to travel
at least you get to
that kind of reeks havoc with plans
it's really not enough to become a big hassle
that's good
i don't think i'd like it if he traveled a lot
they're so expensive
i don't know
there you can get
you can get real high powered stuff now for under two thousand dollars where just a few years ago it would have been six seven eight nine thousand dollars
yeah
i guess it's inexpensive compared to what it used to be
it's a lot to put into one
it's still
two thousand dollars isn't just pocket change to a lot of people
it's not pocket change
it's major
maybe when the kids get in school that will be
when they start needing something then that will be different
when i started at t i i was a summer development student
those papers really
it was nice having access to the
equipment to
his was more for scientific stuff than for word processing
how many different types of packages do you use
all i
the packages i don't really use
what i use that outside development that we use most of it's just stuff that's been written in house that i use
up at work anyway i use wordperfect and lotus which is a line-draw package
i've just used wordperfect and lotus the most
for your data entry stuff that your
a lot of the data entry stuff they used survey system and just in-house programs to do what they needed
do you work at home all the time
they just wanted me to continue working for them at home doing other things
that worked out pretty good then
i don't really don't do a lot of what i used to do
i just do something really minor
it's time consuming
it keeps you in the company
that's right
it gives me a paycheck
the works only three weeks
goes for three to four weeks three times a year
it's not something that's continual because the television ratings don't come out all the time
i've got lots of documentation i need to review and some i need to revise
i need to be at the office too
my hu- he took one home when they had a big deadline coming up
it was looking a little touchy to meet
i've done that before on a couple times
that would make it just that much easier
instead of bringing home a computer you just bring home a few floppy disks
i thought that would be
it's real nice with this because i don't even have to go into the office
i've maybe been into the office once in the past three years
they just send me everything and pick it up courier or whatever
None
it is real nice
i worked
i know most of them
most people know who i am
i don't know who they are
it's been good talking to you
we'll talk to you later
okay thanks
it's kind of hard to find time sometimes
have a family
i don't have a family
i usually work about fifty hours a week
for a dinner party i think one of my favorite things is baked chicken and white wine
that's really weird that you said that because for a dinner party mine is a chicken in a marsala wine sauce
mine actually came from the texas instruments cafeteria
the cafeteria is real good about putting out recipes once a month
i tried it
it was really good
what is a marsala wine a sweeter wine
it's a red wine
i'm trying to think what else
i roll it in bread crumbs and parmesan cheese
i rub the chicken with a little bit of oil
and pour the wine sauce over it like the last twenty minutes
it kind of browns
you put wine over it
it's really easy too
i like to serve a wild rice with it
do you like angel food cake
i mix up some cream cheese and a little bit of amaretta wi- and some cool whip
i make a thickened blueberry sauce
i layer it with angel food cake and the blueberries and then that topping
it's great
since there's only two of us
i try to avoid making anything that too fancy that
i know what you mean
i guess one that i really like that i haven't made in awhile
it's called a fruit pizza
you take a sugar cookie recipe
and spread it out on a pizza pan
you make it like a pizza crust
you bake that
you take things like kiwi
None
i can't remember what else is in it
you make kind of a glaze
you layer your fresh fruit on that
and pour that over it
it's real light
depending on the fruit you use it's real colorful
especially with the kiwi and the strawberries
usually i just opt for brownies and vanilla ice cream
i've been making a hot sandwich
i make a little honey mustard dressing and put over it
that's something that just doesn't take a long time to fix
it's really good for you
we eat out a lot
there are sometimes you just don't feel like eating out
i wish i had something a little bit different
mix up a little mayonnaise with some dijon mustard
it's real good
it keeps in the refrigerator
do you
it keeps a long time
you wouldn't have to mix that much together even
i put a little yogurt in it too
are you
i have been debating what to cook because one of my guests is a vegetarian
we're going to
we might try to grill some flounder or salmon steaks
i usually
definitely go with it will have to be a rice dish lots of vegetables
i had a recipe from that international cookbook two that's a great salad in summertime
do you garden or not
a lot of times they'll give us something
i put it on a glass plate because it looks real pretty
and just a little bit of basil
everybody loves it
it's so easy
it's delicious
it doesn't sound like it would be hard at all
you can put some cucumber slices on too
it's got all these beautiful pictures
it was not expensive
the ones that i've been wanting to get
i've been wanting to get those because we eat a lot of chicken
we do eat a lot of pasta
we just said the other night it wouldn't be too difficult to do without red meat
we don't have that much of it now
some beef and broccoli strips
it didn't have much beef in it
i've got a wok that we don't use near as often as we used to
we used to stir fry a lot especially a lot of chicken and a lot of rice dishes
usually if i take a day off or on the weekend especially i try to cook
real food
at least cook a couple of dishes ahead
that we can have those to enjoy
cause we have some local ones
we have a share alike column in the paper
where people write in and share recipes or write in and say i'm looking for this recipe
that's where i get a lot of my recipes
they are usually good aren't they
i got a real good one from a doctor's office one time
is that right
it's a baked bean recipe
you mix baked beans and lima beans
let's see i guess
you buy the canned baked beans
and brown sugar and molasses and bake them in catsup
you just bake it
it's like a spicier baked bean dish
that sounds
you can add hamburger if you want
i try to always keep my eyes open because a lot of time you can find really good recipes where you wouldn't even think about it
i try to always keep a little notebook in my purse
jot them down
it's been
hang on
let me try it once more
i think we're on maybe
in maryland are you a skins fan
not really from
the teams i really root for in football are the niners and the seahawks
i like seattle because i like seattle
besides i like the city
you were out there in san francisco
san jose but close
it's other than the big catch with the forty-niners and the cowboys
i don't know
i never really was a cowboys fan until i moved down to texas
is that where you are now
i guess when you're down here in dallas you finally get indoctrinated into the cowboys because this is a big football territory down here
unfortunately of course the cowboys have been doing so bad in the past few years
that
it's not like it used to be
you back the winners
you don't back them when they're not doing well
i think in trying to follow the cowboys over the years i think they used to have a philosophy for i don't know probably the last twenty-five years except for about the last about five or six years they always went out and tried to draft the best athletes
they would go out and try to go for the best people and then mold them into different areas or find their natural niche
then about four or five years ago they started going after specific players or positions
the press would get down on landry
this is when schramm was still there
they'd go after them saying jeez what you really need is a defensive end
they'd go out and try to find a defensive end
when they drafted somebody and he didn't workout at that spot it really wasn't a good enough athlete to move to any place else
i think it was kind ever interesting
i think the decline of the cowboys as a powerhouse really kind of started with not drafting the best athletes
it makes sense because you've got the flexibility if they're good athlete they can do a bunch of different things
i don't
my main sport is baseball
i've been enjoying football
i don't know it as well
i just
is it this year they don't have a draft pick because of the walker trade
what was the whole deal on that
they still have some draft picks
they picked up some from minnesota
i think it was minnesota's
that's right
they traded herschel
they
i've got a friend that lives right next to the cowboys' training camp
he sees them out running a lot
every once in a while gets a chance to talk to some of the guys
they're all thinking that they really got something going this year
i guess when you have a whole bunch of professional athletes that get together at the beginning of the year everybody's got great hopes
know i guess it's the same way with baseball or anybody
spring training until you actually start going out and getting out against the competition everything probably looks pretty good
if you go to
i'm sure if you go to any of the twenty-eight coaches in football in training camp they say we're going to be super bowl champs
i know in baseball any manager you go to say we're going to be in the world series
even though there's not a prayer
kim didn't the cowboys even finish
they did as a matter of fact
they only won one game the year before right
i live near baltimore
i'm really
they got a big thing because of the expansion going on in baseball
d c is talking about how they're going to get a baseball team and everything
of course the griping is that if washington doesn't get a baseball team then baltimore shouldn't get a football team which is probably true
anyway i've never liked d c a whole lot
a really hate the redskins
of course
a lot of it's because i got a lot of people at work with and everything that are big redskin fans
i've never liked philadelphia the city a whole lot
the only reason i really enjoy the eagles at all is because i really like randall cunningham
it was buddy ryan the one that i can't stand too much
considering how well he gets along with jimmy johnson that doesn't surprise me
there was this ther- in
the baltimore sun has this cartoonist in the sports section
i guess it was january when jimmy johnson got named coach of the year or whatever
he had this cartoon in there about jimmy johnson's big day
the first thing is the phone call from the league saying he was coach of the year
the second was this phone call from buddy ryan i got fired can you believe that
you said you lived near baltimore
you're out
i used to drive a lot between baltimore and washington
it's just west of baltimore off route seventy
basical- route seventy and route forty
that's not far from where the new football stadium would be if we got an n f l team
they've built a new stadium downtown
is that near the what do they
is it the the wharf or the inner harbor
it's a couple of blocks west
None
there's an old station
they're building the stadium on the other side of the shed from the inner harbor which is really stupid because one of the big selling points of the new stadium is supposed to be this view of the inner harbor
the only way you're going to have a view of is this big brick wall
they've got land set aside for a football stadium if they ever get a n f l team
it's real easy access from south of baltimore like the airport or more importantly for the orioles from washington d c
the orioles say they get twenty-five percent of their attendance from d c
the colts still to me are the baltimore colts
i never been real thrilled with not
i went to purdue university for a couple of years and
i was not real happy when they left to go there of all places
did you graduate from purdue
i transferred to delaware and graduated there
there's not a whole lot in delaware
it's close to philadelphia and baltimore
kind of all over the place but
east coast lately
i have one a five year old daughter
she was
i had her at a private sitter for i guess two two and a half years after that
how did you choose that sitter
she was referred to me by a couple of people
she turned out to be wonderful
i didn't want to send her straight to a day care
even though she was that old i still didn't want her to go to a day care
this lady you would think it was her own
now i have got her in a montessori school
she's really really doing good and learning a lot
that's neat
i guess i'm going to quit as soon as the school season's over
i really enjoyed being with her up there
they go year-round teach them
now in the summer they have a lot of field trips
they still go through all their curriculum as usual
we went over to her house
we told her pro-
we just told here we'd be over that day
that way i didn't think the house would be cleaned or anything for me specifically
she had a daughter
i want to say her daughter was like six or seven right around first second grade
it was only like a part-time basis
we really seem to be pleased with her
did you introduce your daughter to her before you made
she still loves her to death
mean when they see each other they just love each other to death
she literally spent almost the entire amount that i paid her on my daughter
we're real real lucky
aft-
she stayed with her about roughly two years
she had to go back to work
she had to go i guess get a real job
what made you decide to put her in a montessori school
i checked a lot of places out the kinder cares and the
i live in garland
there's this montessori school that's nearby
it had been recommended by some friends of ours
it's an older place
i checked out all the new places that were near us
i checked that place out
even though it was older it was real comfortable and
they didn't just play all day long
i noticed a lot of these other schools that i went
they
i thought that must be pretty good if everybody's trying to incorporate a little bit of it into
they made sure they pointed it out
after i looked at this place and i took randi with me
i just kind of let her go see what she felt like doing
that place
if somebody came and she liked them and she went outside with them it's hard to drag her away
i felt more comfortable at
she was real comfortable
she has really done good
she seems to me to be pretty quick and smart
she's already reading and writing and stuff
she just turned five last month
i didn't want to rush school at her the whole time
my god here we go
do you have any nieces or nephews
that's a shame
i was petrified
that's
that's why
that's one reason i like working up there a little bit is
you don't know
at her school
they have car callers
some kid goes out and gets the kid
at first that always kind of bothered me
not bothered me
i thought i'd like to see what she's doing
now that i'm there it's a lot more convenient because there's so many kids that doddle
when their parents come
it's hard to get them out
a lot of parents have places to go and things like that
it's late at night
now it doesn't bother me at all
is it near country club
i've seen the signs
i've never actually seen the place itself
it's set far back
that's something i like too
a lot of those places are
it's right there on
it's set back
i would be scared to death my child might accidentally get out
if that seems like a real accessible place to where you could
go
a car accident
it was brand new when i checked it out
of course it was beautiful and
i that
i do know why because
drugs and
that scares me
you're just with them
they've
of course they still have no concept of
what to do when they're faced with it
i just think of her
next year she's going to be five six years old in kindergarten in same school with i guess ten year olds
sixth grade
that's a big gap
that i can honestly see the peer pressure there
i can
i'm probably a little too over protective
nowadays you have to be
i don't think there's anything wrong with that
i at first thought when i didn't have kids
i was going how can you be so protective
it's easy now
i do
are you married
that's good
they're really neat
in which building
are you summit or are you
this is fun
i'm building one
i'm building two
how's the weather in building two
typical t i
i'm a transplant
what do you think of the texas weather
five years now
i've been here long pretty long
you know about august then
i've been through five of those
a lot of people try to leave the state for a couple of weeks in august for
we went up to wyoming this last summer during that time
it was like eighty degrees up there
that's even farther away
it is so cool you wear a jacket
even in the summer time
because it rains a lot in alaska
it
it's lovely
it rains just enough to keep everything nice and moist and very green
my goodness it's pretty
texas isn't bad
i have to think every year to try to remember what's it supposed to like this time of year
because march we usually get a lot of rain in march
it'll seem the news the harold taft on the local news
we've had this many inches
we're right on target
just seem like we were getting a lot of rain in march
i it's hard to remember twelve months ago what it was like
we always do though
yeah i just wish it wouldn't come all at once
we get all that heat
it's just that
in california you get these nice lovely rains nothing really like downpours like you have here
you got into that bad stuff
just so noisy hitting the house
the glass on the windows
we went out there afterwards
there's ice balls the size of marbles all over our lawn
you pick them up
they're perfectly round
i go how did they form so perfect like that
i think that's one of the strange things
you very seldom see it though
i've seen hail
usually the size of tiny pebbles
really small
this was really large
it's a drop of water that had come through quite a few rain clouds apparently
i don't know how hail is formed to tell you the truth
i think that's
you don't think it's cold enough to
in the clouds it is
i think all that falling would warm it up and melt it
maybe that's what rounds it tumbling
i was in florida for a week on business
i had called back to the house
i called back to the house
i said okay i watched the news
i thought ha ha that's garland that's not plano
i guess you just tend to think of where your house is and nothing else
close to that what's called duck creek that runs through part of garland that's the part that always seems to get hardest hit when there's the hard rain
i see
a lot of houses around that creek seem to get flooded the streets and stuff around that area
that house
not quite
i live close by there in far north garland
it's getting built up with more new shopping centers and things
the house that i bought was really really nice
really really nice home very pretty
you're not living there right now
i see
it's investment property
it's a very nice place
i would cheerfully live there
i've lived in my home almost ten years
i've got everything just exactly like i want it
if i were to live some place else it certainly meets my standards
i'll be honest with you
it's in the estates that adjoin it
that's a nice area
that one ninety is just going to be the outermost loop around
another belt line just farther out
i've lived in san diego for six years when i was younger and l a area
my parents live in anaheim right now
there is an area beyond thousand oaks north of los angeles that is really an eerie strange looking area with boulders
is it along the coast or inland
it may be a little bit more inland
i had to go up to t i on business a couple years ago we went up that coastline
i was just amazed how unusual that looks
okay maybe i'm used to texas
the
i don't remember seeing that part of it
they've built some new highways out to that area and things lately
i know exactly that area
texas i don't know
i don't think it's quite as green
it's just
it's green sometime
it's just
it doesn't stay green the really
in all honesty
we built a pool in eighty-two
i'm not
i read a lot
i don't read a whole
i'm a big baseball fan
i tend to read a lot of the baseball books
i read a lot of science fiction
i like
during the school year i just don't have time to read
i would love to be able to read more because i enjoy it so much
with correcting papers and two kids of my own i just don't have time
in the summer i try to read a lot
of course being a woman i like romance novels and stuff like that a whole lot
i really enjoy that because it's kind of a getaway type thing
i read a lot of that
i also love sports
i don't have time to read in
i do read sports illustrated during the year because my son gets that
i don't read a lot of nonfiction
i really should because there's so many self-improvement books out right now that would benefit me greatly
i just don't
i don't really i
i'll get books on history and stuff like that that look interesting
of course i don't ever get around to reading them
i got
i belong to quality paperback book club
do you
i'll get stuff out of that
i got battle cry of freedom
a couple of years ago
i started reading and got about sixty pages into it
it's like eight hundred pages
my word
it was like i want to read something else for a while
after you get into them they're really good
it's just tough to get through that first two hundred pages or so
especially
battle cry of freedom starts off in the eighteen forties
it's
wait the war wasn't until the eightee-
it's okay
i realize these things
these things take awhile to move up
it's hard sometimes
i find though that when i find an author
you don't read a lot of fiction you said
when i find
i do the same thing
because you get used to their style and you really enjoy it
there's one science fiction writer named allen dean foster
i must have fifty or sixty books by him
i have almost everything he's ever done
i know that when i get his book i'm usually going to enjoy it
it's really
it's fun to do that
he does a lot of movie adaptations and things like that
does he really
his adaptations are usually really good
it's funny he
the novelization of star wars was list-
it was out in the stores as being by george lucas
it turns out that foster actually ghost wrote it for him
which
when i read it i should have realized that because it had foster's style written all over it
i've never read anything of his
i've heard about him
wouldn't you think he would
i'm sure he does
i would think he would
i mean he's doing all right probably
i'm sure he is
sometimes the more you get the more you want too
you're a baseball fan
you're aware of that kind of thing
in fact i'm a sports fan period
that's why i like to read sports illustrated so much
there's everything in it
i had a subscription to that last year
i'm mostly a baseball fan
i'm not as inter-
i was mostly interested in the baseball stuff
you're probably a baltimore fan right an oriole fan
i'm a red sox fan more than anything
that's good too
i do like the orioles also
i'm sure you do
i'm a ranger fan simply because i live here
i was
i've always followed the tigers because i was born and raised in toledo
went to a mud hens double header
i love the mud hens
was a really big article on the mud hens in sports illustrated last year
i saved that issue
that's when i had the subscription
we used to go there all the time
they have the iowa oaks
we used to
i don't know if they play
they must have changed then because it used
i haven't been back to des moines in a long time
we used to always go to their games
it was kind of fun
it's almost more fun than going to a major league game
it's not quite so serious
it's a lot cheaper
there's a city just west of baltimore called frederick
they have a minor league team
i go out there almost as much as the orioles
it's free parking
bu- four bucks now to get in
the hot dogs are a dollar
it's just great
how much is an oriole game
the cheapest ticket you can normally get is like six fifty to seven fifty
it's higher than the rangers
hot dogs start at a dollar fifty
you can get a good seat for
i think it's gone up to four dollars this year
that's nice
it's in the bleachers way out in center field
it's still nice
we usually sit there unless somebody gives
how much are the box seats there
box seats run from like eight dollars to twelve dollars
that's a little steeper
i think the most expensive seats in memorial are eleven bucks
we're getting a new stadium next year
it'll go up
if it opens
it's something we're really irritated about around here
some people are really irritated about
they built the new stadium downtown
they're saying how there's going to be a lot more parking for the stadium
i park for free up at memorial stadium because i know where i can do it for free
i'm not going to be able to do that downtown
that's a bummer
baseball here though is the cheapest game in town because the cowboys
it's outrageous to go to the cowboy game
the mavericks are t-
baseball's cheap
that didn't go over
it didn't
george bush who's the main owner of the rangers decided that they'd stay in arlington
arlington's going to build a stadium a bigger one
they're going to stay there which is fine because arlington's got a lot of things to offer
that was their main money making
it would have devastated them if they would have taken it away
it that's
they
i'm kind of glad they're staying there because it's right in the middle of fort worth-dallas
None
that's what i'd always heard
i like it there
i think dallas has enough to offer that they don't have to hog everything
i'm glad that they're staying in arlington
it's takes us maybe thirty-five to forty minutes to get there from plano which is not too bad at all
it actually funny that i live just outside of baltimore
it takes me almost the same amount of time to go to frederick as it does to go to the ballpark in baltimore
because to go out to frederick i just jump on the interstate
i live just south of the interstate
hop on the interstate
the stadium's right off the interstate
it's like i drive west
i'm there
to go into baltimore it's fewer miles
i've got to go stop and go traffic and everything
do you read
you don't read many sports books
not really
my son does
i have a son that just turned sixteen
he reads everything he get his hands on
he's a basketball fan because he plays for the high school he goes to
just loves dick vitelle
he's reading it
he says he's so interesting mom
he's really enjoying that
he said mom you need to read it after i get finished
maybe i will
i understand there was a really good basketball book called a season on the brink
i was listening to something on the radio about
a talk show about sports books
they mentioned that one
i was thinking about
i saw a book kicking around on the history of the a b a which
that would be good
even when i don't like the sport so much i get interested in the history of sports franchises
do you have any friends that have children
what do they say about finding adequate child care
there relatively nonexistent from what i hear from my friends
it seems like even when they have consulted day care centers that are quote unquote reputable that are sort of like a chain if i can use that word still you have to deal with the people that happen to be operating it locally
it's just a matter of trust
i think they feel that these people are under qualified basically and underpaid
i think that sort of goes hand in hand
it's difficult for them
we certainly found that to be true
indeed we've
we moved away from institutionalized child care if we can call those chain kind of things
like that by that name
and found that more creative avenues were the right answer for us
at one point in time we've had au pairs
that worked for a while
adequate ones were really tough to find
i do have a friend that
they loved it
they had stayed with this family from the time these children were small four or five years old up until they were well into grade school
she was paid very well because the parents trusted them
they had done such a good job
i can see where someone in a position like that in a live-in capacity would definitely be the way to go if you're lucky enough to have the financial to be able to do that
that's true
that's something that we're struggling with now
it's a terrible thing to say when your speaking of children in that way
you still have to be realistic as well i think
that's bad to have to admit too
it's just there's so much pressure when you're talking about two people that work outside the home
i think that is one reason why i continue to be without children
it's just such a responsibility when i've had friends that have said
when you hear people say it alters your life forever please take heed
it's such a responsibility
it certainly is
i just have to be honest about it
there are those times when i think if i didn't have children i could be out playing bridge or golf
it's funny
i had a friend that said before we always said we don't want children because we can't go off on the spur of the moment or this or that and the other
she got older
she said we never do those things anyway
it's just the way your attitude changes
you mature i suppose
the thing about the child care i have friends that struggle financially they both do have to work
it's a matter not necessarily that she might want to stay home or he as well
they need the money
when i seen some of my friends that have taken that six week old baby to someone else it's just i can imagine how emotional it must be multiplied by the fact that you don't really trust the person or you're uncomfortable with the situation as far as child care
we were lucky when our children were that age
having lived in a community for a while we knew the person to whom we were entrusting our children
felt that
feeling of safety
were leaving them small children
we also learned something from that experience as our children got older
i think your patient level needs to increase as the child gets older
i think that might be part of the problem with some people
when you have them in their little feet are moving
you have to chase them down constantly
you sound like your pretty well passed the worst of it as far as worrying about
you don't know what happens after they get in school
we have one takes piano lessons
the other one of course can't do the same thing
of course not
we are helping
it's almost everyday
the stamina that you must draw from yourself to deal with it
i've been finding out that i really am a nice person
i didn't need it
now i need it
it stays low a lot
are your children now
do you feel comfortable with them coming home after school until you and your wife get home
one of them i would leave unsupervised any time any place any where
the other one i wouldn't leave unsupervised two minutes
it's the one that's going downhill
is it the one that needs more supervision that has a bad influence on the older or more mature one
you don't think that good prevails
i'm living in a dream world
i'm an only child
i've never been around children
i'm sort of at a loss where that's concerned
i do hear my friends talk about it
we're having such fun
we just couldn't wait to have two children so they would be such friends
i have to admit i was selfish as a child
now that i'm older of course it's different
i think about wouldn't it be nice
None
they just sort of adopted me as their eleventh child
that worked out pretty well
i guess that's an alternative
if you could just
of course people are denying it
it's just frightening
what's frightening is a parent to see things that you don't really don't understand
you don't really know what happened
we gave up on one baby sitter because we came home one night and found pieces of hair ribbon tied in a chair where obviously she had
i sure do
the dog is joey
my goodness
we just got a new addition to the family so to speak
a cross between a catfish and i don't know what a salamander
did you all catch it
the mud dog
we had a friend give it to us
it's all alone in that aquarium
we haven't found one yet
how about you
at the present time i have two dogs
an english setter
it has
yellow spots on it which they call i think liver spots
that's a male
i have a wonderful female lab black lab
quite a long time probably five or six years
unfortunately the black lab that's a female it's the most wonderful animal we've ever had
when she was about three years old we noticed that she was having problems limping and so forth
it's in that breed
now i think there are tests that can be conducted to tell whether or not the puppies have it
i think
apparently they've been so i don't know inbred or what
is that right
it
if you should have one that also has hip dysplasia you cannot breed it
i didn't even know that
she's wonderful
our dog joey has a back problem
ha-
he's got a bad back
he's seven
i guess he's almost eight years old
what are the symptoms
he just
he rolls o-
otherwise he can jump just as long as he doesn't bend a certain way
i have had just wonderful luck with this lab
let's see winter before last we would bring her in when it was cold
she wouldn't
i
she wouldn't
i couldn't get her up without picking her up which it was pretty hard to do at eighty pounds
i met my son's college roommate is a vet
he said let's give her some race horse shots
in
i'm kind of glad to be able to tell people about this because you all the time run into people with problems
that's when we lived in oklahoma
he gave this dog a series of
they give it to race horses to get rid of cartilage
it's called
it's a series of six shots once a week
i noticed after two shots she was
i could have
i can't give a shot
after the second shot she was significantly better
then i didn't notice any improvement till after the sixth one
ever since
he said a booster every year or two
maybe every six months or something like that
and when i notice in the winter when it's worse it's cold weather and so forth then i have gotten a booster for her
not many people in this part of the country know anything about
they've really never used it
dogs that get down in the hips
i think german shepherds do it and probably large dogs
it's just wonderful
does he just run out in the backyard
we're living now in an area where we're in the woods
we take walks
go away from me
we take walks through the woods twice a day
that's nice
i can over do it on her
at least she can go
she's not limping along and all that
stripper he started out being a little orphan
we took him in
he's about two years old now
he loves his treats
both joey and stripper get treats
let's see
is stripper an inside cat or outside
he's outside
he gets to go in and out whenever he wants to
of course
he has to go out whenever we ask him
when we ask him he barks
he'll tell you which one he wants
he just can
he has been trained
you've kept it up haven't you
i have some neighbors across the field
they
when we first moved here when the dogs and i didn't fe-
since i didn't want to
i just wanted to let them be able to be free for a while
i kept watch and never let them get away
every couple weeks one would slip away
my neighbor said to me i noticed those dogs are so well trained
that made me very proud
have we been talking five minutes
it sounds like you keep your pets for pleasure
okay
i didn't know if they stop you when the time is up
i glanced at the clock when we started
i think it's been probably about five and a half minutes or something
one day i was talking to a lady about gardening
i love gardening
she did too
after about twelve minutes or something
it's been so much fun too talk
my best friend in virginia's daughter is a part of this project in texas
i see
she knew that i had the time and would enjoy it
i
i have a hard time getting anybody because i guess
probably just got home
during the day i me-
i understand also they want men
this is a great project that they're working on
it's really going to lead the way for a lot of applications and development in the voice area
i think so too
i haven't helped them out on men particularly
my husband probably has made a few more calls than i have because i tend to not make them around dinner time
i try to make them during the day
nobody's home
this is the perfect time for me
maybe i'll get you next time
it so much fun to talk to you
i guess if i was having a dinner party depending on the number of people i might cook a brisket or a roast or maybe a chicken dish i guess i usually plan probably a lettuce salad and a potato dish
we usually serve fresh fruit and then make a dessert
that sounds good
that makes
we're not real wealthy at the moment
i used my mother's recipe
it's got
you cook the noodles and brown hamburger and put tomato sauce in with it
i'm not sure she even puts
that sounds good
for the cheese part you mix sour cream and cream cheese and cottage cheese and layer all that
tossed salad and
lasagna's always wonderful for large crowds
i've heard a lot of people say the short cut on the cooking for lasagna
they've told me that they go to sam's and buy a great big pan of lasagna
i've heard that sam's has a really good lasagna in fact i think i had it at a party once
i know people that have served it
they say if you have company coming when you don't want to be always in the kitchen it's easy
they said it's good
that always sounds good to me
i feel like i'm in the kitchen cooking a lot
i know
seems like i cook a lot of dinners not always for company just for family
feels like i'm often in the kitchen
a time consuming place
you fry it like a taco shell you
for all the inside parts you brown hamburger and put some tomato sauce in it
i like to just add picante sauce to get the mexican flavor
you don't have to mess with spices and stuff
let's see
you heat up refried beans
you cut up tomatoes and lettuce and grated cheese
what you do to make it you take the shell and you spread the beans on first
then you put
then i usually put the cut up tomatoes next and then the lettuce
you can put guacamole and
get a towel or go change
we don't make it very often i guess
do they
usually when we get avocados my kids just like to eat them plain yeah
that's good
it's always good on top of something in the sandwich
i made guacamole that i would take to a pool party across the street the other day
everyone there said they never made guacamole salad
i don't know
they just said they never had it at home
i was concerned that taking this as a dip i thought sometimes when we have it at home it it turns dark on the top so quickly
i just
it helps if you leave the pit in it
does that help
that's supposed to help keep it from turning brown so quick
i'll have to remember that
that day i just took extra lemon and just squeezed across the top
it really stayed longer than i ever thought it would
that's good
i guess we bought a lot of
even though
the ground turkey the meat is softer
sometimes it seems to be cheaper too
we often buy it we buy it
we bought that
we bought the filets and then the chicken or turkey nuggets
i don't think anybody in my house knows the difference
less cholesterol
i guess that's probably all we need to do for tonight
i can't think of any other specific things i like to serve
you mix cottage cheese and a package of jello and a thing of cool whip that's good and quick and easy
probably the only family recipe that we make is cheese cake
we take a recipe from my grandmother it's probably fairly typical cream cheese and egg and sugar and the insides of a
this is the season for vacations
i guess for places i like to go i enjoy going to the beach and being outdoors somewhere
maybe as the summer heat comes along i would sort of like going somewhere where it's not so hot and being able to be outside enjoy outside activities
i like to have a tennis court there
if it's at the beach the beach is great
where do you usually go
let's see
we have plans this year to drive up to the to colorado
we will be going to estes park and colorado springs
boy that's a nice place to visit
there's a nice train ride that goes up to the city of silverton where they used to do a lot of silver mining
north of that is another town on a smaller scale i guess than silverton
i there's lots and lots of mountains that are covered with boulders
i guess people jeep through that area
we did not have a chance to do that
i sure would like to go back there and do that again
we have not had a vacation in several years
we are going to go to destin florida which is a very nice beach area if you are not familiar with it
i have heard it's wonderful
it's gorgeous
we used to go quite a bit before i moved out here
we were closer and used to go almost every summer and rent a condo there on the beach
there's a lot of development of condominiums there on the beach front
they have quite a few rooms we will usually rent one for about a week or so
it's beautiful white sand and very clear blue green water and a
lot of nice waves usually
enough to make it
there's not as many sea shells along there
if you go further down you will usually find some but not right in there
i do not know why it is
it just
it seems not to have as many right there
we enjoy it
we usually stay at the same place every year
where do you stay
it's a place called jetty east j e t t y e a s t
it's called that because it's at the very end of a jetty there which is
sort of at the end of this little point
it's at the very end
it's very nice
it's not very expensive
we have a i think it's three bedroom or two bedroom condominium which will sleep
six or eight cause it's got pull out couches and all that
i think it's going to cost us per couple about three hundred dollars for the week
it has got its own full size
this one i think has two baths
the one we got is on the beach side
just
it's really a nice stay
i had won a trip to the bahamas but did not get to take it on our honeymoon time
we instead went there and loved it just as much as if we had gone to the bahamas
in fact we stayed an extra day or so because we liked
the particular suite we had gotten was very nice
it's a pretty nice place
we have just
it will take a day and a half to get there probably
we are
starting at the end of july we will have two vacation weeks in october and two vacation weeks in march
that will be an interesting turn on vacations for our family
what does that mean alternate
in the summer would be more like a two month break
they hope to boost the learning of the children
kind of scattering the vacation throughout the year
maybe within a year we will see how that falls
we will head for florida maybe in somewhat of an off season instead of summer
that's probably all we need to do today
your occupation is teaching
i'm a substitute teacher
is this pat i'm talking to now
it is
i was just trying to make an introduction here
i haven't told you i'm going to be at a different school this year
i've just gotten another job at an elementary library at barron
i bet you may dress differently then for that
not really
every day i've got to read to kindergartners
i'm going to be down on the floor with them
i've got about forty kindergartners i'm going to be working with every day for a half hour
i'll probably be wearing slacks as often as i do because if i'm going to be down on the floor messing with them i'm not going to wear
what i wear sometimes depends on how cold i think the school might be or what room i might be in since i'm a sub and have different rooms to go to and always carry a sweater
of course you've been at clark enough that you know it's always cold
you don't know i guess at some of the other schools you go to unless you've been there
you try to layer so you can add or take off
it's interesting to notice when you go to different schools that some are a little more fancier than others and have a very casual
i think some of the dress codes are different at different schools
that's one of the things i ask about whether she would allow slacks
she said she doesn't have a problem with that
i said that was okay
basically i wear slacks year round except about once a week i try to wear a skirt
in the winter i maybe wear longer sleeve shirts than i do in the summer and add a heavier jacket or wear jackets more in the winter than i do in the summer
i don't really work in a profession that requires that i wear a business suit and look really
for me sometimes they even have dress up days
they have spirit week that you wear your different outfits you have to have the color for that particular school if you choose to participate in spirit week
one might be a hat day where you have to come up with some sort of hat
you never know that though sometimes when you're going in do you
because i sort of stick to several schools i'm usually aware that there might be a spirit week going on and might might remember to do it
many schools on a particular day during i guess football season maybe all year long they wear the school colors for game day which
on what thursday
it may be friday for the senior high schools
that would kind of give you a clue i guess
sometimes you get the long term stuff
you're aware ahead of time of what's going on
i don't know
i think about the dress code they have for the kids
they put one on the parents or the teachers and say the men have to wear ties
there can be no blue jeans worn
because some of the teachers i know wear dress up jeans not sloppy looking jeans but tapered jeans that they've had dry cleaned so they have got the crease
they'll wear it with a nice top
i don't know that that looks that bad
if you're going to tell the kids they have to dress up i guess you can tell the teachers that too
i think the elementary school teachers or maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier than some of the high school teachers i think
i think it varies just so much
anything can go
you can see in some of the departments in some of the schools like history at clark they're all pretty fancy
they're just sort of into clothes
there's other departments that aren't
they'll just wear your common ordinary whatever you
there's a couple teachers up there that do dress up more than others
you try to maybe follow those if you know you're going there
you always
course it's a standing joke when the men come in a tie and a suit coat you say what have you got a job interview today
you're going to be observed
there's usually something going on that would cause that to happen i don't know how a coach would feel that teaches health or english or whatever that they had to wear a tie
a t-shirt
we've got coaches that teach health for five periods and then have athletics sixth period
they dress pretty good i would say
they go to their coaching
they put their shorts on there
that's what i would think
they don't wear their sweat pants or anything
they dress like any other teacher would in a classroom situation not in p e
course we had one coach one period he'd teach p e and the next period health and then a period of p e that's hard
he just left warm-ups on
no
i think really probably they could really
i don't know if they make uniforms the thing for the kids
i don't really know if they still do
some of them yes they do
it's not at some of the private schools
even there's a couple public schools in dallas where the kids wear uniforms and the teachers dress in accordance with that
it's certainly cheaper and easier in the long run i think that you don't have to be concerned about your wardrobe
i think it would make a difference at school
i don't think we should be spending time saying somebody's wearing torn clothing or wearing shorts too short
they've got the really short skirt the black nylons the high
it's a lot of trouble to take care of that
of course the kids say then why bother just let me wear what i want
yet we can't to that either
i'd like to see them go to not necessarily a uniform but saying that they've got to wear a button down shirt
that would alleviate any t-shirts with sayings on them
if they could wear a button-down shirt and a pair of dark slacks and they could buy them anywhere they wanted
the girls
i doubt that that will come about
they may get a- they said in the dallas schools that that helps their educational process there
i think it does
it takes their minds off of trying to compete
then i think that's going to push teachers to dress a lot more professionally than they do
i don't think a lot of teachers are very professional
we've got a pickup twice a week that they come out
they have their own special bin that they hand it out to everybody
it's twice a week
recently started a bin program here in plano where
used to be we put all of our trash in green bags and the trash men came out twice a week and picked up
now they have these large green containers
you have to put your trash that you don't recycle in there
they haven't started curbside recycling yet
they're planning on doing it very soon
apparently the trucks that they had lined up they needed the parts for
that put off
do you recycle
my kids do
they've been recycling cans for extra money
that's been their summer money
they're fixing to go to disneyland
that's great
that's the way we started too
to camp goddard which is through the plano school system in the fall couple of years ago
she had to earn money for it
she was too young to baby-sit
that's how she started
from there we now recycle glass and newspapers and aluminum cans and plastics
is that the same way as with the aluminum cans
the rest of it we just do because
we don't get paid for that
that's okay
it's not that much of a bother really
we use a lot of
two liter bottles and milk cartons and things like that
when the kids first went down i said that's great
i was thinking maybe i'd help supplement it when they turned them in
all that stuff
how much we have reduced our waste
that we're generating a week
i know our neighbors when we first went to this bin program said there's no way we're going to have to have pickup twice a week
they were only picking up once a week
we said to them if you recycle you'll go two weeks without having to put out the green container
it's really amazing
he got a little mulcher thing
we mow once a week
no more often then that
the clippings just get mulched up and then just lay on
it's amazing
that has cut down a lot in what we throw out
we don't catch it either mainly because my husband rarely has time to mow the yard
if it gets mowed i do it normally
i can't mow the yard with the grass catch on it
None
they say that you're wasting fertilizer if you're not catching your grass clippings
that's that much fertilizer you have to use because it does fertilize the lawn
i like it better doing it
i really think you're going to get hooked on plastics and paper
it's really not that much trouble
we keep a large plastic garbage bag in the garage
as soon as we use something we crush it up and put it out there
every few weeks we have a recycling center near wal-mart
they have the containers that you can just go over there and drop it in
it's really no trouble
i feel like at least we're doing something
i read a magazine article
they said something about how you don't realize even just your small contribution it seems like a small contribution
it's not
if everyone were to recycle just their newspapers they would save thousands and thousands of trees a day just from not throwing out your newspapers
when you read that you think maybe it is a big deal
what makes me sick is when they show the dump sites and how big they are
like in new york the barges that go up and down the river they don't have any place to put it
it just floats in the
it's ugh
that's really not necessary
i'm excited about the recycling program in plano
i can't wait for them to get it started
because it'll be that much easier for us
like i said now we have to take it over to wal-mart
it's convenient out here for them to do it
what do they pick up
they pick up the plastic the glass and the newspaper
they do
do you have to sort that
they will do the alum-
do you just put it all in
i guess they do the sorting
they'll do the aluminum cans too
we don't give them those
you're doing that now
we don't take the newspaper to begin with when neither one of us are home to read it
we don't have the newspapers but the plastic and the glass
at first when it first started it was hard
because you're just used to throwing things
he would get all upset
i'd say
now we think before we throw anything away
it's really funny
we really
it's just making it a habit that's hard
i know
the kids have even got to the point where if they see anybody going in the trash can with a can they're no don't do that
they go to the sink they rinse them out and they put them upside down they let them drain
i put them in a big bag anyway they dump the bag out
they crush them
that's their activity thing to go out there and crush
that's a lot of fun
that's great
i'm to hear you're
they have a deposit on all their bottles and cans
the air pollution isn't too bad in our area
we're very fortunate huh
they were doing an overview of los angeles from an area that was up higher
you literally could see the band of smog
i think it would be terrible to live in an area like that
unfortunately i think there are a lot of areas that are that bad
particularly in the areas where there are industries where they are burning a lot of coal
and oil more up north i guess
i think air isn't as bad it once was from the cars because we certainly have plenty of cars in our area
i know that's been the concern in europe
we have friends in germany and
now they're doing that
i guess it started in the last few years because they have found that in that particular part of the country that's the only pollution that's been there
they were losing a lot of trees and a lot of
i guess from something that the car was giving
i think in the emissions it gives off gases which combine up in the atmosphere and form a weak acid
after a period of time i think that accumulates in trees because they take it up through their roots as well as it landing on the leaves on surfaces
you've seen what it's done to buildings even where it's really bad
it was put on by the power companies about the various sources of energy and how much pollution there was
there wasn't from various kinds of energy
at that point in time one person that was a speaker brought up the topic of acid rain
it was kind of pooh-poohed
you're making a mountain out of a molehill kind of thing
it's turned out that that's been very true what he was forecasting about the accumulation of the pollutants in the air and the acid rain and what it would do to foliage
it's kind of interesting the change in perspective from when i took that course
i'm not afraid of nuclear having had that course because of how the nuclear that they use is not bomb quality
we're so strict with all our controls in the united states the chances of an accident are slight
it doesn't pollute the air at all
i don't know
they recycle the fuel
instead of
some people are really afraid to recycle the fuel because they're afraid it could become bomb quality
that's the only sensible thing to do is recycle and reuse the fuel and not store it down in the ground as far as i'm concerned where it could eventually perhaps there's some problem pollute the groundwater
i don't know what the answer is
the best answer of course would be solar or
we've got a problem on the line
i get that sometimes
solar of course would be the cleanest
i know it's
oddly enough i thought our part of the country was ideal
i don't know what the problem is
when we lived in houston we had a solar water heater
we had thought this part of the country would be ideal for
we have enough clouds that there are other areas that would be better suited
we have a tremendous amount of sunny days
it
it can help
that was a problem that they were still working on
it's still got a long way to go
it's just a possible solution in the future i think maybe to help in some ways
that's perfectly clean
it isn't not at all
you can't control it unless you gotten a huge electromagnetic field
that's not going to work at least not now
i think
i hope so
i do think
you've already mentioned several things i think just the change in attitude and the fact that more people are aware there is a problem and more people are interested in
we got to take care of it
for the future generations too
i've noticed young people are much more receptive to ideas about the environment and protecting the earth
if we can raise generations with those concerns we'll solve a lot of our problems
i know i was part of the me generation where people didn't care
it's whatever
recycle if it's a problem forget that
not throw the trash out the car window
leave it in the car and then throw it away
i've always done those kinds of things because i just didn't like messes
i'm pretty much for it
None
i think that i
one of the reasons that i'm against it is that i'm afraid of someone losing their life for wrongly
right another reason
one of the arguments that really
made me feel kind of strongly against it is that
i thought about it
i thought the loss that i would feel at losing my mother
i guess i can see it from several different perspectives
when i hear about things like what they've been reporting about in milwaukee to me i don't see any way of rehabilitating the guy
maybe there is i don't know
he's never going to be to me a functioning part of society
he's already been paroled whatever for child molestation
i don't know
i really have a hard time with that because he really sounds like a real sicko
for the things he's done
i guess it's put him in jail for the rest of his life capital punishment i guess
None
that's true because a lot of these conversations i've had on this program these telephone conversations have revolved around
justice
most of the time i hear myself saying
we don't have enough room left in the jails
people crime is still climbing
we need to have different punishments
i just am scared of capital punishment
i can underst-
you know there there is always that chance
i guess to some people it'd almost be better to die to them than to spend life in prison or whatever i don't know
that would be a situation where if somebody you know was gonna be
you really throw a lot on the courts hopefully that they won't do that for any situation really
when you find somebody just like that situation it was disgusting when i read about it today
when you find someone like that that you know is guilty he confessed already to killing eleven i guess i have a hard time feeling merciful toward him
None
trying to rehabilitate him too
None
nobody wants that
everybody would be just as scared to death
we've had a real problem here in texas with prison overcrowding
they've been releasing people left and right
they've committed murders and rapes and everything else
you just think where's the justice here
they're not even having to serve out what they should be serving
i just recently moved to massachusetts
that was one of the questions
i do know that they are notorious for paroling
when
having them reconvicted for violent crimes
i guess they said do you think it should be restricted
i guess if
violent crimes with just malicious intent
that's exactly i'm not saying i think capital punishment is the perfect solution in every case especially because there are some cases when you just don't know
i think there's a shadow of a doubt like with this guy in in milwaukee
it
they
just everything cannibalism and everything else
i really would have a hard time especially if i was on a jury not wanting him to be executed
because that's just awful
what is he going to do prison to the other people
i have a hunch that the other prisoners aren't going to be too happy with him anyway either
they
from what i hear about jail life is not any way to live
i don't know it's just
i saw on a human interest story or whatever today there was a woman who was just being paroled and trying to make it back
she said in prison you can get
it's just like being outside
people find ways around
there's a power structure that you have bow to
for some people who have been there for over and over and over it really isn't as bad
there's
it's not that bad of a life as it should be for the punishment aspect
the society is turned against punishment and more towards rehabilitation
especially like repeat offenders
it just appalls me that they even get a ten year sentence and be out in in two or three or four years
that's scary because i'm not sure i think we're paroling them without even knowing if they're going to be committing any more violent acts or not
what they're going to be doing when they get out
it's really scary
i me-
i don't know what the perfect solution to that is
i know that especially with violent crimes where you're nearly a hundred percent
for instance that's just
i could see capital punishment in a case like that and for other people too that do things like that
when
my wife and i are both participating in this survey
she picked up the phone
when she
she was
i see
she tried to enter her number
it wouldn't work
she said whew it's for you
i don't know
i struggle with it
i really think that in terms of this i think that it might not be
i'm su-
maybe if they could
if they had more money or more resources to
deep down i think every human
what do you feel is the major change that's been going on
they no longer feel it's no big deal to stay home and raise your family any more
it has no credibility any more
i think that's really sad because i think there's going to be a generation of kids that are going to grow up raised by somebody else
i'm a school teacher
i'm in charge of raising them
i can appreciate it
you don't
i'm still home with my last one
i wouldn't change a minute of it for anything
good for you
i can't help but think that eventually the pendulum's going to swing back the other way again
it's interesting because when i heard the topic i was thinking
one woman had four children
it's sad
her husband said she wasn't pulling her own weight in the family that's frightening it was almost from the audience participation it was almost a social issue people were siding with the husband saying you've got to go to work if you have these four children you've got to support them
nobody would give her credit for being home and raising them
i think too many people feel they need to live a more extravagant life-style than necessary to
i don't think the kids don't benefit from the bigger house and the fancier cars and this type of thing
i think that they would from the attention or whatever
i don't know
i see it as a major problem
i think it's going to have to swing back the other way because i think we're going to have an awful lot of kids who are going to have major problems from all this
as i said i teach school i'm trying to think
i have one mother that i know is home
she also has ten children
what grade do you teach
i've got a chi-
i know there aren't very many
do you ever see problems that you feel that the kids are left alone too much
i've got one child that stays with me every day until five because his mother doesn't come home until seven
he doesn't want to be home from three thirty until seven by himself
the school allows that
he stays with me i have a tendency to work late
i work until six he stays with me until five thirty and then goes home i have lots of kids because they know i'm there late i'm a slow mover to say the least
they'll come in and say can i stay with you because i don't want to go home to an empty house
that's frightening because the
when i said i'm raising them i am
we're talking about what the girl said in class
what's right because there's no mother at home it makes a difference
just the social values
i've just
do you feel it will swing back the other way
i don't know
do you feel there's just going to be a big push for more and more day care type situations
i have a feeling we're going to go more and more
i've got twenty-two year old male children
i listen to my daughter
she's going to work
she's going to buy her house
she's going to get her car
she's going to have her children
when they go on one salary will they be able to sustain what their life-style is
they're back to work
i agree with you
i was raised in a generation we didn't need all those things we lived without them
i've got a
that's get rid of the half of the government payroll
we really wouldn't feel it in our services
i don't know if you've ever been to washington d c
you've seen that which was on there and the offices
in light of these hearings we've all been sitting through the last two weeks we have very definitely decided that every department there is just overstaffed
the other thing is besides that i think two things that very definitely need looking at one is foreign aid
again being just a voter and a taxpayer working through our congressman i don't think there's too much that i'm going to be able to do about it
i believe in taking an active part in politics
one thing that really bothers me beyond cutting what they spend is that just really aggravates me when the big businesses do not end up paying taxes
the
the corporate industries just don't seem to not pay proportionally
i think that that would help a lot
seems like some rather large chunks of money could come from that direction
they don't seem to
the taft-rudman act is supposed to help that
this nonsense that's coming through now about lowering payments on social security and a few other things that bush has in mind in order to boost the economy because people have more money as it's ridiculous
not going to help
it's never helped my personal situation
i can't say it would help with theirs either
thank god we don't operate our budget
the way they operate theirs or we'd all be in dire trouble
that's
i guess it's sitting around so long that it's sort of like our mortgages
i guess why
it seems to be
i
it really does bother me when i think about leaving our children with this sort of a national problem that we can't seem to find an answer to it
i don't think it ever will really
maybe if they ever get to the point the biggest outlaid expense has always been wars or defense
if they were to take half of what they spend on that and put it on some economic intergovernmental or inter united states like programs that one really might
i believe in paying my share
i don't mind paying for some of these fringe benefits that people are entitled to
i just sometimes feel like i'm being used
again i don't think we'll be able to do anything about it
that's quite possible
i guess we have to keep plugging away a little bit
it will just
i don't know
i do
that's a shame
she's not the one going to washington
i think that will probably do it
it was nice talking to you
i used to like st elsewhere
that's
i'll just ignore it
i did like thirty something yes
how old are you
you're little bit younger than i am
i like it
we are so busy with all of our kids are in sports
i hardly ever watch t v
that's one that we watch
sunday nights we watch life goes on
that's a good show too
it was a
the new character on there did
it is twenty minutes to nine
my gosh
i'm twenty minutes to six here
let's see i like a lot of different shows
let's see i like murder she wrote
i never watched that ever in my entire life
matlock is another good one i watch
then during daytimes i like all my children
that's mine
that's the only one i watch whenever i
i'm sure i watched it for more than that probably
that was a long time ago
i used to watch it in high school and college when laura's mother got killed
i read the reason they killed her off was because they couldn't settle a contract
i said if they're going to do that to her i won't watch it
i do like all my children
i like it i don't know
i like the people on it i guess
i like it
tad's going to come back i bet do you think
i kind of wish that nina would come back because the story
daisy pops in once in a while
i forgot about nina and cliff right
he is
he's out for good
that's how they left the show but not in real life
she's happily married
that's the reason she left the show
i watch it maybe twice a month
i don't watch it everyday like i did when i had babies
i watch
i play lots of tennis
i'm gone a lot
i don't get to watch
no kidding
i used to be like that
don't they have a new chick on there instead of what's her name
there's jan hooks from saturday night life
None
yeah
i just know which one she is
i don't
jan hooks has taken charlene's part
i never watch that one either
i really don't watch a whole lot of t v just on sunday nights
my whole family's home because i don't allow the kids out on sunday night because they've got to go to bed and go to school the next day
we sit around and eat popcorn
then we watch america's funniest home videos
murder she wrote comes on opposite of that
you don't watch that one instead of
i pick nights pretty much so on t v that i watch different networks
beverly hills nine oh two one oh i watch it religiously
we're discussing the capital punishment i believe
i suppose i should have
i am pro capital punishment except that i don't like the way it's done
i guess i hate to see anyone die i guess these people that go around and kill children and women and everything else without any remorse i don't think they deserve to live and be supported by us the rest of their lives
i agree
capital punishment is necessary in many cases
the
it's not a deterrent or our jails would not be so full
i think it needs to be something a throwback to where they did a public execution where it's visible
something not gruesome
something more where people know that it was a deterrent and it was equal for all people
it was going to happen to you
no loopholes
even that i don't really know if that would help
i think a lot of these people do it mainly because of of t v
the double reason they see it being done on t v and also the fact of notoriety
they become well known
they are almost like a big star
they know that their chances of actually receiving the death penalty are minimal
that's a reward for a heinous crime rather than having them pay the penalty which is forfeiture of their life
in complete
i think if they went according to the bible where it does say
you take a life you give yours
that's for sure
there's exceptions to the rule
if it's an accidental taking then you look at that
most of these people that down right go right and do it out of pure pleasure i don't like to see that
it is a deterrent in the sense that that person will never do it again
not if he's killed he can't
that's correct
if he indeed receives the death penalty and it is executed
the chances are not great that that will happen
there's a greater chance that he'll be back out on the streets in twelve years
i guess i'm also looking at beyond even that
i guess i been thinking about it
i don't have a definite opinion
repeat crimes maybe not the more mild ones but more severe ones especially on armed robbery and stuff where they been taking from elderly people
i guess you've got to look at something like that
do they deserve to remain on this earth too
you know that as soon as you let them out on the streets they are going to do this
unfortunately the way our system of jurisprudence is set up you only receive the death penalty for capital crimes
of course of battery or assault or that is not a capital crime
you wouldn't be able to under our system
china and a few other countries have a little different view of that
you get caught with dope there and you die period
there is no appeals
i don't know what to do about the federal budget
there certainly have been ideas surfaced recently matter of fact repeatedly by many people
i sort of wondered what thoughts you had on that area
the first one is we need people in there that understand numbers the numbers that are being thrown around when we're talking in trillions of dollars
which is an astronomical sum
the people that are talking this numbers have no concept of what that number means
are you talking about the elected people
are you talking about others
our senate and congress and people that deal everyday and what's going to be done with those monies and don't really understand what that is or how a budget even works
we need to elect people that are more
if
let's make them have a degree in economics
you would trust the decision making economists
people that understand the value of a dollar
wh-
in
the lobbyists
needs them to be eliminated
from congress
they make a decision based on constituency instead of a decision based on what they really believe
they tack on this pork bellies and do things that are good for their area to pass something that is not good for the country
you would favor a law which said there could not be lobbyists
right now lobbyists require to register you'd just say
i definitely would
make them all
i think that any company or anything that wants to contribute to a fund should be able to do that and be registered with what they ever contribute
they should not have a one-on-one relationship with the people making the decisions that affect them
that's a conflict of interest as far as i'm concerned
when you are talking again billions and trillions of dollars you're jeopardizing the future of the country for today
you talk about jeopardizing the future
i think to bring it in line you are going to have to have a generation that's going to really bite the bullet to bring it in line
i forget the figures on the interest rate
it's something like hundreds of thousands of dollars a second in interest
we buy from intimate international banking
i really feel that is part of the problem that we've let things get so out of control that we don't want to put the brakes on them
what practical steps could one take
by having a budget that is reasonable
everybody will say that he is for that
of course
how will you
add on to it
if you make forty million dollars then you're going to pay four million
that's it
that's it
that's
i agree with that
is it your expectation that that would raise the total revenues collected or lower them or what
what's your favorite baseball team rita
i suppose i'm supposed to say the rangers right
that isn't a true false or right or wrong test here
i would to say the rangers
unfortunately they're not
my favorite team was the white sox
not a cubbies fan
my dad was
i turned out to be a white sox fan
that's all right
i'll tell you
i just moved down from south dakota in july
in south dakota the minnesota twins are the closest professional sports team to where i was living everybody was a twins fan
i didn't have much interest in the twins
it was kind of pathetic
one of them broadcast every twins game live
the other one was country
there's was twins there or skip williams
i was routing for the twins myself because a couple of ranger players that i had watched when we first moved here went to minnesota
we used to tease my son
i used to have a bet going about some of the players that had moved from here to minnesota
it certainly was an exciting series anyway
can we predict
i would like to assume that they're going to do better this coming year
when we moved down i was able to go to my first baseball game and thought this is great this is incredible
i became a rangers fan
i adopted the rangers
rather they adopted me i guess it was just exciting
they hit the long ball
it looks like wow they really hit that ball
when you go to the ball park it's really not all that far
it's so much more exciting watching a ball come at you
isn't it though
i think going to the ball park just really makes it because then you watch it on t v you feel like you're more a part of it too
i'm a great sports enthusiast
i love baseball teams
he was put in the restaurant hall of fame
he says he's coming back
he doesn't know how many years to pitch
he said he's been saying one more and it's been two and three might be two and three more
that's right he's still doing great still doing excellent
he said i get a kick out of it
he's such a nice man
didn't he just sign a twelve year contract with the rangers
when he quits at being active he will go into managing and being a coach i'm sure
he certainly is a good example for the kids
you like to have someone like that you could point to say see what a fine man that he is
some of the
ivan rodriguez wasn't even born when nolan ryan started pitching
it's just incredible to think that there are players who are the sons of ball players that used to play against nolan or with nolan
now their sons are
he's been a legend for so many years
i don't know
had you moved here yet when he did the exhibition at u t with his son
he pitched for an exhibition game for the rangers
was it nolan against ryan against ryan
that is neat
his son pitched for u t only ryan didn't want too much publicity on it because he didn't want his son getting too nervous about this whole thing
a game is a game
the rangers really knocked the socks off of them which you would expect anyway
nolan i think took himself out after a couple of innings or something of the game
how do you feel about capital punishment
you did
i was on the jury
the topic was something about juries
i am just hitting it right
how do i feel about it
i don't know
i guess it is right in certain cases
the one i was just on i don't
i don't know what was decided
what i found out
once i was declared an alternate and i was dismissed we met with the judge the two alternates did
i remember hearing about it
he was involved in another capital murder the very next month
he was caught just
they drove up
the police drove up just as he fired the gun and killed the guy
he was caught
it's interesting because the county i live in
i'm pretty far north of dallas
county i live in the past ten years only had two capital murders
last year there were six
this guy is indicted on three of them
you have to wonder
the cases like that they should
if he's going to be drastic somebody has to be drastic back
although it's not really revenge because it doesn't mean anything to him
he has no concept of what he has done
he just
from what i can tell i didn't talk to the guy or anything
he doesn't seem to have any regard for anybody's life including his own
it's kind of strange that
no remorse whatsoever
i guess in cases like where the guy would obviously go out and do it again you've got to do something
it's funny because when they interview you before you go on the jury for capital murder i was interviewed by four attorneys for about five hours
at the time when the guy kept saying could you ever convict someone
do you think you'd ever know beyond a doubt
i said i can't imagine
i can't imagine you ever making me that sure of something
they really did
it was really amazing
i guess if the police came out and saw him fire the gun
that was a subsequent case that we didn't know about
this particular case they had a complete confession from the guy with a lot of things that the police hadn't released
no one else would have known
it was really pretty interesting
they can i think in the punishment phase but not in the guilt or innocence because he hasn't been found guilty of it
of that crime he was found guilty of anoth-
they pushing the death penalty
in texas there is a couple of questions you have to ask in the punishment phase
for example was the guy provoked and was the response reasonable given the provocation
there is a number of questions
just depending on whether you say yes or no you can give him capital punishment
if you're up to the point where if he still qualifies for capital punishment
there is a lot of outs
the only result is otherwise he gets life in prison
i'm really kind of against life in prison anyway because it costs so dog gone much
to me you take away a person's freedom you've taken away most of their life
if you're going to put him in prison for life with no chance for parole
you have to look at reality
i think normally they may get out
what is it worth
i don't know whether i'd stay in prison or not
you said you're from mississippi
do they have the death penalty there
they've had a number of cases here
not a whole lot
jackson i heard just the other day had their sixty-first murder this year
it was like last year they had forty-nine
that's going up
i visited the prison up here at parchman
i've been
they'll let you look down the hall
it's kind of a weird feeling
i've been they took us around on a tour
i guess just going up there and seeing the surroundings and stuff the people up there
let's see
i'd like to have a corvette
i'm engaged to get married
i'll more likely get a car for economic reasons
to drive back and forth to work is all i'll need a car for pretty much
we have a truck
probably a economic size car or
i drive out of town a lot of the weekends i would like my next car to have good gas mileage
same here
a nice car american made
a nice car not too expensive
i couldn't afford a brand new lamborghini
while we're talking
while we're talking my next car i'd like to be sporty and nice
it's expensive
insurance is really high for that too
i know
something that's not too sporty because of insurance then
is it real high up there
i'm not sure really how much i pay
my mom's helping me out because i'm in college
i just give her the money
that insurance is high dollars
the more expensive the car the higher it is
in kenosha
it just is
in wisconsin they drive them little four wheelers or four wheel drive
do you all need four wheel drives up there because of snow and everything
we have a jeep with four wheel drive because of the snow you mean
we usually only get once a year or so
kind of strange to you all
don't tell me that
how cold is it there
it's been warm
that's really warm
it's supposed to rain tomorrow
it was really bad
it all melted within the week
now there is no snow
what is your dream car
i haven't really thought about it
i don't know the names and stuff
if i were to go to a car lot and look at them
for a car
if it was just an average middle class car
if i were to get a sports car maybe white or red
what kind of car do you drive right now
it's a sky hawk buick
like eighty-two thousand miles
i hope it does though
i like smaller cars
i'm sure
i could see why
you been down here before
it's different i bet
i remember swimming on easter day
it was really cold up here
came back with a little tan
that was nice
it's
i guess
which one have you got right now
i
i got a leading edge
i got a american one and had a i b m one
i've got an omega
i've got a generic three eighty or four eighty-six machine
upgraded it and put things in there and dibbled and dabbled
now it's a fast machine
i'm a contract programmer
business programs
i've done business programming scientific applications like petroleum science stuff and
test equipment
i did one that was the demonstration of a touch screen for a company that sells touch screens
and make it look like things like attack simulators and all sorts of little things you'd want to put your finger on the screen for
matter of fact i guess you get a lot of graphics in there i imagine
unfortunately the little portable p c that was plugged on the back was only a seven and a half megahertz eighty-six
it's slow
that will
i do programming for c n c turret presses and cat cam system type things
really need a faster system
i got a new line that i sell metal fabricating equipment and cat cam systems and tooling et cetera
i know a guy that upgrades for a reasonable cost
my notebook is somewhere around here
he's up in
that works
as they go to the next one i just keep the
here it is
where are they at
do you know where custer is
he's south of renner on custer
there is a little bitty mall that looks kind of like strip kind of center
there is a mobil and all that kind of s- on that one corner
it's just south of there
kind of little guy in there
i traded my three eighty-six for the four eighty-six for about six hundred
that's a good deal
he
he does a good job
he guarantees everything he sells
there is a lot
i don't know where those guys are at these days
they're up there in that mall just below campbell
or that strip center
it's like wow
boy that thing screams now
i thought was funny that they kept pushing the three eighty-six s x even though the price difference is about ten dollars
when it comes on the manufacturing floor it's about ten bucks
our most recent series of projects i guess inside was we remodeled a bathroom recently
how did it go
it went pretty well other than the fact that we encountered some problems that you run across in older homes with plumbing which one thing led to another
eventually we ended up replacing all the pipes from the sink clear back to the main drain
like starting over i guess
it started out as a sunday project by the next sunday
boy that sounds like
course i don't know
you've got an older house
that's the thing that surprised me because once i got into the plumbing everything in there was copper
it was all soldered
is that right
that's what drove me bananas because i'm going to the hardware store saying give me plastic pipe and cement to fit them together
nothing wanted to go
it was like i had to go all the way back to the main drain and start all over
just start at square one
if you do it wrong
i was very fortunate in the fact that when i made the installation of the sink and everything bolted up and we turned the water on nothing leaked
i just said that's marvelous
i expected something to leak left a fitting loose or didn't use teflon tape on one of them or something like that
it all came together
i felt pretty fortunate about that
all worked out all right
probably the last thing i did was paint and wallpaper kids room i learned to
this must have not been a very good quality because it just hasn't stood up very well
it was a latex paint
it was flat i wonder if maybe i should have used a gloss
they say you ought to use your gloss mainly in your kitchens and things like that
i think maybe
it is a latex paint
it just kind of is
you're supposed to be able to wash it
it's kind of got just kind of a worn look to it
did you require more than one can of paint
it's a small room
i think it only took one can
we did
you do mix the color as far as you start with white
they add the color
you only had one can of paint that you did the entire room with
i wall papered a couple of walls
that was the first time i've ever wallpapered
the dye lots must have been a little bit different from
repeating patterns is what you have to check for when you buy your paper
i didn't think about that
a lot is wasted
you know how
i didn't even think to look for that
the
one of them was just a different color pink is what it ended up being
did you start at the edge
then you had to cut around the closet and cut around a window
i'll start with a plumb line
start right there
and start in the middle of the wall and go from there and go all the way around the room
what's the
you
i have two boys twelve and sixteen
i have three
they're five and three and nineteen months
we kind of got different ball game
you of course spend less time with them when they get older
it's of course still really important
i work two nights a week at a
i'm a librarian i work two nights a week at the senior high school library
they keep it open for kids to do their work the school district hires an aide to work for me
my son is my aide
that's nice
some nights it's just real quiet
i have sort of a captive audience
i really do spend probably more time with him than most
of course i'm away from my other son those hours too
his dad's at home pretty much that time
that kind of gives him time with his dad then
it is hard once they get that age
their friends are the most important thing there is
they want to be able to spend
i've even noticed that with my five year old she started kindergarten this year
every day that she's not at school she thinks we need to have someone over and play
i think i find myself getting my little projects going and not taking the time that i should
i'm more worried about
i need to remind myself to slow down
it'll still be there tomorrow
that's kind of hard to do
if you're kind of a person that likes things organized or neat then i think it is hard
i think one of the nice things about holidays is that it does give you the opportunity to spend more time with family
we often go to illinois for christmas
we're not this year
it's just really nice because we can do the things you want to do
you can do more than when you travel
that's an opportunity to get out the games
we usually do that
my kids even have already gotten out
of course
my twelve year old got out the legos which of course he hasn't touched since last summer every now and then he's got a lot of those hard kind
he wants to be an engineer
he still likes all that kind of building stuff
we have the train
we haven't had that lego train together for years
he sat down
i told him i really wanted him to build the train
we would put it under the tree and that i would keep it together
every year i'd have the lego train under the tree
he worked on that for the longest time ever since school
then his sixteen year old brother started helping too
these are kind of things during the normal rat race those kinds of things never happen
i think that's a lot of the breakdown of the communication the communication that would take place in a family
there's always a few people in the family that when they stare at it
you can't communicate while you're doing that right
whereas i'm the type of person i could not sit
be very hard for me to sit down and watch a program all the way through without doing something
i don't watch very much of it at all to the extent that sometimes i feel almost embarrassed at work and stuff like that yeah
i
how can you watch that
what do you think about it
drug testing procedures would have to be refined
i didn't realize that
there have been people who have been turned down for jobs because there was a drug showed up in their test
they didn't know for sure what it was
it was a drug
they got turned down
turns out it was a prescription or people getting somebody else's blood test
same sort of problem that happens sometimes is some of these aids tests and such
i don't remember what they call it sort of like a positive negatives or some kind of word they use when you get a positive indication of drugs
there weren't really any there
every now and then there's an error
people are really upset about that when it comes to their rights and their rights being violated
i work here at texas instruments
let me think do we everyone coming in
everyone coming in goes through the drug
they talk about it as better for the country and better for the working conditions
if they test for drugs
i can't even remember if we do random sampling anymore
i don't know if once your in they continue to do it
i guess you're always on
i not very long ago worked for wal-mart about a year and a half ago they instituted
it's not a random through the s-
i think the big problem though is they send these
your big beef with it is the
it's a good idea
like you said the drug testing procedures need to be defined a little better
i tend to agree with you david
my brother used to work for wal-mart
i don't know if he still does or what because i don't know if sam's is actually part of it
good company
you all have some
you have a little taken out of your check each payday to put
not portfolio just against wal-mart stock
you can build a pretty fair amount of stock after a while
that's good deal
how long were we s-
you're supposed to get five minutes
think what else i can say about that
do you have any idea
you were tested for drugs as as you got into t i
everyone coming in goes through the drug test
were you asked to wait before starting to work until the drug test came through
let me think about that
it was after i had already been hired
seems to me i remember that i was hired came in and went through some orientation
i thought i
i can't remember
it's hard for me to remember where i was when all that happened
i guess just like other companies other friends i've been hearing about that have been moving around
it's before
i'm sure that happened to me too
what about
they just instituted it there at wal-mart
they it was after i was already working there
they weren't testing any of those who were already working
you heard the question
what do you like to do for yourself in car automobile repairs
i'll tell you i used to do a lot more repairs when cars were easy to work on than i do now
i do the easy stuff now
what some people would consider a little more difficult i'll change spark plugs
i'll change points and do air filters that kind of stuff
i can't do as much as i used to
i used to do a whole lot more but not any more
are you so busy you don't have time to do it
that's part of it yeah
being a female and being alone i don't do anything but put gasoline
have you had any major repairs recently
on this car i've got now no
i had a van before
it was only two years old
it had transmission go out on it
fortunately that was covered under the warranty
you should feel very fortunate
i had to have a transmission replaced in an eighty-six automobile i'll declare that's an expensive
it just
i have a very comfortable car i have a health problem that i need a large comfortable car
i have a new transmission
i'm sure that any of them would have charged me almost the same amount
it hurts real bad
i see
i had
these people were recommended by a neighbor that's the only thing
i see
that means i have to depend on trustworthy friends that's
it's fixed
i pray that i get my thirteen hundred dollars out of it
it's going to run for a while yet
i know it
i work for t i
i work in the networking area
i have just retired from the southwest medical center
where there are a lot of people down there that could help me with my car
they're all too busy
that's find someone and pay them to do it
i certainly hope you have a nice new year
i'm planning on it
it can't be any worse than last year
it could be
i don't much think so
we're starting out a new one
let's make it a good one
i enjoyed the conversation
thank you
None
usually the reason i will turn it on is to hear the news
i don't think of that every day even
i think i get most of my current events
i get them from everywhere
i work at a
there's a
i often drop in on a break and read it
i keep the radio on quite a bit when i'm home
i figure if there's big news i'll hear it from my husband when he gets home or
someone else
i also
we have a news
we get the newspaper and magazines anything
i'm
i get
i'm really up on current affairs
i get the news and everything
i'm not getting an-
i'm not getting any news magazines as i said i do
it's easy to keep up on current event- especially when you get a paper every day
i don't know
i
i don't know what are we supposed to compare it to
None
i
they're supposedly covering everything that happens
i do feel a little bit like
being from california and wanting to hear
i don't ever hear it in the news here
sometimes it's such a
the tremors are so slight that they don't even bother putting it in the paper
most of the times i find that even if they do have tremors out there there'll be a small article in the paper about it
i sometimes feel like the dallas paper and the dallas news the top headlines are always a murder
that's because there's a high crime rate
that's been like that since the first newspaper
i don't know
i guess i'm satisfied
i don't
what basis of comparison do we have really
we don't get a
we can get news
there's even the c n n channel where we can get world news twenty-four hours a day
it's all so negative
we have to keep talking i guess
it's just whenever we're
is it really
i don't
i guess we're supposed to wait
one
was it last week we were supposed to talk about gardening
i mixed it made the call
it happened to be my friend who lives
it was really
we don't really do any gardening
that took like a minute we just talked about whatever
some topics
really now this topic this is
if they're satisfied
that's about it really
i guess i can just say it bothers me that i hear a lot on the news that
it seems like some things are sensationalized or some things are
you'll hear one report
you'll hear that they didn't
what are your favorite shows
i like watching colombo and matlock and really
that was pretty good
i like northern exposure and home improvement
i haven't seen either of those
i also like to watch star trek
it's on so late here that i don't always get to see it
they're already out with number six by now
i haven't seen any of the movies yet
you haven't seen any of them
they're good
they're getting rid of the old cast for the movies though
is there one you prefer better the older one or the newer one
i like the older ones because at that time they were really futuristic
i guess the newer ones are real
i like both of them
he almost hates the new ones
he thinks the newer ones is like a soap opera and the other one isn't or something
i think
it's
that's true
you learn more about the characters and stuff
that's the way all shows are now
let's see
i like to watch colombo because it's like a mystery thing
colombo is way tricky
did you see the one
is there a series on
there's one on
we see it thursdays at seven
it was
this last time it was about this movie director
that was a rerun
i guess i nev-
i wondered if that's i don't know if that's the movie of the week or what
it seems like there's only about four or five different ones
they keep showing them over and over
i guess i haven't seen it before
he had that gal killed
there's never anything good on saturdays though
star trek's on at five
i'm never home
there's something i watch on saturdays
i can't remember what it is
i used to watch twin peaks
they'll say so and so from twin peaks or something
it was a different type of show
did they end the whole series
they only did it for i think two years
it's all over now
another show i like to watch is mash
how's your products been
i really haven't had too many problems
seems to me that everything that i buy goes bad just after the warranty runs out
i really don't have any recourse
i had to call and have them all repaired and that
you didn't get anything
even all the warranties were out
the warranty on the refrigerator
the ice maker itself passed it's three years
it was three years and two months
we had to buy all those too
watch out
the only thing i've had problems with is
i buy a lot of wood working equipment through the mail i bought this paint stripper where they advertise
when you get the product it ends up being toxic and all these warnings
that's about the only thing i've had gone wrong
i just
the ice maker had to have a new pump
the microwave had to have some kind of something i can't even pronounce
they
it was almost three hundred dollars for all three of them
they all went out at the same time
within two days of each other
two days
None
i think even if i had kept the warranty the service agreements were with the companies that manufactured
still they were through that retailer
i don't know if i could have taken it to another retailer or not
i didn't have to worry about all that because they weren't under warranty
it was a call to the local appliance dealer who came out and fixed them all
the only other things that i've ever had trouble with
the other two weren't
i just
other than that t v and things like that i haven't ever had any trouble with
i'm in the manufacturing
make automotive air bags the safety air bags
i thin-
it's changed a lot with the manufacturing environment
our testing is pretty thorough
do you test each individual one do you just test
if you've got ten you test one
by the test results of the one you assume that the other nine are okay
the tests that
we test every one electrically
i think they test four or five a day actually exploding the air bags we do test during the assembly product after we assemble each part of the inflator or what explodes the bag we check to make sure it's there after we install it
each assembly process has an inspection right after it's done
we do electrical tests on them during the process
that's something i've never had to use
i've never been involved in an automobile accident
luckily that's a product that i haven't had to test
i think it's a great idea
they do all the testing that we have to do through the government
i'm sure they want to be thorough before they
even
i don't mind spending the extra money on the car even if they pass the cost onto the consumer because it just seems like a real worthwhile thing
jackie on taxes i guess i would have to say that my opinion is that i do think american's are paying too much in taxes
what's your feeling about that
where you live do you have a state income tax and a sales tax both
in new hampshire we have no what we call broad base taxes
we tax business eight percent
we have what we call the five b s for our taxes booze butts cigarettes beds hotel room tax bellies a meal tax and bets gambling
we do have a very low tax rate
combined with the federal income tax i think that american's generally do pay too much in taxes
i agree
i think it's about the time of the year when you just start getting
if you do get money back from
i'm still a student i only work part time
i get a check back
that's nice
from taxes
nice to get a refund
do you think that for whatever taxes we do pay that we are getting value for it
my opinion of taxes is that we just send money to washington or to the state
they say they are going to send some back
it's like one arm giving the other a transfusion
it really
i should say one arm giving another arm a transfusion through a leaky tube because there's an old saying in amongst taxes and politicians that there's a fly paper effect
that is that money tends to stick where it lands first
when you send it to washington or send it to your state capitol a lot of it stays there and not that much comes back to you
there's plans there
now that they are voting and people getting into drug and that stuff
None
they try to raise taxes more
i don't what happens with
taxes get raise
i don't know
i'm not really into politics i don't really understand it it's just
it does seem that the more taxes that are raised the more the politicians spend
it's almost like they will spend as much as they're allowed to collect
there is an interesting proposal that's been going around now for a few years of having a flat tax ten percent or thirteen percent
you would take your income tax
you would take you total salary those who made under a certain amount wouldn't owe any taxes
there would be a set amount for however many dependent you have
you would just pay a flat tax no exemptions no deductions or anything else after you figure up who's in your family
that would eliminate a lot of the bureaucracy in the i r s
it would eliminate all these loop holes that the fat cats get away with
i'd like to see something like that
it would put a lot of the tax attorneys our of business
i am sure they will fight it tooth and nail
i really think a flat tax would be a lot fairer for all americans
it doesn't seem right that somebody that makes twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars pays four or five thousand dollars in taxes while somebody that makes two hundred and fifty thousand dollars might pay nothing in taxes
i think your taxes in wisconsin are pretty high if i am not mistaken aren't they for your state
do you know what your state income tax rate is
no i have no idea
you just pay it
you're like my daughter who is in college down in massachusetts
she works as a waitress
she is attending college full time also she sends her taxes to me
i figure them up
usually in the mornings i am getting ready to either go to work
n b c
i really don't have much time to read the newspapers and stuff i get a lot of stuff through the grapevine which really isn't too great sometimes
i usually tend to just rely on t v again just through the grapevine just to know what today's stories are
i usually go out an buy a newspaper if i'm interested in any particular one
do you think that t v is pretty accurate
sometimes do you think it gets pretty commercialized
what i really don't like about t v especially local news as compared to national news is just it seems like everything is very spoon feed
it's more like the news shows is now an entertainment show like a sitcom or like the news because they would always have the wonderful investigative reports is you're kids bus driver smoking crack
on the way to school
they mainly go with popular topics just not basic news
also i have the observation with the press that any stories that i had any first hand knowledge of that i see in the press which only happened ten times in my life first thing for anything that actually had more than just a blurb about it the press has managed to just mess up some aspect of the story it's something wrong
looks like they're going more for ratings
i think
i am from a small town too here in texas that local news is really who grew the biggest tomato
in dallas i don't know if you heard about the killing where the guy drove into luby's
the story was
was that he started shooting people in this cafeteria or something
the news covered it hours after it happened
they were taping people who were crying who
like three days later this local news station was using as as their promo to promote themselves
i just thought that's kind of cold
channel x gives you the best coverage
we were on the scene with our team players
it was just
they were showing these dead people they were showing people crying just taking advantage of
they are trying to get the most emotional response for
just the play on people's emotions
somewhere it's lost a lot of the quality that they use to have like in walter cronkite that if everything
i've pretty much stopped watching local news totally
i found it very one sided
it just seemed to lack any sort of debate
not saying that we actually should have been there or shouldn't have been there
it just seemed like
they kept just showing how great we were doing
it never really showed the damage that really happened that's a lot of times the news coverage showed all the guys who didn't get hurt coming home and all the big parties they kind of
if they were going to show that why didn't they show the guys who got really hurt and everything
i really think that in the involvement that the press states the military basically sets the press
think about taxes
i think they're a necessary evil
i wish the government would operate on the same premise that businesses operate on
that is you don't spend more than you bring in
i think that the general idea is to spend during a time of recession for the deficit spending to help pick up the economy
they're running under the assump-
the way they're running it now they're running it under a deficit spending while we're not under a recession
there's never any surplus coming in to counter the deficit that we're running
that's kind of a basic thing of economics i guess
roads are very expensive commodity and so is utilities they supply and police and fire department
they need to make a living
then again it's hard to justify with all the wastefulness of money that the government spends on all levels of government including municipalities as well as state and federal governments
i'm a student right now
i don't make a whole lot of money
i kind of don't pay a proportionate amount of taxes i guess compared to what i get because all my education is state sponsored
my education all up through high school and stuff
i guess i'm kind of in debt i suppose because i don't been paying taxes all that long
my parents i guess however have contributed to that for the education side of it and everything
i usually end up getting money back
you're very fortunate
we pay in a substantial amount
we do think that sometimes we have a reverse of a regressive tax a progressive tax
progressive tax i think does not give people incentive to make more money
what i mean by that the more income you make the more tax you pay
that percentage ought to be an equitable amount
last year when they passed the tax laws for the nineteen ninety ninety-one whatever nineteen ninety-one i added up all the taxes that we were going to pay on all these different specific luxury items and travel expenses and everything else
i totaled them all up
basically we were going to be paying seventy or eighty percent tax
that was the assumption that you spent that same dollar for every item on there even though there's taxes on different things
there's a lot of taxes you pay that you're not even aware of that you're paying
there's a lot of hidden taxes
you pay gasoline taxes every time you pump something into your tank
the income tax is a lot more visible portion of the taxes you pay i guess
you probably pay more percentage wise in other taxes
one of the democratic candidates had a proposal for doing away with all the tax codes they have now and implementing i think a flat percentage something like that
if you implemented a flat percentage it would encourage people to make more money
what people need to understand in my opinion is that businesses create jobs and jobs create income and income pays taxes
if they penalize businesses business people are smart enough to say here's my break point i'm not going to work any harder and make any more or create any more jobs
that's because until eight
up until eighty-five or something was the
None
i don't think i'm in the majority in texas
i wouldn't say that
when i was younger i thought it was
maybe slowly changing my opinion
i'm beginning to believe this is less civilized society than i thought
she has very black and white
there's no gray in her opinions
she probably would agree more with you
i don't know
i've never had a punishment or a crime like a murder touch my immediate family i still feel very strongly that capital punishment is a good way to punish especially criminals who seem to have absolutely no remorse for what they've done
we see that more and more
in our state right now there's a fourteen year old boy who raped and then killed a seven year old girl that's fourteen years old
i certainly don't advocate turning people like that loose
i'm not sure executing them does anymore than keeping them in jail
that's a factor
i work and i pay my taxes
i lived out in texas for a little while
that's a pretty heavy state compared to georgia
you guys are a lot more for to each his own even than we are in georgia
even in georgia that's the attitude for the most part
when i've got to work to pay my dues and your dues
i think it's relatively unimportant compared to what's the most effective way of
i guess i would like
the european countries certainly none of them have capital punishment
they don't have a crime problem either
i don't believe they do in germany or italy either
they don't have the crime problems we do
i guess what worries me about capital punishment is when i see people enthusiastic about it and sort of bloodthirsty i think it brings out the worst in the people who do the punishing
that bothers me
i'd hate to be the person to pull the switch
i would never in a million years want that job i do believe it's necessary
on the one hand i guess i admire the person who has the guts to do it because i couldn't stand behind a gun and shoot somebody for nothing
i couldn't pull the switch
i wha-
the other thing that bothers me is when it becomes a political issue because i don't really think it's a very important aspect of fighting crime or law and order or anything else
i think it just becomes a
i would like for it to be settled once for all and get in the background while the more important issues get discussed
now i'm not so sure of that
i wouldn't vote against somebody just because it was for capital punishment and nor the other way around
what's making you become more convinced that it might be a good way of punishing
i guess i'm
i'm beginning to believe that some people are simply not rehabilitatable and that
costs and other factors justify executing people
maybe it's more a symbolic gesture
i've also never been a victim although i have two friends whose wives were murdered
what do you drive now
i have a ford pickup
the family car is a dodge caravan
we have three kids and they're under thirteen
they sort of fit our requirement
i have one of those pickups with a seat in the back
they just fit in there
right now i can throw them all in the back when we have room
since i do a lot of projects i throw things in the back
i kind of like having a pickup truck
i think of it
i don't care about comfort
i'm pretty happy
i wanted a truck that i wanted something that i could throw people in the back too
i got a four runner
i wouldn't hesitate to get another one
i never buy new
i wouldn't hesitate to get another used truck
i don't need to pay for the glitz
i'll let somebody else have the showroom shine
i'll pay for the rest of it
the van we're sor-
we might go again on a van
we could probably do with something just a little bit larger than a compact in a sedan next time
we'll have to face it in a couple of years
i guess we had a small toyota wagon
it certainly had that
i got one of those toyota four runners it pretty much does everything i need it to
it'll tow three thousand pounds
i can tow everything
it's real reliable
i've had it for almost four years now
up until say two weeks ago it had never had anything
of course two weeks ago
it blew a head gasket
i caught it real early
at how many miles
ninety-seven thousand
it's not real early
i smelled the coolant
saw where it was coming from
that was
that was it
i have that
i have a kawasaki motorcycle
which is usually my preferred mode of transportation if i can take it and it's not raining
it's a
i have one colleague that commutes to work on one when it's not raining
he's a
i don't think it's much of a sport for him i guess
i bet you he really enjoys riding it
yo-
i go out twice a week on the bike
the only thing i think i might get not necessarily a new car but another car
i would consider going to a normal pickup rather than a covered pickup like the one i've got just because there's a lot of times i wished i had just an open bed to throw stuff in
i'm sure that that's very
you got one
that's really convenient to be able to throw that sort of stuff in the back
if i only had some place that i could store the camper top i would have it off most of the time
i really leave it on there just just to have it out of the way because you put it on the ground it gets dirty
they're solid
trucks are built
even though the little jap trucks are good there too
so are the
i think the fords tend to last a little longer
i kind of like mine
mine's a ford
a friend of mine just bought a year ago it's a really nice truck
i don't like dodges at all
one of the dodges they have out now has the cummins turbo diesel on it
i heard about that
it's beautiful
that thing will last forever
that's a serious truck
that thing's
i know a contractor who just got one of those
that's about the extent of it
when
i really am concerned that so many of these child care places are coming under investigation for child molestation
i'm saying to myself you dump your little turnip off to this child care place
they don't pay very much
why would they be interested in your little turnip unless one of the motivations in the hidden agenda is that's somebody to molest
that's a terrible kind of thing
i don't think my children have ever been subject to that
my wife didn't work
we really didn't have that much exposure to it
i am a working mother
my children since they were very young
i've had various different alternatives child care arrangements
like most working mothers
i personally feel in our particular situation i'm a much better mother when i work out of the home
my kids i think are very secure well raised children
i e-
it is a problem
as you pointed out i think the real problem is the low pay child facilities
that is sometimes what some women who have to work that is all they can afford
when our children were very young we had a live in paid baby-sitter that was wonderful
as they got older they went to i preferred to call them schools
they were really all day preschools
they were wonderful
i think they got exposed to a lot of neat things
that's interesting
we really truly did pay a fortune
we were paying
my god
you must have just one hero ace professional job to support something like that
yeah
i'm a physician as is my husband
i felt very good about working
i'm a pediatrician
i think there are some wonderful child care opportunities out there for children
we all know the kind of things that you're supposed to look for i think
not all of us
what the kind of things you're supposed to look for
i think it's real important that you have a place that first of all parents have a lot of input into and that they're always welcome and that they have a lot of activities where parents come in during the day and that at any time you can drop in
we had a really wonderful arrangement
i'm with the university they had a wonderful program that started at age three
it was about a block away from the hospital where i work
many times at lunchtime i would go over and visit the children and eat with them and see what they were doing
they had wonderful
they had a four to one teacher student ratio
that sort of an
most of the teachers had degrees
it was incredible
it was good
it
they were in special programs
each one was a little over two hundred a week
in addition i paid a little bit extra
the kids were
they really had some great opportunities
tha- what you were alluding to earlier is women who work for minimal wage and really feel they have to put their children
sometimes they do put them in fairly low paying situations
they could
that's a good starting wage
boy three hundred dollars a week doesn't go very far on child care
even that really i think i don't
it's been a little while since i've looked into daycare centers
they are the good ones do cost maybe sixty dollars a week since
we used
mine are twenty-two twenty-three and twenty-seven
that
you made the comment earlier why would someone be interested in children
it has been a real
there have been some good entrepreneurial
i think they have captured a certain market
there are baby-sitting groups
let's see
i wore corduroy shorts with a white blouse and flat shoes
can you dress pretty casually
on occasion
i do vary
i wear suits
how about you
i run a business out of my home
i tend to get up in the morning put on
there's no real dress code where i work
you see people wearing all different attire
i don't like to wear heels that really tires me out
i predominantly wear flat shoes
in the winter i wear sweaters
in summer i like one piece dresses short sleeves things like that
i've recently tried to update my wardrobe trying to put suits together that i can interchange the
i can only have a limited wardrobe since i'm only
still it gives it some variety
at home i predominantly wear sweatpants and things like that
they're like ber-
they're like black corduroy bermuda shorts
sometimes i wear a blazer with them
i get really a lot of compliments on them
where i work is predominantly male
they
their attire is always the same suits or slacks
jeans whatever
i'm really the only woman i guess at work that does that
seems to work for me
in fact i just got a new outfit as a gift that
th-
i think that'll be good for work too
i guess down here
my wardrobe has changed quite a bit
we moved from colorado where
i have a closet full of sweaters
i live in virginia
that's interesting
right now today was in about the fifties
i do wear a lot of sweaters and things like sweater dresses
today was definitely a shorts day around here
we're still pretty much in winter as far as that goes here
this is pretty unseasonal
at least we
it feels good
it gets
particularly what kind of music do you like
i mostly listen to popular music
i listen to it all the time in my car
i tend to be one of those people who switches stations a lot because i don't like commercials
i find myself listening to popular music
quite honestly i i have some little children
i unfortunately found myself listening to a lot of nursery rhyme music here lately
that's not by my choice
i do listen to a lot of
i switch the stations a lot because i don't have a cassette player in my car
uh-huh
however i do like a lot of different forms of music
i switch quite often
i think i like
i'm really particular about the type of music that i listen to
the
i like a little bit of a lot of different types of music
i like music that i feel
if it's not then i won't
i really don't
i don't really have anything against rap music
the one thing i do object to about rap music is when it becomes militant
or if it's violence oriented
i have strong objections to that
i listen to
one time i remember this was back when even
it was about
the piece of music was i think about forty or fifty years old
it was incredible the parallel between it and rap
you listen a lot
if you hear a lot of old gospel especially the black gospel
you can really pick it up
a lot of times you'll hear songs that they're not original
it sounds so much different
yet i have a much younger sister who listens to a lot of rap music
she thinks its pretty funny how often i know all of the words to songs that she's listening to
they do cover versions of standards i guess you could call it
i guess there was even a bit of ruckus caused by the m c hammer who's really
seems to be the hot one of today
he used wild thing
do you remember that song
he used
maybe it wasn't that one
it was a living person that i'm thinking of that said you know hey that those are my words
i guess that they hadn't originally gotten permission
he since then has amended that and paid them his royalties every time the song goes on
it may have been somebody else because i think that even jimi hendrix did it
come to think of it i think that was a cover version of a john lee hooker song or something
it was just like
i can't think
i
there are so many different songs
the whole thing about cover versions a lot of times i've heard some songs that i just thought were horrendous cover versions of
i'm like i don't want to listen to this
that was really great
that was a really good piece of work
when you hear the cover it's like god what are they doing
the cover version i thought it was pitiful
i remember seeing the video of it on m t v
i thought it was hideous
whatever became of peter frampton
there was nothing
there was no reason for him to really come into great stardom or anything
i think it
i remember i saw him in a huge stadium in philadelphia
i graduated back in seventy-nine
uh-huh
i've really
i loved
i was really into the album oriented music even then
i was really familiar with a lot of the a o r type music
the album oriented like james taylor
and the beatles
a lot of people they go they're better than the beatles
i'm like
the comparison made between new kids on the block with the beatles
i guess i can just humor them
i guess our age is showing when we think that
i've liked a lot of the new music
i think
i saw some promise with a lot of the new wave when it came out
i don't know
music it's in a very weird position right now
i like to hear what they call world music which is using all these natural forms of music
really that's not world music
what paul simon's doing i think is great because he's using
drawing from a lot of different sources and making a synthesis of a new type of music
world music is
a lot of where they make music that they adapt to another type of listener
for example let's say you're taking an original brazilian form of music with a certain style
you try to make it a little bit more listenable for let's say another audience let's say a north american
when they hear it it's another form of music and
sort of trying to draw out the best sources
the best of every type of music
because there are some
i li-
there are some types of heavy metal that i really like
i wouldn't say that i completely like heavy metal
i think
it's the same way with
world music takes the forms that have really been
the cream of the crop i guess you could say
taking those qualities and then applying in the styles that are extremely enjoyable and then taking
then it becomes a kind of music of it's own so to speak
when you listen to it it's
a lot of the stuff you hear coming from south africa now and from west africa that's considered world music because it's not particularly using certain types of folk styles
they're trying to make it somewhat more modern
i
another good example was i heard miles davis
miles davis worked with robbie shoncar
if you can believe it
he's playing with robbie shoncar
he's a very good arranger
arrangement to
when i heard his album i heard it and it was just incredible
i listened
i heard
you hear this guitar
you hear the muted trumpet
you never would think that they can actually play together
let's see
i think there's a lot of people that don't vote because they don't really think their opinion is going to be heard
there's such a small voice and such a huge number of people in the united states
that
their votes not going to make that much difference
whether you vote for one person or the other person the issues is what you believe in
that person is going to have a lot of
it would be really difficult to have that one perfect person that believed exactly what you believed
a lot of people
i think that it ends up the people that vote every time elections come around are more the party type followers the guys that follow the party lines
they just go in
if they're republican they vote republican every year
the people that are independent are the ones that don't really show up every year because they can't seem to decide which are the good aspects and which are the bad aspects of a candidate
back when anderson was running i was hoping that things would change and he'd actually get elected and party politics would start going down the tubes
there's a lot of extremes on the parties too with the real far side of the democrats
they're real liberal now to where probably fifty or a hundred years ago the democrat party being liberal like they are now would never be thought of
it would be the other way that the republicans were real liberal minded as far as moral standings and those kinds of things
people always get upset about it too because every year the politicians are the ones that are usually pushing for more people to vote
they each think that if more people vote they'll get more votes
i'm always amazed that each candidate thinks it's going to be the people that come out that will vote for him
that's true
i think in the texas governor elections i think more people turned out to vote against somebody than for somebody this time
that
i know that there's certain issues that can really motivate people because we live in a predominately catholic type area
when things start
when abortion comes on the issues and people just get all inspired
still on the other hand we're also
down in d c where things are a little bit different it's women's rights and that sort of movement
it's quite the opposite
elections start getting very
that's true that the different places in america that different issues would be a lot more important than in another place
i can understand why some of the rural areas the voter turnout isn't as much because it does seem sometimes the lobbyists in d c are controlling things for the midwest
it doesn't matter who they put in office they're going to fall subject to the pressure that the lobbyists can put
it's real true that they'll say one thing
once they do get elected they don't have the power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they promised beforehand
maybe it just wasn't possible at all in the first place like the no new taxes thing
that's
i don't think he's going to have to worry about that next year
that really
they won't even bother turning out
that's true
they'll just say the republicans have this election
that's what they keep saying that it seems like people with old-fashioned values are the ones that aren't turning out at the booths
they say that these older voters that they feel like the kids are running the country
they don't come out turn out to vote
they're the ones that really know what's going on have the experience and seen how politicians can screwup or what ever
i know my grandmother hasn't voted in years
neither has mine as a matter of fact
i think they look at it as everybody the majority of the people think this way when that's not necessarily true
because that's what the media says
the majority believes this way
they don't even bother turning out to vote to express their opinions
that's true
wonder if they're going to take into account this computerized conversation that there's little children bouncing in your knee
they went off
that's
i guess we've talked long enough
washington d c
i'm from
i figured with texas instruments they'd probably have a few texans on the line now and then
do you work for t i in any way
how did they get you
they went through engineering companies
we're communications
i work in a communications company
we saw it on the t news one day
i thought that might be interesting
they called me at ten o'clock one night
maybe i'll figure it out
it was nice to talk to you and sort of meet you
if your ever in d c come look up wayne sherman you'll say yeah talked to that guy
i'm kyle hunt
too if you ever come to dallas area
i'll talk to you later
the
there are so many ramifications to this entire thing of how women have changed
look at them
margaret thatcher was prime minister indira ghandi in india
so many women are heads of state
we keep saying yes we feel some day a woman will be president
i have some question whether or not they will ever really get around to that
i think we'll have a black president before we have a women president
i don't know whether that's bad or good
i truly believe that before that we have to address the racial issues in the united states
it's
i think we're supposed to hang up
it wasn't the matter of wealth
i'll talk to you later
what do you think about the idea of having volunteer service for everyone
None
i've talked with several
i think they've gotten a lot out of it
are you doing any kind of volunteer work now
i have done red cross work
i've taught c p r training
what about when would people do it when they finished high school
i think probably as soon as they finished high school it would be ideal because a lot of times if they go straight into college i think they're going in too quick
i think there's a real challenge there
there's also this issue of whether you're really ready
i think it gives a different perspective
i think if you've been out of school a year and a half before you start to college you appreciate college more
the only complication is how do you fund something like this
there are some groups that have their children go away for a year
i think the mormon church sends out missionaries that
the parents fund them for the whole year and a half that they're gone
it's interesting
it gets them away from home and gets them to do something useful
although the kids today though it seems almost that their concern for money
we were doing some investigating colleges and said the kids are much more interested today in trying to find a job study something that will give them a job as opposed to be curious
if there was mandatory you could choose the option of either a mandatory military service or voluntary
in israel even the women are required to be in the military for a certain period of time
i was in the military
i personally feel if they have the draft that they should draft women as quickly as they do the men
the issue of which
what would you have them do
there are a lot of people around with
say the volunteer
say that it was mandatory
i think that they ought to have something for the unemployed in a voluntary field like the
i don't know if you remember about the w p a
it's not the best thing in the world
it gave them something to do
it seems that there's some things like the programs at least just go around and clean up streets and pick up trash and even aluminum cans and some of these kinds of things
or go into the more depressed areas and help repair the houses
in fact we helped with help to help humanities
that was a good experience
you take the kids out
we've been doing this three or four minutes
i think that
it was good talking to you betty
christian literature
i've kind of
i used to read a lot of novels
it seems as though if you really want to set side time to read the bible and you work and whatever that pretty well takes up your time for reading
i been praying that god would put a desire to read the bible
he really has
a lot of times i do just read magazines and stuff like that because i don't have a lot of time
when i do get to sit down and read i like to read the bible
i like to read
i like to read bi-
i have bible storybooks i like reading those to her
she really enjoys those
that's good
it's kind of short because we don't have a lot of time
to read
it's real enjoyable
this present darkness and i forget the the other
he's also written a lot of children
they're all spiritually
i love to read his children's books just
that's good
they're good
it's usually about a family of archaeologists and the spiritual fights that they get into
digging in old ruins
and running across the old gods and things
that sounds pretty neat
i'll have to look for those
it also teaches them spiritual warfare
that's neat
my daughter has precious moments collection i like that because it's real easy to follow for her
if i read straight out of the bible to her she'd
it's hard for me
it is real hard to follow and understand
i've got a bible that has a little bit of
it helps explain who people are
that's about the hardest thing is who's related to who
especially it's hard to keep your interest in those begats
it is good reading
it's good for us
then on the other extreme i like to read i don't know horror steven king type books
i like that
they're just so suspenseful
there's another guy
what can
you would
when you're recording you can't remem-
dean kratz or kranz
he writes the same thing though
his last name ends in a z i know that
i think i know who you're talking about
i've seen
i think i've seen his books in there
they're real
did you ever read the
that long thing
that seems like all of his books have kind of come from that
that
i loved the shining
that was my favorite
those hedges when they started moving
he just brings stuff alive
that was a pretty scary movie too
they did do it justice
most of the time they don't follow books very well
i also liked cujo
None
it was
dead zone
he has some under another name
s-
i think his name was bachman
i wish i could do that
i know it
i have gone back
after i graduated i read some of the old classics that i just bluffed my way through and have found that i enjoy them quite a bit too
i love good old
the l-
it's english
it's not the same english they speak today
it's kind of hard to keep at it
their worthwhile
that was one of my favorite subjects in school was literature
i used to love those good old books
i liked
why can't i think of their names
the one that wrote wuthering heights
wasn't that jane ehre
you know who i'm talking about
those are good old books and classics
because they'll take a classic and televise it put it into a viewing format
i know it's really hard for me
i work two jobs and have my daughter and teach sunday school and go to school myself
i can imagine
it's hard for me to sit down and read
when i do i just love it
i think we've accomplished five minutes
what is your view do you consider the soviet union a threat
it takes awhile to get used to something
if they have completely chain-
the place has completely turned that much around to where they're not what they used to be
it's hard to know anymore if it's a threat one way or another because it used to be so much in the past that whatever the top said the rest fell rank and file in behind it
now that with gorbachev is introducing more i guess expressions of freedom it doesn't look as though everybody's following the same pattern
the people who are the staunch military conservative people
you never know gorbachev's future is like whereas in the past it was seen as whoever was the head of the communist party was seen as untouchable
the thing that keeps happening is happening so fast and so dramatic that you almost think now wait a minute we're getting stuck into something here
if somebody's about to clobber you the first thing they do is sort of say we're ashamed we're not going to do that anymore
i
the evidence is that he's let some stuff go the east german situation
if i'd have been asleep for five years
and read it in a book i said no that couldn't have happened that way
it's amazing just because of the drain that's been on both economies that our economy of course been able to withstand that a little better
the russian economy
they
i heard it one time
finally who knows
maybe they're finally waking up saying we can't afford this
the u s isn't the threat that we've always made them out to be
even if they're saying that beneath the doors
it's hard to thing that just one person can bring that much of a radical change in that short of period
even if it is the best thing in the long run it just steps on too many people's toes
i think what i'd have to
i guess to answer the question directly i'm still just a little bit leery of the whole thing
what i haven't seen is a great stepping back in the military
it's one thing to let us go ahead and sort of disarm
i even had a thought once that the whole iraqi thing might have been just a deal to go ahead and let us
expend some military hardware
that may have been a kind of far out way of thinking about it i don't know
it's interesting anymore the world's getting so small that it doesn't seem to tolerate anymore any kind of the expansionism
philosophy that was here
twenty years ago
of course the people who have challenged that or tried to do have not been world powers
it's easier for us to say to an iraq
you can't do this get back or we're going to force you
we can do something about it
whereas if the soviet union would have who knows what taking over mongolia or something like that will we have been more just rhetoric
rather than going in there officially or
physically and try to remove them
the china situation the when it looked like that thing was turning around
all of a sudden it was like somebody in the red square or wherever said okay
that's enough
the tanks came in and
pretty much took care of that
i think he's actually honestly trying to do some change
i don't believe that he in this first pass around being the first one to really turn things around or attempt to is going to be allowed to get away with it either
this would be like if somebody was elected president of the united states and suddenly took off toward just some pretty hard by the socialism
the reaction
the economic
the social structure of the soviet union it's coming apart at the seams
i've heard people say it's just like the american civil war will there be a union or not
there was no
as we are seeing now with a lot of those
they nobody vo-
a lot
a lot of my friends have taken us down the stance of these people are just trying to be free and trying to get away
i'm thinking more of it from a nationalistic
if i'm a soviet and if part of south let's say south dakota wanted to succeed am i going to stand for that
i realize that the origins are different and that we all joined under a common direction and a common bond to begin with
i
it's easy to believe that they were probably more forced into a pact than a volunteer or willingness to join
there was the whole thing was put together by force
there's no real question about that
some of the countries that were forced in at later dates is the three baltic countries came in the forties
it's not that they came in it's they were conquered by the germans
the russians even
that's a
that whole a
the whole idea if you look at the russian history is the only way to truly protect your borders was to have a buffer
that was the whole idea why they had so many buffers
maybe more and more people are seeing countries hopefully are seeing that that buffer isn't going to help you
i guess
with israel is a perfect example
the reason they have the angolan heights and all their buffer area is between jordan and the sinai and lebanon was just as a buffer
as you can see with the scuds go right over there
there's very little that binds you anymore in today's technology
they're going to land in other places
that's going to be the safest place to be
i guess what they'd have to do to
in the i hope that what's happening is exactly the way it appears
some reason or other is it's kind of a strange thing we've been trying to make something like this happen for so long that when it finally happens you say
None
you wonder how this thing
who was it boris yeltsin evidently was elected president of the soviet
which is i guess the the biggest
i get confused between which is the soviet provinces versus which are the russian provinces
in the center
you got the the great big area that's was traditionally known as russia
all these little nationality groups
around it was there nineteen of them or whatever
these were all the soviet economists they had some real fancy names for them
what i read when the united nations was setup in san francisco one of the first things the russians wanted to do was bring in each one of these republics
as a
there would be nineteen
the united states said that mean we get to bring in forty-eight
that sort of
they backed down on that
i thought it was interesting that recently here the warsaw pact no longer exists as a military force
it's merely an economic now
wonder if that
at
wh- w-
what do you get shot by something that's called an economic force or what is called a military pact
it's all
i wonder if it's still exists
although i've seen some evidence that the the russian soldiers are
the funny thing there is they're not particularly welcome back home because they're having housing shortages now
all the
what do you do with all these troops that have been taken care of by bulgaria and czechoslovakia
now all of a sudden they're going home
somebody's got to pay for their
that's what they're saying the whole problem with if we were to demilitarize europe
that's not
what's going to happen to the economies that are no longer have a million plus people
since you live close i don't know if you know about what louisville is doing with recycling
are you familiar with any of that
i know that we have some relatives that live around the area in there
i read
when they first started doing that in the paper i read about that
we separate everything out and then have to haul it up to a metco
which is a real pain
if they would come up
recycle because there is some bins behind wal-mart that take some things
have they moved them behind wal-mart
i finally asked because we had all of those milk cartons
there was nowhere else to take them
they had it in front of wal-mart
i ask in wal-mart
they said they moved it just behind
because to take it to a metco you have to take it when they're open
when that thing came up in wal-mart parking lot we thought this is great
we started taking them up there
all the sudden it disappeared
we're going no there goes our recycling place
we pretty much do plastic milk cartons and newspapers
plastic milk cartons newspapers and cans and glass i guess is really the four things that we do
aluminum cans
that's really about it
is there any place else that really takes anything other than that that you know of
i guess down kind of in north dallas there is a place that will take almost anything
we just don't have the room to store all that much
at first you
at first it was a real hassle
i'm wondering are we really going to do this
you kind of get i guess into a little routine where it is automatic to throw
i just go
i've just got three trash cans sitting in there
we just kind of dump things in each one
they do too
they're impossible to crush
you can't get the down to any size
if you get four milk cartons and that fills up trash bag
None
there was so many baby food jars
when i found out some places to take it
they also take some things at the flower mound dump behind the fire station there
i know that they're going to use the money for that to build some kind of multipurpose field and that type of thing
that will be good
if i'm not going to get the money for aluminum i would just assume give it to the city of flower mound
to do something with
they won't raise our taxes
i was kind of hoping with
do you work for t i
we're recycling aluminum cans up here just what you would buy out of the machines and drink here
there was crushers out in all of the hallways
t i doesn't give them any money everything is made from that
they had talked about having a thing like one saturday a month you could come and drop your aluminum cans off from home
i'm kind of like yeah
they would do that because at least somebody was getting the money out of it that was going to use it for good
it was good to talk to you
it was nice to talk to you
do they really
what do you think about it
i think we need to do more
i know i need to do more
they have programs around where you can reach the
i have a hard time of separating my trash
get all the cans from the paper
i just haven't gotten that dedicated yet
we try to do a lot there's still a lot more we can do
i don't recycle my newspapers myself
i noticed in one of the sales catalogs this weekend they have a clothes hamper kind of thing that you lay your string in then you put your papers in there tie them all up and bundle them up
i figured i might get me one of those because we don't always read the newspaper
we just chuck it
i don't get the paper every day
i get it on
i try to buy the early edition for the coupons the sunday edition
then i just bundle it up and put it on the front walk every monday or every other monday and have them pick that up
that's the extent of what i've done
the problem is with a lot of it is it takes a while to drive to these places where you recycle it it's not always convenient to do it
here in lubbock everything's so close
i'm not exactly sure where the can thing is
sometimes it's just so
i went out to payless cashways here a couple of days ago as a matter of fact and got me one of those little can crushers that i could put on the wall i put me a little five gallon bucket
it's just outside the garage door every time we drink a coke or whatever we crush the can and just drop it into the bucket
it's actually metal it's not plastic
because those things i think would just snap
payless cashways has them
they're metal
i don't know what affiliate of payless cashways you have up there
it was only seven dollars not too bad
i'd have to check into something like that because we don't drink a whole lot of soda around here
occasionally we have some around
for other kind of cans it'd probably only take aluminum cans like that don't they
i don't know
you could probably just
it
sometimes even with the newspaper they say they'll only take certain types of paper
yeah they won't take any lint free paper
i work at t i
that's just now come on board
we've been throwing paper out there away for years
we're just now getting on board to recycling ever since this big earth day thing came out
i haven't
i like it
it makes
i think it's good that you see these boxes cereal
they're now starting to make the packages out of recycled paper
i've bought greeting cards that are made out of recycled paper
i think they're just fine
what it is is a recycled paper bag it's just got happy birthday printing on it and a cute little phrase inside
it's just a paper bag it's really cute
i think we're doing better and better all the time
yeah i think we're becoming more conscious because we just can't stick everything in landfills any more
i think we're getting better at it i think there's quite a bit more we could do
you're right sometimes it does seem like it's more trouble than what it would be worth
i just wish it was a little more convenient to do
seems like you're so busy anyway
that's just one more thing to have to worry about
i think if the cities locally they'd get more programs going so that you could do that it'd make it a lot easier
they'll get at it sooner
they have
we just don't have any place to store those kind of cans
if we go out and pick up a bunch of cans from people sure they'll save them for us there's no problem there
what do you do with them in the meantime
i don't want a garage full of cans
people don't have room for that kind of stuff
they're not prepared for it
in texas they're just get things like that
you don't
the more trash you have laying around the more bugs you get
pick it up
i need to get better at it
if we all try a little bit a little bit goes a long way
thank you for calling
i assume you have kids
we have one
she doesn't have to worry about public schools yet
my degree is in teaching
i thought i wanted to be a teacher
before i went through all of that i wanted to see how i was going to like it
they
in alabama where i came from they allow you to substitute if you got a four year degree
i went out and played substitute for a while and decided nope not for me
i taught junior high
i expected it to be a lot of trouble
it wasn't that bad
they don't call it remedial reading these days
at the time that's what i taught
it wasn't too bad
we got long real well
i sometimes wonder if i didn't mess up
i started out wanting to teach lower like primary and then top primary and thought no i don't like this as much and ended up moving up and got up until about the sixth
that's what i got my certification in
i had decided long before i was even married that i wanted to if possible teach my kids at home and not put them in the public schools
my reason for that was i don't like the varied inappropriate influences that you find so much in the public schools
that's a nice way of putting it
you can find a lot of good public schools if you look real hard
i don't think they could cover everything that you could teach
most people don't have that option
it also depends on the district your in as on the
accept for the private ones of course we're talking about public
you pulled stunts like that and you were down at the principal's office and usually bending over to get five of the best
nowadays they can barely scold the children for something without getting sued
the crime is just escalated and the drugs and
even in the lower schools
the thing that really did it for me i was subbing in a fifth grade class
this kid comes to school with his lunch box
inside this lunch box he's got easily i'd say two hundred to two hundred and fifty dollars in one dollar bills
i asked him what are you doing with that
he says my father gave it to me
i didn't believe it for a minute
i have
i've full-
i think i understood what the kid was doing he was a
let's just say he was one of those types that you wouldn't doubt that he was selling something
not a lot i could do about it
we had the problem when i was in
with teaching
if we did have a student come in and they were drunk or they were on something you had the option of calling the police and have them taken out of the schools or trying to teach them something while they were there
you don't know if you were reaching them or not
we felt like maybe just going ahead and trying to teach them was better than have them taken out
because that just
it
it doesn't do anything for them
most the time if they were
i've only had two instances where it was really noticeable
they were better behaved when they were
it ended up better
i don't know
i think there's a problem too with teachers trying
they've been a big drive especially in the seventies to return back to the basics
i'm not completely just teach the basics in schools
i think there does need to be a reemphasis of those because
of our lower grades in the standardized test and such
it's indicative across the board that we've done something wrong
when you see koreans and chinese and japanese who are taking all the science jobs all the engineering jobs all the mathematical jobs
here we are
we can't balance a checkbook without a calculator
i don't know
i spent a year and a half in japan also
i've seen how their school system works
at the end of a certain time period you spitted everything back out
the better the memorizer you are the better your grades are going to be
i don't completely agree with that either
there definitely needs to be a balance somewhere
that's a great deal what law schools like
is it
i did the same sort of thing
you get one examine for the whole semester it's how well you can remember it all
how much can you stuff in your brain
i found that a particularly useless way of studying
consequently some of the very best students had excellent memories
they couldn't put two and two together as far as the law was concerned
good question
money is not the answer
they're throwing more money at it now than ever before
things are getting worse
i think it's like a lot of things in the united states
we've got so much built up in the bureaucracy and in the politics of it
in the power plays that it needs to be pulled down and started over again
there's no way that that can be done
maybe on smaller scales
i don't know
i think part of it is that they've got to give authority back to the local school
it's silly that these people are handcuffed when it comes to discipline
right into the classroom it needs to be able
teachers are so afraid now of even saying something
to students because they're going to get complaints or they're going to get sued or something
they're kind of fearful of
lawyers help create that
at least i've heard that
i haven't fortunately been in a situation where it's
i think what we've turned the school schools into now are just day-care centers somebody
he's out of our hair
the other part of it is parents have quit becoming parents
they're just
you can have the best school system in the world if you don't get anything at home then it's not going to help either
i don't know
it's an interesting thing you want to do
you have to prove that you're teaching them something
they try to encourage you to follow a specific curriculum although you don't have to
if you have particular religious beliefs they're kind of monitored
they will allow you to
certain religious groups don't want their children in public schools because the influence
maybe they were a group of mennonites or something like that
they are monitored by the state school board
i remembering reading a few cases about when
it seems silly that we started
that's the way you got your education in this country
None
i grew up in the sixties
at that time it was a changing time for the whole music scene i guess
i grew up with the beatles and the rolling stones and the whole pot culture during that time and went through that phase and kind of stayed with it i guess for several years after i graduated from college and thereafter
have since
i grew up in a small town in southern oklahoma
i have kind of gone back to more of a county flavor in music
i'm not quite sure why that is
it seems like almost a opposite
i guess i got away from what i consider to be the pot sounding music
it didn't have i guess what i was looking for at the time country tell's more of a story
i've become i guess more of a country fan over the years
when you say that you grew up in the sixties i take it that was the teenage type years
None
we're very similarly aged
we probably have an interesting perspective on the music on the times
i'm just a couple years older than you
essentially i was one of the nerdy types in high school really which meant that for one reason or another i didn't pay much attention to music
as i look back now i realize it was very formative for me
i became attached to that style of urban country if there is such a thing
i think in a way one could talk about simon and garfunkel that way because they do tend to have a dramatic or story approach to their music usually tend to have some good or bad moral to it
over time i became very interested in baroque classical
i think that was just through experiencing contacting college and the fact that i found it very relaxing for me
my tastes now run i guess to a upbeat simon
it's something that interests me combined with the classical tastes i had mentioned
my classical music tends to be confined to the seventeen hundreds early eighteen hundred music
i'm not a music
i spent a good deal of time listening also to
i'm not schooled in it
i've enjoyed the times when i have listened to it
i never have the discipline to stay with it
when i do play and begin to reacquire skills i inevitably fall in love with country western music which tends to be in some ways easy to play for a new piano player
it's got basically an easy rhythm and tone
it's fairly well easily something to fall into
i've gone through different periods of life in music from pop to classical
i guess one of the things that influenced me was that i've worked in radio stations as a d j for all my college years trying to support my way through there
basically because that's where i worked
i've developed a real love for classical music in probably junior high and high school because my band instructor was heavy into classical type music
he said he used to sit on saturday mornings and watch cartoons just to hear the music that they were using behind them because they used especially disney used a lot of classical music behind the cartoons
consequently we wound up playing a lot of classical music there
i think that got deep seated into me
one of things i especially like now in music regardless of what kind it is are those that call on those classical roots i guess barry manilow comes to mind for some reason there's not a whole
he does have some things
i think even electric light orchestra had some real influences by classical music
i'm still
a good example would be
i have connections but not particularly deep ones to the vietnamese war type situations
i found that i really like china beach
i particularly like tour of duty
both of them i had as much fascination of the background music i think going on as i did to the theme of the shows
i i've thirty something i'm particularly interested
it's the music
almost that i find myself listening to
our generation was so in tuned to music of that time that we identify goodness or badness with things now with the music that's behinds them
i
a song by the
if you recall how it goes downtown
all i have to do is hear that song and i get strongly evoked memories of difficult times in school being behind on work
my family now knows if they come into my study and i happen to have had a tough day at work and maybe i'm trying to get a project done at school and i'm humming or whistling in a sort of mad crazy way the tune to downtown they know to just stay away
when did you first take your first piano lesson
probably about first grade
i have returned about every four or five years to thinking that i would like to do something about it
inevitably i am swept away by the pressure of other types of things
in order to continue to grow and
i always think that i'll be able to do it
i inevitably discover that i have no innate music talent relative to composition and that i struggle and really can't quite understand what is that other people take for granted
in a innate music sense there just seems to be something missing there which is always frustrating for me since i have pretty high math aptitude
it doesn't for me
it's making that connection especially with the mechanical parts of it
i was never able to master all that
in fact my brother and sister both they were thirteen sixteen years older than i they went through the parent thing where you've got to practice or you're not going out to play thing
when it came to my turn the folks said no we're not going through that again
turns out i was the only one who really had an interest in it and never got to
i really
in fact one of my favorite things to do now is sit down and listen to chopin that is played on piano
i can just drift off into some other world just listening to that for hours if i ever have the time to do that
i'm kind of like you maybe one of these days i'll get around to it
probably not
we both have a secret background that says somehow or another we just knew we were piano players and never got a chance
it's a pleasure talking with you
you sir
i could barely hear what the switchboard operator was saying as what was the topic
i like to do weight training and cycling and just walking swimming
the doctor said that running and jumping isn't real good for my knee anymore
i had to kind of change my life-style a little bit
let me ask a personal question
then you should
over thirty-five everything goes downhill flop
the rest of me is in pretty good shape
you're lucky then
i've battled arthritis all my life
even since i was about two or three
usually most people are just absolutely crippled
i do water aerobics
i bet that helps
now i'm down to about four
it's about the only thing that keeps my mobility in there
i tried weight training
the shock on the system is just too much
i have stuck to water aerobics basically the weightless thing and
it's hard to find
it's really hard to find a place that's going to offer water aerobics because what i'm finding is that if they do offer it you get the crowd of women that are
it's the geriatric crowd
i've considered even becoming licensed to teach it
if you know what your routine is you can do that by yourself
you probably do
you have to have an indoor pool
to find an indoor pool where either you can do this by yourself without drawing a lot of looks means you're really going to do a strenuous workout activity
that does look very odd in the water
have you tried the pool at the spring creek fitness center
that's the only place i haven't tried
people have told me
that's the texins facility
a fairly good amount more on the weekends
i try to beat the traffic in the mornings when i workout in the mornings i try to come down to the dallas fitness center
i don't work at t i
you don't
when i was working there i was the only woman that was pretty much in the industry
i used to fill out those attitude surveys
me and the insurance adjusters are very familiar with each other
my husband still works there
i get my attitude expressed through them
i find it to be very
sometimes it's kind of shoot yourself in the foot mentality to save a few bucks
i came down here
they did an attitude survey like six weeks after i had been working here
i asked about day care for the shift workers
i was pulled in by my manager and told that you just don't say that
it's not
i was kind of horrified
what year are we talking about
things have become much more enlightened since then
we still don't have a day care facility
people are more sympathetic to it
i understand that they're now covering women's preventative health care
the reason i'm at home is when i had my kids and i was scheduled to go back i had been rated number one in the field
i took
they put the baby on a heart lung monitor when i took her home
the insurance carrier was not going to cover this because it was considered preventative treatment
they used to
i had a second one eighteen months later
of course to maintain
i was flat on my back for the last five months with the second one
i don't even know it
they put me on twenty-four hour fetal monitoring then to try to control the labor and see how far it was going
after the baby was born since it wasn't premature then they said they wouldn't cover the cost of the monitor
because it was a thirteen thousand dollar bill
that was when they had
i was just outraged
i did not know that since i was on personal leave of absence that i had been terminated until i filed my insurance claims about four months later
they didn't have any coverage under my name
i went back
i said what the hell is going on here
they told me your husband works here
he's got a good salary
we've got people here that really need to be working
so that we had just
it was this way we didn't have to layoff an active person
we'd just let you go
it took me about a year of arguing
i said i've got to put this in writing to me
because until they put it in writing i couldn't get my insurance benefits
i couldn't get my termination benefits either
i can believe that
i still don't think that after my experiences that they could get me to go back ever again
i can understand
it's been good talking with you
let me ask you this since you use texans
shoot it's only about ten bucks a month
that's for individual
to add dependents is maybe another dollar or something
if you pay your monthly charge do you then pay separately for classes your taking
you do for classes
to use any of the facilities is no extra charge
or a depe-
do you have to be an active t i employee to join texans or a depe-
seen that my co-dependents have turned on the hose and are getting my neighbors fence
my position for management to domestic goddess has been an adjustment
boy i think i'm going to go contact texans
that beats any offer i've heard in a long time
it would depend on when you go
it's not excessively crowded on the weekends
i'd want to be there in the mornings from nine thirty to ten thirty
i don't think that would be bad at all
if you're in richardson you'd probably wanted to come to the dallas site
then you could go either one
you'd probably like the pool there
god it sounds like i would
thank you
i guess this is probably really a good subject for me because i really like to do hand work
mostly i do needlepoint i guess
i've made a lot of baby gifts
especially lately there's been so many babies
i do crochet and a lot of things like that
i have very little of my own stuff
it's kind of embarrassing
can you do it
a friend of mine gave me a clock kit i needlepointed the face
i kept that because she gave me that
that would be definitely something you'd want to keep
it's real neat
was the whole face done or just the numbers and like minute marks
basically the whole
the minute marks are done they're like hearts
the
at the numbers they're kind of outlined and stuff
it was quite bit of work
it was a lot of fun too
i got into the bargello
what's that
it's an italian needlework using the
the
i've just gone blank
it's used with yarn
it usually takes long stitches over two or three openings in the cloth you weave intricate patterns and use different colors
it could be a flame stitch where rather than drawing a picture you're making a design like a geometric or whatever
it was used quite often in the colonial times to upholster chairs and so forth as well as the crewel embroidery work that was done on them
that's interesting
what kind of things did you do
what i did when i was doing that was mostly pillows for sofas and so forth
i can't find one that i've done
i didn't give them away
i didn't know if it's been my color choice or multiple moves or what
i have no idea where they are
when you described it
i suspect you have
when you described it it sounded like something that would be around i guess
i've never heard of it before
it's really interesting
i guess i've decorated baskets and stuff before in the past
i've kind of gotten out of that
basically bows and lace ribbons
i really wanted to do
so many of them now have the ribbons where i'm not sure how they do it
the ribbons they make them they
they make them hard
those are so neat
i would really like to do those
there they
she has three kids all under the age of like six
they're all a handful
it's got to be something she can do fairly easily and fairly quickly
when i do crochet it's usually the lacy victorian type things like that
i stiffen those with a glue mixture
it may be something similar to that that the fabric is dipped in and then allowed to dry in those draping streamers
there's bound to be some kind of fabric stiffener like that that's very similar that's not going to melt too much with high humidity
i think that's what my concern was was it really sure and how they would last
right now i'm looking at a little quilted hanging
it's a flag
i don't want to wash it because that would start breaking down the batting and so forth
it's such a dust collector to be out and so forth
most of my things are dust collectors
i hate to dust
first thing i think of is how easy would this
i don't do it quite as much as i used to i guess because i went back to school
i don't have as much time
you don't have time
i have two children also
i really enjoy it when i do do it when i get the chance
once i get started i can't put it down
i don't even want to get into it in the first place
i end up lots of time not doing anything at all
i started a project
i didn't tell you what year
it's cross stitch
it's a picture
it's a wildlife
it's really beautiful
it's going to be a lot of work
i have worked on it quite a bit but not as much as i'd like to
it's just so hard
this is done in the needlepoint
i should-
it's counted cross stitch is what i'm doing
since it's counted it's really a lot of work
i decided that that's something that demands my total attention
i've got to have almost total silence
it does not sound like an easy one to finish
i tell you i could just kick myself for even starting it because i have a feeling i'm never going to get it done
i'm sure you'll get it done
it just may not of the original
i just don't know when i'm ever
it's just really hard
i really do en-
i said i really enjoy it when i do
there's so many other things that i have done in the meantime like i said so many baby gifts
those don't take much time at all
it's no big deal for me to pick those up and do them
do you use a book of patterns
do you go out an buy a kit for a bib or something like that
i just go with those
i buy the bibs separate
i just use whatever colors i want to
it depends on what it is
some things especially letters if they suggest certain colors for letters i just go with whatever i want to
there's a few designs i guess i've done myself but not very many
i made a little thumb print and made it a bunny
just did a thumb print
i didn't cross stitch the actual thumb print
that was just the ink
i made the ears and little eyes and nose and mouth
that sounds really neat
i just
did you use a stamp pad and ink
what kind of movies have you seen lately i guess
a lot
the last movie i saw but it wasn't my choice was the ninja turtle movie
my preference is the one we saw before that was silence of the lambs
the last movie i saw was sleeping with the enemy
was that good
i'm not a big julie roberts fan
i was a lot more impressed with her than i thought i would be
that's good
i'm ready to go
it's hasn't worked out that way yet
it looks good if you like thrillers
i do
i love them like that
i like all ranges of movies
it was really interesting
what other movies have you seen then lately
i'm sure i'm going to be seeing it because in a week to amarillo where my sister lives and she's got two boys that i took to see the first one
i'm sure i'm going to see the next one here real soon
my husband said it was about the same lines
then it won't be too bad
it wasn't impressive necessarily
it was better than it could have been
i was impressed with the fact that it wasn't that childish
she understood everything
she goes to almost all movies with us except r rated
she really enjoyed it
it was on a higher level where there were some things that kids didn't understand that adults did
i liked that
i think that's important if parents are going to have to go you ought to make it at least semi for them too
we take her to just about every movie
she does really good
she does real good
if and when we ever get a baby-sitter like we did with silence of the lambs we go see it
do you go to a lot of comedy movies
something on the tip of my tongue
i can't think of which one it was
gosh i can't remember
the last
that sounds good
that really wasn't too bad
he's supposed
he's this actor right he's playing a cop
he's hanging around with a cop trying to pick up the stuff
there were times when he'd be running with a gun or whatever
i was so impressed with that because usually
because everybody grows up looking at these cop movies and trying to imitate them or whatever
i thought he did such an excellent job of not going that far
by the end he was looking more like a cop
at the beginning of the movie and all through the middle part he was trying to get it
he wasn't there yet
you could tell it
i guess that i thought was a real good acting and writing job both or directing job
james woods i think is who it was did an excellent job as the cop
he just
there were some definite should i say tense moments
i had seen it before christmas
i took a date to it about a month ago
i've seen it the second time not too long ago
of course the bad thing about it was the second time i saw it i didn't really enjoy it as much
i was kind of surprised at that
i was hoarse getting out of there
maybe i just laughed so hard the first time that i didn't have it
it just wasn't as funny the second time because i had just gone overboard the first time
it was a great movie though
i'm looking forward to this summer naked gun two and a half is coming out
they are just slapstick
you have to see them more than that
i still catch things in airplane that i didn't catch
it's amazing i love those movies i really do
i'm looking forward to seeing that because that looks hilarious
it's just getting so expensive
isn't it though
that's at least the good thing about the texas organization letting you buy the tickets cheaper
normally we don't think about it until
all of a sudden i'm saying i wish i'd bought these things
if you want popcorn and stuff just it's incredible
popcorn is not that expensive
they get you at the ticket booth and then try and get you at the popcorn and coke
it's just the idea that these actors live in such lavish style
it's as simple as that
as long as we keep paying the money for it they are going to keep paying them
have you seen dances with wolves
that was an excellent movie
it really and truly does because to get the feeling of when they're chasing the buffalos and everything you've got to be where you feel it
i guess my first instinct was to wait for the video too
i'm glad i didn't
that was one movie i came out impressed
i have absolutely no problems with them winning seven oscars
normally i'm one of these people that i don't like one movie taking all the honors
even though they were okay the girl in it
you know what i mean
the best
from what i heard the guy who got it was better
i can see that
there is one spot that was just a little bit on the gory side
it's
it's just the idea that there is this one spot where the white man has come by and killed a bunch a buffalo and just stripped the hides
that is honest to god the one reason i don't want to see the movie is because i love buffalos for some weird reason
of course
yeah
that and plus part of it is the idea that he goes with them on a buffalo hunt
they are killing buffalos in it
they don't stress that very much
i think it's an excellent movie for
if she enjoys movies i think it'll work pretty good
that'll be good
it's a long movie
i heard the video's even going to be longer
they said there's a lot that had been edited because of the length that they wanted in
they're going to put it in the video
that way you can watch it at your leisure
there are certain things you can't do with a video the idea that they may put a little extra in it i think is a good idea
because when you rent a video
videos of course are not cheap either the idea of getting a little extra with it i think is a good idea because they make bundles of money off those things
i do too
we keep holding out
i'm getting to the point where i watch nick at night
do you have children
my goodness
do you work
brian's in a day care center
he was two in december
he's not quite two and a half yet
i put him
i'm kind of had different ideas from what probably the majority of people have
no kidding
i just
i kind of looked at it like if you take him to a home with private individual
i always figured at least in a day care center there are other people around
if you get one bad apple there's are at least other people that can see it
i just kind of always felt that the chances of something happening were less
how can you help depending on the day care center
have you ever noticed they're always a family owned center where the mother and the daughter and the son run it kind of thing
it's a family thing
that's what i did
i have had just excellent luck
i was just going to ask you if you liked the
obviously you do or you wouldn't have him there
he was in the same center for the first two years
it was wonderful
i loved it
i was so happy there
the woman who owned it sold it
i thought okay i'm going to keep an open mind here
the people who came in it
their attitude and philosophy was just completely
i left him there for about a month and just decided i can't do this anymore
he's done well
i just feel so lucky
do you get to stay home with them
i got to stay home with my kids for the first ten years
she's i guess
i was really happy that i was able to do that
that's what i wanted to because i just couldn't wait to have kids
if i was
i couldn't wait to have them it would be kind of silly to go back to work as soon as i had them
it was really great
my youngest was only two and a half
she was already two and a half
she wasn't an infant
i felt real good about that
boy i tell you with summer coming up i'm just pulling my hair out in terms of what i'm going to do
i guess i
i worked full time all last year
now i'm going to school part time and
i'm working part time
i'm still
i only have half time salary
when school lets out i have no idea what i'm going to do
we did
we had all different things
my daughter went home to visit my mom for a while and my son went to camp
there we had i don't know some
it was all really expensive
now they're a year older
my daughter's going to be eleven this summer
my son will be
if i can work part of the day i'm going to leave them home
in fact i'm doing that right now with their afternoons when they get home before i do
the four year old before i went back to work really in a home day care situation
we've just been really thrilled
i wasn't embarrassed to shop around
where do you live
they have a number you can call
all these people are registered with their association
go like our
that's wonderful
she gets home visitations by the i don't know the state boards i guess some of them and then some by the association
they have weekly meetings and everything
it's just really really well regulated
she's just great
in fact she's all upset because galen is going to go to kindergarten next fall
she says this is it
i said no don't count on that
we've tried everything
one year i guess last year when i went back to work i had
we put him in amrein's day care after
i think they were fine
the thing is he was in school all day
in plano it's open classroom situation where they don't have walls
there is like a hundred and twenty second graders
he'd get on the amrein's bus to go to amrein's
there would be a whole ton of other kids all in the same room
what fun they had with these computer games
they'd go outside for awhile
it was just like going to school until five thirty at night instead of being able to get home at two thirty
because he was always around with a crowd of kids he just really missed being able to be by himself
None
another thing that we tried to do
i know your son's too young right now
we tried to sign him up for after school scouts and
we've already started about
how young can they start t-ball and soccer
i just
we both think of that as just so important
he's so much fun now
he's really starting to get lots of fun
i can't wait until stuff like that starts happening we did the easter egg hunts
which was really the first year he was really able to to know what he was doing and enjoy it
it was so much fun
he went a couple of weekends ago and rode an elephant
my gosh
god he got up on this elephant all by himself
lord i couldn't believe it
that's great
i thought i'm going to end up on this elephant with him
stuff like that is starting to come along where it's really
he comes home with something new everyday
that's great
i know they're working with him
he's excited to get there in the morning
he goes running
he's always having fun when i pick him up
yeah
this day care is
whenever you say bright steps everybody goes i've heard that's the best day care in town
it's one of those that's very hard to get into
this woman owns three day cares two in lewisville and one in irving
she had to open the second one up in lewisville because
her waiting list was just a year old
my gosh
she's got two day cares within three blocks of each other
about half the teachers are degreed teachers
it makes a huge difference
i think that really makes a difference
not because it's a job they could get because they didn't qualify for anything else
his old day care as much as i loved it
the owner i really liked her
she worked really hard to get good people
the people that she got were there because they weren't qualified to do anything else
i got lucky
all of his teachers were
sometimes that's fine
that's great
then sometimes
is it real expensive then
it just went up the first of this month
seventy nine dollars a week for now
it's like where he was before i was only paying sixty three
there's quite a little jump there
i looked all over lewisville
there were places that were cheaper
is it
your peace of mind is worth a little bit of money
i have peace of mind
where he is some of those other places i wouldn't have
we do the same thing
we pay for our day care provider full time for a whole week
she's gone three mornings
i said to her i said it doesn't matter if for whatever re-
have you ever had a family reunion
let me tell you
some of the older people organized it
what they did they had a book made up
it was like
what they did was they asked every family to write something about their family
like how many kids you had and who you had married
it went through
it showed who my husband's parents were
and who he married and then how many children we had and then his brothers and sisters
it went through the whole family and stuff
that's so neat
it was so good
it really did
it's got a lot more people interested in it because
did everybody send in their information and they made a book up
you could get it at the reunion
everybody got a book
it told where the first connally's came over
it told what happened when they got there and how many kids they had
it just kept coming on up through the generations
that was really neat
do you have a big family
he does
he does
he has enough relatives to make up for me not having any
he just has himself and his brother and his parents
that's it
he had to kind of get used to us
that's what happened when i first met my husband
i said this can't be
a lot of them lived in a group down one highway
there was a lake
they all lived down there by it
how nice
we were going down
the highway
he kept saying this is where my uncle lives
this is where my aunt lives and my uncle
my gosh
i kept thinking this guy is putting me on
nobody has this many relatives
because nobody it seemed liked the same thing
you had a choice
you got to taste a lot of new dishes and stuff too
did people come from out of town to the reunion
did you have hotel rooms
how did you do it
they just stayed with different ones of them
they just came down and say okay this aunt and uncle kip all their kids and their grand kids and everything
they had a church service ahead of it
None
then they ate out on the ground
they just brought food with them
did they just have over a weekend
i'm real curious because my family
if we ever had a reunion we'd kind of all have to stay in a hotel
there would be one person who lived there that would have a house
they couldn't put everybody up
i think it would get kind of expensive
you know what you can do
it's a big place
None
it's not very expensive that way
you mean
i see
everybody could stay together
they have a convention type thing
it has little rooms off of it where
you'd go and sleep at night time
then it has a kitchenette and things like that
that would be great because then you could spend so much more time together
every time you wanted to go eat with somebody you'd probably have to go to out eat or something
they had
that
at area lakes and all
now every time we plan anything just about we write to the chamber of commerce of where we're going because
that way than try to locate it
calling different places can really run you up a bill
if you can find a centrally located place where everybody would have to come about the same distance
you can't get it exact usually
everybody goes to that place
that is not bad at all
lot of times they'll have little cabins
three or four or five families can stay in those cabins because they have just the single bunk beds and stuff
they can all stay in those cabins
you can have cookouts and stuff like that
that's the best way i found
we had one
it wasn't any of my immediate family
they had thing where everybody could come and meet and go out to eat
i didn't think that was as good because
it was like you couldn't really talk and stuff like you could when
or somewhere where you were out
you have to sit at a table and just
it just
did you
did you have to draw a line
did the people that had that reunion have to draw a line
they just
what they did was they wrote to all the initial people
the oldest ones
they had
some of them if they didn't have their addresses and all on them
None
they told them that what we had to do was when we sent back in our information we had to tell them how many people were going to be coming
when they talked to us or when they sent us the letter
it asked will you be willing to bring
you had to check off what all you would be willing to bring
i see
really there wasn't any problem with
there was just so many of them
it turned out so much better like that
because they knew ahead of time how many people to expect
if there was a sickness or something like that you're not going to lose that many
how about because of divorce and stuff like that
my parents are divorced
they are both remarried
there's
then
then you would have put that down on the list
you would have been the one that sent their invitation to them
i'm kind of in control over who comes just from my family
once it went to the oldest people then they knew who they wanted to invite
None
whether i wanted my kids and any of my family to come
it never did
if i didn't want somebody to come then i just wouldn't send them one of the questionnaires
there really wasn't a problem that way
that's a real good idea
i tell you what that's the neatest book we've got
course we've still got it
they charged us i think like it was like five or six dollars i can't remember exactly
it's not a hard back book it's just a folder type thing
it has the entire
it has everybody that you could ever
it will be something my kids will have
i was just thinking of what you could tell your kids
i know very little about before my grandparents
very little about it
i can't remember who it was about
i remember these stories
i have no idea who it was that was in those stories
i couldn't give an accurate
i couldn't tell my kids what those people were like
i don't know who it was
usually when you find out some information from your parents
then you can find somebody else that can tell you something else about these
what kind of camping is there in texas
there are quite a few i guess state parks
there's a couple of national parks i guess that you can camp at
most of them have pretty good facilities
i don't know if the camping that i've done is really roughing it without a whole lot of stuff
you do backpacking and the like
done a little bit of that mainly just camping out at the state parks
there's some real nice ones in arkansas
i think arkansas has one of the best parks departments around
that's probably a pretty nice place to go
they've got real nice lake system around their parks
one of them the gray it's real nice there a bunch of lakes around it
there's a golf course and just a whole bunch of camping sites
where have you
i've been camping for years not on a regular basis
i first started camping out in the desert in california
then i moved to north carolina
i didn't camp for a long time
i started to go camping again kind of in conjunction with white water rafting
i'd go up somewhere and camp overnight and then do some rafting
maybe camp another night and drive home
that was pretty good
i went out and bought a whole bunch of camping gear
i still do it once in a while
where is raleigh in north carolina
in terms of north south i would say it's a little more towards the northern border of the state and pretty much in the eastern half of it
what i-
it's
actually the blue ridge in virginia are closer to raleigh
you can pick those up going west
then you're talking about six to eight hours
it's a real nice place to go and camp
there's some pretty decent campgrounds although i don't think the state of north carolina takes
i didn't know how much camping areas there were along there
what's it like camping in the desert and california
it's kind of incredible
i like it better than almost anything i've ever done
you really can probably count thousands of stars
it's just kind of nice
i like the
i think the desert has a rare kind of beauty which a lot of people don't realize
they hear desert
they think of scorpions and snakes and sand and being real dry and lack of water
it also has a certain quality of beauty that you just don't find anyway else except in a desert
it's pretty nice
the movie the doors has some nice desert scenes
the shots are pretty nice
it's sort of like that
it's just almost surreal in some places
the
you sort of have to choose your season carefully and know what's going to happen
it's beautiful in february
it's just beautiful
the days get up into the high eighties maybe the nineties
it's quite bearable
the nights are reasonably warm sixties or seventies
we've talked about planning a trip up through
i have a sister-in-law that lives up through new mexico and into colorado and the grand canyon area
that would be pretty nice
i have been camping on the south rim the grand canyon
that one thing you said about the stars is really true
when you're close to a big city like dallas the lights kind of wash off the star
it's nice to get away
how much you miss
i don't think i ever see the little dipper
i don't think i ever see it except when i go get out of the city and go camping in the desert or in the mountains
i guess we've talked as much as we need to on the subject
thanks for calling
stephanie what's your position on gun control
on a scale of one to ten being ten no kind of legislation and zero being total ban i probably would lean more towards six or seven
i feel like a total ban on guns is just going to put the guns in the hands the criminals
i lived in massachusetts for two years
they have a total ban on guns
i saw that it didn't stop crime in that state
was that just on handguns or was that on rifles
any kind of firearms
there's was a mandatory jail sentence if you were caught with a firearm
also i think there was a fine
that didn't help at all
the crime is not any better or any worse
it's
i shouldn't say i don't know if it was any worse
it certainly didn't get any better
i guess i would tend myself to be more towards the three
where i don't think you should necessarily ban guns by any means
you should definitely have the character search and the seven day holding period and things along that nature
you shouldn't be able to go out there and just buy one right off the shelf
i agree with that
i think that the law on who can buy a gun are way too lax
i think that the
i think that kind of control would be good
the
i'm trying to think of how many times you make the statement just to kind of exam it a little bit
i know that any statement in absoluteness is not necessarily true
how many times
i guess i have never heard of a robbery being foiled or spoiled because the person who's being robbed had a gun
maybe they just don't report those
i'm not sure
i can't think of ever hearing on the news or whatnot or hearing or knowing anybody who was being robbed
good thing they had their gun on them
they thwarted the robbery attempt
i'm not really sure
personally i don't own a gun
i don't think i probably ever would although i would like to know how to handle one
i think everybody should learn how to handle one
you just never know when you might come into contact with one
were you brought up in a family that hunted
nobody in my family hunted
my father had guns when i was in high school because he got them from a friend who lived in massachusetts
he lived in massachusetts and had to get rid of all his guns
we ended up with these guns
really my only experience with a gun was shooting a pistol and not knowing how to hold it right
the hammer came back and hit me in the thumb and blood squirted everywhere
that was really the only experience that i've had with guns
it kind of scared me
i think that if i learn how to use one i would feel better
i've also always thought about the idea most sports which are the n r a and people have their thing
if you ban guns you're just banning the recreation the sport of hunting things of that nature
most of that's done with rifles and such though there's probably i'm sure some sector that does it with handguns
just by the mere fact of outlawing handguns would make it so that it would be not as conspicuous
you could see someone coming or dressed inappropriately
if they had to have a rifle or was
made it more difficult to get a handgun
of course in this world anytime you've freedom you can be able to get anything you want
i guess to make it more difficult for the person who's just so irate and upset and temporarily a little bit offset or off keel
i don't know if that's a large percentage of crime or not
i guess it would be some
i think definitely
today they just introduced what's called the brady bill the seven day mandatory waiting period
i think shoot that's a good idea
i agree the thing that scares me though about where i would definitely want some sort of legislation
coming from the north east i'm just not used to seeing these
i know this may sound kind of stereo typical
it kind of scares me especially with all the shootings that have been going on
you come here in the dallas area
i don't believe that people should be allowed to carry guns in their vehicles
that's kind of wild
especially not in the back window
that's all very interesting
thanks for talking
you're welcome
i'm a dodgers fan from way back
how way back
late fifties early sixties
wally moon moon shots and all that
it's a
i'm living just west of baltimore and frederick which is also just west of baltimore has a minor league team
wally moon is the manager of them
he's still kicking around
i also lived eight years in ohio before going away to college
i used to go watch the toledo mudhens
i saw them
i was out there last summer
i saw a game at ned skelton
i couldn't tell you for sure
there used to be a race track
had a lot of fun
i like minor league baseball a lot
that's true
they've led the american league in batting fielding and pitching
they've never been able to do more than one of those in any given year
they
the guy's twenty twenty-five home rums maybe thirty eighty some r b i-s
he can't field
he strikes out a lot
he's done that for five years
he really has become a very decent fielder
he's not the liability that he used to be
he fits right in with detroit bunch of guys that hit home runs and strike out a lot
of course get a guy like cecil fielder
with detroit they can get away with one guy like that
if i were in detroit i would start building the team around fielder
that doesn't mean get three other guys who hit all they can do is hit home runs and strike out which they did
i think the key for l a this year is whether oral herschiser can come back
i like them a lot
by saying i like them i like their chances
i actually don't like the dodgers
picking up darrell strawberry didn't hurt
butler didn't hurt either
bobby ojeda didn't hurt
who's the last one
he's a pretty decent pitcher
he
that guy the short stop is going to be good
it should be an interesting year
i should have been to two
the team i live and die with is the red sox mostly die
i go to the orioles since they're here
i do enjoy them
i've had an opening day on monday
i kind of wish that they had inter league play like they do in all the other sports so i could see some of the national league teams here once in a while
three hundred miles
it's incredible
we're pretty lucky because if i want to see a national league team i can usually go up to philadelphia
saw the cardinals and cubs last year and a bunch of teams the year before
i try to see whatever i can
i've been to thirty or forty games each of the last few years
hope i'm going to do it this year because having a kid this fall
it's like so much for going to lots of baseball games
do it while you can
it's been good talking with you
you'll be happy i think in october when the dodgers win
i'll be upset probably even though my prediction will be right
god bless
good talking with you
good talking with you
i don't know
i'm not a real great football follower
the other is the oklahoma sooners
being a native okie i like to keep up with what the homeboys are doing
you make it to that longhorns sooners game
i got out and got my bachelor's degree in seventy-three and never went to a game there and have never gone to a game since
i always enjoyed watching them
there's always been an interest there
it's kind of same for me
the local team was philadelphia
they were thirty miles right up the river
i'm still pretty much an eagle fan i guess
i worked in missouri for a while
i was probably the only one in the room several times when we were watching football on t v when the cowboys were playing the saint louis cardinals
i was rooting for the cowboys
they were kind of closer to home when i struck up with them
i think that's quite a bit of optimism around here that still there's a chance that maybe these guys are right maybe they will come through and do something this year
boy they sure did have a big turn around from a couple of years ago
they got rid of a lot of familiar names and got a lot of names in that we weren't familiar with
some of them didn't
maybe the stuff that jerry jones is talking about the construction and redefining the team and maybe the effort might be starting to pay off
i keep waiting for the eagles to get over the hump
they just have done absolutely nothing when they got there
they've got a lot of the tools to do it
if they can't just put it together
they have got the quarterback there in randal cunningham who's just phenomenal
he's too streaky it seems
they have always been a really strong team
without a whole lot of big name players
they've managed with those guys
i don't know
once the pressure gets turned on they seem to loose it
that's the typical trait of the dallas cowboys
it's been a rough road to hoe ever since he left
i don't know why it's so hard to find a good quarterback these days
that says a lot for his ability though i think
for staubach's
he was one of the few who come through in history that can really perform
we hope
the guy winds up getting hurt every other game
i tell you it's difficult in that guy's position coming into that because there he was just so highly touted by the press and everybody expected so many big things
it's funny watching them play
he's probably like a lot of quarterbacks
i haven't quite figured that out
if they figure they have got it won or if there's no real hurry because the first three quarters or if something happens that that adrenalin starts flowing they say hey we got to do something now and then start playing the game the way the game should be played toward the last few minutes
i don't know
obviously though do you think they're going to do anything in the playoffs to make it to the super bowl this year
who do you like to do that this year
they'll get close to it
that's a good question
i'm figuring either the eagles or possibly san francisco
i don't know how these changes are going to help or hinder the team sometimes it brings in new motivation
all you can do is get out of the way because here they come
i'm sure my sentimental favorite would have to be philadelphia
i sure am scared of them giants
that's true
they're big
they are going to come right through you if you don't do something
that sure was a fun super bowl to watch this year
i wasn't pulling for either team
that was just a good football game
it's funny
you like to pull for the underdog
for a long time i was pulling for denver
marino makes me just crazy mad sometimes because of some of the stupid stuff he does
he's a good quarterback
l a
has it been snowing up there
i was just up there
it was about seven inches of snow on the ground
it snowed all day
that will make the skiers happy
it snowed that much in denver
they got that much up in the mountains just west of there
you bet
good to talk to you
do i still feel that the soviet union as such is still a threat to the civilized western world
my reasons are based upon not only what i see on the newspapers but up against some of the fun and exciting things i ran into during my six years as a soldier in the fifth special forces group
i think just the instability of the country right now is sort of scary
that's what makes it a powder keg
naturally we were at the time
we got quite a bit of information as well as indoctrination on soviet tactics and weapons
i went to lebanon in eighty-three before the marines ever got there with the u n peace keeping force with the training i received prior to going there with captured weapons we kept running up against
these weren't chinese made copies
there was also a bunch of russian advisors that were damn good shots
the team i was with we jumped in on the western tip of the island down on point salinas
for every cuban there was at least five russian advisors
they were all shooting state of the art soviet weapons
the equipment we were capturing and taking from the nicaraguans was brand new out of the crate soviet made material
let me tell you they are nothing nice to go up against
when they graduate from there they can pull terrorist actions anywhere in the free world
they are very very good at what they do
until i see the entire quote old guard of the soviet government completely roll over and disappear preferably buried i still consider them a threat
their military is different from ours to where there are extremist generals that actually control tens and thousands of troops
i guess that's what concerns me the most is they're so unstable that somebody like that could make decisions that would jeopardize a lot of people
it's interesting watching the different soviet states albania lithuania doing their little revolts down there
if uprisings happen in their sectors it's going to be a total blood bath
they're showing remarkable restraint
they would level entire areas
basically the size of the area around richardson
there won't be anything left alive
they can do that in about four minutes
they've got entire squadrons of those just standing by
they used them in afghanistan did remarkably well considering the terrain they were flying in
on a highly populated area like some of the soviet cities would be with the weaponry that's attached on those things there is no place to hide
if the bombs don't get you if the bullets don't get you then the nerve gas definitely will get you
during that same time frame didn't you get some feeling that they're getting all these weapons and stuff
you mean in the most recent conflict
i'm a little bit shocked to what the u s has done in terms of selling to iraq
i think we kind of shoot ourselves in the foot that way too
the ones to the south are more regional conflict
they've got a screwed up situation i'll give them that from mexico all the way down into central and south america
it's very screwed up
the governments which our government has technically supported for years are corrupt as all get out
generally the people
they're tired of it
they're willing to try anything to get out from under it even if that means going to communism
i think russia is getting to the point where they're about to do something to get out of communism
he's had his problems with some of the old guard himself
it may be trying to choose between the lesser of two evils
i understand when they reduced the number of troops in europe after the berlin wall went down
by no means do i endorse or approve pulling everybody out
you still better have the key players in place if something does go down even if it's a regional conflict
if united states is going to flex its muscle and be the super power that it is not only does it talk the talk but it's got to be able to walk the walk
it's got to have the stuff to back up what it's saying
None
this is an appropriate topic the day after earth day
what do you think is the main pollutants in the air
i have trouble with the chemical plants and things like that i think they put off so much
they're not regulated enough
that's me too
on channel thirteen they had some programs the day before
i'm not sure that about yesterday we didn't really watch it too much yesterday
the day before they had a lot of programs about the environment and how we're affecting the earth and things by what we do
they mentioned sulfur and carbon dioxide a lot
that actually as our population increases and our number of cars increase per the population that's the problem but also like you said the industry pollution
they're regulation that's placed on them it's better than it used to be
it's incredible that they're not made to regulate the amount of pollutants that they put into the air
i just
i know for a fact that they get away with a lot that
they're supposed to be regulated because i don't know about t i but we have a pillsbury plant
in a town adjacent to ours
i know people that work there that
they put out toxic chemicals there just in some of what they do to make their dough and to
it's incredible
they said that they have a little creek that runs by them
some of the people that work there have told me that when they have inspectors coming they shut down everything
they clean up their act but on a normal basis that they're dumping things
i'm like if they're getting away with it
that's a pillsbury plant
i wouldn't have thought that pillsbury even had chem-
to break the flours down
they also do testing there
i don't
when you consider it's probably not radioactive
toxic can be anything that's classified that can damage the earth
there could be a lot of things that they could put that chemical wise that they use to that they are testing with
like in packaging
just goodness
they do a lot of research
they do a lot of the refining up there
only thing i can think is bleaching
i don't know how they do the flour
we're on the southwest side of houston
we don't have that much as far as aiming in the plants over on this the east side does
they're right there on the creek also
they've been there for years
you think about it
i would think it would be easier to detect those things because you could detect them down stream or such
you can do testing on the ground itself at that point
when they pollute into the air and you've got movement through the air it's going to move a lot of that off
i don't see how they can do some of the te-
unless it just hangs there like in places where it's a lot of pollution like in los angeles or the bigger cities where it tends to get stuck there
particles in the surrounding community because it's not moved away
i think what if somebody's dumped something back there in the and no one knows about it and it sinked in through the ground and all that
i know out in some
it's where stillwater is or
i think it's
they've had a lot of problems because they've introduced a lot of dairies there
they have a lot of cattle in the area
None
they've got a lot of head of cattle because dairies they don't th-
i read in this article where one cow a day produces like a hundred or so pounds of manure
this thing says that people think cow manure is good for fertilizer
when you get that much manure it says it becomes a real problem because it's not
when you buy cow manure at the store they've added stuff to it
they've added humus and stuff that
this article said that they've got a real problem that you've got toxins and bacteria in the manure that is
what it's doing is it's going through
they don't have a very deep o-
they're natural water
i forget what that's called with
it's a spring water
it's below the surface
all this stuff is seeping through to the water
they're afraid that within a certain amount of years they're water in that town will be totally polluted
they won't be able to have any drinking water because they will have completely polluted so that there's too many toxins and bacterial growth
the gr-
i'm like my god
just from them introducing dairy farms
the ground will filter some of it but not all of it
i didn't realize one cow produces that much manure
None
thousands of cows they were talking thousands cows in one little tiny area
good grief these are well fed cows
they are evidently
evidently a normal cow produces that much too
they're just so spread out on ranches and stuff that it's not a problem
when they get them in these tiny little areas they've got a real big problem
they said that what they were doing was scraping it with bulldozers and stuff and taking it to
these ponds that they had to filter it with
the ponds because they've had so much rain in the past few years they just
they overflow into the creeks and stuff in the area
that just creates
there's
it was just disgusting
people stand outside their houses and watch the creeks foam brown and all
that's bad
i'm just like my gosh
the smell is really bad they sa-
i don't know
it really frightens me though as far as thinking of just air pollution itself
channel thirteen they're really emphasizing the problem with acid rain
if we keep putting that stuff into the air and if we keep creating the problem and not doing anything about it it's really going to be a problem for what the earth is receiving back
cutting the trees that bothers me
as far as the
we've been wanting to
not me
it's been suggested that we cut a few of the trees down here
for what's cut down here more will be cut down someplace else
it will just take that longer to grow back
trees help so that
they do because what is it carbon dioxide
they're synthesizing it for us
yeah
i think there's lots that could be done to improve how things are done now
i don't know personally
i suppose if you just make sure your car is working properly
they're suppos-
i think the main thing is just keep on your legislators back as far as
it's really becoming a problem
what are we going to have
what will we
i don't know if i know anything or not
i've got some opinions on it
those type of people that have the most opinions ones that don't know anything
i've had teenagers
i now have grandchildren that are teenagers
i don't know that it might do them a little bit of good to see the world from a different perspective
i think this me generation has gone far too far
the young people are overly impressed
i think it wouldn't hurt them to step back from themselves just slightly and see things from a far more disadvantaged viewpoint
i personally know nothing about the peace corps though
me either
i went to college and then started working and then got married
they have
i'm out on a limb here some type of college volunteer work for teachers that they are straight out of college
they do one year of volunteer work teaching in the lower income brackets of the united states
i know that my sister
when they graduated she went to teach in a small town down in south texas
i know that if you have college notes if you teach in a lower income bracket where they don't pay as much and they cancel part of your your college note or whatever
if it's really a lower paying job where in a small town you don't obviously you don't need as much as far as to live
this is money that she's borrowed to form her college education
she got credits for it
i think it would be
i know that also one of my cousins who he is in the therapy type thing
he was
he was required to go back and work for a certain number of years in this town at
it's a nursing home or something like that
if
i think that's a good way maybe get people to come back to these small towns to work by helping people that normally might not be able to go to college and get the type of degree they want
it's beneficial to the small towns too because
they really have a disadvantage that we wouldn't understand because we're in the metroplex
as far as getting doctors and all that stuff yeah
if we had some really major health problem that required a specialist we could find one it wouldn't be convenient
we could find one
i can see the advantage to that one
the peace corps itself is really dying out isn't it
i think of the peace corps more like the sixties and that kind of stuff when
don't they go into other countries and stuff
dig their own wells set up
it definitely would give a lot of the kids now that have everything given to them that they want to see what it's like if you don't have all the money and can't have what you want when you want it
they're pretty good
at the same time i think it would do them a world of good
there's a
i don't know that you could require everyone
do that for
mandatory just like the draft
somebody's didn't really want to be there and didn't have
there would be loopholes just like there is in anything else
they'd figure a way around that one in a heartbeat
maybe this is why this has died out
this wasn't the question
it may be the more of the issue versus should young adults
can they go in there and can anyone go out of
i think bangladesh would have been a good example or some really desperate situation
teach them to farm teach them
it doesn't do any good
don't know that if you step back from the current issue and look at it more intellectually there are forever over as long as we know there are races of people that are dropping out
we're losing certain
there are people now that are obsolete point and fact just like endangered species of animals so there are quote tribes of people
i'm just wondering if you're fighting a natural process there of being winnowed out
i never can remember what it was
they're being winnowed because where they are they're not adapted to their environment essentially
one of the quick examples is the aborigines
when we were in australia
sad little things i felt sorry for them because their society isn't there anymore
their belief system and all the structures of their society are gone essentially
they're just kind of more like a side show than anything else
that's sad
i don't think there's any way the peace corps could go in and rescue those people
i don't think you could have done it fifty or a hundred years ago either
i'm wondering if the peace corps is
we've got enough without a passport
maybe rather than just require somebody to join the peace corps for a year maybe during college maybe have some kind of course where they'd be required to do some kind of community service type work and help people in that area or people in the united states
i've been out of school too long to answer this
i wonder if there aren't some sociology courses
there probably are
i'm sure
that's probably like people that do that are the people that are going to go into social work and stuff
i think that it wouldn't really be half bad for everybody not to do something and realize it's everybody's responsibility to help these people
they have to be taught to be
i know that's what my father-in-law was talking about when you give these people money
they were bringing up points asking as far as whether they need to give more money to these people
that's not really the answer because if they're alcoholics they'll just go out and spend
it on booze or something like that
come on let's be realistic
or to find a job where they can learn how to support themselves
i guess we're getting kind of off the subject
it's
that's more realistic than making them go in the peace corps
i think that we should be spending more time
again i don't think the peace corps is as successful now simply because it doesn't fit the circumstance anymore
we've got plenty
you're in what flower mound
we're a little farther removed from dallas and some of the areas where they probably have more of the homeless and that type of thing
have you been downtown recent-
right now they've got a kind of a central location off of the main highway
they've got some great big bins there for newspaper plastic i think three bins for glass white green and whatever other combination there is
i think they've got some kind of container for aluminum
they start off putting out great big huge garbage cans
of course it doesn't fit right now
now we start in may breaking it down
they're picking it all up
they're going to by
we have to separate our papers and our glass
they have one day for everything you picked up from your yard
we put that in disposable bags
they pick that up on monday
it's really great
i'm completely for it
that's good
rowlett had sent out a survey not too long ago in terms in how many people were interested in having a pick up i guess on the days they do trash or something like that
apparently a lot of people responded to it favorably because they're going to do it
i don't know how soon they're going to do it or how organized it's going to be
they're supposed to initiate that sometime in the next couple of months
does your
i've never noticed that
we don't have a whole lot because we're in a hospital setting
most of the things we have are through our cafeteria
down in the cafeteria do they have any place where you can put your pop cans and things like that
there's only one pop machine
it's not accessible to the cafeteria now
mainly what they serve in there is juice and coffee and tea
not really
i work at j c penny
last week they brought
they're going to recycle them
it's getting people clean out their closets and such
the week before that they said go through your cupboards and any food that is still good bring it in
they brought it down to the shelters
they have one two they have three i think that i know of for cans for people have pop
they put them right near where they have the time cards
it works great
they have one in the room where the
they're really going at it
i think it's marvelous because
i guess rowlett's done a lot for the size town it is
i think they're trying to make some changes
i noticed at the library or someplace this past month month and a half ago they were having a speaker talk about doing lawn work and how important it is to cut your lawn without a bag just to kind of mulch it
rather than bag it up because of all the grass that's being bagged and being hauled away by the garbage trucks and stuff
it's i guess a lot more ecological to just mow the grass and let it work it's way back into the soil
did you watch the program the other night on was it save america
the only thing i thought that i haven't been trying is when i go to take a shower to save the water
i've already gone to
i started years ago i guess not years ago
i would say five years ago turning off my water faucet
i didn't realize that was the biggest waste of water
i missed that question totally really bad
i did exceeding well
i didn't realize that our garbage isn't being decomposed
there are a lot of things that aren't
that's one of the things i wonder about
one of the questions was do you think more should be done or something else
i wonder about some of the products that they don't take like some of the plastics and things that they don't take why they couldn't do more recycling with those
i was in bizmart the other day
what i don't understand is there is recycled paper in there
it cost more than regular paper
it was only i think forty cents more fifty cents more
it upset me to realize that they're going through the expense of recycling
people aren't buying it
the cost of it is higher
i seen a lot of adds recently for organic fertilizers and lawn additives and that type of thing
the cost is double or sometimes triple
the regular fertilizers and things you buy
in in terms of that
for the environment there's a good reason to do it
the cost is kind of prohibitive
that's recycling
that people would use this stuff over again
it's like when he was saying which one was recyclable which was reusable
the recycle ones are better to use
lots of times you don't even see the signs on the bottles
if we're going to really do something they ought to put that stuff out bigger for people to see it
you haven't got enough nerve to say put it back
i'd heard something stranger
talk about bottles the other day on the radio station they were talking about the
i think it's in canada they're using recyclable milk jugs plastic milk jugs
as a reinforcement for roads
apparently they don't break down very easily
they don't expand or contract when the weather changes
they're
along that same line they said they were using
it was toilets
smashing them up because that stuff there is great in road work
i thought that's good
i saw recycling on tires between
hoses were being used
soaker hoses made out of old tires
i was trying to remember what it was i can't think of it now
i was trying to get my kids to see different things that we could come up with for recycling purposes
just anything to recycle rather than keep throwing it away
my biggest problem is i take the bags out of the store buy the bags to bring the back
i forget to bring them in the store
i wish they'd really push this recycling bit because i really didn't realize how much stuff i actually throw away
i think the more people are aware of it the more they'll do
i think that's just the biggest problem is keeping it in front of the public so they understand how serious the problem is and how important it is to do that
what i'd like to see a little more
if they get the little tiny kids saving it now
i really amazed to find out that eighty per cent are filled now in garbage fills
i might not have that much
i wouldn't
they always offer credit cards for college students
i went ahead and accepted every one that i was offered
i pack around a lot of them
i only use a few of them
they make it really easy for people to get credit cards especially college students
i have two daughters who both are in college
in fact one has finished now
they both have
they give you such high credit limits
it's easy to get caught up in the minimum payment trap
they give you the credit limit
you're always seemingly up to that limit
i have quite a few credit cards that i'm always almost up to the limit on most of them
that's how a lot of people get into trouble
i've got two that usually i'll have a balance on
all of the others i just try to use kind of like you would an american express card and pay it off every month
that way i feel like i'm getting a thirty day loan
i don't have to worry about running them up too high except at christmas
then they usually get run up pretty
you have a lot of discipline
i'm trying my best right now to pay off some of mine
i've paid off about four credit cards this year
still i have some that
especially the visa card that you can go and get cash on
it seems like every time i'm short of cash i just go get it from visa
that's
can you use it at a bank machine
you can go in a bank and just hand them the visa card and say i want a cash advance
if they've sent you a number that you can use a personal identification number that you can use in the impact machines or whatever you can do that
i have one that i don't have a pin number for
sometimes you have to ask them for that
i have one that just gave me the pin number automatically
we got
that's funny you said that because my husband and i got credit cards in the mail one day that we hadn't even applied for
a couple of weeks later we got pin numbers
we got a bill saying the yearly fee it was like forty dollars
we cut them up and sent them back because we hadn't even applied for them
we didn't want them
they had just automatically approved us and sent them without even contacting us
i thought i don't know if i trust this or not
everybody in the world will offer you a credit card
it's hard
it's tempting when you see something to say well i'll just charge it
sometimes i'll do that
usually i i will try to pay everything off the next month
the ones that usually have an outstanding balance all the time i'll pay more than the minimum payment
just i feel like even that little bit helps
the way the economy's going and inflation and the recession and all that i think we really need to try to stay out of debt as much as possible
that's why i've really started to try to pay off mine and get out of debt because we never know when we might get laid off or something
they've had a lot of layoffs lately
i work for t i too
i think they're getting ready to probably sell us out our division
they just announced that didn't they
it's kind of a bad time to be a slave to your credit cards
it certainly is
i have worked on a part time job where i was a collector
for a jewelry company
people that
they have about a thousand collectors i guess
there's just so many people that have bought jewelry which is really a luxury item they just can't pay for it
something happens
you hear so many stories listening to them like they lost their job
they've signed for a friend
they got it in their name
they got it for a friend
the friend
now they're stuck with the bill
it's ruining their credit
you really have to watch this
every month all of these credit cards report to the credit bureau automatically most of them do
if you're
bad because if your bill is due on the fifteenth then you're not past due until the fifteenth of the next month
if you pay one day after that fifteenth you're not one day late
they don't recognize any time difference do they
we need to watch our credit reports and all that kind of
that's something i never thought about getting checking with to see what your credit report looked like
you can do that
you didn't
you might think you're paying something on time
you by that day
you're thirty days is not real bad though anyway
something you haven't paid in sixty days or ninety days and things like that
i think that discover card has a good idea with giving you a little cash back incentive for each amount you purchase as long as you don't go crazy trying to get cash back
since they don't have the yearly fee
i haven't gotten one
just because
i would think it wouldn't be much more than the eighteen or nineteen percent everyone else charges
that wouldn't be too bad
there's a couple of other places that are able to charge us twenty-one and twenty-two percent interest
i know i had a charge with spiegel
when i did i realized that it just seemed like i was never paying the balance off
i looked at the credit card agreement one day
it was like twenty-three percent interest
i've always watched it since then
there's no point in giving them any more money than we have to
they can't bill you any higher than eighteen percent i think in texas
that's great
there are a couple of states that can
one to watch out for is anybody that bills you out of
let's see
they weren't supposed to process it until they delivered it
i changed my mind
they went ahead and charged it on my account
it took me about eighteen months to get all of that mess off of my account
that's probably the worst thing i've ever had happen with a credit card
have you taken anything back lately that you've bought
the only thing we've taken back recently are plants
we had no problem with it
we got our money back
do you think that consumer goods are generally getting better or worse in quality
i don't
i believe that they're better now
wh-
electrical appliances i think are pretty good reliable
did you return it
the people told me that's the way it's supposed to be
i fell for it
when i got this one it heated a little bit warmer
after one year it started heating only on one side
you or your husband can be warm but not both
i figure anybody that is dumb enough to iron needs to have an iron that will last a long time
one year of ironing only once a week is not long enough for it to last
without even any question
i think it was the store
have you been buying any clothes lately any new clothes
the last thing i bought was a dress last summer
the buttons turned on it over the winter
i have not gone back about it
it was an expensive dress
they should have put buttons on it that would last forever
one the chain belt loop half of it raveled out
that was i believe a leslie faye dress
it was i think over a hundred dollars
i did that one
of course i do too
i believe that we've been talking about five minutes
norma it is just wonderful to talk to you
what part of virginia
i live down in the south western part of blacksburg
i hadn't been down in that part of the state really
we vacation a lot
i wish we did
we go to maine every fall then that's kind of a family visit and a vacation all up and down the coast i have a daughter in texas and one in new mexico
we go out there
we go to florida down
it really depends
None
my fiancee's family's from wisconsin we've been out there a couple of times
i went to purdue for a couple of years
i've gone up to indianapolis on occasion to visit friends i'm a real big baseball fan
i usually try to combine it with catching a couple of games somewhere
i'm a big red sox fan
i
you're a red sox fan too
i go to cleveland to see them play
that's about it
we do a lot of little trips around here
we've gone out to a place in western pennsylvania called falling water
have you ever heard of it
it's really neat
it's this house built on a waterfall
it's really cool
of course we keep picking crummy weather to go out there
the first time we went out there was the day after hurricane hugo had come through
they didn't have any power
it was really cold and rainy
we went up about a year later
it was better but not a whole
where else did we go
did you
my girlfriend has with her sisters
i haven't been
i hear that's nice
just to catch a football game actually
when we came back from the outer banks we came up due norfork
spend a day and a lot of money
i've heard
i'm not real interested in williamsburg because of the price attached
it's pretty neat down to just go and walk around if you like to walk
i can wander around without
i think they do the whole with paying
they really did throw away a lot of money getting one thing or another
they had a good time
we really didn't do that really this time we just visited around
that's enough for
i was
my
up around san francisco
there was one year when my father's company was starting to do stuff down in los angeles
my father was working down in los angeles for like six months or so
it was closer i think to a full year
he'd fly down there on mondays and fly back on fridays
any time we had a school vacation or something like that we went down to los angeles
i went to disneyland about five times
i really have no great urge to go back now
it was great because the times that were really fun were when we had vacation
the kids in los angeles didn't we basically had one of the parks
there's still a lot of people at disneyland
there was another amusement park down there busch gradens
there was nobody there when we were there we won a log floating ride like five straight times
we just get done with them and they go do you want to go again
we really enjoy that
i keep wanting to get further
i thought i would go to florida a couple summers
never did it
my sister lives in charlotte
they've gone to
we're getting married in about
are you
our honeymoon we're going up to this place in wisconsin called door county
is it on one of the lakes
it's
there's kind of like a little thing sticking out
they call it the cape cod of the
we're thinking that'll be a lot of fun
she had this book of pictures from it that were really nice kind of like a travel guide that should be a lot of fun
i don't know what our next trip will be i guess our next
i know what my next trip i'm going to be a grandmother in july
the first one
my next trip is going to be to texas
that'll be fun
in the middle of the summer
they'll be air-conditioning anyway
is that how you got into this
data base
i was just
most of the people i've talk to are from texas
when i heard you were from virginia i was like okay there's somebody different
you said i got somebody down in texas
i
there's been a couple of other the people most of whom are like me that work in speech labs that are going to use data base
i see
it was fun
yesterday i ended up talking to somebody else from the same lab i'm in
she's working on this project too
she's talking on the project too we got back monday
i got a call yesterday
that's neat
i haven't had something like that happen just getting the one guy
you're sure have a nice town
my sister lives on lake
we keep wanting to get down there and visit them over the summer
just so we haven't been able to take really
i'm know real sure there are
there's one in salem salem rebels
i maybe seeing them in a town just west of here frederick has a minor league team that
i think we may be seeing them this
that's a nice little town actually frederick
there's some nice things in baltimore
the inner harbor and the
they've just done a
i
the aquarium is one of those things that because everybody
how do you think we've changed in the last ten to twenty years
i'm at a little bit of a loss
i don't know
i'm about twenty-eight now
when i was eighteen
people are being a little less bigoted in some ways
it seems to me that civic freedoms are more restricted
that may just be because i've changed
i used to live up north
down here dallas seems to me the police are militant
did you
how long you been in dallas
about eight years
in fact in the eight years i've been here it seems to me it gets to be more and more restrictive place to live
yeah as you're talking like police and stuff like that it's definitely a tough job to do
crime has got a lot worse in the last ten fifteen years
maybe that has a lot to do with it
i definitely think that has gotten a lot worse
i think there's
i'd say my own personal lifestyle has improved that's more a matter of
i'm no longer a teenager in high school
i think there's more pressure on both parents to work and things like that than there used to be
i don't know
that's one thing i see a lot more double income families and a lot more baby sitters raising the kids and things like that i guess
you can't make it
i guess when i was growing up it was still the ideal to get a home and buy house
these days you see a lot of people living in apartments forever you just don't buy a house
that's a good point
i'm trying to think of anything else that's changed over the last ten or twenty years
i don't know i think the middle class is shrinking and the lower class is expanding sooner or later there's going to be a turn around
i hope so at some point
i don't know at what point
i think it's going to be at the expense of the middle class usually is i think
on the other hand there's a lot of injustice that needs to be changed
what department do you work in
how long you been with them since you moved down here
i'm over at the center one building
it's a small world
let's see
second floor you work with linear
do you know alec morton
you do
he comes up and pushes us around
i'm pretty familiar with
seventh floor
boy he comes up there and gives us all kinds of grief
they say it's what makes him happy is to give us d a d grief
i can believe it
been with t i like twelve
i started out in lubbock
the people all seem to be a lot more laid back too
here in dallas everything is just real rush rush
living in the city is a whole different social structure
i got some friends that
seems like he went to school at devry
i see
he went to school somewhere in ohio
he's from that area
he works over in the park central building i think
i haven't talked to him in a while
yeah
he misses it
he used to go back twice or three times a year because he missed it
i haven't been back in ten fifteen years
let's see
how long are we supposed to talk here
i think we ran out of social changes to talk about
my kids are probably needing me to go
all right
it's nice talking to you
None
what do you think that problem is
i think a lot of it has to do with the fact that we don't train our teachers very well
we put the schools in the hands of professional educators instead of the teachers and the parents
we put too much responsibility on the teachers
that seems like you've thought this through quite a bit before
i have some rather strong opinions
i'm
i was not very happy with the results
if you were to improve it what would you do to improve it
i would use the money that we've paying them to provide some special help in training and particularly mentor teachers to work with the beginning teachers and the teachers who may have been at it a long time
pay attention to what's happening talk to the teachers talk to their kids about school and support the institution
instead of becoming adversaries to the teachers so that the teacher's in the middle
that's some pretty good ideas
you should run for a school board position
that i'm not so sure about
my mother was on the school board
that basically is the extent to which our family has been directly
my parents through the p t a organization
my mother was on the school board for eight years
that's the extent of which i guess that's more than some people less than others
i would tend to agree with you that there is a problem
i believe that there's definitely a basic perception and image problem with the fact of even being a teacher
if there was a way through the public mind set that image to be a little higher esteem a little more prestige to being a teacher
with that of course you have to pay them accordingly
if we paid them more it would attract more the higher educated people to move into that field to continue in that field
if you paid them more you'd also be able to demand a higher quality product out of them
rewarding people who've been doing a lousy job instead of getting the improvement that we want
we'd have to have some way to reward and recognize the teachers who are doing a good job and give them a pat on the back and respect and some honor and more money
it's hard to tell
it's a business or an occupation that the results are not as tangible as other ones
it's very difficult to say that this teacher is doing a better job than this other one other than i guess how a person scores in the beginning before the class and then after the class
if there's some gauge that they could make
also i've thought about the idea of making teaching and the
some certain type of position where you're overseen to begin with
that's a very good suggestion
rather than throw someone into that environment it i thought that maybe something
i don't think student teaching is enough
i think that at least what i used to observe in student teaching was that some college kid who might not be all that bright to begin with was thrown into a class room with a teacher who was harried and overworked and had too many kids to handle and too many things to do and too many interruptions to pay much attention to the student teacher
the student teacher didn't stay but about six weeks
there really was no time to try
much of anything and get significant feedback that would help the student teacher improve very much
students could watch that and criticize the methods used and analyze it figure out what worked and what didn't work
also to video tape the student teachers so they could correct their own performance
that's good as a teaching aid
more you see these commercials that have jimmy walking into class late and it happens that the teacher is an instructor who is in new york while jimmy's in rome
the whole electronic classroom idea
i don't know if i i'm in favor of
i think especially in the younger years you need to have more of the person contact rather than just the fact that your machine being fed information to learn how to learn
another thing i think would be helpful would be to have some sort of say a national curriculum because one of the problems with getting good textbooks is that we have such a fragmented system for curriculums that the textbook makers produce a textbook that will sell in texas and california
everybody else is stuck with that regardless of what they want to teach
that's the two states that adopt on a state wide basis
it
it was absolutely clear that if you could get your book adopted by texas then you had a built-in market because there were only about three or four textbooks in each subject
all you had to do is just get your share of those adopted in the individual school districts
a third of the texas market with its millions of kids is a heck of a lot of textbooks
the states that don't adopt on a state wide basis or don't have as many kids just have to follow along and take what texas gets
texas adopts state wide all the way through the twelfth grade
definitely is a national problem that they need to address
i hope maybe we're going to get somewhere with a little more attention being paid to it with reagan's new education secretary trying to produce some new programs anyway
i've enjoyed speaking with you
it looks like a little shot gun house almost
it's an older home
i wouldn't know
because we had saw some termites
we thought about getting it sprayed
where do you live at
what part of town here in denison
that's north
down here in denison
i live in plano
it's north to me
you don't have a texas accent
i'm originally from ohio cincinnati
i'm familiar with
the
the way in which people speak
my home i guess it's about twenty-five hundred square foot
i have four bedrooms at the present
we're going to enlarge our master bedroom and take out a couple of walls and enlarge it and then shuffle the rooms around a little bit
we've got a den
we need the one extra room
like you said the bedrooms are too small
the bedrooms are too small
there's they
they tend to put windows in the strangest places
we have windows in our bathrooms which really makes it difficult for
you're kind of limited in what you can do there and everything
we've got at least two windows on every wall in the house
you can't really clean them on the inside
the house is about i'd say almost thirty years old
it's not a new home
it's seen some wear and tear
he did it hisself
most of that by now is falling apart
it's not just horrible
this tiles come loose off the wall
i don't like that at all
that is awful
with that the great big square tiles that you put on the floor
the huge one
i wouldn't mind it if it was short tiles
this looks like floor covering on the wall
also they're very heavy
they tend to come off a whole lot easier
short of putting nails through it we can't get it back on
he rewired the house
it's shorting out here and there
that's one of the things we've been fortunate with is our wiring is okay
we don't have enough power
our breakers aren't powerful enough to really help with the load in the house
we need to redo some rewiring ourselves
our plumbing is awful
there is a shut off valve that's outside that doesn't work
there's no other real shut off valves inside the house
if something breaks we have to shut it off from the main in the street
it can be really bizarre
we never know where it's going to flood
it runs about ten minutes fast except for about a month the clock ran normal
the power went off again
we hooked it back up
now it's running ten or fifteen minutes fast again
on the east side of the house it runs fine
boy you do have a strange wiring problem there
no
that's something
he won't even touch electrical stuff
he'll do a little things
he won't do any major rewiring
that's about as far as he'll go
that's the way mine is
he said he went up in the attic and looked around
he was like my god
we had squirrels in our attic when we first moved in because the roof was so sorry
when we moved in
he put
husband probably knows
he's got seven layers of shingles up there
he told us it was a completely new roof
we stripped ours off
we completely stripped all the old wood shingles off put decking up put the paper down and just started from scratch
we had almost i'd say about half of the roof off
it did this
a house full of snow
a house full of snow and rain
it came down
we have plastic just tied down on everything as best we could
real thick edge stuff
the wind came in from the north
it just blew everything off in the middle of the night
we were asleep
i woke up
i got up
it was about four o'clock in the morning
i heard all these drips drip drip drip drip drip drip
it filled up my light fixtures because they're the old kind
i would go in
i'd turn on a light in the room
the light would come on
the whole thing would be full of water
the light would still come on
the neighbor's washing machine had over done something
it was leaking just pouring water in
it all went through to her roof
it was coming out of the lights fixtures
she woke up with about six feet of water in her house
my lord
it's quite a bit quite a bit
did you have carpets and stuff
several of our rooms got ruined
we have
we are on pier and beam
it got into the carpeting got into the floor
it got into the floor and rotted the floor and made it stink
they had it
the insurance company was paying for the new roof
they also ended up having to pay for the damage when the roof was being repaired
which really wasn't our fault
we'd done everything we could to keep out the weather
and stuff
you got to redo it the way you wanted it in the end
the roof
it's been done for quite some time
it's three
it's just been at three years
it had a detached garage
my husband's built a walkway across
we're going to brick up the garage to match the house and things like that
what the walk
this is what
they're varied
they don't encompass many handcrafts like knitting and that kind of thing
i do quite a bit of wreath making
my dogs are my hobbies
what do you mostly do
mostly right now
we're about to take the kids to
i've got a little girl who's six and a little girl that's three
i think that's better than having that party at home
this is a friend's party
they rented
they
they just rent skates and stuff for the kids
the skating rink does the rest practically
not that long
just since october
we did spend twenty years in norman
we needed to get back to our older parents
i am loving it
what did you all do
my husband was with university of oklahoma and
he went with
he just quit a perfectly good job and we
is he working there then
he's doing quite a bit of consulting work and
he's contemplating
he's liking this free time
how did you get hooked up with the t i switchboard thing
i see
my wife has talked more than i have
i haven't
the call was probably for her
they wouldn't accept my t i n number
we put hers in
like i said we're
some of
they've all been in dallas
she hasn't talked to anybody
that's interesting
you haven't told me what sports that you are active in
the sport i like best probably is basketball
i guess i'm probably better at softball
i'd
during the summer months it's occupies quite a bit of my
i play in a couple of leagues and occasionally in a tournament or something on a weekend
my family usually goes with me
i think that's easy entertainment for a
they
a good friend of mine that plays on one of my teams we
they have a couple of kids that are almost my kids age
they play together
tina enjoys
that's kind of nice
it's getting
it's been raining a lot here so far
we haven't really had any kind of real heat
i think it's going to be warm enough this afternoon we were noticing a while ago it's already eighty in the house
it looks like an air conditioner
maybe this evening anyway
i'm sure you're familiar with that living
we go through enid quite a bit
my parents live in southern illinois
we drive
lot of times we take seventy-five
it seems like that goes through enid
enid is
it's directly across the state from tulsa
i know i've seen
enid is
not an unknown little city
it an awful lot of people know where it is or have been there
was a very self-sufficient wealthy
until everything happened
there's a lot of
you said you've just lived in north carolina just
you really like
it there
i've never been there they sure
it's
this winter
if it got to be forty degrees i decided it was too cold to walk the dogs
my wife and i spent a couple years
it rains
a lot there
you get used to it
it's like a fine mist all the time
it doesn't really
that's the way it was there too
i know it did it all february
some people said to me that's our wintertime
i know you
i've enjoyed talking to you
i have enjoyed talking to you too
thank you
i hope you enjoy
i hope
how long have they been recycling there in virginia
quite a while
i've lived here for six years
i'm sorry
i live in an apartment my ap-
they have facilities here in my apartment complex for recycling paper only
i've been recycling for maybe about two years now and at another public facility where they have recycling of glass aluminum and paper
have you recycled plastic also
that's what i don't understand exactly why they don't have that option
we have out here up until just this last year in on you are town there wasn't any really good way
not all that many
it wasn't very well advertised recently the refuse department is working on getting a system going where we will actually have a bend that we put things in for recycling these other things it should be good
i think it's a marvelous idea when i just think of the papers that i dump out there just
an additional thing is
where i work they also have recycling there of all white paper and of cans also a lot of people right at the vending machines
they have receptacles that
near the
xerox machines they have places for your
i keep a little box at my desk
as i'm using the white paper i just throw it right in there
they have someone that comes around and pick it up every afternoon which is an excellent idea
i guess one of the things i think that needs to happen is we need to be better informed about it
there's needs to be more public
service programs or something that would let us know had happens to it and helps us to become enthused about it because of what is happening there's
i think that's a shame
they need to do a little more
i'd like to know for instance when they say plastic all plastic what kind of plastic
maybe they just sort it after they get it and throw out what they can't use
i don't know i'd be glad to organize it
i have to actually go to two different recycling areas because one of them is that
their aluminum cans is for children's hospital for a burn fund all the monies are donated
there because the other
that gives
before even at work
saving them for you
i would have them drop their cans off in my office
i would haul them here to this place for the children's hospital fund which got people really going into it
i think helping us be more enthusiastic about it
helping us maybe using the money for something special that would be like paying off the national debt
i think that's
i think there needs to be a little bit more in the area of advertisement
and public letting you understand
more of what it is you're doing why you're doing it how it's done and
what happens to it because i think that would help a lot
i'm sure in the near future i would think they would be coming out with more
i've seen a definite trend towards more recycling
everywhere even at mcdonald's
with their use of no
i'm glad
i think it is getting more advertisement
all these things that
i think
i'm that's about my
i enjoyed talking to you
i did too
i have
i used to have the opinion that there really was not any more crime in america in the cities than there was in previous centuries before
the reason there seems to be so much was the fact that the police now had advanced reporting methods with computers and other devices
those statistics
however i have been persuaded lately i guess simply by the overwhelming data that seems to be available that there is indeed a lot more violent crime
i am in washington d c
i do a lot of business here
i come here quite often
that again is a sort of media perception there's some absolutely lovely and marvelous and peaceful areas in washington
it's real
there's pockets of violence that is so violent that they
just to focus on that a minute i guess
became the drug czar for president bush he was going to focus on this area and do something about it
i see that even he was met with little success even though i guess quite a bit of money and other planning efforts went into that
what do you think is causing all this
it seems that there
i have three theories about it three things
it's brought to us by two things
one i believe that this is a function of the violence that young people see on television and the movies
i am not just talking about role models of tough guys and gangsters and things like that
i am not even convinced that maybe things like football hockey and even baseball games now where everything is settled with a fight the immediate need to
i am an advocate of hand gun control to some degree
i think that particularly
i was reading the other day about corpus christi texas which has the highest
i think it's corpus christi that had the highest rates per hand gun death in america per capita
i have not seen that
the saturday night special stuff
None
i tend to agree with you with
it seems anymore a movie can not be considered good unless there's just some sort of violence
along with that
you start making a movie and
they just throw something in there just to say they have it
that's the impression i get
i imagine that it just feeds upon itself when we have this sort of violence in society
you have to amp-
it has to be even magnified to attract people's attention i guess
i am sure that it does form role models for young men and young women
i read now where we are
young women are arrested fighting with knives over whatever reason which is kind of unheard of when i was young
i do not want to sound like an old fart
seems that those things did not happen in that manner before television
i have to think that it has some influence on it
i listened to a radio talk show today at lunch time rush lynn bottom
there's a fellow that had called in and was lamenting about the
they were just really coming down on him because of just some of the things that he believed in some of his morals
for instance they asked him if he spanked his kids
he said you bet i believe in discipline
people i guess they confused discipline with punishment
it seems anymore that if you have this type of a moral stance that people come down on you
it's like hey everybody has to be free to do their own thing
i disagree
i think that's really contributing to this high rate of crime
i guess what i wanted to say was that there's so much of a return to prison that the rehabilitation programs seem to be a failure
i recognize there's over crowding problems
since we have decided to put everybody in jail that commits a crime now that's complicated the entire process
i guess it's the reflection of the society where we have so much more mobility and less attachment to
it does not seem to be any responsibility to the community where you live
i do not mean attachment and responsibility
nobody feels responsibility to do something
it's like boy i wish they would stop doing that
i do not know how that's
i do not think it's done by
i am sort of an advocate of having free speech
i guess to curb
the violence on television and in the movies would be contrary to my beliefs in that
how many
the sacrifice is not that great
what you see and how yo-
what you see affects how you think and therefore what you do
i think that's correct
as soon as you start
texas has always struck me
i have lived in and out of texas both in the service and short business stints
it seems to me they are a pretty tough law and order state
that's a
yet that does not seem to have effected the amount of violent right in the state
just citing that
unfortunately you have got a lot of the
a lot of it can be contributed to the racial differences just that we are so close
i talked with people from richardson and plano
the first three days
yesterday i talked with someone from pennsylvania
i tried to make calls two different days
i couldn't get through
i know
i've been trying to do that
sometimes i just can't wait that long
i just hang up
i knew as soon as i heard your voice
i thought it's kathy kester
let's see
you're such a reader i know that
i don't read all that much for enjoyment
i read a lot for school
i just don't have much time for enjoyment reading
the last book i picked up was a book by judy bloom
it was called smart women i think
or something like that
it was kind of
it was written back in the early eighties
it was all this divorced woman syndrome of the
it was almost like a pre-aids scare kind of thing
i right away looked at when it was copyrighted
because i could tell by the theme almost when it was written
it was all about women searching for themselves
that kind of was kind of a pop psychology time for when a lot of books like that were coming out i think
that makes real sense that that's when it was written
i wasn't really aware that she had written anything for adults
just more aware of her jer-
she's more famous for that
she has been writing for adults also
i thought i'll just try this
it was very
i wonder if she's written anything really recently if she's got anything in print
i remember seeing a new book by her that was out
i think it was an adult book
that's the last thing i've read
let's see i think i read
when i was on semester break between spring and summer i went to my mother's
i read a book that i should have read when i was probably in high school
i read jane eyre
it was pride and prejudice
i didn't know what to expect except i had heard that jane austen was such a wonderful novelist
i was very much impressed with the way her plot was put together so
i just
as i say i was pretty much ashamed that i hadn't read something before then
because i think i read it in college
or had to read it in high school or college
i don't remember it
when jennie had to read it at gettysburg i got her someone
i think it was some actress reading it
how interesting
they had an abridged version of it on tape
i got that for her
she loved doing that
i'll bet
i remember that was the book
i think it's around here somewhere
i read that
i'm trying to think
usually i try to find something long
if i have long periods of time like christmas vacation or when i know i'm not going to be doing anything for a while
that's what i do too
that's about it because otherwise i'm reading so much for school
i have just started reading a book
it's for school
it's for
there's a literary jour-
not a literary journal
i'm doing some reviews of books to sort of recommend whether or not a full-scale review should be done for the journal
how neat
just got a i got this one
most of the stuff is on literary criticism and philosophy
it's a biography
that's fascinating
it's fascinating
it's so long
i don't really have the time to read the whole thing
i think
it was written
the copyright is nineteen ninety-one
it's a brand new book
it's a brand new book
that would be wonderful to read something like that
this man really shed some light on
it was families had just loads of musicians
they just went from generation
just with these all passing it from one to the other
that's interesting
if that's kind of what
i have to
that's rough
at least i
that's a neat thing to be involved in
because i think my alma mater gettysburg i think they were just starting a magazine
i think that's probably sort of a thing to do in small colleges
you see a lot of small colleges doing things
because it attracts really a lot people's interest
another one of my projects this summer
translations what do you mean translations of
where for instance a baudelaire poem that was written
i see
the translations are all so different from one another
that's interesting
it's multiple translations of single works
let me tell you
None
there are days when i would prefer
this is not on the subject
i feel in light of some of the accidents and so forth that have happened lately that i think there are some occupations such as the health field the transportation field
they're already doing it in the armed forces where they handle weapons and so forth
they do it to prisoners i feel like it should be mandatory in some professions
i think if an employer feels that he wants to drug test employees and they don't like it then they should not be employed there
i would not mind it
i especially agree that if it's an area where they could cause somebody else harm or injury absolutely
i don't have a problem at all with employers testing in the hiring
None
uh-huh unless an employer has a reason to believe that the work competency of the employee is hurting the business
maybe it's
right it's not a problem
number one because generally if they are involved in that type of thing they are into theft as an employer
the first
my concern is
i'm not even
i'm concerned in the medical field
i think they should screen for alcohol in these areas too because i consider that a drug
that i think is even probably more widely abused by the masses than drugs so to speak
i know
when you consider they could be driving an airplane or driving a bus or a train it doesn't take that long
they don't have to be totally roaring drunk just a little off on their timing could mean life
now t i has the random testing policy our names or our employee numbers or whatever are in a pool i've already been tested once when i was hired and once since they initiated this random testing program
my word
i work with one girl who was tested her name got randomly selected three times in six months i think that's the only reason i have a problem with it when there's no reason to suspect someone
that's getting a little bit
as long as you accept that it is a random testing to alleviate
your name came out of pot when they spun the wheel
that's just the way it is
i would rather have it that way to know that i was chosen at random by a computer than to think that somebody turned me in because i think when you let other employees turn in people
there are so many people with their petty axes to grind it could really get out of hand
i would really rather know however
if somebody does observe you at a party using drugs i would think that it would be their obligation to report that
i guess you'd report that to a supervisor maybe anonymously or something because i would feel very uncomfortable working with someone i knew was using either illegal drugs or abusing alcohol
i'd feel really uncomfortable
there would be even be a situation where you were at a machine and working with somebody that was that way
we have a lot of people who work on the line
it wouldn't
they couldn't hurt me with their ten key or something
out on the line they've got people working some serious equipment
especially given today the drug abuse that goes on i just think employers have to have some kind of way to see that they're not being put at risk
i'm not sure but what some of the insurance claims aren't due to illnesses brought on by drug abuse or alcohol abuse
in the long run we're all paying for that it protects us in the long run hopefully when they do that
i was trying to remember there was a court case here where i live just a few months ago
the city workers they wanted to
the city government wanted to institute the random drug testing the city workers took them to court to protest saying that it invaded i guess the search and seizure amendment it's still tied up in the legal channels
i'm curious especially since t i a local employer is also already doing it seeing what they'll say about it especially since
is it just a small group of the employees that are concerned
it's the whole city
they just don't want to be drug tested
my husband and i have never been in a situation where somebody said you have to be drug tested
my husband's retired from i r s agents
in our minds we're thinking what's the big deal
you don't
it's not as big a deal
you sometimes wonder when these people protest so much
they say if you give them the right to do this then they're going to take some other right away from you
i firm- i think that an employer has the right to ask you to do anything
of course one of the big deals now too is that when you come into a company you sign a paper saying that i will go take a
how do you hold to yours
i never keep a budget
that's good
it's sort of always worked
that depends on the individual if they can
that's a lot of it
i know we tried several different ways
we didn't keep it up
she won't quit doing it
that was the envelope system
you put the cash in envelopes marked for that
you have one for entertainment and one for groceries et cetera
for some reason taking it out of that envelope and seeing it in cash instead of in check form causes you to realize how much is left
she even writes down on the envelope as she subtracts and kind of debits on each envelope
at the end of the pay period if she has any left that much is for fun or entertainment
they kind of work it that way
a seems like the problem that they were having of all the things that worked was not planning enough for the incidentals that we couldn't think about
those are the ones that will kill you
the accidental fee or the car repair or the things that weren't supposed to be every month
i couldn't probably be bothered doing that every month
ever since
we've been married almost thirty years now
you learn to get through to the end of the month
you wouldn't on payday think boy i can go do this and that and this and that
if you charge things you pay all your bills at the beginning of the month
you get paid the last day or next to the last day
there isn't anything left to spend anyway
that's true
we're going to go ahead and try to just live on what we earn instead of guessing ahead of what we probably will have next month
we tried to
we are paying them off now
there was a time when maybe we didn't take all of them off
you just sort of had to watch what you put in
for most of
i'm a substitute teacher
i've only substituted i guess for the last fifteen years
there's only been really one working
it works for me
i can't see that it would work for probably the majority of people
i could say it's kind of
that's good
you probably have a little extra than you have to have to
that's the difference there where sometimes i know if we've had an especially bad month and we're just almost getting down to payday then i think if we could really budget
that was a real eye opener
it is when you do it that way
to have lived by that every week would have been tough for me because sometimes i'll spend less on groceries but we'll go out
it's kind of hard to say this is how much you're going to spend going out for fun
we eat out a good deal at this point
i started subbing just to go on a vacation and saved
all that money because i knew that you couldn't spending
we were going to go for ten weeks
i started
it was paid for
it made a big
you enjoyed it better probably
i think that that's difficult for most people
then my father was
you never could afford anything although we could afford everything if he wanted to
if you're out in a department store and there's a sale you're just real careful not to let your urges get hold of you
that's excellent
i'm working on it
i never worried about saving money because we're in the savings plan at work
they took it out
i think though that we need to have some liquid around that you don't have to go through the company to get
we never had too much of that then we never had any really emergencies that
we didn't buy really new or expensive cars
i think the most we ever spent for a new car was like six thousand dollars
they were mainly used cars
that's the best thing to do
that's going to payoff on retirement
we've been
it
each time they used to call in and tell me their space is limited and to please
i almost forgot the topic
i was waiting so long for it to find somebody
what is your favorite t v show
major dad
you like that one
i love it
it's funny
i've never really watched that one
it's funny how you can just get in a mode where you only watch certain shows there's only a few that i like to watch routinely
probably my favorite is
i like shows like growing pains
what's the other one now they moved from tuesday night to wednesday night
i don't get to watch it very much
that's my favorite
i think basically they promote family values
i guess that is supposed to be put out at a time when i was growing up or whatever
it's just a real cute show
i guess i like the shows that really have a real sense of i don't know honesty or sort of a purity value i guess
i don't like lot of the shows that i've liked in the past like golden girls
some of them tend to get so risque
when you have children watching it that sometimes really starts to bother me that's one of the reasons
if you want to go all time favorite show probably one of them was little house on the prairie yeah
which i always felt was wonderful many of them nowadays like i said i think are just they go after
there was
there's a sense of i guess purity in the show
one of my favorite shows used to be happy days richie always used to be just so honest and pure i guess
when he left the show it seemed to be missing that part of it i never did like it after that i don't know
i see the same thing in wonder years and a lot of the shows that i like to watch
i agree
do you like the sports programming
i enjoy those also almost as much to a certain extent
our whole house is baseball fans we enjoy that
you're going to watch a game tonight
yeah
do you have a favorite for the series or anything
probably the pirates
only because of steve bushel i guess otherwise i really don't care that much
i'm annoyed that the rangers got rid of him
i'd like to see him do well all the way to the bank i guess
live in plano
i like steve bushel
i don't really like the pirates
i'm a big saint louis cardinals fan i'm kind of pulling for the braves over all
they've come from so far down
i keep hoping the rangers are going to do
one year they
maybe they'll make it i don't know yeah
i guess my favorite shows are the
that getting back to the point that you made that's really true
her daughter was talking about birth control my daughter was kind of walking in during that time
she's only seven years old
so many of them now it just seems like they feel like they have to stick that stuff in
i'm an adult i have adult tastes now
i don't need that i like things that are wholesome i guess
that seems to be more our values too
the wonder years it's kind of risque stuff maybe for teenagers
you can kind of relate to it
i enjoy that a lot i agree with you
it's funny because the shows
a lot of them that used to be considered risque like three's company and stuff i think they maintained
there was really the period that was going on there
he really wasn't messing around with the girls
everybody perceived him that way and stuff as soon as he went to move in with another girl the show just died it's interesting that a lot of the shows are that way
we're going to talk about what kind of clothes we wear while we work
you do
you're like me then
that's good
you are busy they're all girls
all girls around here
really sweet
anyway as far as clothing goes my wardrobe changes all the time depending on my size
they all rotate all the time kind of the same stuff all the time though
i don't get a whole lot new right now
when it's cold i'm wearing sweat pants
i like jeans a lot
that's good
now nothing seems to be comfortable because i bulge in all the wrong places
it's frustrating
i find i have to get the right kinds though or it's not comfortable they
it works best if they have pleats in the front they have to
it has to be not the straight up and down levis kind
i
when i was pregnant through the summer this time i wore dresses all the time because it was so much cooler and so much more comfortable not to have something binding on your waist
i remember i wore sundresses and just those real cool dresses almost the entire time
i had one that was born in december
it was a little bit because it was a real warm winter even into november and december i was still wearing the short sleeve dresses
i didn't really need warm clothes
i haven't tried those
they are so comfortable
it's just a light weight kind of a sweat suit but made out of that real light polyester stuff
it's just great because you can decorate them up or dress them up if you want
you can just wear them with tennis shoes if you want
they're really nice
i sure never wear them
i don't either
if we had professional jobs where we go into an office and have to wear a jacket or something that would make a
i worked part time when my oldest was a baby i had to wear a dress every day
it was a little bit hard to wind down
i would have to drive six thirty five home
i would be burning up like in the summer time by
i remember that from when i was
offices they keep them so cold in the summer that you can't wear regular summer clothes and be comfortable you've got to have something to add to it or something i don't know if you can
when you drive home especially if you're in a lot of traffic which you are in dallas
uh-huh i always hated to run my air conditioner just sitting still all the time i was afraid i'd make the car overheat
i would roll my windows down
i had a friend who used to take shorts to work
that's funny
after work she'd go in the bathroom
you can ruin your good clothes getting so hot in them especially if it's something that has to be dry cleaned which i don't have any of
even when i go to church i have to have something i can just throw in the washer when i'm through
i generally go to the quickie places just because they're cheap
we have four
most of them are gone now there might be
we were taking four five and six people out
we lived in ohio prior to this
we were up near cleveland
i look for service even at the quickie places type things
i don't like to go to the drive-thrus because sometimes they get your order wrong you're stuck
it's a pain to have to stand there and see what it is before you leave i really don't like the drive-thrus that much
i like to go and eat there
i would say service atmosphere and whether the food is good
on going out i like steaks
we try to hit those places when we can
my husband and i like getting the salads or the lighter meals that way they can get their burgers and fries
we can have a salad bar sometimes we drive for a couple hundred miles until we find a wendy's
in the countries unless it's a large city i guess dairy queen and wal-mart are their main
my husband likes dairy queens
he's a fan of dairy queen
we'll go even in town here at times just as a change although i'm not that excited about it
we eat out so much it's gotten so i don't like to really eat any place
yet i hate to cook food at home that might be why i look for inexpensive places just because we're eating out probably five nights a week maybe
we eat junk food at home now my husba-
what are some of your favorite inexpensive places
we'll go to them all
we
if not we can't because it's cheaper mine is i guess strongly monetarily based
we'll go get pizza at little caesar's although the kids prefer domino's
we are little caesar fans here that's where we always go
it's just a lot cheaper than domino's
mcdonald's we've sort of been off of that for a while
no particular reason
she never wanted us to show up there we don't go there that much
a nice meal
it's usually when we're out of town i'll order steak or steak and lobster combined it's really not in town
when we have something to celebrate we head to houston's
you wind up waiting about an hour the food is good
they've got a nice patio area that you can wait and get something to drink unless you get there at five o'clock
they have real good signature salads there and nice steaks
that's our nice place to go
we don't go out that much
i guess we do go out without kids
with my husband traveling he can get all he needs
i've been eating at home all week long with the kids and would like to go out somewhere
we have a conflict of interests on the weekend
i think i never have liked to cook food
i think it all began eating out when we had the boys on baseball tea-
it was mainly baseball teams my husband would coach
we were never home at the same time
i'm not one that's going to fix the meal at two o'clock in the afternoon so they can eat it all day whenever they're there
if there not there in between five and six then i guess we don't eat today
None
that really snowballed when we got down here when i started to sub make money i went i'll just sub to
the types of vacations that i usually take
then i do before i take it
i need to definitely take a vacation where all i do is rest
i guess to do that i'd probably have to take it at home
the vacation spots that i like to go to are places like the bahamas and florida
we went to cape hatteras
we were out visiting one of our kids in maryland
we went down to cape hatteras for a few days
the waves were huge
i've never quite seen waves like this one i was standing in water not more than barely above my ankles when the waves go in the waves go out they kind of all of a sudden you're in sand above your ankles
i was standing there talking to my daughter
this really big wave came and totally threw me
one foot did not come out of the sand
it tore the ligaments in my knee
i'm never going to another beach again
i enjoy going to the beach and to beach areas
i really don't like to get in the ocean
i love to go and play around
at least i always did although
i basically
my dream vacation is alaska
someday i hope we can afford to just take a humdinger of a vacation
i used to live in colorado sometime ago for a couple of years
i really enjoyed that
i'd like that
i haven't been to yellowstone for a long long time we've been talking about going there next summer
i don't know we'll have to
it seems when your family is different places a lot of trips involved
my mother and his mother
we have to go to those
you have a lot of vacation areas you can go to
i know
i'm tired of them
my idea i guess of the ideal vacation would be to begin with
just absolutely first class fly where i want to rent a car if i want to
just really the nicest hotels
that's what i would like to do
i would much rather get on a plane and get there and then enjoy myself
i just
that does absolutely nothing for me
i can say that i think my favorite spots are still to go where there's mountains and a lot of trees and wildlife to view
None
i agree
i can do that too
i think if i had the money i would probably go to europe every year
i think that they have it all over there in just a few tiny
two miles
there's mountains
there's beaches
i guess i've never really thought about it that way
she's a very picky eater
our standard excuse for not going someplace like that is holly would starve to death if
football i love this
we're from colorado
we're bronco fans
we just moved here two years ago
they went to the superbowl when we first moved here
they lost again
they seem to be doing pretty good this year
i was from illinois originally
i grew up a bear fan
then we moved here
we had some wonderful wonderful years there under roger staubach
we kind of got spoiled
have they just lost one game this year
i know they lost to washington and philadelphia
they're not doing bad
people are pretty surprised that they beat the giants
wasn't that fun
i must say i attracted a lot of attention
people running up saying what's the score what's the score
boy i bet all the men that got direct down there were just right on it
that's exactly what they said my wife dragged me away from the television
i wasn't
i probably wouldn't have been there
i'm a big football fan
he used to have the football pool at the office and all this stuff
i just hated it
i think i was just mad because he spent so much time watching football on sundays
when i met my husband he was watching football
i figured out that i couldn't see him all weekend
i couldn't see him until tuesday because monday night football if i didn't
it was
if you want to see them you might just as well enjoy football
i used to tease my husband sometimes and say my gosh did you bet the house or something this week to get so excited
i do
i love it
i just think it's such a fun sport
i'm just hoping that the broncos can get back on their feet
it takes a little brainwashing first
are you transit usually
do you stay not in one place too long
we have two small children
he just got transferred here to e-systems
it will take you a little while
you'll probably always have a soft spot in your heart though for denver
i tell you this
the weather here and there's no mountains or anything
when you go to a football game in colorado there's snow
it's an adventure
i know
here you've just got to drive down
if they close it in we'll have the best of both worlds then as they're talking about doing
dan reeves is a pretty neat guy anyway
he's from here
that's right he was one of our boys
we never cheer against denver unless they're playing the cowboys
i
it's funny
in colorado when the broncos went to the superbowl three times in the last i don't know five
they take popular songs and change them to fit the broncos and stuff
they had
if i saw a picture of john elway in the cafeteria at school
they did the johnny angel
i was trying to get my son to sing that
they do a lot of fun things
i think football is kind of a sport that i think you kind of it's hard not to like it
there's just
there is so much about it to like
it's so exciting
when the cowboys won the superbowl here of course they put together some real cute songs
we all ran out and bought the records
now we feel like they're kind of a collector's item
i wish i would have bought the tape when i was in colorado
i think about that a lot
when i first moved here i guess it was about a year ago they did this
they sure do
even when they were losing pitifully people still support them
are we paying too much in taxes
are we getting what we pay for
it's kind of a broad subject
i think there are some areas where we pretty well get our money's worth
i also think there are a lot of areas
i was in the air force
there was equipment at every base i was ever on that was just going to waste
None
i tend to agree with you
when it comes to government spending there are so many studies done that don't mean anything we'll spend hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars on
it's nice to know something doesn't work or something doesn't exist
it could be put to more practical use
i think that
i have a tendency to
i'm from texas
i read how our politicians voted each week in the paper
it's interesting how the votes vary
what they ran on in platform don't necessarily come true in their voting in the senate or congress whatever
and don't really respond to people who write them and call them
unless they're in the limelight and under pressure
what state do you live in
it has hurt us a lot
there has to be some way i think to equalize education opportunities
i think especially big government tends to think that the solution to everything is to throw money at it
i don't
i don't think money is going to take the place of intelligence or problem solving skills
i think there are too many things
we're comparable
i think we have got it on the line
it's not going to get any better
it's going up and up and up
i used to live in the plano school district
there was a taxpayers organization that finally communicated the message i think to the people in plano that we didn't want our taxes raised
i remember there was about five years ago
this
i think living in richardson we're kind of spoiled because i think
did you read in the dallas paper where they increased the administrators' pay by thirty three percent after they laid off all those teachers
that's the biggest mess i've ever heard of
how can you justify raising anybody's salary if you have to lay people off
i'm not going to complain because plano we all got a pay raise this year
i think the teachers did
i don't know about administrators
i'm semiretired
i was an administrator
i don't get a
i work part-time and just get
are you enjoying it
course i still work two part-time jobs
it's not really total retirement
it's interesting because when you look at what richardson has done with the early retirement you
that's a rather broad topic
we live in plano
that's a
where you are
when i heard the topic i was thinking of the thing down at maceo high school in dallas
it is
do you have children in school
i don't have to
i have
we have all this to look forward to
it is really frightening to think that you can't even
certainly you can't just turn them loose in the middle of dallas
None
i really don't know
it's just in so much of society with the violence
the kids having access to weapons and drugs
i really don't know what can be done
i just don't understand how guns could be so available
apparently they just really are
my son comes home and tells me that he hears kids talk about having guns
my heavens
it just scared me to death
they called the police
nothing happened
my goodness
maybe that's the answer to crime is getting
i don't
now somehow i feel we're living in an impartial society as far as people seeing something happen across the street or seeing someone get mugged or unfortunately raped
people don't do anything
a woman was raped in richardson i read in the paper about a two weeks ago now
all the neighbors said they heard her yelling for help
nobody did anything
they heard someone calling for help
nobody even called the police to say i hear a strange screaming i'm afraid if you
i can see especially if you heard screams from a house or something not going over there maybe because it could be dangerous
certainly i can't understand not calling the police
i just
it's really
probably one of the best things we could do for crime is to participate ourselves in its prevention
i think you're right there
i think that's real dangerous
i don't know
i try to tell my kids just kind of be aware of what's around them
the call for help is what scares me now because it just
it's that not getting involved that impersonal society i think we live in today
it really is frightening
i don't know the details
it was someone that just kind of showed up at the field
it was a student age person
i'm not even
it's a little part time thing
i'm building a log house at a farm that i have in east texas which is a hundred miles from here
course i've been working on it for five years
None
how wonderful
it's getting real close to of course there's still a lot of work to be done
when you get it completely the shell finished you still have a lot of stuff to do inside
actually i'm not even sure
it's beautiful
it's eastern hardwood forest
it's mostly oaks
how beautiful
it's pretty flat there
it's kind of hilly
it's low hills
it's not
i've only been to texas once
i have two sisters in texas now one in austin one in dallas
the one in dallas is the one that got me to doing this i thought austin was beautiful i liked the hills and the trees
it's really different because that's the chalk hills down there
you've always
limestone hills
born and raised texan
i had never been there
my brother-in-law works for the university in dallas
at which one
university of texas in dallas
okay it's just north of me here
he's got a job there
this is his first year
it's been a real interesting thing for them
they seem to like it okay
maybe some day they can get closer
what kind of hobbies are you in
i'm mother of four
basically i'm just
we have a little halloween talent show tonight
that's great
i am a travel agent at heart
my hobby is just
i love traveling and being involved of that and finding out more
it's real hard to work in the summers and holidays and weekends when you have four children and a husband
i reluctantly gave that career up and am just substituting at the school
i've been librarian all this week which has been real interesting
i'm enjoying it
what else do i do
i do lots of cross stitching when i have time i enter things in our little state fair
that's pretty fun
actually my hobbies mostly is my sports tennis
i love tennis too i ski
that's great
we usually go to new mexico because it's a little cheaper
i've been to telluride which is on the west side and copper
are you guys getting snow
we are on the dry side of the mountains
of course i'm a real seahawks fan going over that pass is just a real nightmare
we're on the colder side
we ski
my children all ski we have been to whistler in canada which is just a marvelous place
we've gone to sun valley several times
that's just a great place but not in colorado
since i went to school
always want to go to canada to banff or somewhere like that
your kids all ski
not all of them
my kids are all grown
my youngest son is a skier
my boys are at the point where they scare their mommy to death
they go off
i thought i haven't taken anything back for a long time
i haven't either
i hate returning things
i have a friend who if she likes something isn't sure what size somebody might need will buy it in every color and size and take everything back again
it's a game to her
i do not like to do that
i consider it kind of a waste of my time
i'm usually pretty careful when i shop i also usually have checked over things if it's like an appliance or something to make sure it has the features in it that i want
we've had it for a while
all of a sudden it just wasn't working
it looks like there's a part missing from it
of course we don't have the receipt any more
we can't take it back
i think a lot of goods are made not to last real long
you'll throw it away rather than have it fixed we're a wasteful society for sure
that's true
lot of times though it costs so much to get something fixed that you almost
you usually get what you pay for
they were ten dollars
we expected them
they didn't work worth anything
we took those back
that's about that
i think a lot of times if you get a brand name if it's a good brand
i think there can be a lemon in anything but i think more often than not
you pretty well know what you're getting ahead of time
if you buy a good one you shouldn't have too much of a problem with it
we had a car once that we tried to have declared a lemon under the lemon law which is extremely difficult to do
the car would go
without any warning whatsoever you could be going down the freeway at sixty
it would stop i
we went round and round with the manufacturer and everything
they got it finally semifixed
it just pertained to that
it was such a hassle yeah
it really is
i still don't have anything to do there
i think too a lot of people don't buy their warranties either because they know that when it's that old they're going to buy a new one
i think that's true
now we generally don't buy a warranty because you think at least for the first couple of years nothing should go wrong with it
he usually be able to fix anything that's minor
that has saved us
it's hard to say
i think they more of their parts plastic which makes things break easier
i think the technology is better
i think technology is better
i'm not sure
i don't think necessarily that things are being made better
everything is so automated
things can be made without
i think that certainly makes a difference back from the time when somebody handcrafted something and had some pride in it
people aren't willing to pay those prices very often for a handcrafted something
that's true
if we get
i do craft work and sell
it's a real eye-opener as far as why people charge what they do to
you keep up with current events
somewhat not as well as i would like to probably that's the way it goes
whereabouts in pennsylvania
state college
do you
i'm a current event junkie
i try to watch the news
i read the newspaper
i like to read time magazine and people magazine to keep up with what's going on in the world
what particularly are you interested in
i just pretty little about everything
again not everything
i like to know pretty well what's happening
political things don't interest me a great deal except i do like to stay informed enough to feel like i halfway vote intelligently other than that i just
stay in touch with it and feel like i know what's going on
i always have been i stay up with it
how do you stay aware of most of the current events newspaper
some of both
i read the newspapers sometimes i watch c n n that sort of thing occasionally i read magazines and such
you stay up with it pretty well then
not that badly anyway
i am interested in what's going on
i'm particularly interested in certain things of course like all the news about haiti recently because i've been down there yeah
you've been there you would be interested in it then
i follow it
i'm always aware of what's going on like that it's interesting i don't know
they've just been so terribly mistreated for so many years
he was a terrible tyrant i think it's been better since he died
it's still been bad even that priest that was in control there for a while that they overthrew
i've read some things about him that he wasn't too good himself
he was pretty much a
he didn't mind having people bumped off for certain things
it's one of the reasons the u s didn't do more than they did at the time because they weren't all that excited about him although he's probably better than a lot of them
then again who
what do you think about the quality of news coverage in america
they sometimes they jump on it and go a little to the extreme
that's kind of understandable because of course if you watch it more than once a day it's the same thing over and over and over and over
i listen to the radio you hear so much
then again so many people you got to understand only catch it once a day maybe i think the quality of our news is just i don't believe it could be better i really don't
i think it always could be better
what else could they do to make it better
i think that
you always want to think everything can be improved upon i understand what you're saying
by trial and error over the years i think they got it about as good as they're going to get it
that may be so
nothing is perfect
i think that i'm not always satisfied with how deep they dig into things and such
that's true
again i understand why they can't dig too much deeper
i don't know if there's so much wrong with the public schools as much as
that might be a lot to do with it
a lot of it in mississippi here has got to do with funding
they're trying to spend money where we don't have it
there's a lot of things we need that we just can't afford
it is getting very expensive to run schools
it is
there's just so much more and less money to do it with
a lot of it has to do with salaries too speaking of money
cause if you can't pay the right people they're not going to get the people that can do a good job
i guess that in
talking on a lot of the things as far as the discipline in the schools i think they're expecting schools to discipline the kids
i think it should go right back to the parents
when the kids get to school they try to take away a lot of things that they can do to discipline the kids
they've so severely limited
i know when i
they do that now
they could probably lose their job
it seems that'd be a subject that i don't have much to say on
we've talked some about it in my state because we've had a lot of prob-
he wasn't
a lot of his problems had to do with money mostly
i know a lot of
unfortunately there's not many places to get that money
they may not know a lot about
they're trying to teach social studies
they don't know a lot about that
my professor was a physics professor
he said a lot of teachers teaching physics today have no background of physics at the high school level
therefore they're teaching from a teacher's point of view and not from a physicist point of view
that causes a lot of trouble
maybe they should sit back and kind of decide on where the money's best spent
i know in a lot of cases different districts like to have nice fancy schools
maybe they should be a little more concerned with paying the right people to teach and be satisfied with maybe a little older school
here in the town i went to high school
one of the high schools was blown away by a tornado
when they rebuilt that school they had a top of the line high tech school there
the other schools were built back in maybe the fifties or early sixties
when the evaluation committees came through they praised the school that had been rebuilt while they were down grading all these other ones telling them what they needed to do to fix up this building
it kind of would make you think that we'd all be better off if all the schools were blown away by tornadoes and we had to rebuild them
i know where i came from we didn't have a very rich community
high school that i went to was very old
as far as i know it's still there
they've expanded on it
they've never built a new one
it's probably fifty sixty years old or better
i don't foresee them building a new one for a long time because they can't afford it
what do you think about the school system
i think they're having a lot of trouble right now
i think big city public schools by definition are having a tough time right now probably from budget cuts and everything else going on
why did you choose a private school
i had one that was needed to be able to be moved along at a pace a little faster than he was going to be able to be moved in public school
he has been going to private since kindergarten
has he
he's loved it
he's been there all the time
he's done it the whole twelve and so many years
it's been really good for him
overall on campus about twelve hundred but in the upper four grades about four hundred and something
it's maybe a hundred per grade
kind of gives them the
we were kind of looking for one that would be a mixture
they don't
he's done really well
he was just ahead at an early age
i didn't feel like what was available particularly in the first three grades even in the fourth grade where they started what they called reach was still a pull out one day program
i just didn't think that was going get it
i thought he needed to be exposed to a situation where he could push ahead every day
one thing i think i've noticed is my oldest is in kindergarten
i'm in a little different ballgame
seems to me that kids these days
the teachers aren't respected as much
they have to be so careful of the things they do and say
makes me a little nervous that students don't seem to show that respect
they'll stand there now with them toe to toe
the things they can say and do to a teacher they do from what i
i think we need to get back to
course i guess the teacher used to warrant that
for other people
a lot of times it's not being taught in the home anymore like it used to be basic respect for for elders and adults and particularly in responsible positions
then you wind up with little brats on your hands
how do you think that that's happened
you think our society's just stopped talking out
this generation's just kind of changed a little bit
the world changes
obviously kids are not the same now as they used to be
they're exposed to a whole lot more things
they have a whole lot more variety of things that they see and do at an earlier age
life is not maybe as simple as it was at one time
still i think it goes back to a commitment by the parents to teach basic values and basic respectful of authority
i just don't think that this doesn't always get emphasized anymore
i remember it was a big thing when they let girls wear levi's
we used to have to wear dresses you had to go to dresses
it was polyester
it had to be matching
when it was skirts it was get down on the floor
we hold the ruler up here it's no more than so many inches above the knee
it was mini skirt time back there at one time
it's really changed
it's really kind of
i think that maybe that's effected it to some degree
i think that probably does have something to do with it
it's also
does this school your son goes to do they require to wear a uniform
they do not do uniforms although one where he was between second and eighth grade did
considering you moved here from california i guess
we have in california
i lived in central california
other than that it would be maybe october and then in the spring
other than that there wouldn't be any rain
it's kind of been a drought out there hasn't it
here i know that last year there was some ice storms while i was out of the state
i'm glad to see there haven't been any this year
generally if we're going to get them it's not going to happen prior to january one
usually the bitterest weather if we're going to have any comes in january and february
we really don't have as long a cold season i guess as people up north
today it's not bad out there
i just came in from outside it's really pretty
i'm a scoutmaster
i wind up going out camping with a bunch of boys at one time
it's better for us if it hasn't been this totally wet before we go
you do that even in january
i guess you've been through a couple of summers here too right
they're not too pleasant
it is
people that i know that come from georgia or north carolina
they say it's
i find it
but more humid than arizona
california for the most part
that was
it's pretty hot in the summer
it's in the usually
it's a drier
it's a dry heat
i lived in africa for a couple years in cameroon
that's a tropical climate
it really feels similar to this during the summer
what type of business takes you to those climates
was that just vacation or something
i still work with wycliff bible translators
this is like the first thing that's written down
first an alphabet is developed
None
you don't think about that as a normal career when you're thinking of things that people might be doing
it's based here
the international headquarters for wycliff bible translators is right here in dallas
you're with the home office now
i think all in all there are a lot worse climates than dallas
the weather does change fast
things do happen severely a few times a year
there's an awful lot of good weather too in between
i thought the fall was really nice
usually a lot of the spring months are really nice too
when it begins to be in the sixties and seventies most of the time i like that
particularly if i'm going to be outdoors and doing outdoor activity hiking and things
that's nicer
you probably do a lot of that with scouting
think we're going in just a couple of weeks out to east texas
it is a little more humid out there than it is here
i guess we'll
when you get one of those tornado type systems through or severe hail or thunderstorms
do you live in a home
it's a house we bought about two and a half years ago now
did you
it's our first home too
what do you think of owning a home as opposed to renting somebody else's
before we built our home we were managing some apartments that we were living in
that was quite an experience
i much prefer having my own home and just the space and more privacy
is it a fairly large house
it's twenty-four fifty square feet
that's pretty good size
we had an two bedroom apartment that was about as big as this house is
it's only eleven hundred square feet
do you have children
all the rooms are small
it ends up giving us three bedrooms which we wanted and use an extra one for an office which is handy
i'd rather have more rooms and less space in each one i guess rather have lots of rooms and lots of space
that ends up costing me
how does it compare to the ones in your neighborhood
it's a very very middle class neighborhood
lots of young couples with usu-
i'm sure that virtually everybody in the neighborhood that's their first homes and lots of kids and stuff
it fits well in the neighborhood
it's certainly not a real upscale neighborhood
on the other hand it's clean and kind of suburban little bit more than i want
is yours also pretty much in conformance with the neighborhood is it
it seems about probably average
our neighborhood has just a wide variety of people
there's older people here and people that are our age
there's a lot of kids
eight kids
my gosh
their home just burned down matter of fact last summer
they're just rebuilding
their house is going to be really big
he's not an obstetrician an orthopedic surgeon
since the house did burn they're going
it's a lot bigger
ours is about
it's a nice home
it's definitely not one of the smaller ones
it's not the biggest either
new ones they tend to be real tiny especially in newer neighborhoods
my brother just built a new house
the neighborhood actually fought him on it
the house was going to cost less to build than any other house in the neighborhood
that's because he's doing a lot of it himself for example landscaping and lots of the other stuff
his house actually ended up being nicer than lots
they were pretty touchy on it
that's interesting
you say that because we have those architectural codes here when we put out house in they wanted us to have
we have part siding on the two story part and then on the back
there was one side where our chimney was
just the chimney was going to be brick
they wanted us to have more brick
we ended up having to go halfway up it does look nicer
we would have like to have had all brick
of course at that point we couldn't afford it
it's funny that you'd say that because there were homes in here that didn't have any brick at all
it's kind of like they were
kind of depends on when they get in
it was kind of like it's they
the houses actually on our street they're kind of gone a little bit nicer
they have
just they
it's the second phase they've kind of changed the codes a little bit
that's kind of why i guess they stuck us with more brick when there were other homes that didn't have any
my sister kind of got in the opposite end of that because they moved into a neighborhood and bought a real nice stone house down in south austin
what the builder apparently plans to do is they do phase one
they kind of give it a very upscale and very tightly controlled codes and stuff
they come back in
they sell
i spent four years as a university professor
i spent three years
do you really
i did
i was pretty young
i was
i was
you can tell me a little bit more about it because i don't think we did that in utah
the cooperative learning is a technique that was tried initially to integrate the public schools
what it involves basically
the teacher becomes a sort of a resource person to the learning cooperatives i guess they're called
there are some fairly sophisticated approaches that are used in the high schools with point systems and things like that so that people gain a competence with respect to the material
i think that the combination of technology and techniques like that together with marketplace forces will bring about a revolution in the way we learn
i think there is a direct threat to vested interest in the public school system that will stand in the way of that progress being a little faster
school systems are in too many states dominated by administrators both teachers and parents complain about the cost and ineffectiveness that results
my feeling is that
there are plenty of good people available to offer people educational experience
that we just have to reallocate and reorganize the resources to do it
i think certain techniques and technologies will influence all of that as well as research of the sort that people like me do looking at theories of behavior and how they can be used to improve performance particularly accelerate the pace of learning
my feeling is that those kinds of things will solve the problem eventually
i think that the future is pretty bright because people recognize that we're paying an enormous price for inferior quality when the people involved really aren't inferior
it must be the way we're managing the process that
i don't think it's a matter of talented people to do it both as quote unquote students and as teachers
clearly what's happened in this country is the school system's been asked to assume a great many responsibilities in the past thirty years that weren't existent
you must see kids with real significant problems in some cases
course i always see the
i don't know how hard is it in the public school system in iowa city
is it deteriorated a lot
i haven't taught in iowa
i've taught in utah
people there were saying that the way that the schools were going a lot of people were going away and going to private schools or else going to home where they taught their kids at home
or anything but the public schools and the ones that did have the kids
utah's a place where you wouldn't think that problem would be very severe
maybe it was the area i was in
a lot of schools had a lot of transient families and a lot of families who were on the poorer side
you saw a fair number of troubled kids
like you said how the schools are doing more things for the kids they thought than they were thirty years ago
the school i was teaching at the year i left they were considering providing hot lunch or hot breakfast for the kids
as far as i'm concerned it's probably apt that your call's at this time because we just got through watching reasonable doubts
which had a capital case in it
i personally have
my own feelings about capital punishment is i think it should be mandatory upon a third conviction felony
mandatory summary execution on the steps that day
i think i'm in that same
i think if it's a convicted felon on parole and he goes out and commits another crime or kills somebody i feel the same way
i think that person is beyond rehabilitation
he should be taken out
i also firmly believe that no one is beyond reclamation
i do know that almost all people usually die before that point
as far as capital punishment on it's own merits i have the trouble with the way it's applied
i think it should be applied on a little bit more fair manner
i've said this very often
i believe it to be a very true axiom
i would rather be white rich and guilty than black and innocent
because
they will kill you
if you're black and you kill a black guy it's two hundred hours of community service
you don't hear too much of those cases
it's a social disease that we have called one upsmanship
we can do whatever the hell we want to do
you're the minority
you're stuck with it
we had this in the vietnam war
that's another issue altogether
as far as capital punishment i think that ten years on death row is cruel and unusual punishment
if he can't produce evidence not argument but evidence
the only thing i don't understand i guess i don't understand our judicial system as it is right now
if somebody has been convicted and has been sentenced to be put to death how is it that they can appeal and appeal and appeal and get stays of execution
how is there
that goes back to when america was a colony of england
in england you went to court you were assumed guilty until proven innocent and once they found you guilty judge said he's guilty kill him
there were some people that had a problem with that
because they found out later on that a guy will lie rather than get killed
he'll say that guy did it not me
he'll have somebody lie for him
people lie
they do that
to prevent that kind of misuse of power they wrote into the constitution a protection against judicial mishap
look at that guy at e systems
they convicted him of a robbery that he could not physically have been able to commit
he had witnesses they weren't dope dealers they weren't drug fiends they were employees of an establishment that had a very high level of security sense too and these were really responsible people
they convicted this guy because somebody says he looks like the right guy
they all look the same to me
big lips flat nose that was him
what do you think about convicted
this is an unusual topic
at first i
i told my husband
he reminded me
None
they just notify everyone by mail
they just meet at a park or something to have a small dinner type thing
that sounds great ellen
they all meet in portland
they come as far as seattle
sometimes we've gone
we were living in utah at the time
his dad's family is all around the area
his mom's side of the family they all have their family reunions in southern utah
people would come from seattle to there let's see nevada and in that area washington and nevada to southern utah
each time they had a reunion they'd assign a different person to be in charge of notifying everybody
the people who are down there they'll assign one person in the utah area one person in the washington area
that person can call beforehand and just make sure everyone knows too
they just sort of do a little program or something like that so that everyone's sort of involved
we just have to either or
we're all there
l a orange county area
everyone's mostly not farther than an hour away
my experience has been limited pretty much lately to my mother's side of the family
years ago there was a big dispute on my dad's side
they haven't had a reunion since then
my mother's side we had our first real reunion that i've ever gone to last summer
they had people come in from out of town
they took some rooms down at a holiday inn
they had some activity
people got up and talked about various parts of the family tree
a lot of that sort of thing
since it was the first one that we'd had you could do that once
that's interesting because one thing that always brings to my husband's mother's side together is they talk about the genealogy of the family tree every time
inevitably everyone is just very interested
they always have two or three new ones to add to the list someone's been born or someone passed away or something like that
everyone has to update their little books or whatever
do you have an interest in genealogy
not a passion
i suspect we will do more of it
i found about some of the relatives i didn't even know their names some of the two or three generations back and some of the aunts and uncles
there's a lot of things there you have to stop
we don't even know where the twin
we have virtually no background on the twin
is it your grandma's own sibling
my grandmother's sister who would be somewhere in west virginia
i'm sure she's dead now because my grandmother died about twenty years ago
i see
i'm probably a lot older than you are
maybe they just moved away and then sort of lost contact
what type of magazines do you have
i take skiing magazine
i take discover magazine and also c d and stereo review and national geographic i think and boys life
i take it that you like to ski
do you receive a lot of information on skiing through the ski magazine
i suppose that puts me on some mailing lists and so forth because i do get things from ski associations and things during the year
do you receive discounts and things like that
would this vacation you're taking
we already knew we wanted to take one
we just started looking around
we went to the ski show and looked at all of the resort information picked up a lot of brochures and just decided to go to crested butte
that sounds nice
i haven't skied utah yet
i want to
you need to come out
how about you
what magazines do you have at home
i am currently taking decorative woodworking and country living
let's see we do have national geographic
we have some church magazines
i really enjoy the decorative woodworking
the decorative woodworking has just been a great great help
does it have articles on how to do things as well as equipment that you can buy and so forth
mostly they have the ads on the equipment
the whole magazine is just filled with pictures and projects that you can make yourself
it has all of the patterns and instructions that you would need to make a wood project and then how to paint it with the tole paintings
it's really a fun one
that's good
i read it
they just sort of gather dust for a long period of time
eventually there'll be a school project or something where my son will need to refer back through forty-eight back issues to find france or something or whatever it is he's looking for
i've noticed that too
they have been nice to have around
i liked that magazine i was just found myself not ever getting around to reading it
by the time the next round comes in i'm still not through reading
scientific american comes to our house too i forgot
that's mostly my son's
i do read it too
that sounds like
he takes game magazine which has puzzles and things that he likes to solve crosswords and various logic puzzles and things like that he likes to try that
he
they can do that
they like to go through
we've found good use for those
we're kind of at the end of that trail
i do have a boy in junior high too
you got a little bit of a gap there between
we're kind of running the gamut
do you do artistic painting
i do tole painting
you do
i haven't done any of the oil or watercolor
right now my passion is tole painting
i took one class about i guess three or four years ago
i've done a little
it takes a lot of time
do you sell your projects
i've done perpetual calendars and
i would eventually like to make enough to sell and quit my job
i just work at stop and shop out there in ogden
do you ever send any of your stuff to the boutique
i have five children of my own
it's they keep me busy
tole painting is just something i do in my spare time
do you cut out your own projects
i really enjoy doing that
do you ever spray your projects with a base coat first
do you brush it on
i haven't tried a spray varnish
i just bought a spray gun one of those high volume low pressure spray guns
i do a lot of woodworking
that's what i bought it for
i haven't used it yet
that 'ud probably give you a smoother finish wouldn't it
what type of woodworking do you do
fine furniture
do you
that's why i bought the sprayer is to finish my projects
that's my
spraying does put on a nicer finish
that is interesting
what kind of equipment do you have
let me see
about it
it sounds like you're really into it
i just have a scroll saw and a jig saw
i am really anxious to get a band saw and a router
it's nice to have the right equipment
that makes it easier doesn't it
have you sold any of your furniture
that's interesting
did you take classes to learn how to do that
just in junior high i just kept on through high school and then
yours is mostly just a hobby too then
that is interesting
i really would love to go take a class in woodworking and learn how to
mostly just do more
the shelves and
it's fun
they come on
they do
this is my first one
i've enjoyed this
i think you'll enjoy doing it
there's a shop in roy that i really love
it's there by the copper mill restaurant used to be the hayloft
we live in roy
we haven-
let's see
one of the things i'm very concerned about the air pollution is the ozone layer issue
i used to own a heating and air conditioning business and handled lots of different types of freons
that rather bothers me that i was in effect contributing to the delinquency of the environment so to speak
one of the reasons they fixed up the freons eleven twelve and thirteen in that area was because they were inexpensive
they could be made inexpensive and lots of it
in that its properties were great with the machinery didn't have to have lots of expensive machinery to get your heating and cooling cycles to work
course there's a
of course the new cars i guess starting with nineteen ninety-three will not have freon twelve in their systems
there's the ton of after market machines and et cetera et cetera
that's got me very highly concerned that
you got to have people that can earn a salary to pay for this conversion
i see us in somewhat of a catch twenty-two unless the banks or industry and the government go together and come up with a way to have us as a part of the unemployed society be able to be gainfully employed again converting all this freon twelve stuff into the new nonpolluting compound
as i say there's a tremen-
how many families own a refrigerator
do you know that number how many a freezer separate from and how many people especially here in texas own cars and trucks with air conditioning
there are people that have a thriving business that do nothing but heating and air conditioning on automobiles and trucks
the only reason i didn't get into that more when i had my little business was because most of your air conditioning on vehicles tend to be greasy and dirty to the n-th degree
that's a polluting type deal too is the excessive petroleum products in your engine bay and so forth and the dirt and grit and those two mixed together with water
i know there's a lot of pollutants we can't even see coming out of cars
that particular bothers me
most of the time when you see the busses with the diesel those are carbon particles and carbon dioxide and water vapor
when diesel is burned it's it
diesel fuel is burned in the diesel engine
it's burned so completely that you don't have any nitrous oxides or oxides of nitrogen to form by virtue of the very combustion process of the diesel engine because diesel oil
where gasoline if you leave a little pail of gasoline out before long it's gone
it's got
it's latent heat is high
it's slow burning at normal pressures
i see
that's why your diesel engines have such high compression ratios as the air is heated by virtue of the compression process to one to nineteen or nineteen to one ratio if the car sucks in fifty degrees
how do you feel about trial by jury
i feel very uncomfortable with trials by juries recently
in that it seems to me that they are swayed more by emotion than by evidence that's presented
i have very little regard for the law
do you feel they are swayed more toward are you talking about with criminal or civil suits
do you think that the stereotypical bleeding heart juries where they feel sorry
i would feel more comfortable in many cases i think with judges doing the sentencing
i like the idea of juries of your peers in that you get personally more than one person making a decision
second of all you get a wide variety of background
too often i think they are not when you are selecting a jury and you are doing it partially if not entirely on the basis of which color representation you have is a matter of concern to me too
i think that in such cases they are not really looking for unbiased people but rather for biased
now i happen to know several judges
there is one that i would feel uncomfortable but has doing sentencing without the jury
i guess that's what i am concerned with
i guess i definitely agree with you
the
what i don't like about the jury doing the sentencing in that i think it becomes a lot less
the same crime gets unequal sentences
i think there is more of an ability for selecting two different juries that would most of the time come up with the same idea versus whether he is guilty or innocent i think there would be a large variation in trying to gage the severity of the crime and an appropriate punishment and have that measure stick across the board
you do see such uneven sentencing evidence of it in the newspapers and such where it would appear the crimes were very similar
one individual got twenty-five years
the other one was sentenced to life
of course a lot of that's also the ability of the defendant to get a good lawyer
there are times when
it's othello
every now and then one is tempted to see what
i agree with it
they will admit to you that they don't have the benefit of being able of allowing themselves to believe their clients that are guilty it's more of the game plan of how do they convince the judge or jury through argument
they are very effective too
i have been involved just slightly in a case where i know the person is guilty his attorneys gotten him off
the city has dropped their charges against him because the attorney has presented enough evidence of doubt to convince the judge
i don't know
this is a little bit of the subject
one thing that i really dislike also that's new is that i have heard that there are federal sentences
in this modern day and age it seems like we have more and more leisure time because we have so many appliances and whatnot
None
i've heard i've heard that a lot of families really don't spend a great deal of time together
the kids maybe on the average get something like thirty seconds of quality time with the parents
that's what i've heard too
i don't quite understand it although i think probably the worst thing that's happening at least the modern world today is television
there's also some i think poorer lifestyles illustrated but simply because it dominates so much discussionary time
i tell myself sometimes just sit down after work
i refuse to have one in the house
good for you
i talk to a lot of people about that
i've thought about it myself
i though about it a lot
i still haven't done it yet
that's good
i'll tell you
the kids can be a real pest
turning the t v on is almost like magic
it's like sticking an electrode into their pleasure center
you don't have to worry about them
i don't think it's too good
i don't know
i take advantage of dinner time
whenever you're with your kids you want to interact with them rather than just ignore them
do you keep your kids active in sports or anything
i guess our big outlet is music our thirteen year old son plays violin
nine year old daughter plays cello when our son started playing violin i took up violin
when our daughter started playing cello i took up cello
there's plenty of interactive time in practicing although neither kid likes to practice
i imagine with infants
i try and read to them
i take them to the park and stuff
reading is so good
i took great pleasure in reading to my kids when they were little
i still try to read to them although our son is not liking that anymore
they get to that stage
i read
you ought to get it
i think his sleep book is my favorite
i like to do it
they enjoy reading
i've i never read a lot growing up
i never read until a few years ago
i've found that it's really important to me to get to read
to i like to get away in a book
i've put a lot more emphasis on that on my kids to try and
how much time do you think you spend with your kids on the average per each day
i probably spend an hour or two
that's great
she does tupperware
she's gone a lot at nights
i see
i spend a lot of time with them
how old are your kids again
you have your hands full with them
i try to stay away from cars as much as possible in terms of repair
that is really a sore spot with me
i think perhaps the automotive industry is improving
ten years ago reliability of automobiles at least u s automobiles was pretty dismal
not only that but the repair capability of service departments and dealerships was equally dismal it seemed that the only way i could reliably take care of my car was to repair it myself which is not my cup of tea
i
do you have a car
at that time i had a volkswagen rabbit it was a real lemon
subsequently i got a buick century
it wasn't as bad
last year i bought a honda accord
i take it in once every seventy-five hundred miles for its periodic maintenance
that is it
it's wonderful
they're good
every time i get taken to an auto repair place every time i go i get taken
bad
they go all right we got a sucker
let's see how much money we can get out of her
what do you have
all the more reason to have a honda
our honda just got old and just wore out
it
you bought a pontiac
my ex-husband's
this just happened a couple of weeks ago
just a few months ago when he was my husband his father gave us this car
everything is wrong with it
the power steering fluid leaks the oil leaks the brake fluid leaks
how old is the car
he just doesn't take care of things
i was awarded the car
there is a man in my church that is a mechanic
i can trust him
he is trying to get things fixed on it
it's just leak leak leak everywhere
i hate to go into a repair place because they'll tell me something is wrong with it and it's not and charge me twice as much
i said okay
he charged me a hundred and thirty something dollars
about a month later a man was looking at my car
he asked me
not a repair man but just a friend
i was telling him that i just a new master cylinder put on
he looked at
he said that's not a new master cylinder i didn't even know what one was
he showed it to me
it was old rusty just awful
apparently it was the same one that was on there
more than likely
probably filled the brake fluid up
that was it
that's happened to me more than once or twice just about every time i've went in somewhere
what's the solution to that i guess find a reputable service
you can hardly find one
the guy that's doing most of my car now goes to my church
that's the only reason i go to him because i know him
i know he will tell me the truth
he doesn't even charge me for doing it
he's not going
he does it so
that's wonderful
i don't know
they ended up telling us we needed a brand new engine for our car
idiots as we were neither one of us knew much about cars
they told us we just had to have one
we bought one
it was not good
for me there's absolutely no question what's the most important benefit
if you try to get it outside of your corporation you're going to pay an arm and a leg
belonging to a health group is probably the most important protection you can have after you
do you also get dental
i don't know if i would rank that second
since i have three boys it can turn out to be important
i know
in a given year dental expenses can really kill you
my husband is with northwest airlines
he gets the full health and dental
we have four children
what you pay just to have teeth cleaned is outrageous
i don't know how people that don't have it can afford it
maybe they don't
if the cleaning doesn't get you the orthodony will
i guess that would be up there
i'm not sure how i would rank that compared to retirement
pretax savings was another thing that i think is a great benefit
it's a lot easier to save it when you don't get your hands on it first
when you have the economy to scale and everything that a large corporation has you can offer some incentive
if the government goes along by not taxing it when you put it aside you can really build up the savings that you wouldn't otherwise do
what about lesser benefits perhaps for you but for the women in the corporation
for example
do they have father leaves or anything like that
they may have just plain parental leave which either one can take
i do too
i know their maternity leave is on the order of six weeks which i think is too short
i think it's just a crying shame
the infant needs her desperately
there ought to be some compromise where the person would be guaranteed
it's so important to families then
yet anybody whose gotten far enough to get a good salary is really reluctant to give that up
i think you've put your finger on the one benefit that i would most like to see changed
i think they've come a long way
at least some companies some of them my girlfriend in particular that works for a rental car agency
as manager they have a very very poor leave policy
i just don't know how women do it
particularly single parents who don't have the support at the other end
there's no other way unless they're part of some extended family which is unlikely people moving as much
it's just a terrible choice
you can't afford to stay once you get there
just getting there has to be half the fun
i do as far as immigration as a whole goes
i think that we simply must start accepting everybody in the world
i think when we come to a time of recession that it's particularly important that we shut our doors at that time
i hope you're one of the employed right now
i applied for one set of jobs with a company here in dallas that they had two hundred openings
they had two thousand applications
i know that there are a lot of foreigners here doing my line of work
of course i'm not perfectly happy about not having a job
how do you feel
i'm a little bit ambivalent
i think one of the problems with immigration policy is like any other political problem is that people are not willing to discuss it in terms of what really is driving it
they're not willing to tell the truth the same way with issues of race and things like that
right now i believe there are two policies that the government uses to modulate immigration three actually
one is at the high end
they always want to be able to do some brain draining
they always like to be able to attract the einsteins or the professor chou
None
they can almost always find room for someone like that
at the bottom end they
are always willing to let in cheap labor
those are two things that i think are going on although i don't think the politicians would tell you that
i think you're right in both cases
the
third thing is the political aspect of letting steam come out from under the lid in mexico
they cannot close off the mexican border not because it's physically impossible but because the explosion that would take place in mexico
they keep allowing the pressure cooker to let off steam
i think they're a very difficult group to integrate into society
they're very difficult group to find jobs and places for
i don't deny that we may have been involved in causing the problem in that they're pretty miserable where they are
i'm not to sympathetic about letting large numbers of haitians in
i feel that if we accepted these people that we would eventually have almost the total population here
it would have nothing to do with political situations
my gosh
if you let them in a million at a time it wouldn't make that big a bulge in the population but politically and economically
have you been to southern florida
i know about it
it is now with haitians the way it was with cubans twenty years ago
the two of them together
we can
on the other hand
there's a lot to be said for having a steady stream of people who know how it is someplace else coming in
there's some differences in the immigrants
that we're getting now
i particularly have a problem with the illegal immigration
probably a great deal of what you say is true about the legals
they don't bother to learn our language
first of all they
i really feel strongly about this
i don't know
i refinished a couple of old dressers that were handed down
it's nice tongue and groove construction
i've done some other things too
my wife has picked up a couple of things saying if we could refinish that that would be a
we've done it a couple of times
that's a kind of low risk sort of project isn't it i guess
i have a really nice desk a nicer desk than i could afford which
we stripped it all the way down and refinished it
it turned out to be a nice desk
maple top i think
i put together a up rolltop desk from scratch
a kit
i'm jealous
it was fun
i do things that might be too crude to be called woodworking
i've built my own deck and
i've done the same like the trim around the house
i picked up a bunch of craftsman tools from the forties that my wife's father owned when he was alive
i do have a band saw and a router and things like that out in the garage
i can't say i use them very often
they come in handy at the most unusual times
i bought myself a template for making mortices and doors
that's a whole lot easier than doing it with a chisel
i've also used them for rabbeting because rabbeting on my radial arm saw is a little bit uncertain
i got one for christmas a few years ago and used it quite a bit for the first eight months i had it
now i use it twice a year maybe
my brother's used it a lot for making drawers
what's your opinion of what a good router is like
i
he was tell me like the ones that you dial in aren't all that great
i have never even looked at one closely
the little use that i've gotten from my router i would spend my money on the bits
i have i'd guess you'd call a medium quality craftsman router
the
the problem is that the as with
any time you buy as a package the bits that they give you are low end
if you're going to use for a lifetime i suppose it's worth it
e-
i imagine if i go and sharpen them myself they won't last
i've never had the bits sharpened
they really get hot don't they
they dull after awhile
especially i did some cabinets in ash and oak that wears a bit down
we remodeled and saved a bunch of really nice ash cabinets which had been in the original
routing hardwood will take the edge off a cheap bit pretty fast
you take the blade to get sharpened right
my gosh
i've used mine on treated wood
now all my blades need sharpening
because treated wood will also chew them up
we started out keeping a budget about two years ago
i made a lotus spreadsheet and went through the year using all of our checkbook to figure out what we spent each time and whether we were over or under for each month
basically since then what i've done is keep track of it through the checkbook
that based on the check coming in
that's our biggest expense
i take half of that amount out of my checkbook with each paycheck
so that i can keep good balance
a running total through the month
we've taken how much we have write down how much we have coming in each month
we've
we made up different accounts
we've set a budget for each household expenses or food and clothing and entertainment and then our own fun money and just stuff like that
we write down each time we spend something we write down in a book
at the end of the month we tally it up to see how close we
we try to stay within a certain budget
is it hard to keep track of it
does it work out pretty well
it takes some dedication to do it
it works out real well
you're staying within your budget and
i have to stay within it
i
we have that
if something comes up and you can't stay within it then we have a budget for we call our slush fund or something
some- an unexpected comes up then you don't feel it so strapped
we don't charge anything that we can't pay off by the end of the month
we're trying to do that this year
we've budgeted the money that we were spending on a coda account with t i and then money we were also buying stock with for that year
we have another loan with the bank
we hope by the end of this year
the only thing we have it to pay off is a automobile loan and our house payment
that's the only thing we ever
it's long term
his retirement plan and then to coda and stuff like that that's all we
we just have our life insurance for right now
we don't have any long term in stocks or anything like that right now
mostly what we've done the coda account with t i where we put in so much a month
they match it
that's worked out pretty good
i used to work for t i
i have
when i retired from there or left i took the money that i had in mine and put it in an i r a
we had an existing i r a
both of us have some money in an i r a that we're also trying to figure
we're putting it in c d's right now
we're also looking at it in possibly getting a mutual fund
if we need it we wait until it's expired
None
the other thing that we've done that was really nice to see we had one of the financial companies
john hancock company came out
their agent did a long term analysis based on salary and what our goals were on a long term budget in terms of retirement kids college paying off the house buying a different house
special thing buying land and building our own house
they did an analysis for us based on what we were putting in and the time frame that we wanted to look at
and then gave us some good information back on whether or not we were going to achieve those goals
or not and what we needed to do so that we could achieve them and the money we could put in at what time
our life insurance guy has come out
he's determined how much we need if something were to happen
that's the other financial thing i guess that we've done is with our life insurance is since i'm at home now is figuring out what we would need if something happened to my husband or what he would need if something happened to me
that's a big thing to think about
yeah
if i would sell the
if something would happen to him i wouldn't stay in texas
i would sell the house and move back home to my home town
i wouldn't stay here in texas
i don't know what he would do
i guess that's most of my financial plans right now
is there anything you'd like to add
it's been nice talking to you
i supplement that with radio news from my car radio and from a news magazine once a week
i try to listen to the radio in the morning and try to catch one of the morning talk shows
i usually end up flipping through c n n and headline news during the evening
i always try to read the sunday paper just because it usually gives a summary of the week's hot events
i try to catch that if nothing else
how do you rate the
are you pleased with the news coverage that you're receiving
for local news i think we do real well where it's
i think we get excellent local coverage
i like the national news that we see
we watch n b c
i think they do a real good job
i've been real pleased with the quality of the news we get
i would much prefer that they keep their analysis to themselves since i don't necessarily agree with it or it tends to be extraordinarily trite
i think i'm fed up with trite
i understand the void that comes naturally with both radio presentations and television presentations
as expensive as they are to produce they certainly don't want any dead airspace
i think there's enough news out there that they could pass on more factual information to us
like you said save the commentaries because i'm going to listen to the news and draw my own opinions
we're certainly in agreement there
maybe they're a little more efficient
i think my greatest complaint about news programs is programs like sixty minutes
i don't anymore maybe once or twice a year
i used to watch sixty minutes until they did two programs that i knew both the people and the incidences
i knew that they had presented an extremely slanted viewpoint
it ever since that time i just don't watch
i guess we have the same reaction whether we came about it from the same place or not
i had heard a couple of people that i had talked to about certain programs say that they had read other things besides what sixty minutes presented and that they didn't present it nearly the same way as the news articles or whatever they had already been familiar with
i started questioning just how bias they really were
i don't know how old you are
it seems to me like the last newscaster that presented news in just the nice simple factual way that i wanted to hear was walter cronkite
i don't know if you're familiar with him or not
not really
i never got to see his actual nightly news
i did grow up with david brinkley
brinkley was sort of trying to be in the mold
he did a pretty good job
we used to watch him and i guess john chancellor
i always liked david brinkley
i used to enjoy john chancellor's style of reporting
on the nightly news he goes into his commentary
that's where i get into the problem with him
once they've reported the facts all they can offer is an opinion anymore
i almost felt like it was too much
i spent a number of years in the service as an intelligence analyst
i don't need their fill-ins
i think it helps me everyday in trying to review the state that the world is in and try to guess where we're going
i wondered if it would help you sometimes fill-in the gaps or recognize discrepancies that people like myself might not pick up on
i think my background is probably what absolutely turned me off with sixty minutes
what weekly magazine do you look at
i keep coming back to that one
that's kind of my favorite
does it give i guess little encapsulated reports and then a few big stories
it's primarily a few big stories and then lots of high-level reports
here's what went on in asia over the past week
there's maybe a page of that little brief paragraphs unless that was the focus of their main stories
it too is one those
i do most of my reading in the bathroom
it's one of those that i can read either an article or a couple of pages of those brief excerpts in the time frame that i'm going to spend in there
it just seems to fit nicely so that i can get it read in about three days
we're working on a newsweek
for the last couple of months we got an introductory subscription
we decided to try it because prior to that all we got were things like glamour or sports illustrated
we decided to try to bring one in that was a little bit better for us to speak
to broaden your horizons make you think about different things anyway
anytime that we stop and think it can't hurt
i enjoy reading t news
they just show you the words and the facts
they don't offer any commentary
it gives me a quick chance to be caught up during the day because we don't listen to the radio at work at all
i don't like to go the whole day without hearing anything
i'm with you
i have to check t news everyday
the other thing we have that i like to check sometimes is talking fingers
you dial in an access code
depending on what topic you called in to hear about whether it was the news or the weather or a soap opera update it will give you updated information
that can give you current news updates current weather updates things like that
it's offered through the local phone company free of charge
it does sound very interesting
it really is nice because it gives you a wide variety of things you can call and talk and find out about
that is something you might keep your eyes open for
i think it's catching on throughout the country
how do you feel about it
i don't have any strong convictions about it
i know i haven't done any peace corps service
i don't know anybody in my immediate family that has ever even thought about it
do you know anybody that's been it
the only people i know that have done anything remotely like that are people that have gone to be missionaries
that's only because i went to baylor
a lot of students from baylor go and serve as missionaries during the summer
i think that's a terrible idea
it's nice to try to teach young people some civil consciousness but forcing them to donate basically their time and efforts
it's definitely up to the person
i'd have to say that the people who do it some feel it's rewarding
i don't know
i don't know how we got the subject
i almost hung up because i thought gosh i don't really have an opinion except for no
how long you been in san antonio
i've been here for just almost four years
i lived with dana in school
that's good
back to the topic at hand
the recording mentioned the peace corps
this is like major long term commitment a year or six months
you're looking at the peace corps or sabbatical maybe
i don't know
None
i'm all for donating my time to worthy causes
i do some volunteer work here and there
every once in a while i'll do a local big brother big sister thing
i'll go do a
that time is minuscule compared to what
i couldn't possibly commit a year or two of my life to go do something
seems to me like the peace corps
i doubt that
i it would have to be tough going somewhere you don't know the culture usually i guess
i think that maybe that's why some people do it is to see the other cultures and some of that
to do that i don't know
i don't know either
growing up all i knew was you go to high school you work you go to college you get out of college and you get a good job and you work
none of this you go spend two years in the peace corps to broaden your horizons
uh-huh i know american express
i'm working at american express now
after a certain amount of years of service these employees can take off six months or something for some type of sabbatical or something like that
they're allowed to take that time off and then come back where they left off
it is something that i think even the larger organizations will support
it's really for the community
i think at the same it's for some people to help them grow in other areas
in that respect a lot of people join the military to grow up and to decide what they want to do
the peace corps or something like that is probably useful as that kind of a time
a lot of people have gone in the military when they're in the college
sometimes it's to help support college
people don't know what they want to do
as far as the peace corps i guess i suppose there's a few people that have done it at that point in their lives
i think a lot of it's when people get older they'll do something like that
i don't
i don't
none of my
that's okay
none of my really close friends in college went off to be missionaries or anything
i don't really know anyone first hand that's committed a chunk of their life to do service work
i'm going to go get a good job and make some money and buy a nice car
yeah or
i don't know anybody that's done that either
it's interesting we got this topic because i don't know what i marked off to get this
i can't imagine
the switchboard's been down for several days
the last time i called it before it went down i had this topic
i didn't feel like talking about it
i hung up
i guess they keep you on the same topic until you actually talk to somebody about it
you had the same one
you'll get it over with here
probably five or six
i've done maybe four or five
she just sent me the information out
i got a hold of it
they mailed me the information that i filled out
i've talked about camping with someone
that one was interesting because i talked to a man in washington d c
it was hot here
it was snowing there
that was pretty interesting
i talked to someone about the education system
that was fairly interesting
i talked to somebody about credit card usage
i talked to this person who i gathered from speaking to her that she and her family just didn't have much
they didn't have much credit available to them
she basically didn't use credit cards and didn't know very much about them and how they work
and how you can use them to your advantage and how you can do certain things with them
i use everything with my visa
i pay it all off
that's a good deal for me
that's the way i use them i try to make sure i don't get in debt
that's always a good plan
most of the ones on the list i checked off stuff like football and stuff that i would enjoy talking about
i haven't gotten a one of them yet when i've called
i had
i can't remember i think me and dana had football
how funny
we talked about the cowboys a little bit
i'm out here in phoenix
we talked about cardinals
that one was all right
what else did i have
i think i had some other staying in shape or working out
i got this guy from new york
the switchboard called me
i was caught a little off guard
i couldn't think of anything at all
i started making stuff up
you've probably never gardened in your life
i can't even grow an ivy
he told me when he gave it to me that it was impossible to kill
you could dry it out
i killed it pretty quick
i think it's one of the easiest plants
i don't know the name of it
i'm not too much into
in the houston area
i used to
i'm now in palo alto california which is i think the recycling capital of the world
that's great
we have many recycling activities
i'm in full support of all of them
we are too
our community is just starting to get organized about it
they just opened up a recycling center where we go and donate our things and dump them off ourselves
it
that's something
it seems to me that we've gotten a whole lot better cooperation out here by setting it up so that we pay just a little bit extra
i don't think we pay very much extra at all too
the garbage men
come by on your regular garbage day and pick up the recycling out at the curb
i don't know if they've done it citywide yet or not where they have the color coded bags and bins
they give us one for aluminum and steel one for metals
you can either bundle your newspapers or put them in grocery bags
we leave three little piles
the garbage men come by and collect them and leave us new bags when ours get old and ratty or leave the ones if they're still in good shape
that's great
it really pays for itself because then the city
we're all for it
we've got several bins in our garage where we sort things out and take it to the appropriate places
they claim that because of the way they're bound they it's too expensive to recycle them
they're
one's for colored paper
anything like manuscripts or computer paper or so-
we get tons of catalogs and things like that and magazines
there's no way to get rid of them
it does
i'm sure that they can find some sort of use for them if there
i've seen talk about using garbage for energy
you could also apply the magazines toward that
that would be a help
it's really going to be a mess when they have to start hunting for places to put the things
i know it
we did have another novel experiment start this year
you buy these super giant heavy-duty paper bags
you get them for i think it's about fifty cents apiece at the grocery store you usually buy them by the dozen
you put all your yard clippings and leaf rakings and anything that will be compostible
the garbage men also pick those up on thursdays
that's great
they take them to a special part of our dump where composting is now in full swing
at the end of every year they sell all the composts to nurserymen and to local people who want to put it on their flower beds
that's a great idea
i wish we were that involved in or that our city was that involved in recycling
i've talked to many people
we wouldn't mind going its extra effort to do it
yeah
i don't mind
at first it was the little extra money that you got returning the cans in and stuff like that
i don't mind as long as things are getting recycled that we don't get reimbursed
i think it's to me more of a convenience to have them come pick it up
i know it
so few people have enough to make that worthwhile you'd spend more in gas getting down there then you get back
the time that you waste standing in line is valuable also
do the grocery stores in houston have recycling for their paper bags and plastic bags
i know the one that we use has recycling for the bags
they're promoting the cloth bags the reusable cloth bags
we can get a nickel apiece for any paper bags that we bring back to be reused
that's great
they have a giant bin by the front door for the plastic bags
they say as long as it's clean they don't want a plastic bag that's full of goop
they want any clean and dry plastic bag
i keep
the thing is i hardly have room now for all the things that we're saving it to recycle
right outside the back door i've got the two burlap bags hung up for the cans and bottles
there right outside that place where the garbage can is we have the bag for the newspapers
now we've got the bag for the plastic bags
i understand
my husband about once a weekend he'll go to a couple of areas where he knows that the people just throw cans out
he'll go pick them up because he just can't stand that
how nice
it's so
we have all our piles of recyclables also
i remember at christmas the only thing that i'm
when you were talking about the composting the only thing that our city did that was they provided a place for us to take our christmas trees
for them to mulch
for city use
they just put all our christmas trees in the regular compost
they did say that you had to put it out within i think it was three weeks after
otherwise you would have to treat it like you would any other lawn refuse
if we have branches or something
otherwise they have to be in one of their paper bags
that sounds like you all really have a great system worked out there
they even picked up our styrofoam packing materials
the week after christmas they left a plastic bag on everybody's front doorknob with a little note on it saying we're trying something new next week only
if you have any of those little styrofoam peanuts that
we'll take all of those back and try to recycle them
see that's one
something does need to be done about the styrofoam that
those things must take up a huge amount of space in landfills
they don't
they stay forever
i've seen where some places have taken a plastic and they're recycling them into other plastics
i think that would be great if they could get something organized along those lines
they really have to rely on businesses that generate a lot of that stuff
otherwise they're not going to go house-to-house collecting it
you're not going to bother if you have one bag full
i was thinking about the styrofoam used at the fast-food restaurants
that if everybody
i know our cafeteria here uses a lot of styrofoam
now we quit that about three years ago when we got china mugs for everybody
the only difficulty with that is that we're in the middle of a five-year drought
it's a real difficult choice whether we want styrofoam cups to fill up our landfills or china cups to use up our water
at the moment we're using the china cups
everybody gets one at the beginning of the year
your supposed to keep it recycled every day
that's good
let us hope that everybody's going to be paying more attention to this and that we will get better reuse of things
i have to believe everybody is starting to pay attention and take heed of what is happening
it will be good
i enjoyed it
good to talk
i understand that it's being proposed as a requirement
for young people to go into public service
all young americans they did not specify exactly what young means
i think that it probably would be a good program
you're probably right
there will be a lot of rebellion in that
when you get people who have no desire to be there in the first place
that would be the problem sure would
i think it would be a good thing though
maybe offer them some sort of an incentive to do it
college credit something
i'm not sure they need to be paid
that kind of takes away from public service
just to receive a letter in the mail
i think giving some kind of college credit
that says you need to report somewhere by next monday
i don't think so either because a lot of people depending on how the public service programs are set up
i'm not that familiar with them to know
if a lot of people flat can't afford to
most kids these days have gotten themselves into financial situations
it's a really tough question
they need young families whatever
they just couldn't take off to do that
if you put them in public service right out of high school then that postpones their college
that would upset a lot of people too
it would have to be a lot of thought given to something like that i would think
i think it would be good for a lot of people to get involved in that kind of program
i think it can't be something that's mandatory
it has to be something that's voluntary which is pretty much the way it is now
i'm not even really sure at this point in time what programs are out there
that's the other thing is that instead of making it mandatory they maybe need to publicize it a little bit better
and go to the schools and do programs
volunteer for such and such a time
you've a choice of where you want to go
handling it that way they could probably get some results out of it
like maybe if there was something they could do in their own town or city
and not have to pull up roots and go somewhere half way around the world or something
that's true too
they would have to be supported in some way
i'm not sure that those programs are available to do that
you wonder what kind of quality job would they do
would they really make a contribution of some kind
i don't know who's even proposing it
or how they plan on implementing it
i'm not sure either
i think there would have to be a lot more information disseminated before you say
let's do this
it be
it would take up more time than anything
it wouldn't take up a lot of money
you have a kind of a captive audience
you give them your speech and maybe a little slide show or something
i think that they could get some results from that
they don't know where to go to do anything
i don't really see the emphasis on things like peace corps we saw back i guess in the carter administration
that was a big thing with him
as a matter of fact i guess kennedy may be the one that actually started the thing or was really interested in things like that
like i say i don't even know what programs are even ongoing now
thanks for your time
you too
how about you
if it goes down then we're stuck all day
i like the i b m p c personally
that's pretty much everything i've worked with
i've become so accustomed to it that it's second nature
i have an i b m p s two model thirty
it's kind of getting too slow for me
i'm an e d p auditor
i audit computer applications both on the personal computer and the mainframe level
i use my personal computer constantly
not only do i do p c type things like using lotus or word processors
all i have on my desk is my p c
i'm getting not only our local area network
i'm getting two separate mainframe machines also
we use an i b m p s two also
every now and then the file gets so big that it moves slower than i'd like i do mainly graphic work on it
and a little bit of word processing and then lotus applications to it
i don't know
i enjoy working with them
the things you can do are endless
there's three of us e d p auditors
one of the three of us has an accounting background
she's not real proficient in p c's
the other just has
i ended up taking on the load of making sure everybody knows what they're doing
i'm the administrator for our local area network
i need to keep that going
so i couldn't live my life without a p c
i just don't find the time that i can use it
we've got a couple of portable lap top p c's at the office that i end up bringing one of them home a lot
they didn't know how they were going to do without me at work because i am pretty much like you said the guru
they didn't know how it was going to work
they knew they were going to have to get a modem so that we could make it through this eight weeks or so
it's almost like we could become too dependent on them
we use a lot of free lance
that's pretty much takes up a lot of our day so for as producing transparencies and things
it
compared to the way the things have upgraded
have really
the way things have changed over the years with the p c and the different programs is just great
it's remarkable the things we can do now and compared to a few years
i'm trying to get an updated machine
mine is just putting along
it's not fast enough for a new four eighty six chip
i'm determined to brake mine
he has to get me another one
that's what i do
we had about ten people sharing this printer
it was attached to a central p c
you had to take your diskette to the p c to print something
now that's awful
the first thing when i started working at this bank is i said now first of all we need to all be able to share this p c without getting up
i talked my boss into investing in a real elaborate local area network
we can share the printer
we can send files to each other
we can send mail messages to each other
i talked them into buying a h p laser jet
that was a major ordeal to get him to buy it
once he bought it he has been so pleased
it's fast
it has good copy
i've got a little i b m pro printer on my desk
i can use either the pro printer
i've got my p c configured to where i can use either printer the one that's on the network or my own
if i just need something real quick i don't feel like getting up and going and getting what i printed
we're just trying to talk ours into getting a laser printer
it's just so
the budget restraints and things like that makes it difficult
hewlett packard makes it's actually a dot matrix printer the quality is almost laser quality
i think it's called the desk jet
i think they're about five hundred dollars now
we got a quote on some laser printers the other day at six hundred dollars
we do a lot of transparencies
they just want black and white which we can just run them through the laser printer real quick
it
that's all you need for charts and stuff
it's
if in our area if we want to use it like you said you had to change it put it on a disc
and wait for an opportunity to use it
you'd have to just sit and wait while someone else was using the printer
i worked at the
it used to be the largest bank in san antonio until n c n b came up and bought the rival
now n c n b's got a little larger market share
it's the only
it's part of the bank holding company and that bank holding company of the ten largest banking holding companies in texas
i work in a big prestigious place
i couldn't believe when i walked in the door on my first day and here's the audit department of this huge holding company sharing a h p rugged writer
i was going wait a minute
how are you supposed to expect to stay number one when you're behind the times in technology
we're trying
the entire bank is not like that
the bank philosophy is one of innovation and
it's just the audit department happened to be just a little behind the times because the senior vice president over audits is cheap
it's real hard to pry money out of him to do these things
i was able to convince him that it would be cost effective and that our board presentations would be much better
we find it hard to understand when we work for a computer company and how are we supposed to present the imagine that we're supposed to present with equipment that's obsolete
some of the guys that run this place are very tight
it's like why do we need this
can't you do that with what we have
when we try and then they complain about this doesn't look good
unfortunately the computer equipment and related peripherals are changing and improving so rapidly
for instance we bought a
sounds like you like to read
i'm a single mom
i have always loved reading
most of my books are i guess what you'd call self improvement type of books
my interests switch around dramatically
i used to read just mainly fiction
now like a said i've read a lot of self help books
i read all kinds of things for helping people survive a divorce
the road less travelled was probably one of my favorites
i haven't gotten through
as far as dealing with divorce
i'm kind of getting that one past me but a good self help book
that sounds good
probably the best one that i know of and i work with all the time is called search for significance by robert mcgee it's one that we use in our work
it's probably one you'd find in a christian book store
that that's sound really good
what kind of counseling do you do
should we stay on the topic of books
probably should stay on the topic
that has a little bit to do with some of the things that i read
it's a christian treatment organization because of that i work with adolescents specifically
i see a lot of kids with various problems
a lot of the books i've been reading have to do with helping them get through those issues
i would imagine helping them feel good about themselves
to have to deal with sexual abuse would be terrible as a teen
that must be a wonderful feeling to be in that profession and be able to make a contribution like that
sometimes it's rewarding
sometimes it's a struggle
i'm sure
what oth-
is that just the only type of reading you've been doing
have you read any good novels lately
it's hard for me to do a lot of
reading just for enjoyment
that's for sure
i just realized i had never read it growing up
i just finished reading that
that's neat
it was good
she didn't enjoy it much
i didn't get much satisfaction trying to discuss it with her
i thought it was real interesting
i've always wanted to go back and read some of my literature texts from college because i enjoyed some of those stories so much
i never seem to have the time to do that kind of reading
i trying to think of some of my other favorite books
i keep lists
i must have a list of three hundred books that i want to read
i get distracted and have to start on another one
i've got a copy of the road less travelled
i was trying to think there's another scott book that i've got that i had read
he also wrote people of the lie
i bought that one
i didn't get involved in that one as well
it's kind of the whole concept of global peace and building communities
i got involved in beginning experience weekends
it was of the people from there that said that
his whole idea is we can build a better world if people get involved in good community building projects
he did mention beginning experience weekends as one of the places
i've ha-
it really was
a real fun bunch of books that i read the beginning of last year were the author of jonathan livingston seagull i can't think of his name
pardon me no
it'll come to me
he wrote the illusion and a bridge to forever
they were fun
not very long
i see
i got myself involved in a sales job
right now my list of books to be read have to do with the art of selling
it's just i was just thinking at rossa
even if you took speed reading
trying to think
he writes spy novels
i think the last novel i read i guess in conjunction with my wife over vacation last year
it was a last name's
it's called this present darkness
it's kind of unusual book
that sounds interesting
hey you should make yourself a promise that you'll read one novel in the next six months just for you
it's so easy to get caught up on reading just for your work or self improvement
you kind of forget the fun of reading
i guess we've covered the topic pretty thoroughly
i thank you for calling
i'll have to check out that book you
okay deanna
i believe also in killing a rape victim
someone in the process of rape
i don't really remember what else
what do you think about it
i agree
i do too
i think they're doing their duty
i think if they're going to come out and kill somebody else then they deserve it
i heard something on the news the other night they were talking about i know what it was
it was in our little lewisville paper that comes out twice a week on the front page every week
it's like a call in survey that says do you think so
you call this number
you press one for yes and two for no
one of the questions the other day was do you think that capital punishment ought to apply to drug dealers
i think
they were showing a segment on a man in philadelphia that's going after the drug dealers
he just got fed up with it
he said he's had his house broken into and windows smashed and his car stolen three times and everything trying to keep him quiet
he's organizing people
they're going out and marching on the corners and taking back their territory
i think that's what it's going to take though
it's going to take
the police i don't think can do it alone
None
i'm trying to
it's going to take all of us getting together and just saying
it said they're going to other neighborhoods from there
quite often they'll get shot
that's right
my gosh
the only thing about the death penalty i know that they try to be careful
they try to be sure
these people are on death row for like twenty years
an-
if
i think being convicted is one thing
that's great if they're sentenced to death
it ha-
it goes all through the state supreme court system before they're
they've been convicted
then they've been sentenced to death
there's no doubt
None
once they've gotten the penalty and there is no doubt do it
i guess that sounds cold
gosh we're keeping these men in prison for fifteen or twenty years on death row
it's costing us a heck of a lot of money
that's terrible to look at it that way
that's the way it is
if the crime was bad enough that they were sentenced to death then do it
the execution was to have taken place a few weeks ago
there was a lot of protest
even robert redford was protesting this guy's execution
the governor backed down
i was so mad
his crime was just horrible
those kind of people i'm sorry you don't reform them
being under the influence of drugs is no excuse to me
i don't know
the same thing goes with some of these insanity pleas
if you're insane enough that you can go cut twelve people up into little bitty pieces and bury them in your back yard
then
i have my doubts
i don't know
some of these plea bargains and all this kind of stuff that they do it just gets out of hand
i understand that
wasn't it lewisburg that had a lot of bad things happening just in the last couple of weeks
was it not
i think it was the south east area
my daughter lives down in rowlett
she was telling me about it
i can't remember what the town was some little area
it started kind of happening a couple of places in south dallas
that's maybe what you were talking about
men breaking in to houses and taking or a man
they think it's the same person taking little girls right straight out of their beds at night
and breaking in obviously watching them in the house
that's the last they se-
the little girls bedroom
i think there's been like six or seven of them
over the last probably eight or nine months
they're all anywhere from nine to twelve years old i think is what they've been
he's taken them and raped them and then brought them right back and just kind of thrown them out of the car in their front yard
can you imagine because it happens in the middle of the night
these parents didn't know the kid was gone until the kid is knocking on the door screaming let me in
can you imagine
you wouldn't even dare put these little emblems in the window saying child in this room in case of fire
i've got one of those in brian's room
it's really bad that you have to be
we were over at a neighbors tonight
my little boy is just a little over two
their little boy is five
there's a big difference
they were playing in the back yard
we were getting ready to leave
i went out in the back yard to get brian
the boys were gone
the back fence was open
she didn't act like it bothered her at all
we walked through the fence out the alleys come to the back of the house
i looked down both directions of the alley
i saw neither one of them
she was like god he does this all the time where are you
screaming j d
None
he's five
brian was two houses down
he
i just can't do that
there was a little girl picked up in rowlett from her front yard
her dad was working in the back yard and had just left her few minutes in the front yard
somebody apparently drove up and took her
they never saw her again
man this is too scary
i let brian play here in the back yard
there's two gates that go into the back yard
we've got one of those big eight foot privacy fences
one of the gates has a padlock on it
the other gate just has one of those slide bar things
it's on the inside
they'd have to come over the fence
they could not open a gate
i still feel a little uneasy about him playing back there
if i don't hear him playing i get up and come out and look out the window real often
you do
if they find who's doing that to those little girls as far as i'm concerned he could
sometimes there are crimes worse than murder
i believe that
this is one of them
i don't know
i don't know what needs to be done
when they do put them in there
i'm taking a business law class at night
the guy that teaches it is a practicing criminal attorney
he comes in and tell us all these bizarre cases
he said you're not told this but if you ever get on a jury you can pretty much guess whatever you sentence them to
they'll serve a quarter of it
if you want them to stay in prison for fifteen years don't sentence them to fifteen years sentence them to a hundred
then they'll serve fifteen or twenty
it just doesn't seem right
it doesn't
they just get out
what are we going to do about it
they don't seem to
we're just going to have to adopt a completely different attitude
we're going to have to say if you commit this crime and if we're sure you commit this crime you are going to be sentenced to death period
do it
if you commit this crime you will be in prison for the rest of your life
we're really going to do it
i understand they're doing it because the prisons are full
somewhere we've got to come up with some money to build more
and keep these people in them
i was watching a show about this the other night
they were i think it was on forty-eight hours
there was a crime here in mckinney
a rather heinous murder
there was no remorse shown by at least one of the perpetrators
yet for whatever reason his crime was not considered a capital crime
if and when he gets free again
he will have no compunction but to continue that same kind of lifestyle
it really bothers me that there's not a way of getting him out of the way forever
i don't think our prison system isn't set up
where we rehabilitate or restore anybody
i believe that god can come in and change a person's heart and genuinely change it
that doesn't negate that you do reap what you sow
if you do kill a person and you're found to be guilty i believe god establishes the authority of our court system
i do believe that capital punishment is alternative
even god can still change your heart
that doesn't mean
like the alcoholic that charges up all the bills on the credit card or the shopaholic you get your life right with god
you still have to pay your visa bill
that's right
you still have to
god sent us his grace
they give pardons
i believe if it's a genuine conversion there's a genuine
those prison people they know a genuine turnaround in a person's character
i worked in a prison in fort worth
you see it the ones that have a genuine character change
they know that
they're not going to pardon someone from the governor
i feel like there is occasions where they do spare lives
i leave that with the governor who of course is going to go through every authority because they want to be be reelected
my concern is
first of all that not all persons who i think should be receiving
whatever capital
i just got home from work
i'm just kind of spaced out a little bit
that not all of them are being convicted of it that they're not even being charged with that appropr-
i agree with you that
the same god that can work that miracle also established the laws that said for certain kinds of
right then it was almost immediate
as soon as the trial was over then it was stoning
in the old testament
we don't have speedy punishment
it kind of loses its meaning
the foundation is still there though of the system
i know what you're saying
also they're under a law because we haven't been removed from the law
we've just been taken out from under a law
under the law if your child back talks you
under the law he would be stoned
we've been removed from being under the law
we're still accountable to it
it's like god changes your heart to not do that
in the old testament they could look all they wanted just couldn't do it
in the new he's looking at your heart
i guess that's what i mean by their character changes and what i mean it's like looking beyond what they're doing and looking at a heart and seeing what is the heart what's the character showing me here
any of
if i don't believe that there's not a character change and the authorities agree that this person needs to be excused i believe for murder rape i even believe incest things
that will permanently damage the character of the child
i believe crimes against children should be punished by death i believe
that's where we just have to trust the authorities
they're not going to excuse people if it was run like that
if it was done quickly and done swiftly
it's not because the judicial system they've rejected the answer to all these problems they have pretty much
all the judicial system is overloaded with
all kinds of problems and crimes and so forth and then all of the civil things that clog the courts
having sat on both criminal and a civil jury
we're suit happy
back to the capital situation sounds like you and i have a lot of common ground at least as far as capital punishment is concerned
i would like to see some kind of streamlining so that if a person is convicted
and sentenced to death that automatic appeal which goes in could be more quickly dealt with
go ahead and get the punishment phase out of the way because it doesn't do the criminal or the victim's family
any of us the taxpayer any good to have him sitting around for months and years
bu-
i think it's jamaica i know that they have crimes punishable by death
i'm sure they hit a few every now and then
i wouldn't want to be one of them that are not guilty
i know that they have their crime rate
it's one of the caribbean islands
None
they don't have a lot of the crime because there is a law
the law is enforced
that's when you have lawlessness
the law's not being enforced
all that does is lawlessness
we went on a mission trip to manhattan and to the bronx and stuff two years ago
all these kids were up on there getting arrested for crack
everyone was out
we were across from that big bus station
they had fifteen people lined up on the fence
within two hours there were fifteen boys sitting there doing the same thing
you'd see the same kid who were back out there in two days
the answer is not being given to them in the court system
i think initially when our country was set up it was set up with god
it was really an integral part
you can't force people
i think people are hurting
they're out doing crack sitting on the street
i guess i'm kind of frustrated that we've gotten away from the christian basis that our court system was founded upon
it reeks of the bible just the whole system
i feel like if that was presented more openly and not just relying upon para-church ministry to come in and do it that the system itself
you know what i mean
i feel like that might be better if it was run on a more scriptural basis which would include and expediting the penalties and just getting it over with
however certain very liberal minded groups who do not subscribe to the same ethical system that you and i do
such as the civil liberties unions and so forth
too often they're can be extremism that hurts from any direction
regardless of whatever you're arguing or concerned about
i see that
that's why i'm like what's my role in this thing
i don't think the system is going to get fixed
it's is something that i've done in the past
we try to go once maybe twice a summer
that's pretty average to me
we don't go for week long thing
we usually go to a lake area where the campsites
are and do that
do you have a camper
that's what i ha-
as a matter of fact my the majority of the amount of camping i've done has been really roughing it
as a little girl i'd go with my dad and my uncle and my brother
we went to the boundary waters area in minnesota
that's really wild
we have a five year old
she was pretty young when we started camping with her
the kids love it
they just love it
they
they don't have all these modern toys
they have to use sticks and rocks and stuff like
i like that
how it
really is a good family thing
we try to go with another couple that have children also
that makes it a lot more enjoyable
we don't have to go out and buy all the
we kind of split it up
because it really does get expensive if you don't want to rough it all the way
even the sleeping bags those are running a good thirty dollars a pop
we've built that up
what i would love
now that's what i would like
let's see
my husband and this other couple that we go with her husband kind of likes is it scuba dive
we'll go to a lake
the girls can play on the beach area
i would play on the beach area too
i'm just sitting here listening to your accent and thinking what a good time the computer is going to have with that
you know what's really funny
people tell me that i have a texas accent
there is just no way i've not picked one up
you don't sound like it to me
have you
if i have one it must be very very slight
that's true
None
a lot of people do say i sound like
i have i guess more of a twang
are you a native texan
good for you
any way
i know there are some good places to go camping along the lakes
is there
we didn't go camping
we drove down to houston to visit friends
we went to galveston and to san antonio and then up to austin and kind of doing the sight seeing type stuff
we didn't go camping
that's one thing my husband wanted to do on this summer's vacation was to go and camp wherever we went
i said i'd love that
ever once on my week-long vacation i
want to be a little bit pampered by a
we're hoping to do a three day weekend
there's a thing called pfeiffer rim
there's a town called glenrose
it has dinosaur tracks
it's got one of those wildlife parks
that sounds great
we're going to try to do that on a three day weekend go there
where you should try
we've driven through
None
not camping or anything
i would love to camp
you need to go there
it's high canyon
there's this little mountain lakes
it's very peaceful
in the early fall time
i can't remember what type of trees they are
all the leaves turn yellow
it's just brilliant
i used to go camping all the time as a girl scout
we did
i just don't understand these people that think taking an r v
we had to make the fires and dig latrines
that is it
do you say you haven't been in years
i'm a struggling single mom
gosh bless your heart
it's
it
that was one of the things i really thought i'd like to do with my children
again
i'm a little bit fearful of trying that just women
i really now
i have gone on one little vacation just the girls and i
and rented a little efficiency
and had a marvelous like two nights
that was great
even at that it was like the first time that i ventured
out of the city by myself
i stayed in a nice place
it's real different not to have another adult with you
i haven't quite adjusted
i was with t i until january
i left t i in january hoping to strike out and find a job where i could make some money
it was a good plan but i haven't yet
i'm selling telephone systems
that's neat
it's fun
it's interesting
it's also pretty challenging
i haven't started making money yet
it's hard isn't it
it's hard
how old are your girls
i'm old
excuse me just second
i'm going to listen
i've enjoyed this
good luck
i haven't made any
have you
when i had to sup-
this is my gemini nature
it's like virtually anything
it's been real interesting the different personalities
it is neat
then i guess i'll let you go so you can go get the door
thank you
i enjoyed talking with you
me too
i usually don't get to hear any of the current events probably until about the ten o'clock news
being
by the time you get off work go by and pick up the baby from the baby sitter it's after six
by the time everything is settled in
sometimes i hear some things on the radio
i don't even have time to read the newspaper except in passing
i'll look over my husband's shoulder and see what's going on
i guess occasionally i'll hear someone at work say something though
we have a news thing on the computer that i'll try to look at every day
it's pretty much headline news
which isn't pretty much what we look for anyway
do you think that the quality of the news events that you get are
i guess it's pretty good
like the dallas area
i guess when you're in a big metropolitan area like this
there's a lot of competition in the media
sometimes i think it too much trying to figure out who's going to get the best headlines and that they'll run a topic into the ground
they try to play public's opinion which i think is awful because it usually works
i'll bet that was the case of the war in the middle east
lots of new newsmen were created during that
it will be interesting to see what happens
trying to think what else
i don't know what to say
that's a bad one
if what it's going to take
we can deduct that from our federal income tax
we need good schools
we're more involved in that now
i think it's better for everybody if we had better schools
they haven't for
i wish they could have gotten a lottery
they're struggling with it
i think the lottery could have helped with that
it wouldn't have been as painful as what we would've paid in state income tax
it's not the idea of your paying income tax
i'm not sure there's a positive solution for that
i haven't seen the news
it
that's sad
the other thing i can think of is what is still going on in iraq and the kurd refugees
they had to choose between the better of the two bad situations
i don't know what i've would have done in the situation
i understand why bush doesn't want to go in and take sides
that would definitely look like another korea
he'd have all these people jumping down his back even though i'd agree with it
i think he should've gone in there and blew them away
yeah it did a lot
i have in-laws that live in saudi arabia that stayed there during all of it too
it
we kept very much abreast of what was going on
in any of the areas where they
they were the near dahran
on the east coast
probably about a hundred fifty miles hundred miles from the kuwaiti border
they stayed active was the military there taking supplies out to them in the desert
it was a new situation
that's awful in texas
have you all been getting rain storms down there
we got some awful rain the other morning
today's just been real drizzly
we did last night some real massive thunderstorms
apparently i don't know if it was just the strong winds or some small tornadoes up this way too
we've just got slight chances of rain
we had the hard thunderstorms the other morning
the ground here is so flat
it's all saturated now
when was it last week we had all the rain
i think we had about eight inches
you walk out on the ground
you
it's awful
today the air was just so sticky so damp
i guess that's it
it was nice talking to you
the public school systems everybody's has known they've needed renovation for years but never really had a clear direction on which way to go with it
the first direction that i would love to see them go with
for too long they've kind of lumped everybody together
that's the only way it's going to happen
the other fifty-seven minutes you've been talking about a subject you've bored them
that's very true
the other one doesn't
you're right they do get bored really fast if they already know what you're talking about
what is your suggestions
the educators need to be a little bit more open minded as well as innovative in dealing with the various students to get the maximum potential out of the person
instead of pushing the scales too far either direction it's great to be well rounded and be exposed to all this stuff
why not hit the points the kid's really interested in
if he's interested he's going to study it
he's going to learn it
he's going to remember it
i think the only thing that they would argue about that is that every child needs to learn every subject
that might be the only thing
i definitely agree with you
that's true
everything i learned about ancient rome has not helped me anywhere in
i feel like i'm taking this history class
it's so boring
i just hate it
what does this have to do with getting a computer science degree or whatever
what type of history class is it that you're having to take
american history
we have to take this is like early seventeen hundreds through i don't know i think like mid eighteen hundreds
we have to take another one that's mid eighteen hundreds on up to basically present
the early ones they could actually combine two
make that your second step because
that's
to a point the early parts of it you're giving the foundations of the nation
even then they're skimming over
they're almost trivial with it
if they really wanted to get to the meat of the matter they make all these people out to be
they're the father of the country and all this
this school system thing
i tell you i saw something on the news i don't know maybe
they were talking about
i'm from the dallas area
they were talking about the plano school system that they had one school that if the students did something wrong whether it was behavioral or they weren't learning properly or something they took these students and put them basically in a closet with no windows
they had a table not a table but a desk in this closet
they had to sit in there by themselves
parents were getting really angry about this because they said why is my child being put in this closet
how is that helping my child
the thing
they said we're giving them isolation time
this helps them to think
if a child has claustrophobia that's just going to terrify him
if the isolation concept really works that good why are our prisons overcrowded
they were
i think that is a very wrong way to handle disciplining a child
putting them in they called them their quiet rooms or their isolation rooms
they showed these rooms on the news
they looked like a closet to me with a desk in it real small
they said that one of the solutions they came up with was to take the doors off of these isolation rooms
i said how is this helping
either way
i think that's not the way to discipline a child by putting him in a closet
as a part of the revamping of the entire education system on that lev- the public school system i want to see changed too
when i was brought up if you crossed the line and you broke a rule bad enough you were going to get spanked
then the extreme came in
now we can no longer
we now isolate them
there has to be some sort of discipline
there has to be some sort of punishment
let's put him into a situation where you crossed the line you broke the rule you're going to have to pay for it
it's going to tax you physically
i don't
instead have them pick up around the school yard have them weed a flower bed somewhere on the school yar- do something to beautify the school property
you cut
the kid's having to give up his quote play time to pay his debt for what he did wrong
he's seeing something constructive come out of it
i have to
i think one of the things that can come out of is not just discipline okay
for instance one of the things they do at my kids school they have what they call caught being good slips
when the kids are in halls and stuff and if they're being really good just being excellent they're not cutting up and so on
when they collect them at the end of each week they get to go to this little what they call their caught being good store
they get to spend these like money
to me that's positive reinforcement is much better than trying to find ways to discipline kids because they're going to be good and try and earn those things to get the positive part of it
they'd much rather go in the store and buy something than be spanked
they're definitely going to work towards being good rather than trying to act up and be bad
there's been too much negative reinforcement
how much like the caught being good slips
that's true
that's one thing that my kids definitely get spanked when they need to be spanked
i really do try to use positive reinforcement with them at home also
it really helps
they don't get spanked very often
they do when they deserve it
i don't think any kid should be exempt from being spanked
that's just my personal opinion
that's not going to
i don't think that law will ever change
they are never going to let a teacher spank a child again
i don't think
some kids don't get don't get spanked at home
some kids need to be spanked at home
i most wholeheartedly agree
there's a point of over kill
somewhere you've got to find an even line
there's so many parents that say you can deal with a child without spanking them which is true you can
there are times when a child needs to be spanked
they do things that they need that
i guess my
i have a stationary bike and a regular bike
when i can i like to ride my regular bike outside because it's so much nicer
i have it in the living room
i either watch t v
i watch the fish
i don't realize
usually after i'm done riding the bike just to cool myself down i usually take a walk
that just kind of gets me to where i'm not quite as tired i guess
i do it because i have to not because i want to
i find that if i sit
i haven't figured how to get that soft
i tried even tying a pillow to it
two years ago i joined the cosmopolitan lady here in plano
i love it
is it just women that go there
i think that's what's my biggest problem with going to a health club
i don't feel like having a bunch of other people watch me exercise
i just feel conscious about it
i'm not big or anything
i still don't like other people watching
my bathing suit's just one piece
there's no big deal all the way around
i don't have to be conscious of what i'm doing or how i'm doing it
it's a total free relaxation
hey you can do what you want
no one is staring at anybody else or worrying about what anything else is doing
they've got such fantastic equipment in there
that's great
i love the water aerobics
what is
it is like double strenuous
you're not being double strenuous on your own body
you're pushing it yourself
you're doing it yourself
you don't really feel like you're really working that hard do you
i get blisters on my toes on the bottom because
that's funny
a lot of people wear those little terry cloth with rubber soles on the bottom especially around the pool
they just wear them right into the pool
are they water shoes
they're just little terry cloth things you wear for house slippers with rubber soles
so that
that's really funny
i never think about it until after you go there for about a week your toes you start getting blisters anyway
no big deal
it's fun
how often do find yourself going
if you're doing it on a regular basis how often do you go
going five days a week
i do force myself to do it at least three times a week which i don't feel like is enough
it's at least something
i have to force myself to do it like i said because to me i really don't enjoy it
i know that i have to do it
it's not a question of whether i want
when i was working up at the summit
i'd be at the swimming pool by four o'clock
about four thirty because they start at five to six
i was there by four thirty every night
the only thing that ever bothered me was my hair getting wet
no matter what i did or how i did it i invariably got myself wet
the water only comes up basically anywhere from your waist to your chest i'd say
it's your choice where you want to go
i'm sorry
did you ever go to texins at all when you were working for t i
i have a bad back
i'm very limited what i do
if i walk for more than fifteen minutes it's going to bother me
what pushed me that way though basically was the fact that when i went in there is wasn't for the water aerobics
she said go for the swimming pool
i couldn't
i'm no swimmer per se
i found that this worked really well
i came out of there
i saw my stomach going down well
i dropped i'd say almost twenty pounds
they fix you up with a diet which worked real good
when you go in there they wouldn't make you do theirs would they
when this one down here opened up i joined as a v i p
the v i p
they go over all your health and all your history
they show you everything to do and how to do it and the whole nine yards
it became part of the package
i went through it
they have packages where they just offer the exercise program
it's less than what you pay now for going in there
it's like when i got laid off
i get all the same treatment again
it's kind of nice
i go into the hot tub
i love it
i have never
that's because of my physical condition and nothing to do what they did
usually when i go into the hot tub before i go swimming or when i come out i'm totally relaxed when i go home
you really do enjoy your exercise then since your
i've gotten on the bike
they've got the stepping bike where you step
i've enjoyed that watching how well i can walk up and down stairs
that's
most of the others to me are very dull
i got talked into the bike instead
i don't know
i'm not sure if i'll get benefit out of both of them
i don't know if it would really do any good having both of them
the one nice thing about the bicycle is you just sit
you have a little
if i were you i would go apply to either a health club or one of the others and use it for a while
you can buy a month's membership
it all depends for everyone their own what they want to do
i jump on the bike here at home
mine has the handle bars go up and down
i can sit there and read and listen to music like what you said
it has no effect on me
it's boring
i will
you go ahead
i'm going to tell you what i'd have
i have shrimp that is steamed in beer that i cook
i have a cauliflower that i would cook garlic bread green salad tea
we'd have a lemon pie for dessert
it sounds fantastic
what's really neat about it is the shrimp is cooked in your rice cooker
you place the shrimp in the rice steamer
you put a bay leaf and put some red pepper over it
now you can use the kind that comes in the little can
you can just get some regular red peppers
you put a little bit of that over it
you put that in there
you pour two bottles of beer over it
how much shrimp would you use
you pour the beer over the top of it
you cover it
you only cook it until the mixture begins to boil
you put it on a platter
you serve it with melted butter
i usually put garlic powder in mine
they can just dip it
they shell it as they eat it
then the cauliflower you
what you do is you just wash it
you core it
in a pyrex or something like that kind of bowl that would go in the microwave
it's got to have one that has a cover on it
you put about two tablespoons of water into this bowl and about an eighth a teaspoon of salt
you just set your cauliflower in there
you cook it for seven minutes on high
you rotate it one time
are you cooking the whole head at one time
when you core it you be real careful so you won't knock your flowers off
you just set it in there
you microwave it on high for seven minutes
you turn it one time
while that's cooking i take about a cup of mayonnaise and a teaspoon of mustard and some garlic powder
i mix it all together
i shred up some just regular white cheese
after that's cooked you take it out and pour this on top of it
you sprinkle the cheese on top of that
you cook it for another three minutes on high
that sounds fantastic
it looks
what i usually do is i'll sit the cauliflower in the middle
i put the shrimp around the outside of it
on my platter
i have a green salad that i put around the outside of that
you have all the different seasonings and stuff
i just fix little individual cups for them
they have the
it makes it a real nice looking
it's not much work
it looks like it
usually i cut those little cherry tomatoes up
and put some color into it
i'll lay those on top of my salad to make it look nice and things like that
how many could you serve
it usually serves six
that's good
see out here we have so many ethnic people
we have portuguese
we have russians and polish
it depends out here the type of people you're going to entertain
it's hard
you just have to pick something for the group that you're going to entertain for that particular time
they're big on finger food here too chicken wings and ribs and that kind of stuff
barbecue and cooking out in the yard when it's nice barbecue outside chicken and that kind of stuff
i have had shrimp
you ought to try some crawfish
that's one good thing about living down here is usually anybody that comes over even if it's like out of town guests and stuff they want our cooking
of course
just like now especially crawfish it is starting to move out
more and more people are beginning to find out how good it is
it's similar
it's got a taste of its own
it does
it is similar to because you only eat the
it looks more like a crab
it looks more like a crab
None
i guess it looks more like a cross between a crab and a lobster
it's small like that
it's got the pinchers like a crab
it's similar to a lobster too because the tail has got the little pleats in it like a
we call them mud bugs
they're fantastic tasting
it's the season for them right now
where did you say you were from
do you do cajun cooking
i love blackened the fish and the chicken and that kind of stuff
we have a few places up here that do that
if ever i see it on the menu i always get it
how do they do the blackened
you buy it as a seasoning
do you have to have a certain skillet
i cook mine do you have a black iron skillet
i have mostly teflon
i guess you could cook it in that too
i don't know
i never have
i use the black iron skillet to cook mine
does it have to get extremely hot
it doesn't burn or anything like that
it's
that is a seasoning
it's not like you would have to cook it for an extreme amount of time or something like that to get it
i see
what it's called is blackening magic
it it comes in a bottle
i'm trying to see
it's got a picture of dom de luise on it
you would cook it for the same amount of time as you would prepare it any other time
i could have the chicken on the skewers with blackened seasoning
that is so good delicious
you do have to have it hot when you cook it
it does have to be really hot when you put it in
it's not like it's burned
what blackens it is the seasoning
it is so good
i love it
in fact i was in texas for a little while
i liked the barbecues and the mexican food
i have been brought up mostly italian american food
my parents are italian and portuguese
we cook a lot of pasta and gravies and pizzas and roasts and that kind of thing
that's why i enjoy going to restaurants and trying different things
have you ever thought about coming to louisiana to visit
you don't even have to go all the way to new orleans if you want to really get some good food
you don't have to go that far south
of course the further south you go the better the food is as far as i'm concerned
fact is we're going to take a vacation this year
we're only going down there for the food though
where do you go when you go there right on basin street and those places
we go to the french quarters and stuff like that
i have some friends that live down there
usually we don't go to the tourist ones
we go to the ones that they tell us to go to
i see
we went to this one
they were cooking the stuff while we went on this boat ride
then we came back and ate out on this it was like a back porch
that's nice
it's so good
the seasoning it's just unreal
don't they make a lot of
is that with seafood
you can
i've seen the chefs on t v do that
it looks delicious
i'll tell you what
we do a thing we call it a sea bake
we got two cats
None
my family had cats when we were growing up the whole time until my mom developed an allergies
i'm used to having cats around
i like having pets around in general
i favor dogs over cats actually
i'm not a dog person at all
i'm a dog person
not cats
we house sat for my wife's boss a couple weeks ago
he has a dog and everything
we were sitting the dog and everything
i felt like just miserable all weekend
it really didn't dawn on me until sunday
it was like that could be it
dogs are real high maintenances
you've got to pay a lot
it's not quite the same thing
it's just nice that cats you don't have to let them outside
you're not worried about them running all-around the neighborhood
they make their mess in the cat pan which is
it's a pain to clean
we used to
they got great stuff out now for cleaning cats' pans
when i was growing up i had a clean the cat pan all the time
i hated it because i had to carry everything upstairs and use this thing to take the stuff out and put it in the toilet and everything
now you get these liners
that is garbage bags
you the
that sounds so easy what i did
that's it
what we used to do was just put newspaper on the bottom and then put cat litter
i would just take the whole thing to the garbage can and dump the whole thing
then i would do it everyday or two days so i would clean that pan very very rarely
it wasn't so bad
she's got one dog now and the two cats
her dog there is basically a reject
it was her ex boyfriend and just was not mature enough to keep the dog didn't realize how much work it was
she's just so kindhearted that she just takes all the animals
i think that for me my husband just has completely nixed the idea of having a dog or a cat
that's all there is to it
None
you don't have anything right now
except the kid
he was completely against having a dog or cat
he said they're as much work as a kid
they're harder to get rid of for the weekend
i don't know because the cats pretty much
it's not a big deal really
they're happier when we're around
they're pretty much okay by themselves
we couldn't do that with a dog
that's really true
other friends of mine have cats
if they go away they hire a pet sitter to come in twice a day and pet them and things like that
their cats their so used to the attention that if they don't get it they get really upset
they sort of cause trouble around the house and things like that
that's pampering the petals
i
i tried to have a goldfish
i killed that one within a very short amount of time
they're not that much fun
you can't
they can't fetch
they can't do anything
i've never
i think we had fish when i was a kid
i don't
one of his fish jumped out of the fish tank and fried itself
i remember my brother
one of the fish was missing
they couldn't find it anyplace
they found it fried on
i don't know if we got rid of the dog
my brother was allergic to it
because of that we didn't have very many pets afterwards
he had fish
like you say they're not the most exciting pet to have
i don't know
i just never understood what the attraction
they're pretty and everything
i've just never seen
a friend of mine had an eel
he had a
it was one of these fish that it ate a big other fish and things like that
now we really get sick
i couldn't see having fish like that
i could see having maybe some of the tropical fish that are really really pretty
i remember a friend of mine at work telling me that at his frat in college that they had a tank of piranha
and used to drop mice in
these aren't cats
i guess that's fine if you have a mouse problem at your frat house
a cat will do the same trick
it was a live rat
this woman just offered it to me while i was in graduate school
i had a friend in college who had a pet rat for a while
i forget how she got it
it was the same kind of a deal
she got it from the psych department
mine had been a
and the people in the lab one day called in my friend and said this rat is acting really strange i think he's sick
she said i don't think he's sick i think she's pregnant
they had misclassed the sex of back there
she asked me if i want one of those babies
i took the baby
i got her when she was just this tiniest little thing like
she grew to be
she grew to be pretty big
a pound or something
i had her for over two years
she was very affectionate
she would crawl on me
she would sit like on my neck or my shoulder while i was working
and things like that much more than you would think
if you get them young and everything before they go kind of nuts
i could see getting one from birth and everything
sort of weird for me to have had one too
it was easy to take care of
i have friends with hamsters and gerbils
they tell me the same thing
it was more fun than you would think starting from the beginning
we also live in the city now in manhattan
it's almost impossible to
or certainly not a dog
people do
it's not
i don't
the pooper scooper one new york
None
you see all these stately people and well dressed people out walking their dogs with their plastic bag or their piece of paper for them
we were wondering if they had any special law for the horses in central park
they have the bags behind them
i think they're actually supposed to
keep them clean
gosh i can't even walk by central park when summertime
haven't been up there
it's not that long ago
fall
twelve times of the year
it was almost october of eighty-five
i think was the last time i was up there and at center park
i had a friend who went to colombia
i used to go up and visit her
you said you had two cats
just what you call it are they breed cats or anything
are they just
my wife got them from friend of hers at work and everything as kittens
this was before we even met
she's had them for a couple years
they're really cute
they're sisters
apparently i don't know all the details
they were born around christmas because one of them is named tinsel
the other one is named holly
the scr-
both females
or whatever it is neutered
they're both declawed at least on the front claws
the topic was should the united states adopt the metric system and if so should
why didn't it work last time
i'm all for it
i am too
i wish it had started a long time ago is the problem because we're so wound up in the system that we've got that trying to convert over
i guess they tried what'd the call it soft conversion and hard conversion one of them is where you just take whatever's already standard
you give it some sort of a weird metric number like six point two eight seven instead of six millimeter
i don't know
i think they just go all the way on new products introduced or whatever start your packaging go to liters instead of quarts
people if they have to are going to learn to think that way
doesn't just about everything now have both metric and english
things are generally packaged in the english sized packages
sure it has the metric equivalent written on there
it still a quart
if they started putting it in liters of oil and liters of gasoline people are going to learn to think in metric
i kind of remember back when gas prices started up pretty dramatically when they started getting toward a dollar a gallon range
somebody had
it was only twenty-nine and thirty cents a liter
they could put this sign out front that said thirty-nine cents a liter
nobody had any idea what a liter was
that's the problem
you can figure out what you're actually paying for it
not at first
by the time i was in fifth or sixth grade anyway
i would expect people with any kind of buying power under the age of thirty or so to have some idea what it is anyway
i think maybe there's where the problem came in
it's kind of like learning a language
it's almost like
it's like somebody said as of such and such a date anybody caught talking in the english
will be shot or something like that
thing is it's a global market place these days
we're like one of two backwards countries in the world as far as
it's just time i think for us to go over
all you end up doing is if you're in business or you're in any kind of international
i don't
yeah i do too
one of the things that we've run into a problem
course you're familiar with any drawing system you end up with things in parts of inches half fourth this sort of thing
you end up with a decimal where you start getting into mils and that sort of thing
some of them are done in purely metric
ours were in mils
it got to
you end up with all kinds of problems with converting your designs
i can imagine
the one that
i had to get used to purely metric system down there because they didn't understand anything else
if you start talking about miles they'd look at you like what
i had a little bit of experience with it
also i noticed in canada you drop a quarter fifty cents whatever in a coke machine up there
you get this funny looking coke
it's in a can that's taller but not as big around
i guess that's some it's not a liter
my daughter in law's from panama
they have had americans down there for so long that they're kind of into both systems
she gets real confused on distances
temperature is the big thing the centigrade for which she says celsius
i would have more problem with the temperature except that working in engineering we do everything in centigrade or celsius
i had kind of gotten used to centigrade temperature
if it's ten and twenty it's not too bad
the big problem is not having the resolution between a hundred if you're talking about a hundred degrees or what thirty zero thirty four degrees whatever that is
you don't get all the little differences the differences between seventy and seventy-two or seventy-five degrees isn't much
the difference thirty and thirty-five degrees is quite a bit
i think as long as people have a choice they're going to stick with the american way
until we have to learn to think that way we won't
i'm not sure what they do in england now
they're on metric aren't they
we run into some problems once
this thing was even different than s a e standards and stuff
this ca-
my dad bought one of these little nash metropolitans here quite a few years back
the thing had a austin heeley type engine
the body was built by nash
who
that was even before american motors
nash essentially in the u s somewhere
that thing had the darndest combination of metric and wentworth and s a e
i think the wentworth and the s a e bolt sizes were the same
the threads were different
that would be a mess
it was a total mess
on my chevy van that's a couple of years old
the only thing that was in it built in the u s was the differential
it was built in buffalo new york
it's got the hardest combination of metric
most of the body parts seem to be metric
most of the engine parts seem to be s a e
it's just crazy
you got to have one and not mix them up
you're never going to get to one system if you still got a mix
of course here that would involve changing road signs all across the country miles per hour to kilometers per hour and the whole nine yards
i thought maybe they would convert to metric back when they went to the fifty-five mile an hour speed limit because what is it fifty-six or fifty-seven's a hundred kilometers
you'd have people doing a hundred miles an hour
yeah
you'd have people going a hundred miles an hour
i don't know
the other thing too is between here and el paso's what five hundred miles
it's almost eight hundred kilometers
they'd seem to be ticking off faster too
every road sign you come to is like i don't know it that far
they converted all the road signs to fifty-five miles an hour
at that time that was still when things were
now cars they have both
i know the only other place that i was ever at where they really had it mixed was in panama where's a lot of the road signs and everything are in miles per hour
some are in kilometers
you got to know where you are because anything that was the old canal zone is going to be miles per hour
jack what type of music do you like
i like classical
and sort of popular rock type music
i never really had listened to it till i got married
my wife enjoys it
i had never listened to it till then
now i listen to it whenever she does
even every once in a while i put it on myself
i used to play the piano
i like bach and
sort of the baroque music handel and
vivaldi and those kinds of
those are really nice
though i couldn't tell you anything about them other than when my wife says this is bach
i don't know all that much myself
i just know
whatsever's on the radio is usually okay with me
sometimes i have a hard time hearing the words clearly if i'm in the car and there's noise and stuff
people always say wow the meanings of those words
i'm always meaning
there's
i just thought they just all sort of rhymed
it's funny depending on where you live
i commute back and forth between baltimore and a rural town called salisbury
the difference in the radio with popular music
is totally different
baltimore will play more what might be considered a little bit more progressive
as soon as you go down to salisbury this town that's two and a half hours away in the suburbs or whatever in a real rural maryland
it turns into basically classic rock
they don't
classic rock
when the doors movie came out doors was really on the radio there
where you'd hear one or two of their more famous songs maybe top forty in baltimore
in salisbury that's all you would hear was this is the doors
it was sort of a funny thing
if you
there is
i didn't
i lived in pittsburgh before baltimore
i never really noticed the difference when i moved to this area
when i went more rural it really changed
chicago has a lot of good stations
does it
in fact they have a continuous news station which is nice if you're driving and you want to h-
you don't have to wait till the hour mark
it's sort of constant
you get the latest news and everything
it's sort of like c n n
it's on
you never hear the news basically on the radio
if you don't read the paper you sort of fall behind if you're in
i like to listen to tapes of music or stuff on a long trip
now you can even get books on tape
on fact my grandmother does that a lot
she's losing her sight or whatever
that in
i can imagine if you're driving cross country
listening to a story
that's a lot of fun
that would be good
we strayed a lot from music
i guess music comes into that whole aspect of listening
as long you're listening
if you do have to go something i guess we can just cut off
jack it was nice to talk to you
good luck
i hope you get some more calls and make some more calls
i have probably had more time than you have to think about this subject
i'll tell you is it a serious problem
foremost where we compare that we are now doing fifty percent of our people are voting
we're probably making a comparison against some european and newer republics
one of the reasons that it is lower in the united states is that mostly we hold it on tuesdays
we further complicate it by saying we will keep the polls open until eight o'clock
a great number of people now work at different jobs that if a third of the people are shift workers they won't be able to get to the polls in any case if they have to work late into the evening and not get up
they hold it on a saturday or a sunday
or at least a day when a great number of people are not working
in america that is not true because a great number of people work on sundays
that is one of my solutions
i know here in dallas that they have just instituted in the last couple of years a real long period of time that you can absentee vote before the elections
i do not think they have seen a really high improvement
have you absentee voted in texas
i have absentee voted in new hampshire
it is a fairly complicated process where you have to go pick up the ballot
part of the process also is that you must preregister at some particular point
other states you have to register every couple of years
to just vote
registrations are perhaps a problem also
we're the mobile society
people are always mo-
if you compound that
if it is difficult to register to vote that would remove your eligibility to vote
or who are not just motivated who really believe that their voice is heard
the people that i have talked to
maybe that is another factor the motivational factor
that's diminished by
i just read two books
the trivial pursuit of the presidency in nineteen eighty-eight
it's preceded by several other books by these guys
wake me up when it's over was about the eighty-four elections
i forget what
any case i-i-it is the mar-
there was
these guys have taken the place of theodore white on reporting elections
in any case they say that there's a definite trend toward candidates using negative voting
is that just because they have such a low opinion of the public and the public's
the public would rather hear something negative about the other guy than a positive factor
None
if you go on the attack and put some sensational thing before the public as mike dukakis learned in the last campaign
it is not refuted
people will believe it
he did refute it
to the matter
he refuted it
indeed his trend started upward
i didn't believe anybody would believe that either
i guess i
they do
have a hard time coming to terms with the fact that the american public really was so
don't give too much credit to the american public for their motivational ability
it
then how can a democracy work then
it
i don't know
how can it work
that's the question
i guess the question also that we discovered is that they don't throw rascals out
they don't throw the rascal out their own rascal
my solution to part of this is to make it an economic incentive for people to vote
that sounds rather crass i think because then you are saying
know it could be convoluted in many ways where people would actually by paying them
you would take a certain amount off their income tax or property tax or whatever
it would be very difficult to administer because i am sure that any time money and votes are involved
the whole thing
how about the reverse of that
when i have heard about england's elections they are allowed to run for what a total of six or eight weeks even for the higher offices in the land
what if we totally just severely limited the campaigns so money wasn't so much of an issue
i feel like
the idea is to get the individual to the polls a-a-and we have to make it as easy as possible for him to get to the polls
i don't care how easy it is for them
i do not think they are going to because they do no think that anybody listens to their vote
they really think that the packs no matter what you're promised during a campaign
these days we are promised hardly anything of substance
you mean the special interest groups
no matter what a candidate promises during the campaign which isn't very much specif-
they do not promise anything specific these days
whatever you are promised they just reverse themselves depending on who pays them what once they get into office
i think that's the
read my lips and no new taxes
yet bush did that
he's excused from that
generally people i've read polls now where they've excused him because there was a definite necessity to balance the budget
then why did he say that during his campaign
he gave it
he promised the best he could
he is the president
he should address those problems
if there needs to be a change in a period of time
what was so funny about it is that i guess that it happened so rapidly
i think it is
i think you still have a view that the american voter is different from other voters
he is motivated because we happen to be the cradle of liberty and all that
i think voters are motivated
what about voters in the other countries that you were talking about
like in the european countries where they have higher turnouts and the newer democracies
it's going to be totally different
you do not think so
i don't know if they have higher turnouts overall
i think that we just discovered in the indian elections is one of the greatest and massive things in the world
just it got more violent every year
concerned about their inability that their vote does not count any way
and the corruption of politics in that s-s-situation there
everything is relative to when we had higher turnouts because at that time we talk about the turnout relative to the eligible voter right
is
before this voting rights act what we had was a great deal of our population mainly the blacks in the south and the
hispanics were precluded by voting laws from their eligibility to register
if you really computed it they probably
i see
were disqualified
all the eligible voters it was skewed by the eligible voters being less than the total population of
isn't that kind of a blanket racist kind of thing to say the blacks and hispanics and other minorities just don't vote
is that just the truth
i think there's a higher percentage in certain black areas of voters
i don't know about hispanics
i haven't studied the statistics well enough to
i think in this sort of conversation we can only do our own reaction
that just made me think of something that happened down here in dallas last year
at one point they took another vote on it
the minorities could not get enough of a vote out to pass their plan
this is something that had been going on for months
they have had lawsuits over it
it was a major issue
there still wasn't enough minority vote to pass the plan that they were backing
that's
i think that you have really hit on something there
to say that those
with the minorities we are saying we have lower voter turnout
maybe it is now that we have minorities included in the
karen i wonder if we are recording
usually by this time they tell me that the time is up
my last auto repair was my alternator went out
i have a nineteen eighty-six toyota
i have a friend whose real good with repairing cars
i got him to take the alternator off and take it and get a replacement part
we went to a place called quality auto parts
their parts are supposed to be guaranteed and everything
they're very reasonable
i bought the alternator
we put it on the car
it didn't work
it blew out all the fuses
i bel- something like sixty-nine dollars something on that order
did he hook up the wiring wrong
it was just that the part just didn't fit the car
i took it back
the guy in the parts shop took the alternator
he put it on the little thing he has in there to test them
he said there was nothing wrong with the alternator
we went back and tried it again put it on again
it still didn't work
we took the car up to a little place called pep boys
i don't know if you have them in your area they're pretty reasonable car repair place also
towed it up there because it wouldn't start or anything
this thing just kept blowing out the fuses and took them about an hour to figure out what was blowing the fuse
it was the alternator that was blowing the fuse
the only problem was that it had to be a genuine toyota alternator because most of the other ones that they say will fit it that they sit in there and everything
there's just some little difference that causes it not to work an i-
that was my last experience
i had a weird
there's a little sensing device
it's an air conditioner sensing device
there's a metal piece that fits through the belts
somehow that broke off
i still can't figure out how it broke
anyway this piece obviously
i think you can only get it through subaru dealer etcetera
this little sensing device costed like sixty bucks
i haven't had too many problems with my car
just basic maintenance and oil changes
i do not do my oil changes
i will not do my oil changes
i think the first time i tried to do one and ended up trying to ge-
i did this
i went and bought everything
after buying the filter and all the oil you're looking at ten bucks at least
or somewhere in there and then to go to the trouble that i figured it's easier spending eighteen bucks at jiffy lube
that's
as far as any maintenance on my car i shy away from the oil changes
my car it's an eighty-six
i really hadn't had any trouble with it until that
the car now has a hundred and thirty something thousand miles on it
this was just recent
i really can't complain about this one
i used to work
it was a seventy mile trip everyday two ways was seventy miles
a hundred and forty mile trip
it was just seventy miles
thirty-five miles each way
i did that for about three years
it really added up
i've only taken maybe two trips that were about four hours long down to shreveport
the rest of it it's just basically driving a long ways to work
now i drive twenty-three miles each way
i'm getting little relief
still i drive a long ways
i guess because they're highway miles it's not so bad on your car as if it were just regular street
i was going to ask you as far as how we're getting compensated for what we're doing right now
i get these green
i just wondering how i go about getting the cash
there's a number that you call
it's the same number that you call to make a call
you call that number
somehow or another they'll give you an option to leave a message
you can leave a message
they'll call you back
that's good to know
this is the first time i've been called in a long time
i haven't been doing it
i've done it maybe twelve times
i don't know if i've done it quite that much
mine is mixed up too
let's see before i had this car i bought an audi five thousand i bought it used
i just bought it from a friend who just charged me what the dealer was going to give him for it for a trade-in
it had a whole lot of miles on it
i figured maybe i'd get one or two years out of it
i did get a couple of good years out of it
the engine messed up on me
i gave it to a guy to repair who works for the audi dealer
he took the engine apart
he just said he couldn't fix it
the engine never got put back together again
None
i think those old cars might be a pretty good bet because you
that's when they made cars though
the body was in good condition
it ran fine
i had to
about couple of months after i was out of college i finally splurged and bought my car
these cars made in the sixties and stuff
the thickness
those thin- they're just
they last a long time
they were simple too
some people will still buy them
i guess it's still easy to find engines for those cars engines and transmissions
i guess if you keep changing them out you can keep a car for a long time
course i guess i could do the same thing with the toyota that i have
i just think they cost too much in the first place now a days
my last vacation was in connecticut
we went home to visit family
actually i did visit hawaii once
i never made it off of oahu
when we were in oahu i couldn't wait to get off
we took a cruise
we went to four different islands
it was really nice
we had a great time
where have you been
None
that one would count
that was about a year and a half ago
what did you just decide to go there
my husband is french
we were living in france at the time we decided that i've never been to africa
i needed to get that continent since i
it's a fairly common vacation place for french people to go
they speak french
in that sense is just a little bit easier
it just seemed like it would be a fun place to go
i'm sure it was wonderful
we didn't really have enough time
as always it seems a bit rushed
we were there in the winter
in january or february i don't remember which
when my father worked there they used to travel quite a bit all around
in europe and whatnot
i was very young
i don't remember that
None
that's too bad
i don't remember
we have all these wonderful pictures of all these great places that they have been
that was when i was a baby
that area of the world i think would be great
the only thing i didn't like was in some of the more touristy areas it would just be besieged by people wanting to be your guide
there were some places
we had nothing taken because we knew
we had things in inside pockets and in jacket underneath a coat type of thing
we found that in jamaica
that people would come up and try and sell drugs and things like that
they were so destitute
i guess they make all their money on tourism
they would come up and ask you if you want to buy different things
really after awhile it really gets annoying
it's a little scary too when they're coming up and they're all over you
the worst place was in marrakech the other cities it wasn't nearly as bad
a couple of them it was what we did in some of the other cities
they tell you to do that is to hire a local guide it doesn't matter who it is
they keep everyone else away from you
it's worth it
it's like ten dollars a day or something
its worth it just to keep everyone else away from badgering you you feel stupid doing that
we did it
we were much happier
you also get in to see things that you might not get into if you were alone
that's great
you lived in france
you've been all through europe
i haven't been all through europe
we're going to go for a conference in september
hopefully we'll get to travel a little bit too
my more exciting spots have been
lots of wildlife
that was really really fabulous
just the photos i have of it and gosh incredible and be so close
august eighty-eight
after there i went to hawaii
a lot of my travel has been sort of based around conferences or business meetings i went to hawaii and then to australia and japan and china
did you see the great barrier reef and go snorkeling
i didn't go diving
i'm a diver
that's actually been another of my favorite vacations has been taking little diving trips
i drove from sidney down to melbourne and over to adelaide
i've seen in
they show all this wonderful seafood and great big prawns the big shrimp
didn't have shrimp there
in fact i didn't eat out that much there because i was traveling by myself in a car
it would have been i think much more fun to do it in the van
you're adventurous
i was by myself in china too
china was a little bit more of a challenge
it wasn't more of a challenge in a sense because i hired a guide all the time
i never got out by myself or not much
i paid about either a thousand dollars or a little bit
this is from hong kong
i was already in hong kong
it only cost you about a thousand dollars to go there
i went to beijing shanghai chengdu
then i took a train up from shanghai to a little quingdao i think is the name of it
it's a little sort of getaway retreat village not far from shanghai
i had two internal plane flights and a couple of other things
i guess i relate it to japan where things are very expensive aren't they
japan's ridiculous
i didn't stay in the top of the line hotels
i stayed in
they were newly built
they were sort of the lower end of the top of the line hotels
you don't want to stay in the very exclusive
i highly recommend that way to go
a friend of mine who had gone for a business trip to china
she just gave me this woman's name to contact
it would really be fun i think ideally with like two couples because you have a car and a driver and a guide
i grew up out in the country and was used to having guns around the place
i'm not for gun control
in the strictest sense of the word
i think i'm kind of bent towards middle liberal of the bridge myself
i have quite a collection myself
i'm a good hunter
i started hunting when i was twelve years old
i don't want to see them ban guns completely
i don't want them to completely turn loose of their controls either
i feel that its
i think what was national rifle association had this bumper sticker a few years back about if you outlaw guns
i believe that too because the person that is wanting to
commit a crime is going to find a way to get a gun a knife a rock
it's the honest citizens like ourselves that are responsible about use of guns
there's an element that can't
it's got to the point now where even our police departments and our d e a agents and everything have to carry automatic weapons
everybody that's in drug trafficking has got them
yeah
there was an article in the paper just this week where i think it's one of the gun companies i can't remember which was developing a ten millimeter automatic pistol for the f b i which would give them additional firepower
it had held a fifteen shot clip
which they would be able to put down anything that came at them
you figure you got some drug guy out there that's got an uzi machine gun
a thirty-eight
i have lived in illinois at one time
they passed a it wasn't really gun control
it was you had to register as a gun owner
you had to have this card
it was like a driver's license card that you had to have it in order to buy ammunition that was the first
they had that so that they were trying to control it a little bit in that respect
in california they make you register when you buy ammunition
you have to sign a
they take your name and driver's license number hunting license number and all that good stuff
rifles aren't too bad
any kind of handgun at all
i bought a pistol there
there was a fifteen day waiting period
that's not a bad idea
i think that a waiting period
again it's going to be the law abiding citizen that's going to comply with that
i don't
the only way they could do it i think would be to stiffen the penalties on anybody using a gun
i think if we kind of stiffen them up a little bit course
i feel kind of weird about that anyway
i agree with you there that
again the purpose of gun control is to control how it is being used is what the purpose should be
i'm in favor of keeping the illegal guy from getting one in his hands
they're actually a necessity in life
they're not
sooner or later i need one
whether i'm out hunting or
i did in the service but not on the street
i don't really need one in the aspects
i use mine for recreation
i enjoyed my guns
i know what
my wife the same thing she knows how to shoot any weapon that we have not that i have an arsenal or anything
we have several guns around the house
i think it's
you got to have the
still i think they ought to know how to use one and that it's not just a toy and that it's not like on t v when someone gets shot they get back up
he
i have a fifteen year old and a seventeen year old
i've taken time to teach them
the young boy wants to know
i told him you're a little bit young for a gun let me go out here and we would start with the b b gun deal
he started with the b b gun and shot a couple of holes in a couple of windows
i took it away from him
he's learning the hard way
at least it was a b b gun not a twenty-two or a four ten or something
i remember i had an old uncle up by tulsa oklahoma that took me out and showed me
it was my mother's uncle
he took me out with him and single shot twenty-two
he taught me how to shoot a old single shot twenty-two
i was probably about twelve at the time
i thought that was the neatest thing
of course uncle sam took me hunting with him
he let me shoot and showed me how
i don't want to get out there deer hunting and have some guy blow me away
that's about all i
it's been real nice talking with you
she's only about a little less than two years old
we started saving
that's all
are you planning to encourage your children to go to a particular school
i think that's really a decision that
help them make in terms of what they are wanting to do
that's a big influence i think and
not only what you can afford but what's going to be best for them in terms of what their career goals are
you need to go to a school that handles whatever it is you want to do
university of mississippi
was that local or
None
it was not necessarily local it was
so what's
at the time i was thinking of going pre med in the state they had the best pre med curriculum for the state institutions
it was choice between there and a private college that was a bit more expensive
i ended up going there although it was quite a drive away for me
i enjoyed it
did you commute everyday then
when you said it was quite a way away i did not know that meant you had to drive like an hour
it was like another world
basically it was a
did not get home that often
at that age it's kind of difficult sometimes
did you go there straight out of high school
i did not get my degree until later on
i just finished mine a couple of years ago
i guess when you have to do it that way it makes your choices a lot easier
that's true
that's like when i went on to get my masters it was where i was at the time
i was not going to try to pick and go somewhere else because i was pretty much settled
i was trying to work
when you are first going to school you kind of have the luxury of being able to have some latitude in choosing the place to go
which group do you work in in t i
the computer science center
where is that at
north building
about three years
sounds like you got your masters before here
i have
i came straight from school to here
cause this was the first real job after getting my degree
my undergraduate degree was not in what my masters was
i made a career change basically
let's see
i have not
there's a lot of pluses and minuses for different schools just like you said
depending on what they want to specialize in and what you can afford different things like that
i have not really made up my mind whether to encourage them to go different places
one day i would like to the
i like the school where i went
i would not hesitate at all to encourage her to go there if she wanted to
the school where i got my masters at which was a different school
i liked it almost as well
that i'm not going to hold them to that just because i went there
i think that's
because you went there
they allow for tuition break for out of state students who children of alumnae
certain schools do it
i was involved in some alumnae recruiting here in town recently last year
it was kind of fun because you are
they were
this was a college night at a high school in richardson
it was
there were a bunch of kids a bunch of schools
it's kind of interesting to talk up your
i was surprised by the number of kids that came by and had heard of our school
and were interested in it
we
situations like that you don't realize until you start thinking about it the kinds of advantages you school may have over others
i was real pleased with that
did you drum up any interest then
that's good
it seemed like there were quite a few kids that were definitely interested in going there
she was wanting some more information
her daughter was a baton twirler or something
she had business cards describing her daughter's she had won several different twirling awards and all this
she had these business cards she was passing out
it was
i think richardson is probably one of the places that would definitely
i really have been pleased with plano
i have a child who
i thank god every day that i have the resources that we have tapped into
is he the elementary school
he's not severely learning disabled
he is being helped
he's being helped
he was in resource from second grade till fourth grade in math
they recently released him from
resource which i was thrilled
i just thought that was so neat that they got him over that hump
he's in the herman method of reading
basically what they do is they start right from the beginning relearning the sounds of letters
doctor haggard is heading that up
it's wonderful
in watching the way he has struggled
you learned how to solve your problems on your own
it's not an intelligence problem
has he had this since kindergarten
is this something that maybe learning phonetics
he just didn't learn the right way
it's funny
when he was in first grade he had trouble with spelling
i would say to the teacher
he'll say c a t
he would go to write it
he would write c o t
i kept saying to the teacher something is wrong here
you're right
the teacher kept saying he has a may birthday
i requested a conference
i was
i went up there the second week of school
i said something is wrong
thank god the head teacher the team leader was a special education major
how great
it was
she was able to zero in
she said we were going to call you if you hadn't called us
we think he needs to be tested immediately because once the first report card comes in they
she said i think we can get him real fast
sure enough they tested him
he qualified for the help
it's been great
i thank god i'm here because i know i have a sister who has the other extreme
she has a child in connecticut who is extremely gifted
because of the cutbacks in the economy they have nothing for her
to me that's the same thing
it's like having a child who has a learning disability that's being ignored
that's something that parents i think are able to help the gifted child in the home more than they could help the learning disabled child
that's something you can do by just enrichment types of things in the home learning disability unless you are schooled in the types of things and ways to help a child like that then it makes it real difficult this to me is the benefit i see in public schools is that you do have government money to fund
i'm not sure that the private schools or parochial schools address that problem
if they're a behavior problem they're out
this is kind of a rejection type of thing
we get it even at our level in
we get students that come in that have been kicked out of the parochial and private schools they come in
their attitude is i'm a bad boy and proceed to
i really hate that for them
when comparing test scores
they were comparing test scores between private schools and public schools
that was one of the points that i made is that you're not comparing apples to apples
you can't say i know steven probably would not be accepted because he has a learning disability
into a private school which is too bad
on the other hand i can't necessarily blame them
they are a private school
they
you can't say then public schools are not as good
perhaps they are because they're
if you choose the select top group out of the public schools and tested them and then compared them to the private school group then i think you would have a more equitable way
i have a problem when they compare the kids in japan or germany to the kids here
in honesty the kids in japan they have to try out to even get into to which kindergarten they're going to get into
after
if you only
in fact they've had cases in the past where parents have committed suicide because their child has not gotten into the top kindergarten which means they probably won't get into the top elementary and high school
if they don't when they reach a certain age that's the end of their schooling
they don't ever really go on
that creates a problem
you can't compare because they go so many more hours
you see that with the foreigners that come here
i was talking to somebody recently or read somewhere where they said that these children they had to be the best
they put off all social life all everything
is that good
on the other hand i feel like my children who are kind of middle of the road are more rounded
that's why i said their childhood is extremely different from mine
we didn't do all that
you don't see the parents encouraging those students to get on athletic teams or
it's interesting to see them as they get older then that is the type of adult they are
this is a very timely topic inasmuch as we're going to a family reunion this weekend
are you really
this is one that's the baker family reunion this has been going on at least twenty-five years or thirty
first time i married into the family
the first time i went was about fifty-seven i think
this one has been well organized
in fact it used to be at lake brownwood
now it's lake texoma because that's more central location for people from oklahoma and texas to come to
very important because you'll start losing people if it's too far to go
i have one reunion on my mother's side
we found that if it's in a certain part of texas some people come
if it's elsewhere other people come we never get them at both of them it seems like
i think we need to find a new place
listen they've had this one
it just
of course over the years it has built up as far as the organization is concerned now they have a golf tournament on the saturday
they have generally a show or an auction or something on saturday night to help raise funds to cover the costs of such
that's a neat idea
they get the community building there at lake texoma lodge
everyone brings in food for the saturday night dinner they bring in kentucky fried chicken from durant
it really has worked out
generally i think it's been as high as about a hundred and twenty people
i guess ours probably isn't that big
i often feel funny because i'm in a branch that's all but died i just have one aunt and my family
sometimes when these other families get together they're really pulling in aunts and uncles and grandkids
we're kind of off on the sidelines
it does remind us that we have family and roots
we keep going even though we're not a real big part of it
our family reunion started out my wife
i were the kids the newlyweds so to speak now our children go
our grandchildren are going now
that's great
it's wound up that we're the old folks now
they have various organized
they have generally a volleyball net set up and horseshoes to pitch
they organize a baseball game for the kids several people bring boats
there's a place they take the kids up to the lodge and go swimming up there in the afternoon
there's lots to do
it's a full day
some just come in for saturday it has worked out quite well
it's a chance to see some of the relatives you don't see all year long except that once a year
that's neat
i think they're really fun
we go to my husband's occasionally down in temple
he has a large family
it's fun when we go to that one
i think we've been to one in thirty-five years
that is a problem with the distance
the people that we have that don't come are out el paso way it's just too much for all of them
then we have the same attitude when it's out
they're going to have it at fort davis we thought that would be fun to kind of tie it in as a vacation time as well as reunion
each year of course they elect officers of the family reunion a number of years ago back in the early eighties my wife was president
it takes a lot of planning
it's a lot of fun
i think
the grandkids really enjoy it because it's the only time of the year they see all their cousins from oklahoma
it's good for kids to know that they have other family
this year they're all excited
what fun
this weekend's going to be a rock and roll show my two grandsons and one of their cousins are going to dress up and lip sing to a rock song in jeans and t-shirts and such
it's going to be exciting for them and for us too
they really get into it
it sounds like you really have a good structure and have it going along
ours is still kind of loosely organized
the same people usually get stuck with doing it
that generally happens
the officer idea is a good idea
we've had various things over the years to raise funds for it again it's not cheap to rent the lodge up there or the meeting room down in the cabins and such
they've come up with
they've had auctions and various things to raise funds
some people do
some people don't
it's not fair that everybody not contribute
thanks a lot i enjoyed talking to you
i am the product of i think as much the changing roles of women as anyone
my mother
my mother and i were really first generation divorce in our family
my mother was divorced in nineteen fifty-seven
i was the first one of anyone that anyone had ever known
of course now fifty percent divorces in the united states
my mother was treated very badly by a lot of family members especially from my father's side of the family
also we were
ostracized by his family basically we just kind of dropped off the face of the earth
they all felt that there was never an issue that my father was the cause of the reason for the split up even though he had impregnated another woman and forced the divorce
it was always my mother's fault she was not sufficient she just was not good enough
that's too bad
that's sad
None
i think that there are people i think that
i was first generation going to college in my family
first my mother had always had a quote career but always a career as in a secretarial position
she did rise to the highest position that a woman could rise to in a secretarial profession in des moines iowa
that's wonderful
she was a secretary the jud- to a circuit court federal judge
it was a lifetime appointment for her as well as for him
that was a really high status position
that's wonderful
hard driving lady with a steel rod up her back
bless her heart
i went to college and now since have completed two masters degrees
i am the director of music in a church
it's interestingly enough i am still everyday confronted with
for instance i am just not taken as seriously
at professions as many of the men who are doing the same job i do
the choir members treat me differently because i am a woman they expect me to be more motherly
i have experience with this because i work at both as a director of music and also as an associate under a man
i am pretty aware of what goes on in the church
basically that's
i am done talking
i think that you carried forth your subject matter very well nickie
i can relate to that
i think it's the image that the woman has and in the world
as the lesser of the two
i think things are changing
the changing is taking a long time longer than we would like it to take
i think we are progressing at a snail's pace
we are progressing
that's the main point is that we are going ahead
i think that in the long term that women are going to be able to have the recognition
men a lot of them have come around and have seen
there are a lot of die-hards out there that will never change
we have to face that reality also
i have never been able to figure out why they can not ever change why they can not bend why they can not just accept competent women
i have never been able to understand that
what
it could be if they are not sure of themselves
the one's that go along with that they are sure of themselves
they know that they can be on the same level
they do not have any ego problems that they are fighting
i think that we are going to be on par with them in salary and in recognition
what i would like to see happen futuristically
is that yes we each have our jobs in life
i think our problems would be fewer
they in their own peer relationships they do not treat themselves equal
it's really difficult for them to treat women as equals
they are really much more comfortable with somebody being the boss and somebody being the follower
it seems that they are more comfortable that way
i do not know if it's a militaristic point of view i guess
everybody else is infantry
it's just really interesting to me
who treats me with as
when he gets angry it's always over control issues it's always over power issues it's never over it's always you said you were going to do something
you did not do it as if he is the boss
i am the slave
those are the only issues we ever fight about
i think it's just difficult for men to accept women equally
dictatorships are real efficient
i guess we would have to go back to the way that the lord made us
the women when they are married they are to be subjective to their husbands
i believe that strongly
i think that they should be in harmony with what they are with what the subject matter is
i think the issue should be settled
i think that can happen in a very wonderful way
if we men and women would do as the bible said that we would esteem each other higher than ourselves
if your husband did that to you
you did that to your husband
that's really the divine answer
and the right answer
that would be a beautiful relationship
i think there are some people that have done that
i have seen it
it's just marvelous
i am just in awe to see this
i'll respond
i'm very guilty of not doing my part with recycling i'm afraid
we recently moved here from north carolina
it was very easy to put everything out there
we don't have it at least in our neighborhood right now i've been very guilty about not making the effort to take things where they belong
how long have you been here
we've been here since january
we still feel very new
it's working up to a year now
i guess we're old timers compared to some people
you need to get into
and we didn't recycle at all before we came i think we're doing well
we save most of our aluminum cans and glass and newspaper right now
where do you take those things
the glass and the newspaper we usually take to walmart
in behind walmart they have bins we usually save up our cans and change them in for money
where do you do that
we've been saving cans for my daughter's choir
i didn't know where to take them
there's a place on parker road
it's just over the overpass before you get to k-mart
i think there's a service station there
there's usually a semi truck that has a person there that will weigh them
what i hear a lot of neighborhoods do have the pickup now
hopefully we'll be getting them in the month of october
it seems like ever since we've moved here we've been hearing that it's coming in a couple of months
the trucks that were supposed to do it there's been some problems with from what i've read in the mail that we get i can't wait for that
i feel guilty we don't recycle our milk containers because they seem like a big waste
they're a lot of bulk anyway yeah
i think that's when i'll start doing the plastic too
it was just no effort at all no more trouble than taking out the garbage
i've gotten used to washing the salad dressing bottles and
it's nicer to just throw them out
we can do our part
how much do you earn on the cans
i didn't know what kind of an idea to give her for
when we first were here it was like we'd take maybe a grocery sack full or maybe two grocery sacks full
it would be like two dollars since last time we've gotten more like a dollar
it's gone down
i think more people are recycling
that's something we don't really make any effort to
whatever pop we drink we used to take the boys out for a bike ride and pick up the litter the cans that was kind of fun
we haven't done that for a long time
that sounds like a pretty good project
i'll have to keep myself and get on it
my neighbor across the street is so careful about recycling
i keep telling myself i'll get it organized
maybe they'll beat me and do the city wide first
hopefully the bins will be here in this month
that will spur you on
that's all you can do
have you
do we
they
if it's been long enough five minutes is when they cut in and say we don't have any more room for recording
you can't chat all day
we can say good-bye now
maybe we'll get on line again
do you have any pets
i have a dog named grisly who's a ten year old mixed breed between golden retriever afghan hound and chow
i have a pair of box turtles
i used to have box turtles years ago when i was growing up i really like them
lucky and spot that's their names they live in an aquarium without water in my family room
my dog thinks he's a mother turtle
do you have any pets now
we have one dog a bichon frise
our friends in houston bred the dogs
i had never heard of them they're all white
they're small and fluffy
they're not very well known in this country
they're not high strung or over bred
how big do they get
ours is on the small end
she's about ten pounds
that's interesting
they range from probably ten to sixteen pounds they love people and kids
that was something we were looking for
our love is golden retrievers
that's what we had intended to get in houston
we had a small yard and a pool
knowing how they love to dig and love the water we thought that was kind of a tough climate we ended up getting this
my son would rather have a golden retriever though i think
we've got a good size dog
we were considering getting a puppy a small house lap top dog for him because he likes other animals and because we used to have a miniature dachshund
i miss having a little one around
they're really sweet dogs
we thought probably our neighborhood in houston had more of this breed than any other place just because of the family that had them and bred them
a lot of them stayed in the neighborhood
how do you spell that breed
how do you pronounce that
they don't shed
they're good dogs for people with allergies
they love people
ours barks more than some because she spent a lot of time at our friends house
they had a cockapoo and two bichons
she didn't bark at all until she spent time there now it's funny
she's a good watch dog if there's she'll bark that way
she also talks a lot
she has a definite personality
if we're leaving her she barks at us because she doesn't want to be left
they're very smart dogs
the circuses in europe used to use them for the acts
they'll dance on their hind legs each they're very easy to train
about how much are they
they range
how about the person in houston
she's no longer breeding them her dogs the second one that she has was one of the puppies from the litter
the one male that she used had a tooth problem she only bred that dog once because it had the tooth problem and did them strictly as pets they weren't show quality
takes a lot of time
it's very expensive
she might have some contacts here
i know that the dog's grandmother was from plano
that's where i live
that's where i live too
what do you think about it
i found it interesting that they started off with a problems of immigration in america and then went back and said if there is a problem
i think there's some problems
they're not really big ones
i think that in general the whole immigration policy isn't quite as open as it should be
i was wondering what your response would be
where did you come from
where did your parents come from
that was prior to world war two
it's interesting that with the topic i think i agree with you
we have to remember the chinese came here and were our labor for the transatlantic railroad
our irish came and built the towns and
what do you think
that will be interesting
we have just
had a naturalization act where the mexicans that were residents in texas have become citizens now
i think that's all right
i agree with it wholeheartedly
when you were giving your answer i was thinking is this a texan i'm talking to
texan philosophy is a little different
a lot of the experience that i have with this problem has to do with my brother-in-law who's chinese and immigrated from china
he got a green card and is in good standing in america and china but only because he was always nice to the chinese government
he was always on pretty good terms with them
their
they're trying to get permission for his mother to come to america to help care for the kid and that sort of thing
it's turned out to be sort of a horrible problem
then you have first in the experience on immigration
that is interesting
i wonder even with those that were involved with tienamen's square
did we really protect them
i think that's pretty crazy
because those students who were in america when that was happening are almost certainly going to be in trouble if they go back
aside for that they're the best and brightest of china
it's certainly in our best selfish interest to keep them here if we can
what do you think about
these are not the brightest
these are refujees you mean
we're talking boat people
i don't have any problem with that
interesting when my daughter was in high school one of the custodians was vietnamese with his limited english they found out that she was in student council
they found out that he was a medical doctor
we started recording already
i guess
you pressed one
i guess we're supposed to start talking
i read a lot of steven king dean r koontz uh-huh
it's mostly all novels
i'll read some classic too
like what
a rose family by faulkner that's one of my favorites
this is more of a play or something that it was from that i saw
i read the book from that
by the way my name's bill
a bunch of stuff i guess fair number of novels but mostly shorter ones
i don't really like the six hundred page long stephen king novels and all that
i read one like maybe once a year
i like richard broudigan a lot
he's dead now
he was really a pretty amazing writer
he wrote books that were pretty short and pretty easy to read written at a third grade level or whatever
they were still very heavy and philosophical also very funny
he wrote trout fishing in america
that's
i read a lot of non fiction books too
let's see
i like to read a lot of non fiction history when civil war era and that kind of thing
that was on t v
it was
and about a american woman that got kidnapped in
this is when they were having their revolution or whatever
teddy roosevelt sent troops over and really portrays him as a
how crazy
just like one quote that he had was that he thought the america's emblem was stupid because it was an eagle
it should be a grizzly bear because the grizzly and stuff like that
that's what made me want to read the book
i also read a lot of books about music because i'm interested in that and fair number of stuff about science and also philosophy things
i like to read some of the philosophy stuff
let's see
even like reading some new age things things that i don't quite believe in
here on my shelf i have a book called journeys out of the body
even stuff about not like ghost stories but real encounters with ghosts and supposedly haunted houses
i like to read stuff like that
None
i read dianetics once i got past all the gibberish on it
did you like it
it took me a while to really get into it
it didn't help me that much
i think once you're set in your ways you're set in your ways
then i
one real interesting book i read recently was when i was looking for a job
it had real good tips
i got the
where i'm from the atlantic coast conference is a very big conference
course we have duke university that was the national champions last year
i'm kind of hoping that they'll repeat again this year
this is college okay
hopefully we'll have a good year
that's probably all i saw
we have moved in the last couple years from utah to texas
there's so many
none of them are our alma mater
i follow it especially around the playoffs
course i was real familiar with the utah jazz
the mailman or karl malone was pretty big thing
the lakers have always been amazing to watch
i did keep track a little bit of the mavericks
and have a lot of problems with tarpley
maybe now that that's over they'll come out of it
that's an up and coming team though
they're not going to have
i think chicago will probably with the n b a again
course the celtics are always
be interesting to see how the olympics does this year with all the n b a players playing on the olympic team
the season hasn't started yet
we need to talk about baseball
my atlanta braves
i really do
it is
that's why i've
i haven't really even started thinking about basketball yet
this wasn't a good subject
i guess my personal opinion i don't mind paying taxes necessarily
i just sometimes wonder if our money is being used in the best way
sometimes when i hear even what the politicians are making when they're getting a hundred and fifty thousand plus benefits and that i think that's just a bit too much to be paying them
that's all tax money
when you read about that they're spending all the money on these studies that have no relevance whatsoever that kind of ticks you off too
somebody was telling me the other day that they heard some senator say that what we're paying it's not that we mind paying taxes it's that we're paying too much for a lousy government
i tend to agree with that
i think there's just too many levels of bureaucracy
i think it can be managed by less levels
i know any time there's a big budget cut
any time there is a budget cut or crunches it's always the small guy that gets hurt
it's never the person that's making a hundred thousand there
sometimes we're running around there
i see these supervisors running around having meetings
i really don't know what they do
i sometimes wonder are they really doing anything
i think we're going to see a streamlining in the government
None
i don't know what level or how long it will take for the public in general to start saying hey this is too much we're not going to pay any more we're not going to pay for this
you're out
i think i don't know what kind of input we're going to get from the public and how they're going to go about doing it
i think we're just getting taxed way too much
right now we're getting taxed probably around thirty-five percent or more
that's me not making a whole lot of money
they got so many hidden taxes that it's really hard to figure out how much you are paying because go to a grocery store something like that and you're paying a little tax here
you
there's probably at least about twenty-five to thirty cents of different taxes on our gas
you don't realize
i don't know what our gas tax is
they're hitting us up
they may not raise it federally as much one year
then they'll raise it somewhere in the state or the sales tax or property tax or whatever
it's just you can see that you're money is just not
i know like with reagan they say no new taxes
they changed the deductions on you
that just raises your taxes they just get it a different way to me it did raise my taxes
you
all of a sudden i don't know
i heard someone say that if they would just something about with the defense budget all that extra money they're throwing back if they cut back by so much percentage it could throw back about six hundred dollars on an average six hundred dollars
even though it's totally out of my degree training i've been working as in the horticultural aspect oh
for goodness sakes
the last i don't know fifteen twenty years i'm
i work for the state as a grounds keeper
that's interesting
at this time of the year are you doing much garden work
i don't know
i guess growing up on the farm and that i've always had a big interest
when i have an area to do i always had a big garden and enjoy working on lawns and everything
i enjoy flowers and stuff
i don't do a whole lot of it at this exact point in my life because i have two teenage boys
they do all the lawn care
i still take care of the flower beds and things like that
i was even planning to go out and to dig up some hibiscus plants that will not make it through the winter here but were planted in the ground since last spring i was going to dig them up for a friend and for some starters for me
that's terrible
lo and behold about five days ago we had a freeze down to about twenty-three degrees or something the hibiscus plants no longer exist
i really feel bad about it
it's a plant that we've had for probably twenty-five years that these were cuttings off of
they're all gone at this point
i grew up in illinois
why everyone that lives in town and has yards practically has
with that why our lawns do stay pretty nice all summer if you water
in the winter we have bermuda grass in the winter it turns as brown as a grocery sack
when i go back home to my parents in illinois in the winter their grass is fairly green
that's one aspect of a lot of those grasses they go dormant
i think the saint augustine and centipede grass is another one you have quite a bit of down there yeah
they really have a heck of a time keeping it going in the middle of the summer
those lawns look nice during the winter
they almost stick out like i guess not a sore thumb a pretty thumb
when you look at the neighborhoods they're all brown except the one
it's sort of like
i know my folks live in arizona there
they just grow rocks
that's their gardening there i guess as long as you can have some grass there
i know i was in houston when i was working for a company once
we were taking care of lawns out there
that particular year they had just tons of rain
i know with all that moisture a lot of the lawns get a lot of disease problems
houston is a lot wetter than dallas area
are you able to get sometimes a double crops of certain things in your garden
i guess i never have here actually
yes
what do you guys having up there
i haven't been up there since forty-eight i guess
that's a long time
let's see it was forty-eight
we did an air show out at andrews
what's it been like up there
for the past week or two it's been cold and wet before that for most of the year it's been hot and dry
like september was hot and dry
september really was
i think for about twelve months through september the average temperature has been higher than normal each month
lots of ninety degree days during the summer
course this whole year
we have all these
somebody said you're either a stranger or a fool to try to predict texas weather
always they were saying it was going to be the hottest summer ever
we had all this rain
it really is not a bad summer at all really cool
all of a sudden in october it got real hot and dry and just stayed that way for a long time
then the end of october it started
into of november the first week actually we had a freeze
if you had it early
the average first frost is like the fifteenth of november here usually it's not until later
we really need the rain that we've been getting
it has not today
the last few days it's been pouring most of the day
is it flooding anywhere
i have not heard of any problems of it flooding anywhere
that's occurred certainly at times in the past
no
it's just kind of clou-
we're supposed to have a chance to get some rain the next couple of days here which will be a little bit more typical autumn weather but really it's strange
it's like we went into winter the poor trees said what
then it became winter like today it's sort of change to warmer to sort of more typical autumn day
there you
usually there's
all these huge trees just like the eastern hard wood belt all the way up to maine
it's that same trees pines and hard woods hickories and oaks and stuff
i was up there last weekend
there are trees that still have their leaves on
they're green
they're dead
the freeze just got them
they weren't ready for it at all apparently
we haven't had a typical fall at all
not much color changes have occurred at all
i'm not sure what that means
our leaves are all on the ground now
you all actually had some color
we did for a time
that's
i think you could drive along in maryland and look at the sweet gum trees on each side and the pines and what not
you could be driving along in east texas and looks just the same
it's almost identical kind of country
i was up there cutting some firewood this weekend
little oak tree that was dead and cut it up and split it
that's because it can't tolerate a freeze this early
there's some trees
the white oaks seem to be pretty hardy
there are a few oaks that have lost their leaves
what i notice mostly is the red maples that the leaves are just dead the dogwoods still look they got bit on the ends of the leaves a little bit
they still look pretty good
it just depends on the tree
it's not often you get many women interested in football
i haven't recently
do you have any
i guess kids are out
i'm married
do you like football
i follow the cowboys
that's about it
the same here
i am a pretty big dallas fan been for a long time i haven't been to any games recently
i try to catch the game every weekend that i can
it's pretty nice
we decided just to watch them at home
at least you follow the game a little bit
hopefully they win
right now i'm in college
i'm more into college football than professional i think
i see
what school are you going to
i'm at b y u
what are you planning to go into
i haven't really picked a field
i don't know i've thought a lot about labor and delivery
i don't know
she really enjoys
she's a nurse in san antonio she's been working on a late shift
she works i guess the graveyard's what you'd call it
she's worked that for years when i was small
i guess probably going on twenty years now
she really enjoys it
she just started a new job at a different hospital closer to where she lives she's really enjoying herself
that's great
good luck to you in pursuing your nursing degree
do you plan on staying in the dallas area
i'd like to come back to dallas
my family's there
i think texas san antonio in particular has got a large base of hospitals
i don't know about dallas
i'm in dallas i'm originally from san antonio they've got large medical center down there
if ever wanted pursue anything more than your nursing degree that'd be the place to do it
my brother-in-law is in the medical profession he's at medical school in san antonio right now
like i said good luck to you
take care
maybe we'll meet up again some time
my name is donna donahue
i live in plano texas
i live in raleigh north carolina
do you want to start
should i start
we have three children
they attend the public school here and are very active in a lot of the sports soccer and baseball
my little girl goes to tap dance
my little one goes to preschool
i'm home with the children just do a lot of running around
what about you
i'm single
i live in a town home here in raleigh
it's pretty typical of the other town homes in the area we have a lot of town homes here as well as single family homes
at the time that i bought this one it was just a much better arrangement for me personally
that sounds pretty good for
i know my husband takes an awful lot of time on the weekends not so much now but to maintain the lawn and the edging and the flower beds
it's a lot of work owning a home with a little bit of property attached to it
it's sometimes i think it would be nice to have a town home with
if you ever get one be sure the walls are good and thick because if they're not you can hear
that's the main thing when i was shopping for one
i wanted to make sure i couldn't hear my neighbors
that was i bought one that's more like living in a
that sounds lovely
they're kind of built on a catty-cornered instead of like side by side you don't actually hear anybody next door to you
in your area then there's probably a lot of career type people that have those type homes
the area that we're settled in is definitely young families with kids
they're still doing a lot of building in the neighborhood
the people that move here seem to move from all over the country which we're from the northeast
it also gives you a common bond when you don't have a lot of relatives visiting your neighbors
None
we also in this area seem to have a lot of retirees people who don't want the heat of florida but don't want the cold of the northeast
they settle sort of in-between
is it very wooded around where you are
yes as a matter of fact this particular community that i live in is very wooded
how pretty
it's pretty flat and kind of barren
that's the only thing that we don't like about living in texas is we miss all the beautiful trees and the fall
the landscape is much different here in texas than it is in the north or even where you are
we definitely have a lot of trees here
fortunately the home owner's association does all that
that's another plus
this is the time of year we're starting to lose
we just have a few trees in the front and a few in the back but not much just a little
if you didn't do anything about it then they'd probably the leaves just blow away
have a happy thanksgiving
the way i dress for work is this year nineteen ninety-one has been really suit and tie
i shouldn't say suit but coat and tie every day
a year ago i changed jobs from being a researcher to doing marketing for the research group
i guess it's a different set of standards i guess
i dress almost the same every day
pretty much it's a white shirt and slacks and shoes and a coat
it was very different before
i'm a drafter
i just wear blue jeans and tennis shoes
i have sweatshirt on today
that's pretty much the norm for me
if i come in a dress everybody's shocked
they ask me what are you doing in a dress
it's usually i haven't done my laundry lately
does it change
i guess do you have things like presentations to do or anything like that
back in my old job up until through nineteen eighty i would usually wear blue jeans and pullover shirts and the like
probably once a month or so there was some reason that i would have to put on a suit
that's for my husband's job and not mine
i see
that's interesting
let's see what else about this
it seems like t i is pretty cut and dried with two or three levels
there's the upper management that always wears gray suits
and the people that don't
if i want to say don't have power or don't have authority or whatever like i used to be in that research i guess you are
there's kind of the branch manager level or marketing people that kind of do that middle thing
there's not much
middle of the road
some of these mini skirts are worse than shorts ever thought about being
i guess that's one of the things you got to put up with when you don't have a dress code
i guess isn't there a dress code something about spaghetti straps
supposedly and backless things i've seen those too
this wasn't necessarily a big conversation
i think we did it
your name was lisa
i work in the north building
thank you
advice on son or daughter going to college
that's advice that i will need in time future for my children rather than one that i have personal experience with
i suppose i would ask what the child wants to do in life and what the child hopes to get out of college and what sort of college would best meet those needs
let's see
when i went away to school i'm trying to think my criteria
i guess when you're eighteen or so it would be important to know if it was a coed college
that was a strict requirement for me
again how serious a person is according to what they want to get out of school
let's see
what was the question
what's the criteria for picking a college
okay
stay in a dormitory if you can
also depending on how adjustable your child would be or flexible i guess it would be
if they chose a college in a different part of the country that maybe they were unused to the way they run things
the northern colleges are very different than the southern colleges i think
you have to be more flexible and more willing to adjust to other people's mannerisms and customs or ways of doing things
you have to be a flexible person to be able to go all the way across country to something totally different than what you're used to
i'm thinking what problems my children might have in that
i agree with you
let's see
climate would be
you'd have to is somewhat
if it's something different than the one they're used to i guess
i'd also advise them that if mom and dad paid for their college that if they decided to drop a course or decided that they need another year then they'd have to get a loan to continue
and to take out loans to assume debt after college
the responsibility of that
they could work and earn money towards college
it's a lot cheaper if you stay within your state than if you go out of state to a private school
like i said if they was willing to work in the summers and also maybe then the parents could pay a third
then maybe they could take out a loan for a third depending on how expensive it is
it's not too far away
it's getting there
we still definitely can put away the money for college now
i would advise that they did not have a car at college
yeah
i think it's more a burden to provide for
i think because most kids don't have a car at college the ones that do get taken advantage of
i think it's just trouble waiting to happen
i would advise they didn't take a car
they didn't take a television
they didn't take a refrigerator
i didn't do any of those though
let me see
city slickers and star trek five
only five
i can't wait
it was classic trek
does the old star trek guys meet the new guys
however the rumor is that it will happen next time
you know that i read in it was u s a today that they said they weren't going to do anymore
except that the rumor is that they still might
it may not include the entire crew
it will be a next generation meets this generation
i'm not sure what the difference in light years between the new generation and the old guys was
that's right
considering that spock was on couple weeks ago and that the very first episode of next generation they had mccoy
he was rear admiral whatever
he just kind of hobbled down the halls real slow
matter of fact he looks just as about as old and the next generation as he does in the latest star trek
did they have some pretty good special effects
i think the script was just incredible compared to the last one
the script was bad bad bad
you know why
william shatner wrote it
is that right
even worse he directed it
leonard nimoy he does a lot better
in fact he didn't direct this one
he directed the one before i think star trek four something like that
journey home i think that was
you're a real life trekkie
i wouldn't go so far as being a trekkie
i've gone to one for real live trek convention
i saw james doohan the guy that plays scotty
did you get to talk to him
it was like want an autograph want to stand in line for about four hours
they have some good management principals in this new generation
it's kind of funny
i was reading in a book trying to think
it was saying don't do star trek management style
they were referring to captain kirk
he kind of was a cowboy type too
jean luke does more of a
it's definitely a lot better
saw the addams family last week
how was that
there were a few things different than the old series
on the whole it was pretty similar and
lots of little funny spots
in fact thing has a much bigger role than he does in the series
there is lots of areas where thing saves the day
he runs around a lot
just finger hopping
he's in a box right
he never does come in out of a box i don't think
that's okay
do you do any recycling
we do here
what do we recycle
they recycle
they also have centers where you can take aluminum cans and plastic bottles
i think that's all they have
we
there is a lot of things that you can recycle down here although the only thing i guess i wind up recycling religiously is aluminum cans
we've got a couple of different places
you can go up there and redeem
we've got one that gives you a penny a can
if you
you have to put them in there unsmashed
when you do that it basically crushes them and then drops a penny down a little shoot
can you hold on for just a minute
i'm going to try pressing one again to make sure that i pressed it hard enough because just succeed
i guess
i heard it that time
anyways you guys only get a penny a can
when you buy canned drinks and stuff like that do they charge you for the deposit
it's like they charge you for the deposit
when you turn in the cans unsmashed you're just reimbursed
it really is
really what happens is we just get a penny a can back off the price if you want to think of it that way
when we get a twelve pack then that's twelve cents back
you guys can actually get ahead
they have sort of things that you're not reimbursed for or paid for
we can recycle clear glass brown glass green glass
milk jugs and newspapers
that kind of stuff
they said they can't be smashed or else
they're not reimbursed by the people who are over them or something
shoot maybe what we ought to do is start sending unsmashed pepsi cans and whatever up there
they said that ways can encourage recycling
i tell you what really works at least down here is if there is even some money basically to take care of the gas to recycle it then people tend to do it
in other words taking care of the environment is all well and good if it's going to cost you to take care of the environment they're not quite as likely to do it as if you get something back for it
if there are some energy savings or if there is some significant savings anything that they can pass on to the consumer it kind of reminds me of using an a t m card to get money or doing your banking
if it's free people will use it
i know we had a problem down here with people taking oil out of their cars and just putting it down the drain sewer
None
apparently a lot of people every time they change the oil
they just dump all their old oil down there
that's good
another thing i thought of i guess to recycle would be like clothes because everybody gets rid of their clothes sometime or other
that way you don't get near enough as much as you bought it for
you got the use out of it
what you're going to basically donate to a goodwill or whatever anyways you can get a little bit of money for
that's something that i've never
we're new to iowa
that's one way to sort of get money and still recycle i guess
i know a lot of places they
i guess what part of the country do you live in
i'm also in dallas
have you always lived here in dallas
i'm a
i'm originally from boston
you are seeing quite a different climate and quite a different neighborhood
i like it
i missed it at first
now i go back there
i'm a real wimp about the cold
i like it here
that's good
i have lived in texas essentially all my life
i have traveled up in the northeast and around and have enjoyed it
i don't know
i'm getting older and not sure that's something i want to do
i live over in the lake highlands area if you're familiar with that
tell me where that is
i probably do know
i don't know it by that name
we're just north of white rock lake
we have some very nice homes here in this area
my particular
my particular area the homes run anywhere from about sixty-five eighty thousand dollars on up to probably half a million
the homes that were here earlier were smaller
now they've gotten larger and larger as they have developed the land
of course it's pretty static right now
all the values over here have dropped off because of the economy
gosh i'm barely in dallas
i guess we have a similar situation
we've got houses two streets away that are probably around seventy eighty thousand we've got bent tree right across the street
i don't even know how high those go
some of those are pretty big
that's the strange thing about i guess dallas because back where i'm from you wouldn't have that sort of a variation at all
they'd all be pretty similar to one another within a couple miles
we have suffered from real lack of land use planning in dallas
exactly what you're describing is what happens all over
we've got a house
it had previously been unoccupied
it had existed for three years
this is a whole block of homes that a builder built all of them
i guess he did some crazy thing to get some extra money from the bank and then ran away
the whole block was all foreclosed
some were vacant for quite a while before they finally sold them because there were so many
was your house in good shape
it was
we bargained to get an extra warrantee on that
we haven't had any problems
we had originally thought we'd have to get a fix up special or something because being from the northeast we figured we couldn't afford anything
the prices are much lower here
this was definitely not a fix up special
i'll tell you
i just finished repainting the exterior and making drapes and buying furniture
where i live is a house that's seventeen years old when i bought it
we bought it from someone who was in it
before they had it i found out after i had been in the house it had sat empty for the better part of a year
i'm not sure what happened
i do know the folks that we bought it from had done virtually no maintenance for about four years
i found a lot of things
and plano texas rather than plano illinois
do they have one
i didn't know that
i learned something already
let's see
the three questions are what
mine is down at u t austin at college
the other one is in high school
you do spend less time then
yeah they almost don't want to know us
i have two married two almost married
the other two i'm not sure
two for sure are single
between the spouse and myself we have six
that's kind of nice though
i came with a split family
she had
you shouldn't be lonesome on a holiday
they're doing their own things
that's true
a lot of times they've got
yeah sometimes they want to do their own thing
sometimes it's just spouse and me
you know what
right
who says that they just must got to come over to see us all the time for the holidays
if they force them to that's not good either
do they all live in the area
let's see
of the six we've got four around here
we're talking like north texas
one is in montpelier vermont
the other one is in everett washington
my second marriage
None
the s-
the fourth and fifth child of the six are the two that are scattered like that
those are a long way
they wanted to go
j r my middle son fell in love with washington state the third daughter fell in love with vermont
they wanted to make their homes there
are those two married
they just working up there or going to school or what
let's see
i guess you'd say j r is working trying to go to school
especially if they're meant to i think
i certainly hope so
i've got a daughter that's a sophomore at u t
i'm going to u t a right now myself
i agree it's never too late
when you're saying older we're talking fifty up
i say that's great why not
why not because that's a lot of times it's
i believe that we in that category
i'm not in that category quite yet we are seasoned minds
i don't know why i even went to college when i was seventeen
we know what we're wanting to study
we know our limitations
we don't try to burn the candle at both ends and in the middle altogether
we're past that age
we're smarter now
let's see
mine i don't spend a whole lot of time because they're not here
what was it
what do the trends in families
do we approve what other
the trends in the families were to spread apart do your own thing
lately i'm seeing a change that government can't do it
schools are not able to between a person's religion their faith in their maker whether you're christian or jewish or whatever
are going to have to solve some of the problem
the family those are the two that have the wherewithal
of course judeo-christianity and of the jewish folks too believe that the family unit is the one that was given the mission by the lord to do this very thing
when another group of people step in try to do it they're tromping on our territory so to speak
i firmly believe that
the only thing i'm thankful of is that we don't have to pay any income tax in texas
that's probably the next year's agenda
i think one way or the other we're going to pay for the bureaucracy i guess
it's one area that is really i think hurting the economy more than anything
i think the taxes every time you turn around they have taking more bite out of the dollars that are available for spending for any kind of products
i think that is probably as big a item fueling the recession as anything right now
i tell you
that one the taxes on gasoline don't bug me as much as what are we eight and a quarter percent sales tax
every time you go to buy anything now
even they tax food
i think that the problem with the sales tax of course is it's an unfair tax across the board as far as ability to pay which allegedly taxes are supposed to be directed towards
now people with the lowest income pay a hundred percent almost of taxes on everything they buy and where people that make two hundred three hundred thousand dollars a year certainly a portion of that they aren't going to be paying taxes on
that's the unfair inequities of sales tax as a main source of revenue
i don't think it is anymore not in texas anyway
i got you because people that don't make very much money wind up spending it all
that's the unfairness of the thing
i think taxes
what do you think of that new luxury car tax anything over ten or thirty thousand dollars
like other things if they don't affect you you don't worry about them too much
it doesn't
i think generally the prices of cars have gotten out of line which is
i guess if people got thirty forty thousand bucks to spend on a car that's their prerogative
i don't have a whole of sympathy on that
maybe you buy that
i don't mean to be knocking
to me it seems really interesting that they come along and add another ten percent tax on top of it
there's an awful lot of cars that cost more than thirty thousand
the idea of that kind of taxation is to have people think twice on putting their money into that i guess unless they really want it buy something that
more it's just like having taxes on or exemptions for kids
it's a way of increasing the population that was one of the initial ideas of giving exemptions on kids on federal taxes
where you exempt things like one of the best things i heard on taxes to stimulate the economy someone brilliant deductor probably lloyd bentsen said that all if they gave back the deductions on credit cards on your federal taxes people would probably be spending more money using their credit cards
i don't know if that's true or not
if you look on all interest things not just credit cards but on your cars and any kind of interest that you're paying from a personal point of view that might make certain sense in stimulating consumer purchasers
that's a lot of the games that politicians play on where they want to go tax things that they don't to a degree like booze
it gets to the point it makes drunks sober
tell me about your home
right now we're living in
it's me my wife and two young boys
right now we're in i guess it's either a zero lot line or a garden home
we don't have a big yard
when my wife and i first moved in it was just the two of us
it was enough
it's i guess what they call a story and a half
it's not a full two story
where everything on top is on bottom
it's got real high ceilings on half the house
the other half is just standard sized ceilings
it's about a five year old house now
it's pretty nice
these guys that gambled high lost big
i'm insulating myself from that problem
that's nice
as i look out the window of my trailer i can envision all the insulation that's going up
that's nice
i see
i retired about five years ago and started college
now i'm a college educated builder
there's still no work
i decided this summer that we had enough credit on the credit cards to buy the materials
i did
see the state has a law that says you cannot borrow the money to build your own home
you can't borrow the money to build your own
that sounds kind of dumb
the bank's holding the bag
as you know anything that involves the government works half as well as it's supposed to costs three times as much right
my home is fairly simple
i figure it's just me and my wife
i like to do stuff with my hands and whatnot
i want to have a shop
my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon
in the winter time i can see another guy
i can just make out his place
that's pretty good
i took a lot of time in choosing this site
you don't plan on putting any of that in
it's got a very small furnace
we'll use a wood burning stove as well
in the house itself i've been working inside these many months i have not had to use the heat
it's all geothermal
with all the
as much as i could get in it
the east side is glass
it's almost all glass
None
not really
it's on the side of a hill
i see
the first
the
i see
the side that's on the other side is about six feet high
i've got a pretty good grade there
when i put the verandas which will be twelve feet out all the way around on the north south and east sides that will define the shop
that's kind of like a victorian style
i've always liked that
we don't have much yard
i built a small deck in the back
i see these magazines where dig your own deck
i kind of wish i had them those size property and one with a grade on it so i can build a real nice deck
what sort of camping do you like to do the most
i do real rough type camping
rough type
i've enjoyed it
i've never actually done any tent camping
one of these days i'm going to try that too
that can be a lot of fun too
to go visit the national parks and state parks and just get out and see nature
so far my wife and i have pretty much had to stick with tent camping
this summer we went to the smokey mountain
how great
and stayed about three or four days in there
the days were nice and warm
it was beautiful beautiful few days
it worked out particularly well especially considering she was six months pregnant
it was one of those dome type pop up tents
about had to be something like that getting around in a pinto
that's true
i guess the last real camping trip i took has been a couple years ago
i went to california up to the sequoias
just the drive up the coast line and then cut over into the parks it's gorgeous though
that's my first trip back in goodness thirty years maybe
that is god's country
do they still have the scenic roadways that cut through the center of some of those trees
the last one
the first time i was there the tree was still standing
it has since come down
they are huge
if you've never seen them it's very awe inspiring
new orleans and minneapolis
there is lots of pretty country further west
you just need to take the little one
show them all the pretties before they go away
there is lots to see
there is course
the painted desert is real pretty
course the sequoias and the redwoods
the grand tetons are gorgeous too
course i guess i'm partial to big tree country
not a whole lot of forestry down there is there
place is forested with those concrete trees
lot of concrete and glass
i guess that's god's place too
what do you figure has been the longest trip you've taken camping
probably the last one that i went to california
i took three weeks
i was actually on the road a little more than three weeks
it was great
you went out from texas up into that area
we took the southern route and went through the grand canyon again
we stopped at las vegas for a couple of nights and then went into malibu in california over on the coast
we went up the big sur highway all the way up to san francisco
and then cut across through the wine country
and then went down to sequoia national park
big sur highway that's where you're pretty much in view of the ocean almost all the time aren't you
we don't right now
with pets
right now we don't have anything
we've just
it was
someplace where there
some children who would just really enjoy having an animal a dog i think
right now
campus housing does not even allow thinking about that
you like pets and things
i love animals
it was almost always at least one cat sometimes like fifteen or twenty but always cats in the house
we like pets
you've got to deal with taking care of them and feeding them and everything like that
our kids are
they're not used to it on a daily basis
they
from fourteen down to seven
he's about eleven weeks now
i don't know how familiar you are with that area of the country
that's interesting
it's really up north in the country really
my parents' house is like three miles south of where the mason-dixon line would have hit the ohio river had it continued that far
it's beautiful
from my neck of the woods it's hilly
maybe four hundred feet elevation
type variations from the valleys up to the hilltops
not a lot of farmland there
mostly it's
there's individuals growing their own food
most of the agriculture it's more in the way of sheep and cattle
even that's small time mostly
the biggest chunk of what's going on there is industry
aluminum plants
None
just finished up my fourth semester
did you
you've got some experience behind you in the work force
are you shooting for a bachelor's now or a master's or what
it seems to me from what i've been able to find out
it's nice and small which means if you don't get the class this semester then you've got to wait anywhere from two to four semesters to get
it's worth it once you get it
probably a good student teacher ratio and things
i was wondering what if you all were to get a pet like if you were to move into an apartment
a house somewhere what would you get
first off we'd probably wind up with a cat or maybe a puppy
i'm partial towards the larger dogs
our last we've had a couple of cats before we moved on campus
had a hamster or two
they got
it's amazing how much character
you have got a pretty big family
that is the hardest part about getting the stuff together
everyone is spread out all over timbuktu
most of us
i am originally from west virginia
most of the family is right in the west virginia what they call tri-state area northern west virginia eastern ohio southwestern pennsylvania
she is gone now
that is kind of what happened with ours
to make one successful what do you all do
do you all start planning real far ahead of time
there is
the day it happens is ninety-eight percent of the planning usually
we get together at the park and playground area of the church i was raised in everybody brings lots of food
some put up the volleyball net and sit around and tell stories and catch up and play volleyball all day and get really fat
it is a lot harder for us because like i said we are spread out we have to plan anywhere from six really probably a year ahead of time so that everyone can start their vacation time
sunday afternoon or sometimes it has been like on a saturday afternoon
most people do not have more than a couple of hours drive at tops to get there and back
is that one of your
None
where i am calling from is southern mississippi
we have got my wife and i have a bit longer ways to go than most
you also manage to make them
we have only made one of them since we got married about four years ago
we are both in school
that makes it kind of tough
they have been happening just after the summer semester starts
she took that summer off
now that we have been talking about it i am kind of getting home sick now
my grandfather is the only one that is still around
my grandmother is the one that use to plan this stuff basically
unless the aunts and uncles really get on the ball and put stuff together it is kind of like
originally i was born in missouri
we have relatives scattered out all over louisiana mississippi here in texas it is harder for everyone to get home
maybe this year you can find a more central location
the majority of them are just how you said in close quarters
it is easier for us few stragglers to go home
our family right now the most of it there is only a few stragglers with any distance
there is one cousin out in colorado some cousins over in phoenix
i got a sister over in washington state
the rest of them are within a couple hours drive
how do you all communicate like to plan it and every thing
do you all like mail out stuff
it is going to be such and such weekend
you all come
this is the standard pattern
somebody brings the volleyball net
i guess probably the last one i went to i met so many people that i had not seen in probably over ten years
i am like no
is that since
do you have them every year
still you wind up meeting people you never knew you were related to let alone
i think that is probably why our is probably so interesting is cause we don't have them that often when we do and everyone finally does get together
it is like after the
you have eight children
what type of things do you do as a family to spend time together
we spend a lot of time outdoors jogging bicycling going to the park some time watching v c r movies generally cheap things
with lots of kids you don't have lots of money for recreation
that's fun
let's see
you may think this is funny
one of our funnest games we like to play together is hide and seek
that is so fun
we do like to go to the park too like your family
we don't do a lot of vacationing
we get an occasional one or two day thing most of them are going and seeing grandma and grandpa
now where do they live
that's a bit of a drive for you there
you like to go there for the holidays
we don't go very often for holidays
what are the ages of your kids then
you have some in the nest and some out
they go down to four
i think the hardest thing for us is to find leisure time activities that all of our kids can enjoy together with the age span that we have
the older kids love playing board games and that kind of thing the young kids don't understand it they get real frustrated when we try to do that
if you want to play something on the little kids' level then the older kids get real bored
they want to do something else
i can relate to that
do you feel that the current trend in families spending time together is a positive one or a negative one
we have pretty much a routine that we spend
we don't have our kids play with other kids on sunday we just kind of keep them at home our next door neighbor
our next door neighbor was there
somebody came up and asked if their daughter could spend saturday night at their house she said no sunday's our family day
i think those kinds of things are happening a lot where we are right now
i think it's gone to one extreme where the families were just running all different direction i think more people are interested in spending time with their kids now
i feel like president bush has mentioned quite often that we are trying to become a kinder and gentler nation
it does begin with the families at home i'm a firm believer in that too
that's true
we see that a lot out here in utah
hopefully it's going to spread
do you have a lot of large families out there in texas
out here in utah five is about the average
we get up occasionally
i have some relatives out there in texas
where in dallas
no
is that close to dallas
i guess it's out there clear out
i like to play basketball and weight lifting
those are more or less indoor sports
in the winter typically it's probably too cold to go out and do things like tennis
i like to play tennis in the summer time or in the spring fall
in the winter it gets pretty cold
it's mostly indoor sports i think in the winter
how about yourself
i'm riding my aerodyne bike half an hour every morning
i'm just about ready to up it to up to forty-five minutes a morning
i feel like that's been a real nice exercise in the winter time
it's kind of kept me from getting cabin fever and has seemed to be a real nice aerobic exercise
do you do any anaerobic type weight lifting or weight training type exercise
first of all i'd like to get my weight off
i'd like to get the weight off
i'd really like to get into that
my husband and i have a aerobic video that's called the firm
it's an aerobic video with not necessarily bouncing around and jumping up and down
you're using weights
that is the most incredible aerobic workout i have ever done
it's really fun
it's similar to aerobics with weights it's like low impact aerobics just with weights
are you familiar with step or bench aerobics
yes
i have never done it myself
in atlanta that's
that's the in thing
that's the big thing
now bench or step aerobics have kind of taken over
how is that
they call it a low impact aerobics
it's supposed to burn off more calories at the same time
from when i've done it it does give you a real good
only thing i'm concerned about is potential for injury to your knees and movement of going up on the step that could create a problem
they seem to think that it won't
you never know
now if playing basketball are you knees
i think my ankles probably are my main weak point
i've kind of taken care of that
i wear high tops and then also a support ankle brace which is very stiff wearing that i haven't had any problems in the past year or so
that's good
you sound just like my husband
he injured his ankle about seven months ago playing volleyball
he's just had a heck of a time getting that ankle healthy
that's what he does
he wears his brace and his high tops
i injured mine so many times that rehabilitating became quite easy
it would only take three or four days
i could play again on it because after a while you just learn how to rehabilitate yourself to play that way
how successful is your exercise video
it is amazing how fast you take off the inches once i start my forty- i'd like to do the forty-five minutes a day on the bike for a week
every other day i'd like to incorporate the video and then the bike on the other day
it is really amazing how fast the inches come off
the muscle builds real fast
you can start
after that you can just start with your five pound dumbbells and then build up to your twenty-five pound dumbbells you're just doing repetitious exercises throughout the whole video
it's a hour long video
it's a good workout
i'm looking forward to losing this weight and being firm and healthy
in the winter i guess there's a lot of
we could have been out walking throughout the whole winter because really we only had about three weeks of snow on the ground
we're recording right now
i'm melanie from harrisville utah
another one from a different state besides texas
it wasn't really a planning one
it was a birthday i brought a lot of family together then
how did you feel it went
i've worked in hotels
i kind of know how to do these things
i used to
all this planning and getting together and such
let's see what else
it's all of like she comes from a big family
all she has
i have
they show up and all their kids
it's a pretty big reunion
my word
probably the biggest challenge was getting a place where everyone could eat comfortably and everything
i guess probably the most helpful thing was that for the rent we rented a rescue squad building or something like that
everybody that showed up donated some money for the rent and for soft drinks
nobody really got stuck with the bill
that's good
each person in the family brought a dish or something
did you have a main meal
did everyone just bring
everybody brought their specialties i guess you would say
of course my grandmother's food was as always gone first because she's such a great cook
she's eighty-six
is she pretty
she looks probably like she's in her early sixties if she didn't have arthritis she'd get around better than me as a matter of fact
there were
we sent out five hundred announcements because our family is quite large like your family there
that was a real challenge
i was president of our family reunion for two years
i wasn't very at that duty for two years in a row
i found that advance planning was the key to success
also one thing that's helpful
i don't know if your family's spread out or whatever all my family lives in the same county
that's wonderful though
it's just kind of like get on the telephone
it's so and such days from such and such date everybody just shows up
that is helpful
our family ranges from goodness australia
i have a brother lives in australia to boise idaho and all kinds of places
my immediate family my parents and my brothers and sisters i guess we're the ones that have the gypsy blood or whatever
my dad was in the army
we're pretty strung out all over
since they've moved back to carolina's we still are the only ones do not live in yantsen county
my parents live in greenville
i have one brother and his wife live in greenville and another brother that lives outside of fayetteville
we're spread out
everybody else is centralized in my home town waynesboro
my gosh
i don't think that guns should be outlawed it's going to
all you do is to get guns and then like with the stuff of that massacre in killeen texas not too long ago
i don't really know unless they do just outlaw them how you can prevent that
don't you think that just having some almost like a driver's license be required with stiff penalties if you are found with a gun that is not registered or that you are not licensed to carry
do you even know what the procedures are now
it's kind of like if you want a gun you can get a gun especially if you have the money to pay for it
in most states as long as you aren't a convicted felon
or on probation or other obvious things like that
i know that in a lot of states you could be just like released from a mental hospital the day before be obviously insane
have your legal right to get a gun
i didn't know that
that's pretty scary
do they want us to say where we feel about it in rating it one to ten
i'd probably say about a five
i don't really know how they can really enforce the laws any better i do think that some people need them for protection and stuff i can understand them wanting to have them
then again it's just like all those nuts out there
if you are looking at country where they do have a lot more gun control like england and places like that
yeah
the
it's really kind of a complex problem
is the crime that bad there in atlanta
i've not really had that many problems with it
apparently we were ranked pretty high up
i think in the te-
i think we have been ranked in one of the top three for murders in the last few years
i don't know if dallas is in the top three do you own a gun
if i get one i think i will probably get something
i would probably get a shotgun
just for protecting myself from burglar type thing
shotguns are really good because they're
somebody is not going to break in steal it and use it to mug someone
you
i just don't understand these people like when they decide they're going to buy a gun to protect themselves
they go out and buy a three fifty seven magnum which is going to shoot through
they're going to shoot through five wall
and hit someone
a shotgun just really struck me as being a real good defensive weapon
you can sort of point it somewhere in the direction of whoever
you don't
then the actual shot doesn't go that far a wall will stop it pretty much
now when i first moved to dallas i moved up here by myself
my dad gave me a gun i never did go out and practice with it enough to feel comfortable with it i finally ended up giving it back to him
i don't want to be responsible for it because if you're not going to teach me how to do it and if i am not going to
that really does scare me people that have guns
because if you ever get in the situation where you are not prepared to shoot
you pick up the gun and point it at the person that person rushes you
they get it from you
you're pretty much dead
because you've just told the person that you're about to kill them then
you basically made it clear to the person unless that you are a real danger to them
if they manage to get the gun from you their first reaction is going to stop you
that's why i ended up giving it back to him
i thought i don't want it if i don't really know how to use it i just didn't want the responsibility
did you hear about that killeen massacre or whatever
did it happen at a cafeteria or something
it just makes you wonder how people get guns
julie how do you feel about aids research
i think we definitely need more of it definitely
it seems like it just makes economic sense in that
it would have made even better economic sense to have had a lot more research than a longer ago
the country's going to wind up paying for the treatment of patients
do health insurance policies for companies and things do they cover diseases like that
what they do is if you apply to get a insurance policy they'll check to see if you're h i v positive
if you are not only will they not give you a policy
they have
there's a database of people that have tested positive
you'll never be able to get insurance ever again
that's why they should have started doing stuff before
still since it's dormant for such a long time there's still probably a lot of people before the tests ever really came out who are draining a lot of money right now
i think a lot of it was just that because the majority of the high risk groups were people no one really cared about
all these god-fearing people were like god is trying to kill off all the et cetera et cetera
one humorous retort i heard someone who claimed that aids was god's punishment was that then lesbians must be god's chosen people
do you actually think we're doing enough right now to
i did a research kind of thing on aids research and stuff
really we're not doing much at all
it's not really federal movement most of what gets raised by conscious communities and things like that
san francisco has a real strong aids support group and all that kind of stuff
they get donations from the community
and from corporations around the city for aids research and that kind of thing
i think there needs to be more of that sort of on a federal level rather than just in the places where it's predominated so far because it's bound to spread
it seems that it's just going to reach a steady state a lot lot higher point than it will if we'd nip it in the bud to quote barney fife
i don't know what the likelihood of that is
people really waking up
especially with the ultra conservatives move our political system sort of seems to be taking
do you think it's more important to spend money on research or for support of people
i think one of the main things that's really important to spend money on is education not support or research per se but education because a lot of people sort of get drummed out of the work place and out of society kind of like lepers would it's really not necessary until the disease reaches its final stage becomes really infectious i think that would be the most effective support they could get is for other people try to understand what they're going through and everything and try to understand that they don't have to be just completely
i guess i think that
i think it stands a really interesting question of
what do you feel about the present situation in the mideast
it looks like it's just about as volatile as it usually is
i think there's definitely been some changes
i think the end of the soviet union will definitely have it's effect on the situation
in that there's not
basically since the end of world war two there was always that little proxy war going on
with the u s funding israel and the soviet union funding the arab countries
we'll see what happens when they're not funded quite as much
on the same token israel has lost a lot of their value to the u s in being the foothold of capitalism
in the mideast
we tend to be pretty strong supporters of israel ourselves
we kind of cringe when they make mistakes but yet overall tend to support them
i think one of the most interesting things to me recently was during the war
in kuwait was the fact that they did not retaliate
for the scud missiles that were launched there
that just seemed to me to be a phenomenal demonstration of restraint
it must have reflected some awful good diplomacy on the part of the u s
on the other hand if they would have had a hard time retaliating because they wouldn't have been given access to the friend or foe codes
through two enemies
you don't think they got the codes from the u s already
of course public statements can be taken for
what do y-
what about this situation with the continual harassment by iraq right now and apparently failing to let the arms inspectors have free access
i pretty much question what the u s motives were in actually the original involvement
the cynical side of me says that it was more for the domestic political situation than for anything else
and for portraying bush is a strong president
my gut feeling is that he pretty much picked the fight with hussein
i'm not saying at all that hussein wasn't quite willing to enter that fight
i think that we chose to have our official feelings hurt
do you think that we should ignore it and just allowed him to go ahead and
move on into kuwait and see what happens
i think that in the past we've allowed lots of things like that to happen
i really don't think that
i think it was there were a lot more demographic related interests involved than true foreign policy interests
may have been
i'm not saying that that's not the case
along this line since it really didn't accomplish very much except we're getting the iraqis out of kuwait
i don't foresee bush making the decision to invest a lot of manpower and money and in fighting a second battle
over what probably won't accomplish much for him politically
it doesn't look like we're getting ready to do much more in there
what about
do you have any views on israel's relation to the u s
think we ought to
what do yo-
i have very fixed feelings about israel
i think that for a long while we've had almost a ha- t-
we're supposed to talk about recycling what your personal opinion is on it
this is really for a speech research project they're doing
i don't know
they just kicked it off down here in sarasota county
they did
which makes up a pretty small portion of the county actually
they've got these i don't know what if you're familiar with sarasota county at all
they've got these
it's county wide program now
what they've done is they've broken everything down into garbage yard trash
plastic cans and glass
and then paper
which in the paper it's just newspaper and corrugated cardboard
no slicks
that's good
in terms of you got to put everything in its own little bag and really presort it really tightly
when i lived in orlando it's like you could put almost anything in there they'd just sort it out for you
i talked to this girl
she's an acquaintance of mine
she's involved with
it's the other big vitamin company shaklee
she's just shaklee crazy because it's her business and everything
she asked me a couple of questions
None
that's what recycling at home sorting does
it's a little extra work
it can actually turn out to be a lot of extra work because
you set it out by the curb
you can have bundles up to a certain weight and certain dimensions tie them up and put them by the curb
the plastic cans and glass they give you this little tub
it's about a foot and a half deep
it's about one by one and a half foot wide and long
they have another one the same size
you would have to rinse out your pop cans
if you've got food containers or anything like that it's a big problem
it is a big hassle
not only do you yeah
up here they give you one of those containers
you put everything in it
it's like if you use a lot of stuff you
it's like if you're a partying kind of guy and you drink a couple of twelve packs maybe over the weekend it's going to be hard pressed to put all your recyclables in that one place
it's kind of a pain in the butt
i don't know
that's definitely one thing they could do to make it easier is to just
you have those garbage people that make twenty thirty bucks an hour
and maybe come up with a better system
if you want to have a nice garbage can
it's on wheels
it's big
you can actually rent those
yeah up here the city provides them
i think in the city they do
out here in the county you have to rent them
they just add it on to your water bill or something
where exactly are you in terms of sarasota
sarasota is on the west coast
south of tampa right
about an hour south of tampa
i listen to this talk radio station down here
it's really
those guys they just kind of get into stewing up trouble
they get into some really good conversations sometimes
some of it sometimes it's serious
they have some good feedback and all that stuff
from listening to that i kind of got an idea that i thought would be good with
this kind of fits into the aid program
it's like
what things do you consider an invasion of privacy
i don't know
i don't know
i was thinking of
i started to think about all the big data bases they have with all the information about you on them like the credit reports and all those demographics studies that they do that
i don't know what they actually have in there
i know they sell those
what about required drug testing as a condition of employment
that was the other one i was thinking of
i think that's
i know drugs
i have worked at texas instruments
they instituted a drug testing policy where they randomly would test employees to tell you the truth i really did not think much about it
i hadn't
there were some things that people brought up like what happens if they get a false positive what recourse do you have
yet a lot of these large corporations such as texas instruments although they don't admit to it a drug testing policy comes about as a result of government pressure
although they don't actually execute it themselves it's really the government that
in that sense at least philosophically it's really borderline legal
if they're on some kind of controlled substance then it kinds of takes away from the job of the supervisor or manager type person who is able to evaluate them
what about this aids epidemic now
where you find that certain people actually are criminal in their disregard for others
of course the ultimate solution is to operate on their brain so that it doesn't
it destroys their libido
if they ever
i've heard of things like marking them somehow or something like that or putting them all someplace like in a kind of
what about that as an invasion of privacy
i guess it kind of borders on what do you value more the invasion of the person's privacy or the possible danger to other people
it gets to balancing personal freedom against the general welfare of society
i guess that's been the big role of government i guess
it's supposed to have been
that's kind of a difficult one to go into
i mean that particular case
there's a lot of people that they could require
not a huge part a the aids population i guess that have it that don't know they do are spreading it
again to require such a test and then to make it is to subject them to discriminatory practices and other things
i don't know how exactly i feel about that
i guess it's an easy one for me
i think there's something seriously wrong
what is it that you are particularly upset about
i think they've lost their compass
i'm not sure they know exactly what public education supposed to be for anymore
i voted with my feet
my kids go to parochial school
what do you feel that your kids are getting in the parochial schools that they wouldn't get in the public school system
one hundred percent of the customers care
they take an relatively active part
if you're sending two thousand dollars that way every year you watch what goes on and you pay attention and participate
you can influence the way things are
you're saying that the taxpayer who also is really paying through the pocketbook for the education of the child may not be quite so conscious of the fact that they are paying the tuition for that child in the form of real estate or other taxes
consequently they're not so motivated to get involved and make sure things happen the way they'd like to see them happen
i also think that one of the problems
i think this is a cultural problem
the problem with public education is really a problem with the culture
i guess my evidence for that is the school districts in places like california for example where only a minority of the taxpayers have children in school
you can't get a tax levy passed
people are reluctant to pass school tax levies even when the money is needed or would be well spent because they don't have kids in the schools
i think that's a loss of civic virtue and a loss of the cultural attitude that we used to have that education was first even if it wasn't our kids
i think that's the principal problem is that people no longer see it as their problem
there's an immediate problem
it troubles me too that the priority seems to be with my particular purse strings rather than the public good
by definition
it means that you've got to be informed
you've got to have a certain level of education to do the reading and the critical thinking involved to come up with a decision
i believe that the original idea of public education in the united states which i guess was controversial at the time of the constitution
it barely made it
i think the principal was education for civic participation
you couldn't pull the wool over their eyes
you'd think we'd notice it economic thrust
that's exactly what i was going to say
one is education for civilization
i think that one
i quit and got disabused of that notion
the only thing people seem to agree on is that education is an economic enterprise to train people for jobs
i'm not sure that people in the education establishment really know what their purpose is
i'm really sad to say this
i really think that the educational establishment has become part of the problem
that's why i guess i'm sort of reluctantly in favor of these choice programs
i agree with everything that you've said so far
the only that i'd want to add is that i'm a little more in contact i think with public school teachers than perhaps you are except as a parent of your child
the sense that i get from public school teachers that i know is that they are very conscious of what they feel they should be doing
they are the three things that you mentioned
they find that they are also being asked to do a bunch of other stuff which they think is only tangentially related like consumer
you laugh
twenty-seven up
we had five
how about yourself
i'm sure there's a lot of differences in the way it's done now and then
when mine were growing up i did some traveling but not that extensively
i always just made it a point to spend about ten minutes with each one of them
it was an hour
whether it was going back and laying in bed with them and just shooting the breeze or whatever telling them stories or reading to them
they were all real close
qualify that
that's
both my husband and i work
sometimes i feel like by the time i pick them up and get them home and get them fed i have very little time each evening
that's plenty though
he spends a lot of time with them while i'm cooking
i spend time with them while he's doing other stuff
of course we try to spend a lot of time on the weekend
there's a lot of times my house may not be as clean as i particularly like it
it's neat
i can live with it because i do stuff with my kids
with kids you're not going to have a neat house
i've accepted that too
especially with both of them working
you just have to set the time and say okay this is going to be it
that's true
we do a lot of that on the weekends
if my husband golfs he'll do it during nap time things like that where they're not really missing the presence
we do a lot of family things together
we're kind of going the other direction this weekend
that's good too
i decided that you need that once in awhile that you you need to plan the quality time
i do think that if you plan it and spend that and make it quality time you don't have to be there twenty-four hours a day
they say all it takes is about five ten minutes a day
as the kids got older i made them help me cut the grass and kind of made that a project too
they think that's a family activity
yeah
another thing we used to do is have family councils
what would you do
we'd take turns being president
everyone would get one vote
i always thought we'd get outvoted five to two it never worked that way
they would just pick whatever issue kind of was at a head that week
we could bring up stuff too
that was always good time
we really got to know the kids well
i imagine you still have a very close relationship with them
in fact they were all in over the weekend for easter
that's wonderful
i was raised in that type of family where you don't disobey me you mind me
if you have a problem with what we did or how we did it you can always come back and talk to me about it
we did too
i remember the one daughter saying we had a friend of hers that used to drive us up a tree she said i don't make
why make fun of mine
kind of hit us between the eyes
that was always good quality time for us
never attend
if they missed it they had to abide by the rules
whatever was voted on
boy they'd show up
i think that's great
we'd usually take notes the younger kids or maybe all of them needed help at one time or another
they were usually tougher on themselves than they were on us
they loved it
i think that's true
i can remember times my parents would say what do you think would be a fair punishment
we would always come up with something that was harder than what they would have done
i do think it's right that they're harder on themselves
boy i feel for you and your husband
why is that
two of my
i don't see any problem with testing for random drugs
i myself almost am in favor of it
i work at honeywell
i don't know i went through a standard drug testing thing before i was brought on
i think it's important to insure the quality and i don't know almost the goodness of character that kind of thing
i'm a graduate student right now at carnegie mellon
i just came from saint paul
interviewing with three m
they have a policy for testing
if they make you an offer then they'll test you right before you start
i guess the only
that definitely happens
the drug tests sure they're accurate
there's always that margin of error
that's something to be aware of
another thing is a lot of times they aren't that accurate
if you're on a prescription drug of some kind what are they going to do about that
i was on a couple of different prescription drugs when i was tested for honeywell
i know they didn't catch that or else they would have said something
i'm sure they screen for just a particular few types
although the literature they give with you says we do this
they list about five thousand drugs they try to test for
i don't know
what program are you in over at carnegie mellon
electrical engineering
this is actually a
even for interns they do the whole random drug or the whole drug testing thing
they test you before you start or before you even interview
they essentially
they essentially made me the offer and then did the drug testing thing after that
it was one of those things where you go through the general battery of all their tests
they essentially give you the offer at that point they'll ask you to go to a drug testing and things like that
there's some noise on this end
you probably wondered
what happens if you were to fail
then do they give you one more chance or two more chances
i believe from what i remember of the literature they gave if you fail i believe they give you one more chance
once again those things are not that accurate
there's undoubtedly a proportion of people who do fail
wha-
i'm just about to finish my master's in may and just interviewing with companies right now
that was the first time i'd ever gotten any kind of drug screening was going to honeywell
he's doing an internship with i b m
they basically did the same exact thing
we both got our internships at the same time
we both had to go through drug testing
one of those things where we went through a kind of an identical process
do they test you right now at work too
that's one thing they don't do is drug testing while you're on the job
i think the unwritten rule is expect it
they don't do it
that's good i guess
i have gone to a couple of parties since that time
while i don't do any drugs myself i've seen some people who work there smoking a joint or whatever
that's the kind of thing that would definitely come up
they don't really do that
first i need to know how do you feel about sending an elderly family member to a nursing home
of course it's one of the last few things in the world you'd ever want to do unless it's just really and for their own good
i'd be very very careful checking them out
she had a rather massive stroke about eight months ago i guess
i was fortunate in that
i was personally acquainted with the people who ran the nursing home in our little hometown
i was very comfortable in doing it when it got to the point that we had to do it
i had an occasion for my mother-in-law who had fell and could not take care of herself anymore was confined to a nursing home for a while
it had to be done in a hurry
we didn't have six months to check all of these places out
it was really not very good deal
she was able to return to her apartment again
it's really a big
decision when to do it
is there something else we could have done in checking out all the places that might be available
of course there's not one on every corner
especially smaller areas
probably the hardest thing in my family my grandmother she had to be put in a nursing home
she had used the walker for quite some time probably about six to nine months
she had a fall
finally she had parkinson's disease
it got so much that she could not take care of her house
that was even harder actually
it was just a change of location
it was very disturbing for her because she had been so used to traveling
she had children all across the united states she spent nine months out of the year just visiting her children
that was pretty heart-rending for her
i think when she finally came to the realization that no i cannot take care of myself
for somebody who for most of their life has not just merely had a farm but had ten children had a farm ran everything because her husband was away in the coal mines
facing that situation it's quite a dilemma
my mother
my
i think that they had a great deal of
they actually had a conference
it was probably one of the most strengthening things for our family getting down together and doing that
just the children were involved in the decision because it involved just them
making that decision and then finding a place
everybody had duties to perform
whether it was just giving money or whether it was actually taking part in a lot
of the decision making
they had seen it coming
it
i truly wish that if something like that were to happen that my children would do something like
unfortunately a lot of times responsibilities like that seem to fall to maybe one child in the whole family
we
it's usually not a very smooth thing
i was lucky too that i only have one brother
fortunately we agreed on exactly what we thought should be done
my mother also was very independent
she still had her own little house and still driving her own car
we were lucky in one respect in that after she had her stroke she wasn't really much aware of what was going on
that nursing home life would not have been anything of her choosing
of course she would not have been happy there at all
as it turned out the stroke took care of that concern for us
with my grandmother i think it was such that she did not have the problem with
her daughter came and visited her at least her daughter
i think that when she passed away it was probably one of the greatest
she was truly aware
i don't know how i would deal if one of my parents came with alzheimer's
that which is far more devastating
i think that what one thing that they were concerned probably was the fact it wasn't necessarily like the quantity of care but the quality of
that the people that worked there were very interested that to make it as close a home environment
i think for myself i see that as probably the what everything would hinge upon
that's probably the major question
i think that great strides are being made nowadays in caring for the elderly in a whole lot of areas
it's interesting that the population of the united states is changing because now that so many more minorities where they have had extended families for such a long time
matter of fact in the united states we used to have extended families
i guess as we become more industrialized and more less in a rural situation we choose not to deal with the
things are scattered so much nowadays
i think that perhaps the extended family that it maybe one of the solutions to a lot of things even child care
of course there comes other issues whether or not any of the grandparents
they raised us after all
i think that i've had a lot of good experiences with many people especially where they've had extended family
i kind of see that perhaps we may need to get close to the family environment and get down to the values of
it's
with what's going on today
i think that that may be perhaps if we put money on the back burner that may choose to alleviate a lot of the problem
we may not have as high a standard of living but actually have a truer standard of living
i guess that was it
the first thing for me is i see a couple of different ways of talking about what privacy is if an invasion of privacy is something that disturbs your private state
if privacy is something that comes into your private state and extracts information from it in other words finds something out about you that's another
the first type of privacy seemed invaded to me and very much everyday in this country
in the second time at least overtly where someone comes in and finds out information about you that should be private does not seem obviously everyday
i think i agree with that
i think in a good example on the typical thing that happens when the phone rang
it's t i calling
i realize this is something i solicited
my immediate reaction was one of that sense of invasion
after that i realized i really wanted this
it was sort of exciting
that was almost an example of an invasion that turns out to be not invasive
it turned out to be an invitation
at the same time i think that i receive on the order of probably seven or eight a week calls of the nature where one wishes that there were a convenient way to just hang up on it
from personal parties or from these phone
solicitations primarily
that's a remarkable number
i'm still astounded that one they let anyone do them and two that they have any effect in this whatsoever
i'm usually so insulted by them i just hang up as soon as i recognize what
i think they prey on people's inherent politeness on the phone even with the machine
they feel an obligation to respond even though there's not even a person there
i think that's what makes one feel invaded is the fact that there seems to be little control
one's feeling obligated
because of some sense of the way the ritual is played out
that then ends up being the most common example for me
i guess i'm not typically feeling invaded in my privacy relative to this one that you raised
i don't think i would have thought about that
i don't typically feel intruded on the things the sense of finding out information
presumably those who find out such information if they are doing it i would prefer to not to be known
the classic i don't know c i a conspiracy theories or whatever would have such parties trying to do it without your knowledge
i can't talk about the second one other than to generate paranoia
to surmise it is there
i don't think i'd like the k g b monitoring my phone or anything like that
i guess although that's a good point where you said that how does one define what invasion of privacy is
because if that's the case of a tree falling in the forest
i'm not feeling invaded then maybe my privacy hasn't been because i have no sense of my privacy state having been invaded
if your defining it in terms of information gone even if it's something you don't know about it then i guess one could assume one was invaded
i don't feel invaded by it
i guess it comes from a sense of fact or facts
if someone finds out something about me that is true i don't have a sense of loss from that
you must have a relatively clean conscience then
more harmed or something
that would be an example where my sense of threat would be high because i would find that there be a good possibly that their facts were fantasy
i would feel not only invaded in the sense that someone had obtained information that i would rather they didn't
that might be the sense of the spending pattern for instance
that i would have thought to be private
if it turns out to generate incorrect things that's even worse
if my call rate of eight or so a week went up even higher because
someone had
the person who had takes unsolicited phones calls and pays money
all of
one of the problems with the lotus data base was that it was uncontrolled access to who would have that information
they said they would give it out to only select companies
just like software is only given out to customers
you can't believe that
they wouldn't bother to check that carefully anyway to someone who's offering full cash price
you can't tell it what a company really has to do with it
there's something rather ominous about having virtually anyone any hacker being able to know what your income is what your spending habits are
that hacker just has to get in touch with the sneak thief
suddenly what started as an invasion of privacy can be an invasion of your actual home
i guess that turns out to be the basic problem with any invasion of privacy is whether or not you're feeling
threatened as a result of it
maybe that is a little bit of what privacy is
i also thought about it waiting to talk to you that another thing that occurred to me is there is not so much invasion of my privacy because i know how to behave such that there isn't
i realized i have to behave in a certain way in order to not have people invade my privacy
i realize that i can take that for granted
i used to live in india
things are quite different there in terms of that
that's interesting
no concept for wanting to be private
it's generally being alone is not a very desirable state at least officially
there's not
doors don't have latches on them
people walk in out
as a westerner in india i was often surprised
that would be culturally shocking
it very much is
on the other hand i realized i could go out on the street and act like a complete lunatic
people would leave
whereas in this country where everyone respects the closed doors very much if you go out and then act like the lunatic you violate the norms of public behavior
people start paying attention to you very much
they start asking questions and in the sense are invading your privacy although if you know what the social norms are quote unquote you asked for it
it does mean that you have yet another reason to follow a set of social norms
which isn't always the case in all cultures
it wasn't until i was thinking about it just now that i realized that's actually something that's culturally relative
that is true
that it's fascinating to think a lot of someone who doesn't know how to say private
that's really
i wonder how people have sex
None
the results of sex are quite obvious
i just don't quite
anyone can be alone for some period of time
for me a lot of what i do requires a sense that there's this invisible barrier around me which people will respect
if that's gone i really don't know how to live very well
i really do wonder how people do that
are there any other specific things where you feel your privacy to be invaded on a day-to-day basis or either on a growing frequency
all the other classic examples the jehovah's witness or mormons or someone knocking at the front door which is more intrusive because i have to really tell someone to go away
there's that sense of i have now opened my door they now see what i look like what i live like
they're doing something that normally i really only invite
i anyone i give my number to is welcome to call me
no one is just welcome to come by my house
that is more of a sense of invasion
that's another example of the invasion because of the not so
have you all been able to do much as a full family these days all of you
we've gone all kinds of places
None
we do everything we can possibly as a family
then my husband enjoys spending time with the kids
he'll take them out just to be with them
they can have time with him
you have a break too
we try to teach our kids as much as we can at home we try to spend monday nights we call it family home evening
and have little lessons with them and just see how things are going in our family and teach them about their grandparents or something like that bring out pictures of them so they get to know them
we just do all kinds of fun things like that
the only way they know their grandparents is by pictures
phone calls that's
we go to the park
we go in the backyard and sit down
that's what we mostly do pretty simple things
she's really getting to the age where she's playing
with me being at home and just having the one income you don't have this lot of extra money to do a lot of extra things
you make more fun than
the kids just think it's wonderful just maybe to go get an ice cream cone or
that's a big thrill for them
or go get a bag of m and m's or something like that
they think that's a lot of fun
we try to spend as much time as we can
we
our whole weekends are devoted to our children except for we might go out one evening or something
during the day it's all devoted to our kids
they come go to church with us
have you ever been to the science it's called the science place
we haven't lived here too long
we went there a couple of weeks ago
i'm not sure which one we went into
the one we went in had
the thing that sticks out most in my mind is a kids place area
they really seemed to go wild in there
there's some petting like
i think it's owens country farms has a free petting like a farm that you can go to
the kids can pet animals and stuff
it's like in richardson you go up plano road
it's a little bit past campbell and plano road
that's a lot of fun
the kids think that was a lot of fun too
that does sound like fun
whenever we take them to showbiz
they think it's wonderful just to go to mcdonalds
they go for to play around
it's a indoor fun park
it has a bunch of different rides for kids
parents get in free
it's during the week
it's five dollars admission per child all day
you said about plano and campbell is the petting
the one in mesquite is scyene exit
it's
you just pay that admission
all the rides are free
of course they have all the little video games and those little quarter rides and stuff like that
i think that was better than showbiz pizza cause there's more for them to do
they can just do
they had a lot of fun
i've gotten some good ideas from you
we try to do a lot of things as a family and inexpensively as possible
i think i don't know if we've done five minutes
i'm sure that will be good
it was good talking to you
no problem
take care
with credit cards i try to get maybe just one or two
i don't like having credit cards for every store
i just don't like them
i don't know if i'm really afraid of spending too much
i just don't think that i need them
they are tempting at times
sometimes i just don't like everybody knowing everything about me
that's can be very very true
everybody just gives you a credit card just so you'll spend money
that's the idea
they make money off of it whether you use it or not
the other thing of course is the fact that they hope
i use mine a great deal for groceries for everything that i can and
you have
four and two and half
boy those are two very active ages
i'm like you
i only use my credit card for when i
i don't charge anything that i can't payoff at the end of the month
do you ever use the a t m machines
i take the checkbook
if i need cash i just tell him
he gets it out
i don't even think i know my number
he couldn't do without it but since he can just do it right there at work
that helps
the other thing some people are not aware of is they will use their credit card like their visa or their mastercard for cash when they do that they begin paying interest right from that very day on
that's kind of silly
they figure that that's correct
during that whole month and
i get at least one or two a week
people sending me a credit card or calling me on the phone i just say i don't want it
i think that's the only thing you can do is just say no and mean no and
i'd like to know where they determine that i'm such a good credit risk that they can go and say you get this much credit line
it's interesting that
people have generally the same view
some people they get so wrapped up in them that one day they find wow i didn't realize i'd spent this much money
they can't meet the minimum monthly payments on it
some people use one credit card to pay for another credit card they own
that does nothing but exacerbate the entire problem
it does because you're just costing yourself more money because if you can't make the monthly minimum payment you're paying interest
it's been enjoyable talking with you
it's enjoyable seeing that somebody feels the same way
take good care
you too
you found that out tonight
there are some others out there that i don't believe deserve the money they're getting
isn't it funny how baseball's getting less than football players would
they play a lot longer season too
a lot more games right
i think let's see
i know yankees have won a lot games
we had made a list of all these baseball teams and the cities that they were from
i don't even know where i even put that paper
the oakland a's and i don't think it was an all california baseball
that's what i did when i was growing up
i think the rangers need to go
i think the pirates will go
let's see
every once in a while i like to go on the nights when there's not very many people out there
sometimes if you go out there during the day you just fry under the sun
do you know anything about that new stadium
that huge
it's going to have little shopping centers in it and like a lake or something running through it
they're going to try to make it a real community center out there
your going to be able to buy your
what was wait about the liquor
that's in texas stadium where the football players
they're never going to let liquor in there
they're trying
they try every year
every year they get thrown out
don't allow them to sell it there
that new stadium's going to be real nice
i heard that you can bid on that stadium
last night on the news i heard that they said you could bid on the stadium to have it named after you
it's going to go to the highest bidder
that could be your fifteen minutes of fame
where are you
you are
my husband teaches in plano
what's he teach
what do you do
i teach for dallas
you do
it's good because they try new things
it's like they'll try something
they throw it out and get something else
you get tired of that
i think it's going to be any where you go
they can't be though
the politics gets worse in the small towns sometimes
in dallas you don't even know who's in administration
you don't even know who to payoff
you don't know what they're there for when they're coming how long they're going to be
how funny
it's just there they are
they're writing the whole time
i finally just got to where i go okay i'm debbie moore may i ask who you are and what you are in my classroom for
you never know where they are going what they'll report
you hope they're telling you
you never see it
it is
how long you taught in dallas schools
this is my eleventh year
that's about ten too many
all i do is teach reading all day long
it's just ten children at a time
that's not bad
you've got a lot of federal money too
hasn't it changed a lot over the years
working in the system
i said i want to see a curriculum guide
i'll know what i'm suppose to teach
they go we don't have one
i go okay you just did
you don't know which is worse
how long are we suppose to talk for
you can talk for ten minutes
you don't have to
you can
if you talk to ten then they come on and say you've extended your limit
please say good-bye within the next five seconds
i haven't ever talked that long
i hadn't either till last night i was talking to this retired administrator from cleveland ohio
we started talking about gangs
she was real interesting
tonight this woman called
yours is my second one
hers was the first one i gotten
she was telling me all her problems
it went over ten minutes
did you all not talk about the topic at all
the topic was boring i thought
what would you serve if you were having a dinner party
gosh all the other
it was about movies what have you seen at the movies lately and stuff like that
that was real good to talk about that
have you seen silence of the lambs
the last one i saw was dances with the wolves
he said he didn't think it should have gotten all those awards he thought it was too long
i enjoyed it
it was just more for my money
he said after about the first hour he started looking at his watch
how old are your kids
one is eleven
it's not too cool for kids
they've got it all figured out
and ninja turtles
most of the time really we watch them on the video
heck that's a lot cheaper then
especially if you get them for a couple of nights you don't have to watch them all in one time
they're cheap
nobody has got them yet
we saw heroes have always been cowboys tonight
i felt like it kind of got chopped off at the end
it
one of those movies it's not going to be around long
i do that to make myself go to sleep at night
my mom and dad read all the time
i was reading the book
it's called shoeless joe
i decided i like this author
i got a book of his short stories
that's been real good
who is the author
don't ask me
quite a bit
in the movie the guy was black
i never even heard that there was a book tied in with that movie
do you think we covered baseball
have a good night
who's your favorite team
the dallas cowgirls
None
i think once jimmy johnson gets his system established they'll do all right
as long as troy aikman doesn't get hurt again
i don't even know who your favorite team is
they haven't been doing too hot
in fact the cowboys got the best end of that deal
he was a good player i guess
i don't know
he'd get past six or seven tackles and just keep spinning around and get on into the end zone
i guess you never could really see him play because with the cowboys while he was with the team the rest of the team was pretty poor
you couldn't really tell if it was just him or the team
i always just assumed that he was too good for the rest of the team
i don't know
who's the running
is it emmett smith
did he actually play in the pro bowl
i remember he was a backup
somebody got injured
he was supposed to go
i haven't been keeping up with football in the fall
i can go on and on about football
since it's kind of off season it's kind of hard to think back about all that
who else is
there's mike
he was trying to keep
i have no idea
i don't know
did they make it to the play-offs at all
they started out really bad
they went one and six
they won five or six in a row
they were in a shot to make the play-offs
they screwed up the last couple of games
kind of like the cowboys
the cardinals were kind of like the cowb-
the cowboys came on strong at the end of the season
the cardinals got killed by the cowboys
the cardinals i don't know
i think the cowboys probably have a better team
at the end of the season the kind of got messed up with aikman getting hurt because laufenberg just couldn't ever really get it together at all
don't made any excuses for him
i'm just saying i shouldn't blast him like that say laufenberg got out there and blew it for them
he didn't get to see much action but too bad
now he had a shot and didn't look too good
no one's going to have much faith in him any more
i haven't kept up with it lately
i remember reading something a few months ago about them signing somebody else on or trying to go after somebody or trade for somebody
it wasn't anybody i'd really heard of
i heard on the radio this morning or yesterday morning that aikman's back in practicing doing real real well
who is it michael irvin he said that aikman was hitting him right on the numbers every time
sounds like he's going to be all right for next season
they're just trying not to overwork him right now until he gets his shoulder back in shap-
i think it was his shoulder he had surgery on
anyway they're trying to keep him from reinjuring anything but anyway
i got my thirty day notice yesterday
i'm done where i work
anyway i guess we can't talk much more about that
i just thought i'd throw that in there
maybe i'll call you back after the recording is finished
i think we have talked about football for five minutes
i guess we should talk about football a little bit longer just to be sure we got five minutes in
other than the vikings who do you like
when i was younger i was a cardinal fan too
of course
other than that when you grow up in a city that has one of the greatest football teams until the last few years you kind of tend to get caught up in it
the cowboys were america's football team
it was really exciting
growing up when the cowboys were really big
my parents would always have season tickets
they'd go to all the games
the hype were just unbelievable
it's just the last
i'm just used to always growing up and hearing cowboys cowboys cowboys and super bowl and all this other stuff
i can't
i think they'll pull out of it
they'll wind up being good again
they've got lot of really good young players that are going to do pretty good i think
they're banking on doing good next season
they sectioned it out even more
they used to just have
they sectioned it out to end zone and then everything else
now they're sectioning it off from one twenty yard line to the other one
the next highest price is that same area but above it on the upper level
from the twenty to the ten yard line
they're some sections kind of in the corner areas
the cheapest of course is going to be the direct end zones
they have about four or five different prices now
obviously they're all going up more or less is what it's going to do
now the tickets even got lower than the lowest one last year
i'm not sure
i didn't really think about that
not that i'll ever go
last time i went to the cowboys game was during that n f l strike or when they had the scab teams in there
it was the dallas and washington redskins game
i went because my dad can usually get a hold of some free tickets because a lot of those doctors have season tickets
if they're not going to use them they'll give them to somebody else
i went with my dad to a game that one time
that wasn't a real
it was the scab teams
it was kind of different i guess
before that it's been quite a few years
i just never have gotten around to it
maybe this year
what do you do this weekend
pretty much spent most of my time either in the yard or at nurseries buying stuff for the yard
which is
what do you have planned for your yard
we just bought our house last july
None
there's an established lawn and whatnot flower beds things like that
they've gone a few years of neglect
we're in the process of revitalizing the whole situation
we've got different flower beds in front and a built in window box trying to get some color back in those get the trees trimmed up get rid of a few weed problems and things like that
i live in dallas
we're going to be getting some wheel h-
the place we've been living at we're just leasing it
in plano the soil has such a high clay content
that i went to use my dad-in-law's tiller and it about for my arms off
just scratching two or three inches was just a chore
it was
when it gets wet you don't even want to get out in the yard
i don't know
where you live is there a real high alkaline or ash content
it's done
it's in the north end of oak cliff in kessler park area
we've got about
we've got maybe eight to eight inches to a foot of soil
it's solid rock from then on down
it's a little aggravating
we can't put in anything too big as far as shrubs and things like that because they've got to get a chance to find the cracks in the rock
is it limestone underneath
it's solid limestone
we're just happy that there's trees already there so far
anything like that is a major undertaking i guess
sprinkler systems or anything start to get real expensive because there's an awful lot of work that has to be done chopping through the rock
it
it makes for a different challenge
i moved to dallas about five years ago
i never really messed with anything gardening or anything like that until now
i keep hearing all the stories of different parts of town
in fact we were at the farmers market yesterday and bought a few tomato plants and things like that
the first thing the old guy there at the stand asked is what part of town we lived in because he said i've got a dozen different varieties
each one works in one part of town
that's it
we tried planting tomatoes last year
they turned out pretty poor
i just wish i'd known
it's amazing we also have roses
they just grow so beautifully
in fact we put in some more roses yesterday
what type roses
a few different hybrid tea type varieties
hybrid teas
we have a few of the real short stem
they're kind of like the bush roses
i don't know i think it only has about five or six more years to go because it's a really old bush
i'm amazed because the sun is so intense
the roses just seem to survive just fine there
that's what we're searching
we've got all the different lake editions around the house
we're kind of experimenting right now
we've got the direct sun in front
the backyard has two great big spruce and an oak tree all about forty to fifty foot tall
the backyard is just complete dark all day long
None
have you done a lot of tree surgeon work on your trees or not
they're in pretty good condition
we've been pretty lucky on that
just if you want a lot of light for underneath
that may be all right because we have some old fruit trees
we may just be getting rid of that
our peaches they seem to be doing just fine
they really need pruning
it just seems like that even pruning once a year is really not enough
the way they behave
what kind of grass are you growing
it's bermuda
i've been trying a mixture of the bermuda and the rye
i may be working like a fescue in because of the type of weather
it seems that bermuda's fine
it looks like it would hold the soil
it really doesn't
a lot of silt that comes in it just doesn't seem to hold it very well
the rye does really well especially during the wintertime
once it gets over seventy seventy-five degrees it just dries up
there's such a difference
through the year
my parents-in-law they're building a house into the side of a hill
it's already been built and everything
this is out in west texas
the wind there has been so bad that they've tried to plant grass
they just
they just washing watching their lawn just blow away
it's quite an undertaking
on the side of a hill
you can see the house from miles away
it's a pretty neat little job
they save a lot of energy
but just for them they're going to have to start gardening
they said we just plan on spending the rest of our lives just
all they have are mesquite and cottonwoods
it's all on lake greenbelt
i don't know what they have
they can pump water
they have to get permission
they can pump water up from the shore
that's for an additional
they have to pay some kind of fee per year
right now though i think they're trying to get the trees planted and everything
i just think of all of the money that they're going to have to spend just getting that
the taxes alone there lake greenbelt
some places they really nail them for tax
your talking what just several hundred dollars a year in property taxes
it's ridiculous
it would
even though it's far out there it's just that lake greenbelt they try to do it just from selling the water
the water usage they try to limit even though there's three or four streams that flow into it people still use it enough in towns like clarendon and other areas where they irrigate
the irrigation because it's gotten so bad the past few years
i don't know
just the air is so dry
my father-in-law says the mesquite trees are they're pretty smart
they don't even start growing until may or april after it's been raining for a few months
that's all they work on
that's something i've been looking around and noticed all the flowering trees and stuff are
we're trying to decide what to put on one side of the house and things like that
there's so many things that they last for just a couple of weeks
then it's just a bush there from then on
it's kind of disappointing
i don't know
my wife and i on the south side of our house we planted some gardenias
they did real fine during the summertime
during the fall when it stopped when the rain let off just a little bit it just dried up
i guess these plants they don't
how do you feel about the immigration laws
currently i think they are a little restrictive particularly for certain ethnic groups or from certain countries
i think we should permit more immigration from eastern europe for example particularly
i think we could permit more of them in than we have permitted in the last several years
i think we have too much restriction on the orientals also
of course that's just my opinion
we seem to favor certain countries particularly south american countries
i have nothing of course against the south americans or hispanics in that sense
i think we are more restrictive of the so called eastern european countries than we should be
i'm not real sure why i got this topic because i don't think i checked it off on the list oh
i think the embargo we placed on the russian jews although we spent years and years lobbying for their release and their ability to immigrate from russia as soon as that occurred we
i still think
again kind of having within this century come from an immigrant family or immigrant families on both sides
i'm a little touchy
my family is from europe from england and ireland and have been in this country for more than a hundred and fifty years almost two hundred years
i don't have any relatives several generations back that i am familiar with their names and how they fit into the family
they were all born here i don't have any real strong ties with the immigration laws
i don't have any personal feelings about them
i haven't taken the time or effort to learn what they are
i think in a way though i also have an
again that was
my grandparents came over during the time when there were quotas
they had to wait in certain parts of europe for years before they were permitted to come over
None
i agree with that
i think if immigration was entirely unrestricted not only would the united states become more over populated awfully quickly i think it would bring in a lot of people that are run out of other countries or in trouble in other countries
i think they'd come here trying to find a new market for their brand of crime
there's another aspect of this too
they're also diminishing the health restrictions which
i was not aware of that
there were some regulations over
i don't know whether they're laws passed or whatever they're called just recently where people with certain diseases cannot be excluded from immigration
recently tuberculosis which at one time if you had tuberculosis you could not get into this country they dropped that also
i think in some ways we are becoming a little too egalitarian in that sense
i think we should be a little more circumspect about it
i've enjoyed talking to you
i have talked long enough
as a matter of fact before we started this conversation i was working on my p c at home
i work with one at work continually
i do not have one of my own at home
we have an
it's a t i computer
it is the i b m clone
everything is in i b m mode
that's what we have
i really do
i am an accountant
i work at home
you're on it a lot
i use it for that quite often
we have used some of it for some personal things
i do a lot of that work on it as well
she works out of her home also
the software that does the taxes is just incredible
it is
she just
i expected to go and drop the stuff off and go back two weeks later
she had it done and out in twenty minutes on her little p c
i have often thought that having one at home would be neat
i just don't know if we would really use it that much
we didn't decide to get one until i started working at home
then we thought we can use it for some personal things
for us it really took a business application to justify the expense of it
i know my stepfather bought my mother a little personal computer i guess probably three years ago for christmas
it's got some stuff on it
it's got a nice little word processing software on it and some budgeting type things and stuff
i don't think she's ever touched it
it just seems like a lot of trouble for something at home
she always seems to have better things to do than to try to sit down and figure out how to use her computer
now i know my boss has bought the software that his checkbook is on a disk
he goes in and types his checks on the screen and then hits print
they print out on the checks
my gosh
he's ordered envelopes with the windows in the right places
he just whips out
he paid his monthly bills
he just wrote all the checks on the screen and hit print
it printed out ten checks
he just
he just ripped them off
they go through just a continuous thing on the printer he ripped them off and stuck them in the envelopes
there they went
he said i can balance my checkbook in seconds because it's all in the computer
there's not going to be those adding mistakes that we all make
he said used to be i always sat looking for those
it does it for you
this
there are definitely some advantages to it
it's just a matter of like you say does it justify the cost if you're using it strictly for personal business
i think in most cases i'd have to say no
we have some education programs that he likes
a little sesame street one we have another one that plays music
he really likes that one
i guess for kids as they get older
especially now when they get to junior high school and even college
my sister went to college started about three years ago
she had to have a computer
it was like a necessity
i'm going through right now
i'm going part time in the evenings
i do
they require it
you have to type it
i'm up here nights and weekends working on the p c up here typing stuff
i can see where it would be a great advantage to have one at home if you were going to school
any more i don't even know if a college kid would have a typewriter
they probably used to have it
i just finished a major research paper a couple of weeks ago
i couldn't imagine not having that thing on a disk where i could go back in and move stuff around and change it
i don't know what they used to do
in our family my husband and i went through college together
he went on and got his master's degree while i was working
i'm the better typist
we just had a regular old typewriter not even a correcting one back then
you had to type all of his papers
i typed his master's papers and things on a typewriter
boy to have a computer back then
cut your time in half at least
of course you have some changes to make and do the whole thing over
on a computer you take it out print it out fine
i remember when i was working in high school i was working in an office right after i got out of high school
we did everything on a typewriter everything
it's amazing
then when someone would have you type a letter they did it right
they were
they go is this really what i want to say
you typed it
that was it
now people just send it back over and over and over and over
that's probably one of the problems and frustrations that it's brought about because people do feel like we can just change it
we'll try this out and see what it looks like
use it as just a
instead of knowing what they want to say before they just play with it which in a way is nice to be able to do
it gets a little out of hand sometimes
i've seen it get out of hand up here where we've got a secretary that sits over here that's keeping metrics right now and keeping up of all the letters i type how many of them do i make changes on and on each letter what types of changes
people just change one word because they think it sounds better or whatever
she's also keeping what percentage of letters am i retyping for whatever reason
there's one week she did retypes on ninety percent of what she typed
it's ridiculous
that was the high week
it's running about seventy which is still ridiculous to have to make changes to seventy percent of everything that she types
it's good that she does that bring it to people's attention
that's exactly right
she keeps several weeks' worth of data and then in addition is keeping copies of all the changes to show look this didn't really need to be changed
this is ridiculous and changing add this time to now
that's the kind of things that she's keeping and showing that this was a big waste of time it was a waste of paper it was a waste to change something like that
anyway maybe it'll help in some way
i don't know
there definitely even with the few disadvantages like that are far better than the alternative
i have to
i would like to get one at home some day
some day i would like to get even just the video or something like that just to be able to pull in sources from outside would be wonderful
None
i do too
that sounds like such a great idea
it'd be kind of fun to be able to play with it
i know my father had a p c
when we were in high school it was always fun
we could link in
i don't even remember now what it was called
you could link in and talk to people all over the country
you have your own little code name
you'd type in du du du hi how are you du du du
they'd type back and everybody
you'd have five or six or seven people talking to each other at the same time
everything everybody said prints out on your screen as they're typing it
it was just great fun
it was very expensive because the whole time you were on there you were on long distance
we were each limited to twenty minutes a day
it added up big
my parents were divorced
the time we were visiting our father in the summer time
he felt like he could splurge and let us do it
i'm sure we would not have been allowed to do that under normal situations
when you're doing the guilty father complex because he's not there to watch us grow
it was nice to talk to you
they're not in public school yet
i get that experience starting next fall with kindergarten
you haven't really dealt with that in a sense
being one of these late in life mothers i've listened to everybody else's
complaints as to what's the matter with either their kids or the school system
i've been surprised
do you have school age kids
mine are both out of school
i've in hindsight seen some things that i wished that i had done something about that was within my power or wish that in some ways we as parents had more control over what's happening up there type thing
the teachers didn't seem to be teaching anything
of course it's a little hard to tell from the information that you get from your child
they bring things home
i was never one to believe everything my kids said
about something
still i questioned the ability of some of the teachers to really do a bang-up job
yet others i know are just wonderful
i heard a frightening thing
i didn't hear it
it was told to me or suggested to me that to work as a teacher in the public school systems in the state of texas
i think it's similar in many other states if you have a degree in a technical field you do not need a teaching certificate because there is such a shortage of people to teach math and sciences
somebody said you could go in and substitute teach at seventy-five dollars a day
there's always going to be somebody having a need for a math or science teacher
i thought they're letting me in to
this would be frightening
that's pretty interesting just because you know a subject matter doesn't mean you can teach it
even if i knew how to teach the subject matter i don't know if i'd know how to handle that kind of a group of kids
in fact i think that's one of the big problems today is the way the kids behave or act and the way they are sometimes disinterested in what's going on in the class and disruptive
this comes from the aging hippie near forty mother
i went through this period of supposedly cosmic social enlightenment
i'm in
there is a real dichotomy in terms of educational and economic background of the kids that are going to be attending this school
i used to think that's wonderful
they can get a real life experience
what i'm seeing now in terms of kindergarten preparedness just from in different preschools it's like day and night
i wonder how do they handle a child who is obviously very ready and another child who doesn't even speak english let alone know her colors
they're in the same classrooms
i guess also you're going to see the first of the crack kids starting kindergarten
i thought how do you weed those out
some of those certainly have a lot of difficulties with all sorts of things
i would imagine their learning disabilities are quite large in some cases
they've quoted statistics that my throat just about fell into my toes
i got to thinking back when i was teaching college chemistry the people that took the lower level courses i sometimes wondered are they really even educatable or trainable
my god i-
are the rest of us who went for the big bucks staying out of where maybe we should be kind of socially obligated to spend some time teaching or something with
that's an idea
you think about that
at the same time you think i hope i don't sound like a stage mother because
right now if you ask my friends t- put twenty mothers in a room and ask them how many have gifted children you're going to have twenty hands up there
you're kidding
nobody has a nongifted child
i keep thinking
it's not a kid who's precocious
you know what has the educational system been watered down to that anybody who's above average is now gifted
mine did not fall into the gifted category
don't say that
i would never had said so either
they managed to get through although not always with flying colors
in fact one of the incidents i was thinking of that my son had he was struggling with senior english
i had a meeting with the vice principal and the english instructor
she told me what she had requested
i read it
while it had a few little grammatical problems it wasn't very long and so forth
i thought it had some nice well thought out parts to it
i thought now here you have a student who is trying to pass who is struggling with your subject
you give them an f on something that doesn't seem that bad to me
you're telling them that you might as well forget it
i think that harks right back to the elementary and junior high years
i have a stepson now who's twenty-five
i was just absolutely shocked the first time that i saw his schoolwork
i remember being taught
i think you have to teach how to write an answer and how to construct a thought process
they can grasp the points
that's what's really scary to me
i would really
there's such a push among young mothers these days to make sure their child is computer literate
if they can't if they have missed that training then somebody before you're start penalizing them with bad grades for not being able to communicate what they're thinking teach them these basic skills
it's pretty sad to think about those who even today are graduating from school
they are telling that they don't know how to read
my stepson he went into the navy or air force
i don't know
i address them all as generals
i don't offend anybody
fortunately for him he wasn't dumb
he sure had trouble putting things on paper
one of the things that they did for him they tested him
they said that he's great in electronics
he really does need the basic skills
they put him through six months of composition writing in addition to all his electronic training
at that point he has now graduated from warfare electronics school with honors
this is the kid who really barely made it through high school
i keep thinking it's really not too late at any point to do some-
i kind of have always pooh-poohed military educations
i think that for this kid it's going to be his lifesaver
otherwise he might have been driving trucks or framing houses from here to eternity
i don't know
it does make me nervous
i can see why if you've got little ones just coming along
there's a whole lot of stuff going on out there
part of me says i just would like to shut my eyes and pretend it doesn't go on
the old social conscience says i'm not working i don't need to work
maybe i should volunteer to teach what i know
maybe adult literacy maybe composition writing maybe volunteering on a tutor line or though even through the elementary schools for help with homework
the other part of me says is god i've had enough kids
i do it all
i try to grow a vegetable garden
i just have a small plot it's ten feet by five feet
one's fifteen by four
all the rest of my backyard is pool and decking
i see
i enjoy fiddling around
especially when the weather's not too hot or
go ahead
sometimes i wish i had more space
sometimes i want to plant something there's not enough room to plant
some of those things like the things that vine cucumbers
or squash or something
it takes up your whole space
they just run all over
it was very good
it just takes up like you say a lot of your garden area
we just do
radishes and turnips not turnips carrots beets and things like that
she just plants a few for herself
peas i got a few peas out my garden a couple of days ago
i see
i
just wait until the weather warm enough to stick it in the ground
i guess you can get an earlier harvest by doing that
sure is a heck of a lot of work
i guess it
you got to
i don't think i'll do it again
i usually say hello to wife and kids
and then go out and fiddle just walk around the yard and inspect it
the kids want to swing
i push them on swing
i mow my own lawn
i don't have a sprinkler system
i don't enjoy watering
it is really nice
and off by the time you're up and about
i usually get it started for my wife she moves it around
i'll have to admit i do my own yard
i really don't enjoy doing that
i had a lawn service to do my yard for me during the real hot summer months until i retired
now i've lost my excuse for that so i have to
sometimes i wish i could get one of these chemical services to come
they want too much money
it's still be quite a bit cheaper to do it yourself
if i have a problem discipline i think
boy i really need to get out and apply something
i screw around and don't do it or wait too long or something
the weed come up
all of a sudden you've got to do something else
i'm kind of bad about that
now i have the time
i really don't
if you
you can get out in the morning before it gets hot and do it and stuff
just mowing it on saturday morning
i can start doing it in the evening after work
when they switch
i think it's coming up here soon
are you having any trouble with bugs in your garden
not a whole lot
i seldom use anything harsher than seven dust
i didn't have any problems
next year i was planting some broccoli and some of those they're called cabbage loppers
i went up
i didn't go out there for about three days
i went out there one day and the plant was nothing left but a stem
they
have a good appetite
they would
i picked off twenty of them
cutworms will do the same thing to your tomato vines too
they got that what is that safer soap
i've been watching them every day
i haven't seen any signs yet
if i see any signs i'm going to spray them
it's kind like this box shape
i got four pieces of two by twelve and joined them together and just made a box
and put in a whole bunch eight hundred pounds of topsoil and manure
various other things
the good stuff
i'm hoping especially with those big tall sides on there it that maybe i'll have less of a bug problem
at least they'll have a hard time crawling up the thing
my backyard is sloping
i built a box up had to build the one the low side up
i had sandy loam hauled in
you can improve your own soil there the texas soil isn't the greatest
you have to work on
if i didn't wait five years for it to be good enough grow
when we had our pool done i had them to leave some extra loam for my garden
i had a lot of loam out there to start with
do you have a rotor tiller
it weighs twenty pounds or
i guess it has a thatcher attachment to it
he lets me no problem borrowing if it's
just a hassle
it's a fairly large one to
check it back and just grab it if i just go to my garage and grab it
we've had a garden for years and years and years
of some size
you know tomatoes that are starting to bloom i've got a few carrots up
i've got some radishes up
as a matter of fact i've already done a second row of radishes
the green onions are coming along
do you grow those ten fifteen y
they are the best
i couldn't find a nursery that had any of them left
we've got some this year
my wife does a small herb garden on the side
those onions i think we planted twice as much this year because we got onions
they lasted from when you harvest them about a month from now or so
until october
we really missed them when they were gone
i bet
you don't realize how many dishes you put onions in
it was just like everything you put it into tasted so much better
one nice thing with onions and bell peppers at least you can chop them and freeze them if you have
too many
some we do green
my wife puts them on pizzas
and chops them up in recipes and things like that
you're making me hungry here
yellow peppers
i've got some broccoli onions some radishes and beets
i planted potatoes too
the potato
they're delicious
you don't seem to get that much for the space
they do
it does take some space
some beet potatoes
i've got some tomatoes still growing
in containers
i got to wait for a place to free up
our kids love pickles
we all love pickles
we're going to try to grow our own pickles this year
we've got some good hybrid burpee pickler cucumbers
we're going to try to see if we can pickle our own
have you seen how much pickles cost in the store
i said why are they so expensive they're just a bunch of little cucumbers
we're going to try that
i'd like to just try something new
i'll let you go it's
i run occasionally
i work out on a hanging bag
i keep up with that a little bit
the only exercise program i'm doing right now is walking
i'm four months pregnant with my second
at the time walking seems to be the best
it's something i can do with her plus doesn't tax me too physically
i enjoy that because i like the group association like exercising with other people
that's my favorite way to exercise
that's neat
my wife's about five months along she's been walking quite a bit
that is a good exercise for that
our schedules don't coincide as well as they used to
we very seldom get together to walk
when you work out do you pretty much do it on your own schedule
do you go to groups
i do it on my own schedule
it was so difficult to go on a regular basis to drive the distance you have to go
we've just save the fees and buy some of our own equipment
you can do it whenever you want i guess
we got my wife an exercise bike
i use that sometimes too
i guess you're not as dedicated if you don't drive
my husband used to work out three days a week at the texas instruments gym
i would just go on saturdays
since the first of the year neither one of us have been going
i guess like i say we've been paying these fees and not going
it's kind of a waste of money if you don't take advantage of it
i try to work out at least a couple of times a week
i think you really have to at least twice a week just to maintain the shape that you're in
i have two friends that we walk
they have babies that are about the same ages as mine
we've been walking every morning going
when we go we do about fifteen miles a week
the last little while for one reason or another we haven't been
i enjoy doing it more when i've got other people with me
i usually do it because i want to because i know it's good for me not because i don't feel obligated to do it
i won't be as consistent with it
i exercised pretty well up until i was pregnant
i started having pains
i've calmed down everything except i was working out doing aerobic exercises as well as the walking
i had to stop the aerobics because it was just kind of
the t i rec center has an aerobics program for prenatal and postnatal aerobic type thing
i was going to wait until about my sixth month and then start that
i went to my exercise class one day
she was delivered the next day
it would seem to be real beneficial
maybe it speeded up the process and all that
i think it made parts of it a lot easier
is this your first that you're having
then i don't know how much you've been through it
i think parts of it made a lot easier
i've talked to a lot of ladies that exercise with one pregnancy and didn't with the other
they said that the one they had exercised with was three or four times easier
i had
it's rough
i think the exercise helped
that's good
do you work with t i
my wife has been working with them
then she could go if she were interested
she could find out if she wanted to go
they would talk about exercise and just general things relating to the birthing process
for us it was educational
i know a lot of people that talk about exercise and say i don't want to exercise it's too much work
there's a lot of different things you can do that are enjoyable that you don't have to strain yourself or sweat or be real sore afterwards
i guess that you don't want to overdo
it's been good talking to you
i hope your baby comes out well
what do you think
None
i think the n r a has gone overboard the wrong way
i think that's a dumb
there has got to be some kind of background check to see
that the people who are buying a gun are buying it for a useful purpose if you're going to hunt with it
if you're going to do sport shooting you can wait a week
if they're can check your drivers license every time you get a ticket they should be able to go back and find out if you've had any kind of armed felony record
it seems to me right now that there's not that much of a check
i'm not really sure what texas law i think there's a check for felonies on your record
None
he has to go out and do it
if it's a private sale of course then there's nothing
that's my only problem with
get the check and everything is i guess bad guys if you want to call them bad guys
maybe we'll prevent a few john hinckley's
i
that's the kind of people
or whatever
None
i just think it makes honest people more honest
the people who want it it's not that big a deal like i say to wait
if you have to have it in a hurry something's wrong
what they need it for all of a sudden here
i'm married to a policeman
we talk about this a lot
i imagine his opinion is a little bit towards the one there
too many people have too much access
i think the other thing that we ought to control to some extent is there should be some law against the types of gu-
they're are
even the little
that's really gotten bad
that's kind of scary to think that you may be shot for holding one
there are a lot of kids who when they're ten look like they're twelve
or fourteen and especially some of the minority children whether
a racist or not
a cop comes up
you can't blame them
jeez you can't take the chances
there's been kids that age who have killed people
there was a law
i think that's a good idea
yeah
the kids don't care
you like to do
that they're not very distinguishable from a real gun
i was watching t v yesterday
there is a town in georgia
it's the law that you have a gun
every adult is able to carry a gun
they encourage it
the police love it
which really surprised me i think that's what they were going after they went to interview this town
it's a little dinky town
all the people said that's fine we could care less
we're all honest and everything like
we all carry them
we don't mind being checked
i think it kind of took that neatness away from it
heck everybody's got one
it was quite unusual to see the people in that town
my folks have always had
what to do and what not to do
my dad started letting me shoot a little air b b gun
it was
this is the only place that you do it which was
out far and away
you don't ever touch it unless i'm here
you don't point it at people
they had
anyway the hunter safety program
if you want to go deer hunting
your birthday's after nineteen something
that's neat
fifty-five or something then you have to attend one of these hunter safety courses you can't get a deer license
that's real neat
it's basic stuff
it's like when you're climbing over a barbed wire fence don't point lean your gun against it
that's real good
it is always incredible to me the number of times those kind of stupid accidents happen to people
they usually are real basic
always assume it's loaded
that's got to be the most common thing that people
people don't want to believe that
it's empty
i
i forgot about the one in the chamber
we're trying to teach our daughter
she knows real well about her daddy's guns
she's real
she'll know
she's real good about it
she's never been curious
cause he's always
if he has them out cleaning them she can be there
he'll tell how he's doing it or show her the insides or stuff like that
to be feared
if it's just one more piece of something
they've got to understand like you said never touch it
it's up in the closet
the shells are in another part
it's something to think about
i got it because my husband used to travel and be out
i was like i live in a nice neighborhood
i've got it so far
it's in a case
it's put up
it's away and all that
i don't want to take the chance
i think if somebody ever does break in
i know how to use one
we go hunting every once in a while
he showed me how to use his guns
i really enjoy it
boy if someone did break in i don't know that i could or would even grab it
i used to think about that
it was a lot easier when i was single
when i was just married with no kids
it was like you come after me you're going to get it
now there's so many other things where are the kids what are they doing
where is this person coming in from
you've got
if you manage to get it out
how can you even afford to think about what you're going to do because you don't know where your kids are
we have dogs that are very protective
most people that break in or whatever go to houses without the dogs
any advantage that they can take
that's one of them
do you think we've
i think that's about all i can
we're in pretty good agreement actually on it
it would be even more interesting you to be some of these people who are at the other end of the spectrum
it's been nice talking to you
right now the place where i'm living the yard was basically neglected for about the last twenty-five years
after three years of working at it i've been amazed at just what a little bit of doing
instead of mowing in the same direction every time changing one time you'll cut the lawn the long way then you'll go the opposite way instead of going lengthways you go width
it helps the grass come back
you've been working on it for three years
for three years
it was like you couldn't even stand still out there
a little bit
the ants would start crawling up your legs
dursban two
you haven't had a problem with that since
not bad
that's to be expected
did it kill anything else it wasn't supposed to
that's pretty wild
we did that
i'm not
i sometimes have problems starting the mower
a lot of times i won't get out and do it
my husband
he does the edging and all that kind of thing
we're renting
we don't really put a lot of money into the
we have winter rye out back
we have
we're just not real into the lawn probably because we're renting i guess
it anyway
i found one thing that it's kind of a weird thing to say to put out on the lawn
every time i've done it drives the fleas completely out of the area
i wonder why it does
you don't have to put a whole lot out
it's real fine like flour you just go out and do the entire yard
you don't have to put clumps of it
i'll have to remember that because hopefully we won't have them this year
we have a cat that comes in and out
the cat was getting fleas and stuff and bringing them in the house
we had a real problem last year with fleas
we prayed that we could get rid of these fleas
we got rid of them
we did
we don't want them back this year
we've had to get out and treat our lawn for that
None
that's about the extent of our lawn care
i don't know
i love it
it's too hot to be working in the yard
i'm stopping to drink water
what's the problem
that's funny
my husband doesn't
he doesn't really enjoy doing it
he'll do it
he doesn't gripe about it or anything
he's kind of like your wife
in that he doesn't really enjoy it
i would like to have a garden
right now where we're living we have the trees where their roots are at the top of the ground everywhere over the ground
it'll tear up a nice tiller
we're going to wait until we move
we're going to wait
when we move that's one of our priorities
i'd like to do that
that's our next thing
half of it's
in missouri city
southwest side of houston
we're in dallas
that's neat
yeah
we just haven't been able to do that yet
one day we'll be able to do it
i'm excited about it
i don't know anything about it
you'll have to give me a call on gardening
i'll go nothing
i guess we'll let you go
i've had an very enjoyable conversation with you
we'll talk to you later
do you believe only fifty percent of the people actually vote
they really don't listen to any of the issues anymore
they feel like so many of the politicians are crooked
they figure why go out and vote
i think one of the good ways of solving that is everybody likes to come to a party so have a voting party in communities
that's the only
thing that i can figure out because i've heard so many people say i'm not going on voting on that one i'm going to go fishing today or it won't make any difference if i don't vote
i think it does
there's no question it does make a difference
so far
as having a party and then all voting when you have different precincts you would have to have a party in every precinct
people have to vote in different areas
not everyone votes at the same place
i personally think that we need to do more along the education lines in the schools and the children from the little ones on up with the idea of the value of voting and the purpose of voting and that one vote does make a difference
maybe let them have some mock
they are doing that in a number of schools
however probably not enough of them country wide
it's going to take at least a whole generation of people to get across the idea of voting
just like it's taking a whole generation of people to finally realize the harmfulness of drugs and hopefully now with the many programs throughout the country on
perhaps we'll finally get the youth weaned off of it
i know i spent thirty-four years in education here in the dayton area
in nineteen fifty-one the police were telling us about the drug dealers outside the school and how they were just giving away their marijuana giving away their heroin
that was in fifty-one
it's now to the forefront
people are finally taking some action against it
the thing we've neglected the value of voting and what it really means
i don't know how it is up there
down here louisiana has a bad reputation for their politicians and all
i'm sure you heard about some of ours
people are just
it's like they're turned off on voting
that's the reason i said maybe if you had something like a block party
we're going to go and vote
maybe they could give something like the top neighborhood if you had a hundred percent in your neighborhood or something like that
it could be like a sign that they would put down at the end of your block
or anything like that
it's really bad here
to me it is
they say it don't make any difference
they don't bother to listen to what any of them have to say
i know my husband
i don't care how small the ballot is if there's one thing if there's one issue
the way i feel is if i don't vote then i don't have any reason
i hear so many people saying i wish this would change i wish that
they didn't go vote
like you said if they would start when little kids and start letting them vote and learn how to vote and all and the importance of it because if you don't vote for your friend over here your friend's not going to have a chance
he needs your vote just like he needs everybody elses
i know here until you get into high school now then they had the voting machines
you voted for cheerleaders and different things like that
they should start that a lot earlier
it should begin right down in the first grade
your very best teachers in my estimation should be first second or third grade so that the children develop good learning patterns
you have some success and want to go on learning and continue learning and not wait until they're in high school
it's too late to try to change them around at that point
everything should be started on the lower levels
certainly if the youngsters had that opportunity that they understood that the principles of the country were established so that everyone would have a say and everyone would have a vote and what that vote meant
you're right from the standpoint that people do have a negative attitude towards politicians
perhaps it's because our campaigns have become so terribly expensive to run that only the most wealthy can do so
they're not always the best person for the job
they have the money to be able to do it
there are a lot of problems along that line also
perhaps the government
a good idea for the young kids like that too is to have
this candidate tells you some things that are going to happen
this candidate tells you some things
then this percentage of the voters the kids in that class they are not going to let them vote this time
they have to do whatever
if they did something like that and started kids out real young and showed them now you're not going to get to vote
you're going to have to do what that person says
i think that's an excellent idea
they would put them to realize that their going to have to do what someone else says even though they didn't vote for it
you do that in the primary
i don't know that a lot of people vote in primaries for that very reason
they can declare anything they want
they can actually rig it
it's just a sad situation
i do think more needs to be done along that line to help to teach the everyone more about what is going on with voting and with nonvoting
so that they're making some more intelligent decisions
it's going to take these young it's going to take a whole generation of my feeling before that's going to be accomplished
they'd have to start when they're real young
it would have to be a child that is just coming into school
i'll tell you another thing too now
the first time i voted i never voted in high school because there was never anyone that showed us how to use the voting machines
i did not know how to use those voting machines
nobody ever showed us or anything
i didn't vote because anybody that went in there and they asked a question all the other kids laughed at them
she don't even know how wah wah
there wasn't any way i was going to go in there and vote
it took such courage you wouldn't
i was out of school
i didn't know how to work the machine
it really scared me really bad
i thought all these people are going to laugh at me because i don't know how to work this machine
where if they'd had a class or something or just a short time to said this is the way
just the opportunity to try the voting machines
this is the way it's going to be
my son was exactly the same way that i was
i didn't realize it until his senior year
i asked him something about who did you vote for cheerleader
he said i didn't go vote
he said there's no way i'm getting in that machine
then i realized it
when we went and voted the next time i asked the lady i said i want my son to come in with me
she said why
i said i won't turn any of the buttons down
i want to show him how to use it so that he'll be able to vote
he went in
now he's a registered voter
he would not vote before then
i think that's bad
here i was
even of course there's a lot of years between the two of us
even with that many years between
what do we currently have
i have a subaru g o x t
i have a ninety honda civic
i'm ready to get rid of it
it's not pretty old
i had an eighty-eight that i really liked
it got wrecked
i bought a ninety because i really liked my eighty-eight
i've had a lot of problems with this one
you think their quality control's going down over there kind of
it's kind of funny
i think we're going to see that i think that the quality that the japan carmakers had is slipping a little bit
it's true
that's one reason
i've had no problems with my subaru
that's one reason i went with it because subaru had a good reputation for low maintenance
honda does too
there's no question
you have a nineteen
i've got to see if
i've seen and i've had friends that have eighty-one or eighty celicas
those things just keep ticking
they can rack up a hundred fifty k on them
they're still beating on them
it's just amazing
they got
they're not making them like that now
they're still a lot i think definitely better than the american carmaker system
i definitely agree with you there
it was the worst car i've ever owned
that's why i was so tickled with my honda
it got wrecked
i wouldn't even look at another car
i just went and bought a honda i didn't look around or anything i just said that this is what i want
i really have had a lot of problems with it
i don't know
maybe you need to unload it on somebody el-
in the first twelve months that i owned it it was in the shop an average of about once a month
i was really disappointed because i was so hyped up on honda
what's your next purchase supposed to be
i know this
this is going to sound really strange
i really like to have a mazda m p v van
i have kids
and the new chevy lumina van
i don't like those styles the m p v is more of just normal
i'm not sure how to explain it
it looks i guess kind of like the chevy aerostar or arrow
astro i guess
i used to really like the looks of the m p v because it looks more like a mini van rather than i think
do you have a family
that's probably influenced maybe a little bit
i know that it's got to have a radio it's got to have air conditioning
i'm sure you can relate to air conditioning
living in arizona
cruise control and tinted windows that's about it
it's got to have those things otherwise i don't care
when i bought my car it was right out of college
i always been looking for something sporty
i ended up getting basically something that i could afford
i probably
a few girls that i've gone out with i've had mazda r x seven's and stuff
they're pretty fun to drive
i think that's what i'm going to have to get next time around
i keep holding off
i could upgrade now if i wanted to
i
i'm just going to keep holding off
i'm definitely going to look for something in the nice perpor-
it's not practical for me
i'll probably
i don't know if i'll get myself to spend that kind of money
you're looking for a new r x seven or a supra or something
at least
new cars aren't cheap anyway
anyway my ultimate car though the one that i really want is five sixty or so mercedes
we all have those kind of dreams too don't we
that's the only one that i
i see early on
it may be my phone
anyway it's the only car that says sporty and class
kind of what i'm
those are fun
those are nice
None
they're cute cars
he had a red
he actually
they came out with a european racing green miata that's a limited edition
they're only going to make three or four thousand
he went out
he traded the other one in and got this one
i haven't seen those
i'm like i haven't seen one yet either
supposedly they have some real wood built in to the clutch and all this and the steering wheel
it's very authentic
there only is supposed to be limited edition so it may be a good investment
no matter what it is if it's a limited edition it's usually worth something later on
i think
hope it's not going bad
i think he only spent the low twenty's
i would have figured that to be a lot more than that
i don't know
the prices aren't as high
the miata was first introduced
they weren't really that bad though when they were introduced were they
the demand is so high that they were going to retail them around thirteen standard
you get your options
your looking at fifteen or fifteen
there were people were buying them for nineteen and twenty
they may have gone down a little bit
i can't remember what i read about that
so that's
i would think somebody would try to compete with that because it is very popular
have you seen the new dodge stealth
the mitsubishi
is the same
those are nice
that's the same manufacturer
they just market them
yeah
those are supposed to be very performance power there is big time
those are pretty stripped
there's nothing
that one's just more for looks
it doesn't have really the performance that the expensive one does
i've seen one of those
it's not that great because they really
i think they're only around twenty-nine k
they have better
i don't know
like i said it's still not practical for me
no other responsibilities for yourself i guess it's
i've haven't tried to upgrade myself right now
that's i could have get something nice and upgrade
i'm consulting right now
what do you think about the peace corps or public service commitment
that's the first i've ever heard of it
i haven't heard anything too much about it
i think it was thought up when there was so much controversy about reviving a draft
people said young people who were drafted have to provide military service to the country
there are an awful lot of young people who would benefit from some sort of public service
like the conservation corps back in the thirties or various other things of that sort
it seems to me
i don't quite see how they'd make it work
how would they decide who goes into building fire breaks in yosemite national park and who goes to saudi arabia
my first impression was it would be very good
i don't know if it should be an option
i think there are some available now where they are able to work
making it a mandatory thing kind of
the difficulty would be in whether it's voluntary or involuntary
the people who were proposing it said that it should be involuntary that it should be like a draft
some people would get military service
some people would get civilian
they were allowed to do hospital service or things like that
if they re-
farm work in world war one i remember reading about
i suppose that there is justification for taking everybody if you take anybody
i just really think that the difficulties involved in paying them sorting them out assigning them
it seems like you'd have a lot more conscientious objectors if they had that choice
i'd much rather work in a hospital than to go war
i'm sure most young men and women would
None
i think that in the cases like that they had to be pretty thoroughly examined to prove that they had pacifist and religious beliefs and so forth
that this wasn't something new just to keep out of going to war
it was something that was a fundamental part of their philosophy of life
that makes sense
you run into again the bureaucracy in running it
how you going to cover that many people because we've got a lot more people now than we did then
you have to pay them some kind of a stipend
even if it's the peace corps where they don't get most of it until they come home
you have to pay them something
i had a lot of friends who went to the peace corps back in the mid sixties it really did seem to be a worthwhile organization
on the other hand i'm not sure what the permanent value of it was
we had an awful lot of idealistic people who went off to what was then east pakistan is now bangladesh
and to algeria and to southeast asia and lots of out-of-the-way places
i don't know if they really had significant effects in the places where they went
i know in
i was living such a stringent lifestyle that it was very beneficial to me
it taught me not to be so self-centered and to think of others
i don't know if i was doing it in different situation not a really religious background if i would get a lot out of it
i think i did because it emphasized that sort of thing
a lot of self evaluation
it was definitely voluntary too
i'm sure that would make a big difference too
you've got
what about a voluntary program
like i say i know that there are some type of programs that they have available for teenagers to go and do work in the national parks and work in neighborhoods to clean up and that sort of thing
i don't know what organization it's under
i know that that helps a lot with training and a lot of
there's a program like that for juvenile delinquents the ones that are not dangerous
they don't have to be locked up go to these camps
they put up signs
they do fire prevention work and certainly things of that sort
that i know is run by the state
there may be other things
i'm not so sure what kind of training that is for the future for those kids
it's probably a very good way to keep them off the streets and out of trouble
whether it's something that they can put to economic use later on is a different subject
especially if you take a child that's from the inner city and then put them in a middle of a park
that may not benefit them in the long run
my other line is blinking
thank you
it was good to talk to you
what's your most recent one that you've seen
what i do
i haven't really seen any movies in the movie theater
i rent probably four or five movies a week
i haven't been doing it lately
gosh i'm just
air america
see i haven't seen that one
it depends
do you like steamy movies
usually i don't
i guess two of my favorite movies is probably lethal weapon and lethal weapon two
those are two of my most favorite
they're just really good movies
i liked bird on a wire
do you like just action
are you talking about movies like die hard two
jagged edge
or fatal attraction
that was okay
i guess i thought it was too far fetched
so many people said no it wasn't
i guess
i just thought it was too far fetched
i have to say that probably the one movie that really threw me back the most that i was really the most in shock with was probably star wars
i guess out of all the movies i've never been as excited to go back
i was ready to go back and see it again
that's really like an all time classic
i don't think
now i also liked gone with the wind or some of the classic like the lawrence of arabia
i've never seen that
you haven't
that's a real interesting movie
it's got a good historical perspective to it
it'd probably be a good thing for me to see
it's about al capone's brothers
i won't give the whole plot away
it's really a good movie
one of them was lost for many many years
he turns out to be a law man
you just gave it away
go rent it
a lot of times what i wind up doing is picking say an actor or an actress
and seeing all
all of mae west's movies
just kind of go out and rent all the movies and just kind of go
i guess you could do that get all of david carradine's movies
or segal
it's not david is it
he was on arsenio just recently
i don't watch that
arsenio was asking him about what he thought of one of the other action guys
he said he wouldn't really talk about it
didn't want to talk about him because he didn't think he was such a good action guy
it was
i like all the rambo movies
None
i don't really like sylvester stallone
i just have never been a stallone fan
i don't know i just have never seen any interest in him
we actually rent probably a good combination of movies with the exception of horror films
i don't know
there's something about people coming up through the sofa to get you or something
coming out of the t v that just doesn't make my day
it's so
i guess i'm a realist when i watch movies like that it's like this can not happen
i just don't enjoy it because it's just like come on give me a break
i just
so many of them are done so poorly
it just doesn't even give you the effect
some of them are done good
they do scare you
so many of them are just done real
i just saw a really interesting movie called flatliners
that was one of my favorites
what i liked about it was that it was a new subject
it was done so well
students might try to do it
it's not like there's a lot of scientific data on it
that's probably true
it was a very good movie
there wasn't any part of it that you really felt like no this can't happen
it seemed real
it was really good
that was one
it was good
i don't know if you like this kind
i thought pretty woman was a really good movie too
we've seen that two or three times
we rented it
it was really good
have you seen shrimp on the barby
yeah
it must have what's his name in it
it's got cheech marin
it's kind of a poor man's pretty woman in reverse
it was kind of cute
did you see dirty rotten scoundrels
when i thought of that i thought of
there was another one
dances with wolves have you seen that yet
you've got to see that one
it's very very good very good
my wife has got a picture from kevin costner
he signed it
he signed it
he happens to be a friend of one of her business associates
wow that's impressive
not a friend a cousin
anyhow we got a nice picture
it came in an envelope that says dances with wolves
we've got to try to get out there and see that one
it's a very good movie
they pushed it back to playing it in the theaters until august
i think because they were scheduling a video release of it in july
when it won all those awards they pushed it back to august
did you see driving miss daisy
i didn't think that one was near as good
i guess it was okay
it was all right
when i compare the winners of this year and last year it just
maybe it's not
i'm pretty pro gun control over all
i've had a lot of arguments with people about the issue of gun control
i must say that there are a couple of arguments against strong gun control which i find very compelling although most the people who argue gun control with me i find use sort of canned arguments sort of the n r a slogan arguments
i've been very frustrated when i do debate with people about it
i guess on a scale of one of ten i'm probably around a two in terms of fair restricting guns
i have to admit most of that is strong personal distaste
i don't like the idea of people being able to kill me with very little effort
guns are very symbolic of them having that power over me
me being from texas
i'll give it a try
i'm not your stereotypical texan
i respect them and what their capabilities are
on top of that spending a good portion of my earlier years in the military as a green beret i definitely respect the power of weaponry
here in houston as well as just about any big city anywhere across this country
here you go
when you've heard the slogan if you outlaw guns then only out laws will have guns
you've got
any of the big cities you've got the different rival gangs
they're having their little turf wars over their little drug kingdoms and such
they get out their little mac tens
they're going to fight with them
it doesn't matter what restrictions you put on that type of weapon or a class three firearm
i don't care if they've got to go down into new mexico to get it
they'll get across the border
my position although i have absolutely no use for a fully automatic weapon
if they want me to present a letter from my county sheriff saying that i've got his permission to have an automatic weapon in his county that's fine too
what i don't gets dangerous in terms of civil liberties because pretty soon
you don't want to have someone making a personal trust in that way i would hope because someone
the personal sheriff doesn't get to have a gun
someone the personal sheriff
the criteria the sheriff would have to follow is this guy a convicted felon
if he had an automatic weapon could he really be raising some problems
just proving that you're a basically a good citizen
if you're not a basically good citizen
if they want the firepower they can get it
why hav-
why have any restrictions at all
we could be
i said the restrictions i would like to see for anybody whether it being for handgun a rifle a shotgun
whether it be your state police or your county police for you to be able purchase a handgun
that makes a lot of since to me
i certainly feel that if we may disagree on when someone should own a fire arm
i certainly agree that if someone owns a fire arm that have as much responsibility to know how do use it safely as someone learns how to drive if not more so
the han-
as a pistol
i have a bicycle
that scares me too to tell you the truth
i'm still puzzled though what is the argument
how does the argument work if the bad guys are going to have guns anyway
is it a way of raising the prices of illegal guns
does that mean advantage
not necessarily a price thing
i expect to see it in other states very soon
legislation been introduced that if a citizen of the state being
you're from california right
all these people come around
if this legislation comes through
when you're looking down the barrel of a hand cannon things change real quick
having spent time in combat i feel it before they'll get the gun on me
i'm sure
i'm sure given all your training i'm sure that you'd
i'm quite concerned that if you let everyone
hasn't yet committed a felony
it's hard for me to imagine that a situation of
it's no-
the fact that everybody is packing a piece is a deterrence for someone saying i'm going to mug this guy right here
hey he's carrying just as much firepower as i can
if they're sca- if you got to go through a certification course to get to where you can carry it in public
whether this person is made the moral decision whether he can take another human life or not
even more so when it comes to my wife and son
anybody tries to hurt them i won't even blink
i understand that
what if you think someone's trying to hurt them and you make a mistake
this is where the question of gun control comes in
that was the topic
say a person get
say i've got the vibes this guys fixing to do something
i make sure this persons sees it so that he's got now doubt that i will use it on him
i will use it right then
the only reason i feel comfortable doing that is because of the training i've had
as someone who would possibly be in the role of an independent bystander i feel more comfortable with people having blades because you're not going to get
if i'm the one doing the shooting i don't miss
this is really ironic that i would get this subject today because just yesterday our dog ran away
it's just been tearing me up all day
i bet
we have just been looking all over for him
this is just really strange
i guess so
he's gotten out before
he's always stayed right here
this is just really strange because
he's part golden lab and part
australian shepherd
that's why it really surprises me that he hasn't come back because
None
i hope he comes back
about two years
that's tough
isn't that funny how we do
we just really
they're always there for you
they don't talk back to you
they're companions
do you have any
her name is angel
we have a cat a white cat he's just a tabby just a
his name is dominique
we had the dog first
she's kind of a wimp
the cat kind of rules
she likes him all right
we had another cat about two years ago
it got
we got this new cat
i have two children
they really enjoy the animals
my mother who's very elderly lives with us
she's really good friends with the dog
they're really companions
they're friends
you can love them all you want
they love you right back
they don't
it's just so neat
i know it has to be
it's like i said we've had him for two years
he's never
he's gotten out
he's always been right there
he's never been gone for at all he's just always been right there when he gets out
it's the first time he's ever been gone like this
that's really too bad
that's awful
i knew we were going to find him
when we didn't it was like no
i hope you'll find him
we keep
they told us at the humane society and the adoption center don't give up hope
have you put any posters up or anything like that
not yet
we were talking about that tonight since he just got out yesterday
we were trying to find some pictures of him recently
we just don't have a whole lot
we have him on film on the video camera
you can't put that on the
None
i don't know
we will put some posters and stuff up
that's good
hopefully that will help maybe around the neighborhood
that helps too if they can keep
i think that if he gets out he'll come back
i really do because he knows exactly where he lives
it's just so ironic that this would happen
i would get this kind of a call
i know sometimes our cat will stay out all night
when he's not right at the door in the morning i really worry that something's happened to him that he's got in a fight or somebody's hit him
if he doesn't come by mid morning then i really get scared
he's always come back eventually
that's good
they can get hurt a lot easier
that would make you really
he's a real feisty guy
cats are really almost more territorial than dogs are
they're very
any cat that comes near and even a dog he won't jump at them or anything
he'll sit
he'll watch
i think maybe he would if it came real close
he's very protective of our property
i guess i really don't know cats that well because my mother never liked them
i never had them growing up
i never really had them around me
i've never owned one
they're really a lot different than dogs because they're very independent
he's very affectionate when he wants to be
if you want him to be and he doesn't want to be he'll either scratch you or run away
when he wants to be he's really affectionate
he likes to lay next to you and have you scratch his head and snuggle up to you
if he's not in the mood you'd better stay away from him
dogs seem to be always in the mood
they're always right there and like you to pet them and loving
i like the way they come up
they'll put their head underneath your hand
most dogs do that
they know exactly how to get that attention
they just come up
they put your they'll rub their head against you
do you keep him indoors most of the time other than to go outs-
he's outside during the day
we get home at night we do bring him in
because he's had all this room to run in
how did he get out
he did it a couple weeks ago dug a hole
we filled it back up put him back in there
we put dirt in the hole and then put some chicken wire around it so that he couldn't get out
he kind of ripped through the chicken wire
i can't
i just have not
i don't understand because it's like he's got a good home
we have two kids that just love him a lot
it's like we can't understand why he kept wanting to get out
you know that animals are like that
i'm sure that
i know
None
it's like
they just been real
at first they seemed to be upset
now it's like if he doesn't come home can we get another dog
you already want to replace him
that's was our cat's name that died
we named him buddy after buddy bell the ranger baseball player that used to be here
we used to
we named him buddy beaner for some reason
buddy after buddy bell
he was a good cat too
i feel real guilty because
one year i forgot to get him his leukemia booster
he got it
i just felt so bad
it's real contagious
the vet
if they don't have their booster
i had no idea
the question was about physical fitness and staying in shape and exercise
i don't do it as much as i should
last year i did it every day
in ninety-one i've kind of gone down hill
i'm not doing it as much as i need to
i can tell you when i do it on a regular basis i feel so much better and so much healthier
it's just to get motivated to do it
once i get started i do it every night
it's just to get motivated again
what happened about couple of weeks ago i started again
i was walking
it got kind of dark
i was by myself
there was this fellow in this truck that kept circling the block
i kind of got frightened
i kind of use that as an excuse
i try to
i started at the beginning of this year
i went through the t i fitness center and registered for the aerobics classes there
they run for two months at a time
you do have to pay to take them
i signed up for one that was three nights a week an hour and a half
that was four and a half hours a week
it cost sixty dollars
i thought okay that's not cheap
i had a friend of mine going
i was real good
march came around
i signed up again
i got caught up with a class i was taking at t i
i was having to work some real late hours to get caught with my work after i got out of class
i went to colorado springs the next week to do some training at the t i up there
that was two weeks i had missed
boy i tell you what i've been terrible ever since then
it's once you get out of that habit you don't get back into it
i teach school
last year a bunch of teachers had an aerobics class
she came to our school twice a week
i was
i missed once
this session is about to run out
i signed up for a different one now that's only two nights a week because i am getting kind of into a real busy schedule as far as teaching a lot of training classes
some of them require me to go out of town
that just kind of throws my whole schedule off on doing that
i've
lately there's been nights that i could have gone
i've found excuses
i'm fine this week
i didn't
i'm kind of finding excuses
now it's kind of like
i
i think another thing is that my friend that was taking with me the first two months wasn't the second two months
i haven't had that extra motivation of us encouraging each other to go
it's misery loves company
some i
the neighbor across the street she belongs to president's
it's not president's any more
she loves it
it's an automatic high for her
i don't
i hate it when i'm doing it
i just
she just loves it
even when she doesn't go to the health club she runs
it
it's so hard for me
i don't
i have an older sister that loves running too
she runs all the time
to me it's every minute's agony
when i walk i'll take along a radio or something
that helps pass the time
we used to try to get together
i think now that the weather's getting nicer we're going to start doing it again and occasionally go walking
it's not as boring if you get several people you can kind of talk
it makes it pass pretty quickly
the aerobics isn't too boring
i kind of enjoy it when i'm doing it
i do have to make myself go
of course while i'm doing it i feel pretty good
after i get finished i feel great
it's great afterwards
i can go in there
a friday afternoon when i'm tired it's the end of the week and i just want to go home i'll make myself go
i'll have headache and everything
i get out
i'm just
just in general i sleep a lot better i just feel much better
i've been kind of dragging the last few weeks
i know if i would just get around to exercising i'd feel better
my dragginess is my excuse for not exercising
i'm too tired
i have a headache
i just got over the flu
i'm still kind of draggy
i better not go
it's silly not to
i don't know
i know that it's good for my health
i know from everything that you read and you see on television now exercise is so important to good health
you're not only doing something to keep yourself fit but you're probably prolonging your life
i don't know
i think one thing i don't like about aerobics is that after i'm finished it's kind of late at night
i've been sweaty
it
it kind of kills the evening for doing errands
i think a tuesday thursday might be a little bit better
i'm kind of glad they have a longer class on thursday now that i can just kill two nights and get a reasonable amount of workout in
that's good too
i'm glad it's not too totally cheap because if it was too cheap i would talk myself out of going more probably
do you have a facility right where you work
they have a really nice facility at the t i
i guess sometimes it kind of motivates you to really get going
they hire private instructors
that's great
they have ceiling fans in the rooms
it's a pretty nice setup
of course it's real convenient because it is right there at work
just the fact that i can go straight from my desk over to the recreation center and do it helps a lot
i can see that would be easy
do a lot of people take advantage of it
they have probably i'd say fifteen to twenty different aerobics classes each session that are running
they have them anywhere from six in the morning
they have some during lunch hour that are shorter
i guess guys can take advantage of that
for me i wouldn't have time to do an hour of aerobics and then take a shower and get dressed again
there's a lot more guys that do that one
they have big variety
they even have some water aerobics when the weather gets nice out in the pool
you have a pool there too
how nice
they've got an olympic pool and basketball courts and sand volleyball
they've got the full weight room and the locker rooms with a jacuzzi and sauna and the shower facilities and hair dryers and everything you'd need just about
it is a real nice facility
it's also got a full inside basketball court
i think they're working on building a jogging track and some other things
it is very nice
i'm just now finally starting to do the aerobics thing
does it cost money to exercise in the weight room or to go swimming
it's about eight dollars a month
that's not bad
the aerobics cost extra even if you have the fitness membership
i think the aerobics classes are even pretty reasonably priced from what i've heard
people of all ages take advantage of the aerobics
in fact the t i-er's families can come in on these things
what's there to say
in maryland they do have capital punishment
i've seen a lot of people get sentenced
just nothing happens
from what i underst-
i saw a statistic just a few days ago so far this year or was it during the last year during a years time i think it was they executed twenty-five people in the nation
i
it's building up
they're convicting them faster than they're executing them
it's really building up
here in maryland i know we have a real problem with overcrowding in prisons
in
here it's to the point where they were letting prisoners go
commuting the sentences of those that were in jail for lesser crimes
in order to put more people into the jails
it was just amazing to me
of course they made a big deal out of the few that got out and turned around and committed a crime within five days of getting out
isn't maryland where the famous willy horton case was
i can't remember
that was the one that was used so much in the campaign in the presidential race
it may not have been maryland
i don't remember myself
anyway the question is do you think it does make a difference in whether or not a criminal commits a crime
do you think it can if it's done right
i think in large measure the reason they don't care
so many of the people that commit crimes don't get punished
the courts don't convict them
they don't serve very much of the time
their success rate is very high
you can make a good living at it
there's a lot of people here in baltimore that have
we just had a real big cocaine bust
of course they're playing it up real big that it looked like it was a very very small ring
they just happened to get lucky and catch the guy
baltimore has an all time record for the number of deaths so far this year
it's kind of moved up
you have to remember that there's i think x number of people out there that are going to commit murders
once you kill off a few of them
if you murder a guy because he murdered your partner or something like that pretty soon you run out of people to murder
the only consolation is so many of the murders are
they
at least maybe the guy they cross next time is going to
i think capital punishment is an appropriate punishment for the kind of people where we say this sort of person is just not acceptable to our society
we are there by going to remove them from society not temporarily but permanently
i personally think life imprisonment
i don't think much of life imprisonment first of all it's never turns out to be life
second why should we
that means you're going to put them in a cage you think it's never ever going to be safe for them to walk the streets again
then why bother
just execute them because that way you're sure they'll never ever going to walk the streets again
anybody that says life in prison with no chance of parole i'd say give them the death penalty
it makes sense
you have the occasional person who may have been falsely accused but so few and far between
that's about it
also the thing i don't like about a lot of these court trials and a lot of these appeals is that it's not based on what is true and what is false
rather it's on
i think our courts should be geared much more strongly
that way we can be sure
we can find out what really happened and base the sentence on what the person did not on what we're allowed to let the jury hear
my father-in-law participated in a jury trial
he was actually on the jury
this man was accused of killing i think it was two people and shooting a policeman point blank in the face
this was during a holdup of a restaurant
it came out during the trial that they had tried to rob another place
when the guy came out with the bag they thought was money it turned out to be a couple jumbo cookies
they were so upset from robbing this guy trying to do this holdup that didn't work that they quite literally were mad and went into a restaurant to hold the place up and just started shooting people
get even with who
stupid guys
it turned out that the policeman survived to the point that he was able to identify the guy
of course they tried to make the cop look like he was a no good rotten drunk
it was amazing
what was the verdict
he was found guilty
he
last i heard he beat a push for the death penalty
whether they finally got it or not i don't know
i kind of stopped listening after a while
he would come home
after the trial was over he came home and told us what was going on
of course then they had to go back to dec-
the penalty phase
everybody was pretty much let's burn him
that's the way they wanted to do it
he was surprised because he thought there was going to be a problem because he
some people on the case were a little hesitant on convicting him on some of the charges
when it all came down they just within an hour decided the man's fate
you just have to decide wha- yo-
there's really two separate decisions there i guess
one is did it really happen the way the prosecutor said it happened
you have to decide that
then you have to decide as a member of society what do i want to do with this guy who did this thing
that w-
i've never been on a jury
it went pretty quick from what he said
there's a lot of other crimes out there besides murder
i think if you're dealing drugs
caught more than twice or something
there's a death penalty associated with it
the thing i'd be most likely to attach the death penalty to is the violence
ye-
i can handle people selling drugs
it's wrong
it's not worth somebody getting executed for
we hear so much about the violence and how it's not safe to walk the streets because these random drive by shootings and that sort of thing
the people i'd most likely want to sentence to death are the people that just show a really low regard for human life
that
i go le-
these are the kind of people i would like to get out of here and get out of circulation and say we don't accept your kind in our society
i have a low tolerance for that kind of person
as far as
there are some other crimes that i think
kidnapping when they
kidnapping per se has a certain fine and penalty associated with it
some of these people are just out and out brutal
i pay a good deal of taxes i guess because i make a fair amount of money
the taxes that i pay i guess as a general statement i feel i guess i get my money's worth for
i guess i am sure that i feel that in general though the allocation of the taxes in certain areas isn't correct
i'm sure that probably every person in this country would agree with you on that
i
lately i guess or at least for the last twenty years or so i've felt that the expenditures of our taxes into high cost defense items at least in the last ten years have been
i'm not really sure that we've gotten our money's worth there regardless of the outcome of the desert storm
desert shield situations
i guess my particular beef is that having participated in the military off and on over the years of being called back and things of that nature is i've found that there's an extraordinary amount of waste
i take that as a given in any military operation
i gue-
i should imagine that what the problem
why i'm a little concerned about today is that this rather quick victory in the mideast over the iraqis might lead us into a false sense of security that we can do that against any other foe
i don't know what other foe that would be
i'm just getting nervous again now hearing the voices come up that there has to be increased expenditures in that area
of course a lot of missiles and things were expended in the course of fighting the war
the inventory's going to have to be restocked
i work for t i
one of the things we were told is they had eleven thousand harm missiles which t i is the sole supplier for
they used up two thousand of them in the war
they're going to have to do another contract to restock that to get ready in case something else is needed
it
would that be
let's see
two thousand out of eleven thousand that's about a little over twenty per cent
i should imagine that that would be to keep it at those levels i guess that were originally appropriated when the soviet threat i guess was perceived as being a greater one
i do worry about what nuclear weapons are left in their territory over there and who's controlling them
that's true
i don't know what amount of our hardware would stop some fanatic i guess from doing anything that would be irrational
of course now we used up twenty per cent of that inventory
t i also makes the missile which was the t v laser guided bombs a big percentage of that was expended as well
that was just a matter of
what is the name of that
it's called paveway
a big percentage of that was used up during that conflict also
those are two areas in which t i stands to gain some short term business to restock that
i'm
i guess it
talking about the taxes in general and that was an area that i perceive as not being the best expenditure for the amount of dollar that we're taxed for in the area of defense
perhaps we have paid too much there
it's a cliche
i see it myself
no doubt
i don't know
i'm familiar with some upbeat school areas
i don't totally agree with the great expenditure of effort and time there
i guess overall because i guess i'm not associated with what ghetto schools and rural school systems are like i should imagine that would take an enormous expenditure
as a matter of fact in texas we've had our school funding system declared unconstitutional by a state judge
the legislature just passed what they called a robin hood bill which
basically what it does is it takes extra money from the more affluent school districts that come from local taxes and send them to other parts of the state that are not so affluent
they don't have a broad based income tax that funds the educational system
is it all funded out of local taxes
to give you some perspective this town that i had lived in for sometime in nineteen eighty-three was funded sixty-five per cent by state funds
they forgot to put in the state budget the money to pay for it
they dumped it all on the local school districts
what ended up happening was a shift
we went to sixty-five per cent state funding to sixty-five per cent local funding in a matter of four years
do you mean a complete reversal
complete
now even the money that's been raised for the local districts is going to be siphoned off and sent to other parts of the state
because i guess they can't raise that money in those poorer districts
i have no problem with a certain minimum level that's a standard that everybody ought to be able to have
i am opposed to any attempts to restrict local communities from taxing themselves above that to provide above the minimum
i guess i am a strong and staunch supporter of some subsidy for any forms of education
by that i mean i'm a product myself
i have a background of getting my college education through the g i bill
when i look at it to me it doesn't really make any difference
i don't think i would have gone on unless i had that financial easement made possible
i don't really care what it takes to qualify whether you're a veteran or whether you
unless you promise to even do something in the future i think that the subsidy itself
i guess the enactment of that form of legislation
would give many people who i think i perceive the fact
at least what i read is that some younger people feel that education is priced out of their budget
i know in the state of florida just today the legislature adjourned
they had completed a fifteen per cent increase in the state land grant colleges which isn't
to me it doesn't sound like a lot of money
i guess it would be for fifteen hundred dollars a year
for an out of state student the tuition went up twenty-five per cent
they had to raise community college taxes here a few years ago
i guess that goes along with the general idea that the federal government was expending so much money on defense that the program now is
fees that fund these things i guess that's trickled down to the states
the states don't have enough money
they must charge fees
i'm not too sure of that reasoning
i guess to get back to the main topic i don't know whether i pay too much taxes
i travel extensively in europe and see enormous
people pay a great deal in taxes
there they tell me they
some states they pay
in germany or in england in some cases people in my income level at least allege that they pay up to fifty-five percent of their gross income in taxes
i can believe that
i'm not too sure when i put my property tax in my car tax my income tax and these myriad of
some sort of an airport departure tax a sales tax which is getting to quite high levels
i guarantee you'd be paying a lot more in taxes if the democrats had more say
what's happened here is
i feel that in the last ten years my taxes have gone up
i pay
None
everybody is
that's been a republican government for the last ten years
what they've been able to do is slow down the rate of increase
to keep it from becoming even more obnoxious
this has been really interesting
i've enjoyed our talk
we just say good-bye
that's it
i think life
i grew up on a farm
i grew up in
at that time i was in a trenton new jersey
it was a suburb of trenton
i really had mixture of suburb
i see little bit different
i think though it was much slower and much more self-contained
i work in a high school
i'm comparing my life when i was in high school thirty years ago to what i see these children doing
the pressures on the children
it's true they are so much greater
unreal by comparison
i cannot believe what they're doing academically the demands on them
i can see why children do drop out
i can see the
i can remember as a child nobody ever worried about me wondering out at night and going where i wanted to go
it didn't occur to nobody to worry that anything would happen to me
you didn't have to lock your door
a lo-
it's a lot different all though i guess twenty years a go now in this area things were similar because twenty years ago
twenty-five years ago is when we had the washington riots
it reminded me of that
twenty years ago
i use to have to go over to patterson when those riots were going on
i don't know though
it's kind of hard to really know because of
though the news media had those riots kind of blown up out of proportion
i went there many times
i never saw a riot
i lived right downtown
it is interesting
they're different kind of dangers that face young people now and social pressures
the kinds of diseases that you've got out the
the consequences is
i think the other thing is that we have taken some rather drastic turns in our education and the way we approach things as of maybe starting back when i'm number one and worrying about self and not seeing the consequences of the disintegration of the family
there have been many things that have happened that have not encouraged closeness of families and support for young people the kind of support that they need
if you don't have some kind of basic believe or something down inside of you
then it's very difficult to have anything to turn to
when you've got something facing you like that
i also being involved in the school system see so many of the problem children coming from their parents children who will lie and cheat
you approach their parents
their parents are constantly justify them rather then to
they're constantly
you can see exactly
you as a teacher can't hold a child accountable
you can't make up in a classroom of one hour a day
you get mixed signals
it's not always the school's systems
i see some flickers of good directions turning
whether they're soon enough and fast enough i don't know
of course life is a lot more complicated too in ways
with farming being so mechanized
people working on the family farm which was a traditional american way that becomes less and less likely
factory jobs are so much more sophisticated
the kinds of knowledge that
it's requiring an increasingly sophisticated labor force
you worry when
there's so many people on the lower end of those who are going to be the drop outs and the poor and the homeless and whatnot
the sex and drugs on the young children and the unborn children
in terms of what it's going to mean to a society
it just is almost overwhelming sometimes when you think
of the jobs that is out there to be done
it sure is
not that i really think that they were perfect ten twenty or thirty years ago
as mother i use to think sometimes it's not so much the kids
to try to keep all wash done and all the things done and everything
and all the things demanded of the mother too
i look at my mother's life
she didn't work
for a long time when i was very young she didn't drive
she learned to drive i think when i was a teenager
her life was a lot simpler
i sit here
right children's lives were simpler because mother was there
when there's nobody there
i always thought too that people worrying about going to work when their children are little
i think that's sad if they have to because they miss so much
i believed after having a few teenagers that the worst time you could
it's that you are there when they need you
i find working in a high school is very helpful because it let's me be a little more tolerant and understanding of what people do
it keeps me from being the old fogy
at the same time
that's the same
where home
that helps a lot
it does
he opted to go into a day care center where she could have her children with her
and looked a long time before she found one that was laid back enough so she would be able to interact with them
i
good kind of experience as well
that is so true
it's not that the children always say something
every once in awhile they'll come up and make a comment
you realize it's important that
yet we have to make that choice
what was your name again
your name was
i think probably that we've just about
i enjoyed talking with you
when they were little we did lots of reading and playing and going to parks
i had two boys
we would go to the football field and set off model rockets
my children are swimmers
as they were growing up much of our normal life outside of school and everything revolved around their swimming
in order to have a reason for being there especially as they got older i became involved in it too
we were always together at their meets
that's good
mine were not terribly sporting
they both did t-ball and soccer in grade school
neither one of them carried on the sports after that
the boys tried those
they did go in
they started swimming when they were seven and eight
they really loved it
they're swimming both c-
the other will continue to swim in college
they're fortunate
they even made nationals
that's great
we would drive up to see that whenever it was reasonably close
we did a lot of things
we tried to do things both together and individually with the children
we would always go in for the museums
that's always a big thing
one of my children is also a musician
one of the things that we did with him a lot was to go
my other child is big into tropical fish
our whole family we take family trips to different places to visit or go to fish shows
my goodness
we didn't have any avid activities like that
they were interested in a lot of things
nothing to quite that depth i guess
we would
my goodness
we did go to things like aquariums and
our vacations have always been as they've gotten older
as they got older we tried to pattern our vacations where we would travel and do things
and that there would be a feature each day
one summer we went up to new england
we went to the marble quarries up there
so we did try
of course we learned too
i don't know
i started working half-time when they were at the nursery school
i started working part-time when they were in junior high school and high school
now i worked in the school system
now i work a full school day
that leaves me off on holidays and summers
it was a
i think they need you in different ways
it's not quite so much the hand-holding and peanut butter and jelly making
that's for sure
do you have any feelings as to the trends that you see
it lo-
i don't think it needs to be the mothers
i think it would be nice if some of the parents would be around for a few more hours
when they
my mother and i have talked about it how important it was when i came home from school
there were always things that just tumbled out
granted the child doesn't always think that they're sharing it
when it's not there they miss it
i also think that's at least in my experience truer of girls than boys
i realize that
it's funny
occasionally they do
you want
when they do there's a reason for it that they're sharing it
i've wanted to be available when for some reason they were bouncing something off of me
it was
if my husband
what would they do
it's been interesting particularly i think because the society in which we live families are separated
i grew up in a situation where on weekends we were always visiting relatives
i did too
we were close to my maternal grandparents just a few miles
and close enough to visit my paternal grandparents quite often
we're
i grew up with
it was sort of an italian family
my children
although we have some relatives in the area that we see we
when my kids were quite small
we lived close to both sets of grandparents
they saw them a lot
they don't have any cousins
they didn't
their cousins are about ten years younger
they never played together or anything
there are only two of them
they didn't live in the same town
i just sort of think yeah
the trend of families and time
where parents are spending less time you don't have the families to take up the gap
the kids in some ways are suffering a little bit in that the family issues that get discussed
we try to do it as well as we can
cousins and aunts and uncles
we do
although it's not the same we are
that's part of i think teaching too is what a family is like
then how do they pattern their own
everyone makes it's own model
it seems that there should be some continuity
it's helpful to have things that become family traditions and that sort of thing
we have had this tradition that we always go out before christmas and cut our own tree
that's always been a little bit of a tradition that we've had
this was one thing that we weren't able to do this year
we did that from the time the children were young enough to realize what it was until our older son went away to college
that's the kind of thing that they will remember though
we have advent calendars still
from the time that they came to
it was a christmas tree that had a little trinket for each day
then you took it off and put it on the tree
at the end you had a decorated tree
ours is
it finally got moth-eaten
a friend of mine from denmark hand appliqu3ed one for each child
they look today as new as they did when she gave them to us
there's a ring
you buy a present
i see
you wrap the present up
the presents have gone from the days when they were very young to a little box of band-aids and an eraser and things
today where sometimes i put a little gift occasionally a christmas tree decoration which they will save for their future
pieces of candy
i think as they're getting in college i just
i'm sure he appreciated that
for my older boy that was in college i put a dollar bill for each day which was the equivalent it was the equivalent of a christmas present
it was fun
that's a tradition
those will be passed on to them when they get married and leave
you were saying what other trends are there
one just occurred to me because i was editing a book about it recently
that is the trend in a lot of lower class areas for the grandmothers to be raising the children
as i said living in an area of washington d c
we definitely see this
it's that grandmother figure not only raising her own children but raising children from the streets too frequently
we had a sociologist at the center where i work who was writing a book on multigeneration
matriarchies
where the tradition in the family has been for a teenaged daughter to have a baby while she's still living at home with the mother
this is a si-
this is in fact
we've been studying this in our school that this is one of the symptoms or not the symptoms
myrna how do you get your news
most of it is from the radio
we usually watch the local news and the national news both
i find that
i read a lot for school
i find i have no patience to really read a newspaper because i'm reading so much all the time
i really enjoy just sitting down and watching a news broadcast
you can always get up and leave that
that's true
i just don't seem to have time to sit down and read the paper
it's already time for the news to come on
it's so much easier to sit there
besides i can be doing other things and still listen to the news
i agree
a lot of times i eat while i'm watching the news
is there any
what did you think about the coverage over in the persian gulf
it
for a while when we were really interested we saw it all the time
the special reports and the extended news coverage i thought was really good
you could always find some channel that had something on
you didn't necessarily have to watch the same thing all the time
i noticed that one thing that t i did they do have television monitors stationed throughout our buildings
they used to have a program called t news and just updates of different things that were going on within t i
when all the mess in the persian gulf came about they started carrying c n n
now they have had so much good response from this
that's great
we can always run upstairs and
get a quickie update on what's going on if we really want to
if you have a break in the middle of the day you take a coffee break you can always stay informed
i've found that when i don't have cable television anymore when i moved went back to graduate school i just didn't have the money to rent a cable t v line or whatever
i don't get c n n which was a big disappointment
sometimes i teach in the evening
i'll miss the evening news
you could always catch a good news program at eight o'clock or nine o'clock on c n n
i think that really has changed the way i look at the news
we just don't have it available out there where we are
when we did have it that's what we usually watched
sometimes we'd watch the weather stations
that's same
when i had it i watched it religiously for half an hour
you could go on to do what else you wanted to do
i find i read very little
i don't even get a regular newspaper because i don't drive that much
i find i spend so little time in the car that i don't really listen to the radio
television is my main new source
i get that too because i'm in a van pool
i'm in the van two hours a day
in the morning i try to sleep because it's dark thirty
in the afternoon i try to read
i can not pay attention to what our driver is doing
i'm in the baltimore washington area
i know they do van pool a lot here from some of the outer areas
if you want a nicer home beyond the suburbs
are you in baltimore itself
i am right outside baltimore
i go to a campus of the university of maryland that is just less than a mile from my house
i'm actually in baltimore
no
in d c area
her husband is in the navy
he's stationed at bethesda
that's a really nice area bethesda area
it's funny
there is a big difference in things like property values
the closer you get to washingt- d c the more expensive it is
the different slant
washington it really is an international city where baltimore is hometown baltimore
there's really
i'd rather have baltimore with the home town atmosphere
i like it a little bit better too
it's interesting though to meet different populations
being from pittsburgh originally
i find that really interesting to imagine
here is somebody that was in china two years ago when all that was going on in beijing
that's an interesting perspective
i really
much like the hometown area
i think that also goes
you can watch different news
i really do watch baltimore news
that really makes
i don't really bother with the washington station because it's so far removed from what i'm interested in
most of what they're talking about in washington is the
it was just a big thing recently
they had to impose a curfew in two of the areas in the washington suburbs
they've gotten rid of that really bad mayor and then brought in
then came a woman that's
that's good
she has good national ties
she also was something like a state auditor or something like that before this position
she left that to get a position with the democratic party
now she ran for mayor
fiscally she's pretty tight she's cleaning house
it looks like hopefully she'll do a nice job for washington which is
from what i pick up on the news it's a difficult process to get rid of a bad mayor
i know both of my kids didn't want to live anywhere around the downtown areas
i can't remember where the other one lives
germantown is a nice area
they might be car pooling too
now i think he carpools
he's got fairly regular hours since he came back
now they have probably been carpooling together in fact
she had been called back up active duty
she was supposed to have gotten out of active duty as of last friday
i haven't talked to them this weekend
she was
she had called and left a message on our recorder
i had that from all my kids except for one
that's good
i guess we should stop now
i thank you for calling
so do i
i really enjoyed it
it's so funny when you live in one part of the country you only see that perspective
it's interesting to see the wider world
i enjoy it
hey thanks a lot and bye
i do not know
you have heard about dallas
the crime here is pretty bad
rome is pretty small
we hear a lot about new york city
i am afraid to go down there because you hear about people getting mugged
it is stripped when you come back
that is probably enough to see
are you in college right now
i work for the air force
there is a base up here
that's interesting concept
they minimize the access
even so we had a
we had some people come in and attack one of the planes because they were protesting
dallas
we lived in minneapolis
dallas is pretty
we live in north dallas which is near a suburb called plano
we are out of the city
it is bad everywhere in terms of the handgun situation the number of rapes the number of muggings
just it is
it is pretty scary
people put bars on their windows in certain neighborhoods
they call them ornamental grates
they are still bars
i do not know
the jails are crowded
i am not a criminal justice specialist
i do not know what can be done
i do not know
like when i went home
i went home
we were watching t v
this thing came on where a group of five or six guys went and filmed themselves beating up people in the street and robbing them
it was really disgusting
my mom was like they should just be all shot right now
you he-
like that girl in new york that got beat up by
i think they were early twenties
so they weren't
were they obviously poor or depri-
i say s-
how deprived could they be if they had a camcorder
that is one big thing down here
they have
they are not all young
they are eighteen to twenty-four some of the young men and women
you can see the crime stoppers ads on television
they are
sometimes it is the same people that have been observed
they still can't catch them
you are wondering how we lived in minneapolis and wisconsin
there was all kind of
i know it is getting worse
i do not know what the world is or is not
in a small town in wisconsin near madison a young boy somehow got a hold of a shotgun
the child had
they said that he was twelve years old
he had not displayed any tendencies deviant or disturbed or whatever
you are thinking to yourself
you must
i think t v is bad because they show all sorts of violence on
i do not think a lot of parents
i do not know how it is in the air force base
i just do not think a lot of people because of the economy both need to work
they do not talk to their kids and take them out
and are not there all the time
the kids are off to their own devices a lot
i sure knew as heck when i was growing up that my parents were
i was the subordinate
None
i do not know i think today a lot of parents are ruled by their kids
when you go to a restaurant and kids are running all over the place they
they are not learning how to boundaries
i see it in work place too sometimes
you sound a little bit
i am in my thirties
i see even people that work with me that are ten years younger
that they kind of have an attitude that
that's just what it is
i see that too in the air force
a lot of
people outside the air force doing engineering get paid a lot more than we do
all the young engineers are i am just going
i am like you are the one who signed up
the air force is one of the better military experiences
that is
i am
they pay for my college
that's
at least the air force is
i do not know i am nervous in dallas
i go to an aerobics class or something
seventy women in a jazzercise class in a public parks and rec building
you are supposed to feel safe
then there are all these
does not matter race
it is an inter racial mix
you see these guys standing there watching you jump around in your
i do not even think that way
you just think to yourself
nobody can think that it can't happen to them
where they are at
you never know who is watching either
did you
we went to new orleans for four days and came back late last night driving
it is about seven hours
that is a very
in terms of the french quarter all of the things you hear about
the crime is so bad there
how to carry your wallet
i would hate to be there during mardi gras
when we came back i do not know if you have seen
on the cover of time magazine there is a girl she is in boston
college freshman college coed
it just
she looked anguished
it was really just sad
did not pick it up and read it
i should have
i just looked at the picture and thought what a world
i do not
i do not have any cure
it is really scary
we lease out a really nice two story town home in north dallas
they have a real big thing here
people even dry cleaners knock on the door and are soliciting
None
my husband is the kind of guy he's sometime
i think sometimes it is just he and i are very different in terms of that
i basically have started not to trust anybody in general street smarts
he opened the door
i was real upset
i probably got more nasty
i just said howard
my god
i would not
you
people
it is not a reason
i have been to new york
it is not any worse
i used to work for a mortgage company that was owned by
i know i never felt
i have been to downtown new york city
i have been to downtown boston
i never felt any safer on milk street in boston staying at the meridian
i never felt any safer there than i did in any other city i have been in
i would say one thing
do not deny yourself the new york experience but go with people that you know
i do not know
i guess i could go on and on about what to do about criminals
i think our justice system needs to be stricter because they do it
they get out in a couple of years it seems like
are the new york
are they paroling like murderers
here it is just a real big deal
they are out doing it again
i do not know because i am not real up on a lot of news things
you just hear about that
you are like why are they repeating
you think i can remember i have not been out of school that long
it has been at least ten years
you think to yourself was it that bad back then
is it just
is it just that more people think there is excitement in it you know
people that may have been close to the edge just go over because they see something or read something
there was a case of a couple of kids fifteen year olds
they picked on this kid who was new in town
they were like no one was going to miss him anyway
it like
that is horrible
isn't it something
i am originally from pittsburgh pennsylvania
i have a niece and nephew
i just
it is just i think kids get too much too fast
in atlanta where my inlaws live they had that thing the high top sneakers
for the sneakers
the jackets the team like the raiders and the caps
stealing the hundred dollar jackets
it is i guess it goes from the most petty like that to like what you were saying that in boston
it seems crime is turning into a pastime instead of be
what do you think
the major cause it seems up here is exc-
it's kind of hard for me to tell what would happen if i lived in some of the valleys inland
the major cause here is the car pollution
car pollution seems to be the one and only thing that i can really put my finger on here
that isn't the same in the washington area because we don't have any major industry except for government and services
the transportation situation is such that all the car pollution is absolutely awful
also the hub of three airports
in this general area there is national dulles and then baltimore washington
interestingly some of the information i've been reading indicates that the amount of air pollution from airplanes is extraordinary
that's always something that you don't think about
most people talk about the noise pollution from airplanes rather than the air pollution
the
i guess it talked about all types of pollution
i happen to just read something the other day at least in the boston paper there were three things that come to note
now they've located an expanding one in the northern hemisphere
i'm quite concerned
i don't think it's involved any longer with hair sprays or those th-
i think now from what i understand it's air conditioning units
i do quite a bit of business in washington
what it's like here
is the un-
i guess refrigerators
solutions to this
improved
i guess to me the first thing is i wish society would get as upset about this as you do get getting people upset about animal rights
this is so basic
in terms of demanding it's just not caused
demanding that we can spend so much money on certain things but that research really be directed toward improvement of polluting vehicles and not just cars but also buses planes that something can be done i can't imagine that
i th-
i think that it can be done simply because we've
no lead gas came to the pumps
that's been done
there's the lead pollution that problem essentially i guess because it was at crisis proportions was licked
i think that there are solutions
that for buses
certainly we don't even need a research anymore
passing the law depends on how heavy the automobile lobby is
and also to make it economically feasible
and also in buses
yeah
that
the smell is awful
i was reading the other day not to go on with this but that
i guess you're
even of course in the longer term just to get away from fossil fuels
i'm thinking of research in that direction rather than
we've taken the intermediate step
i don't think
we up here in new england where i've
practically a guerilla war up here
my daughters marched against the seabrook
i kind of
my feelings were that we needed this bridge to jump from fossil fuel to whatever it was going to be
unfortunately though i think the oil companies have lied to us for years
we really don't know whether there's enough fossil fuel left
there isn't
None
with the pollution issue fossil fuel is not the way to go anyway
you've got to look elsewhere
it is something that's a little frightening
in fact i
i have two sons
the other will be going in september
we just feel that when we leave this area we're going north not south
i like the mentality north
i also like the fresher air up there
that's the way we will be going
i'd be interested in having spoken with somebody also from the far west on this issue to see how their attitudes are
since texas and louisiana and california in that ranking order the worst pollutants in america
i read that the other day
louisiana for a small state it was amazing
it's the industrial pollution i should imagine
california seems to be taking steps
you read about the fairly stiff laws they put in on cars now they're enforcing
again that didn't occur without a crisis
even california was notorious for its smog years ago
the greatest thing that happened to pollution in the last couple of years as far as i'm concerned is the no smoking rules
it really is a pleasure for me although i guess smokers don't
that's personal air pollution
that was its most personal pollution that i can think of
i definitely advance that
listen i enjoyed speaking with you
let's hope there are other people that feel the same way
my mother's side of the family was quite large at one time
back early on they used to rotate them to different people's houses
were they all in dallas
no
this was i am actually from mississippi
it was around there generally
that's where the family grew
it was not only in mississippi in some other places
it was a big deal
they tried to centralize it in one spot
in the past couple of years they had it at a state park every year
we rent a pavilion
that's usually works out to be pretty good
they will rent a pavilion on a weekend
in fact this past sunday was the reunion
i did not get to go
i have
just the distance involved
just not
i
it's kind of hard to
i am going to hopefully next year get to go back cause a lot of the family on my mother's side has not seen my daughter
is your mother still living
you go back and visit with her anyway
either way there was family reunion time
right i usually see her a
that's no big thing
i do enjoy the reunions
the only problem is that now originally when we had them they were mainly
brothers and sisters
it was a large reunion of that group from that descendants
a lot of those people have
at time they all knew one another
now it has gotten that a lot of those people have died off
what we are left with is the relatives of that group
it's not quite as close as it used to be
i think people feel less of a desire to really go
why do you think that it's less close than it used to be
i just think at that ti-
those were all brothers and sisters a lot
they were all in the same geographical location
back around in the twenties and thirties when they were growing up they were all located together
when time went on the family grew and moved away and so forth
say the kids of those people who are not anywhere near one another i do not think they feel
that's just how it is
my mother was complaining last year about th-
is that family's lack of priority anymore maybe
i think that's just
i have
i
it's just the way i think society is now is that we do not have the extensive family we used to
it's more of a
None
as opposed to the extended family of people that we may or may not remember or know very well
it really makes an effort to
it requires a lot of effort to do that sort of thing
i used to enjoy going
i still do kind of enjoy it
it's not as many people there that i really enjoy seeing
i
no
in that
then again i have some aunts that i do
i feel closer to them because i kind of grew up with them
generally when i was growing up a lot of those people the only time i ever saw them was at the reunion
you do not really feel
in my father's family we get together
they had chosen santa barbara california for this summer and did not get enough people that were willing to go that far
because most of us live either in the midwest or in the texas oklahoma area
we have a family letter
it usually goes through me twice a year
what you do is take out the last letter you wrote that's on the bottom and put your new letter on the top
that's the way it's kept in order
you are kind of
i said let's start this letter
it just never
that's as far as
we are going in a couple of weeks to the next one in scottsdale arizona
we are real glad we got together because since that time there were only one sister and one sister-in-law of the original family left
the sister-in-law died
the sister is in a nursing home
we are glad that we took that opportunity two years ago
since i initiated the call i guess i'll start off first
number one i have absolutely no problem with random testing
i feel
i really don't have a problem with it
i've never
my husband works
they do have that at his place of employment
neither of us have a problem with it
we've particularly like you said with the things that the airlines and such
it's a scary thing to know that you just don't know what people are doing before they go to work
the advertisements on television lately have been so
there have been so many
there's just about
train wrecks and things like that
i happen to be
even in our field we have people that are in very high risk jobs
we at the present time do not have random testing
i am pushing towards that
i honestly feel if people have nothing to hide they shouldn't have a problem with it
if they are trying to hide something then i have to know that because we're talking major liabilities
i really
they're talking about sports and sports personalities and all this stuff that i would much prefer having doctors and airline pilots tested
i have a real fear
that at some point something's going to happen
they're showing it with aids
why
they ought to start doing something with the drugs
i really have no problem with it
it's unfortunate i think that everyone doesn't have that opinion
i've heard some people just talking in our group of friends that they just feel it's an invasion of privacy and things like that
in the long run it seems to me it's kind of like what they keep talking about the aids testing with doctors or dentists and things and how that
those kind of things i'd like to know
i've had a lot of dental work done
the last dentist didn't even use gloves at all
that kind of
that kind of thing really kind of concerns me
that scares me because if that's the way they are
you would think so
that is because
i worked for a dentist
that's
you come in contact with a lot of blood and things like that
it's real real dangerous
i would think
with all the accidents just with everything happening with
just because they don't know what their pilot's been doing and things like that
where you're located i do know texas instruments has random drug testing
i think they've had it for several years
they're program they had i don't think had a lot of problems associated with it
my brother-in-law happens to work there
it sounded very positive
i think it's great
i would encourage it
if they do find someone who is having a problem with drugs
as opposed to just letting the problem go on without any support
a lot of people seems like obviously are trying to hide that from their employer and friends and family and things
too many people are just dying
the crime rate here is just astronomical
ours is changing
None
it's unbelievable what's going on and the selling of drugs
it's just too loose
i just got a piece of paper the other day that now they have these
i have two very little children under two i got a piece of paper from my husband's office
it's talking about these drug tattoos now that they have got
it looks like a sticker
it's for kid
you said that you live in coppell
what is your house like
that's neat
brick and
our side
that's kind of neat that you can even though it's a duplex you can still buy
our home is really too small for us right now
at the time we just had a little baby that was five months old we moved into this house in garland
it's in one of the older areas of town one thing i really like is it has big trees everywhere lots of shade and squirrels and birds and real pretty
the house is real small it has less than a thousand square feet yeah
now i have a daughter
the one that was five months old is seven years old i have another one that's three and a half and have all these clothes and
they advertised it as a three bedroom house because it has a built on addition room the room that's built on doesn't have a closet the people that lived here before us did use it for a bedroom we have always just put our computer and extra toys and books and it's kind of a catch all room
it sure is nice to have it when the kids come over to play
i'm thankful i have two girls because they're in bunk beds
they can share a room and make for more space that way
how old's the youngest
right now we have their clothes on double racks in the closet we made a higher and a lower it works out fine
they're just about to get too tall
where the dresses are beginning to drag
we're going to have to figure out a new idea
we're kind of looking around and wanting to move into a bigger home hoping to be able to do that within a year or so that would be nice
it's a wonderful place to live
i don't really know
they say that we have wonderful schools
i think i've heard a lot about coppell schools that they're real good that's neat
do you hope to have children
are you not planning on having any
do you have any pets
of course those are my kids i have two dogs
do they stay inside
that's neat
what are the colors in your house
kind of a mauve and gray
i bet that's pretty
the kitchen's kind of a country pink and country blue
it's all done in cows
that's neat
yeah our house was redo-
it was redone before we moved in which
it was redone at the time probably when earth tones were in everything is the carpet's kind of a tan and brown and has paneling in the living room and lots of tans and lots of browns the good thing is you can bring out other colors from that that's worked out good
in the kitchen they put real pretty blue and tan wallpaper had done it up with blues
that's nice
sounds pretty
it's close to my oldest daughter's school that makes it really handy too she really likes her school
we are so close to shopping
i've always imagined it kind of away from everything
that's nice
now we have that new mall in lewisville that's just a mile or two from our house when we first moved to coppell we didn't even have a grocery store now we have four
yeah it does sound like it's definitely growing
very much
i moved down here from chicago what twenty-three years ago to lewisville coppell's now about the size that lewisville was when when i moved down here
i see
when we first moved here we moved here from lubbock we almost moved to lewisville
that was our second choice behind garland
at the time we thought we might buy a mobile home
do you have an opinion on credit cards
i do
what do you think about them
i just got it about six months ago i find that it makes it a lot easier to get things that you generally wouldn't get
you don't stop to realize that
pretty soon you owe a hundred dollars
you don't stop to think about it
i got in trouble when i was in the service quite a few years ago ten to fifteen thousand dollars in trouble
my goodness
i eventually got it all paid
i never use them unless i need to
they
i made a rule with myself when i got one that if i couldn't pay it in full every month that i'd have to rip it up
interest rates aren't none too shallow these days anyway
i know a lot of people that get in trouble with them especially
we have a bunch of college kids around here going to tech
they seem to get in trouble with them a lot
i have a couple friends too that have about three of them maxed out
they can't do anything but work to try to pay them off
one of my friends hers is up to nine hundred dollars
she only earns like two hundred dollars a month because she's going to school
that's just enough to pay rent and buy like
i guess you have to pay twenty dollars each month is the all she's paying is interest on hers every month
it just seems crazy to me
my wife got in trouble one time with hers
she was making forty-five dollars a month i think
fifteen dollars of it was because she was over the limit
fifteen dollars of it was interest
she was only paying in it fifteen dollars a month
we sat down and talked about it and discussed it
it's come out pretty good
we kind of discussed that a little bit and shot that idea down right quick
i don't know
i think they're too readily accessible there's too many companies out there that are willing to give them to you and get you trapped
you can always file bankruptcy to get out of it
that's a lot of pain and hassle
in the olden days when my parents were growing up and we couldn't afford everything we didn't have such things as credit cards
we had all the necessities
i think if cards were as stringent as say a home mortgage loan or something like that where you have to be able to prove that you can afford this and the rest of your bills we probably wouldn't have the problems we have
i guess they trade one for the other
they still trade one for the other
that's good
i'm twenty right now
just going to school
it does kind of get in the
last weekend was homecoming
i needed a pair of shoes
i just went out and bought them
do you just have two kids
we have a eighteen year old seventeen year old and a seven year old
are you
right now i'm out in provo utah going to b y u
this is a extra long one
they must not have too much traffic on saturdays
fifteen or twenty i guess
i get calls at work
that's an idea that's been kicked around for a long time
i don't know that it's ever been seriously considered as far as close to passing any legislation or anything like that
i believe israel does that don't they for their
i think so
everybody has to do something
maybe theirs is in fact one year of military service for everyone
i don't think it's n-
it couldn't be
the military used to do it
the idea that
country would benefit from one year from everybody and even out the
for kids in high school it could be in the summertime
that's a thought
it could even be done while they're doing a job to make money
people would have to be convinced that
i think the basic message is that giving is better than receiving
that's not the kind of society we have right now
anything like this that came up whether it
at least it's my opinion that most of those involve adults
adults who have the time to give and the desire to give
it's not
maybe it cou-
it should be if it's not
i suspect that that's not the thing that they don't feel it's open to them
it's just that they are more self-centered if you will and not considering
some high schools have actually started a visitation program to less advantaged areas
they promote service on the part of the kids to some of those people
at least that's a step in the right direction i guess
now i don't know it di-
i think you're right that that's not the way that the society these days is going
i think we need to try to figure out some way to turn that around that everybody
it's really unfortunate because
i have gone to work for american heart and just recently for the leukemia society
there's no question that doing that kind of service you get a lot more out of it than the people involved
it's really a gift to yourself
i think that's a really important lesson to learn
maybe that's why we have so many people in society who are not really happy
that could be
it really is better to give then to receive
i agree with that
None
it certainly seems to me that in the last twenty-three years things have definitely gone towards very much the concentration on self and loss of perspective in terms
what was the last car repair you had
it was getting rusty
the thing that they forgot to do was to also look at the hose
i had gone about two days with my new radiator flushed
the hose burst
i was stranded out on the highway
i didn't do that thank goodness
there seemed to be enough antifreeze left to do that
it cost me all kind of money to have that repaired after they said they were going to they had repaired it
that was a horrible experience just recently
i guess it's been awhile for me
i had the water pump break on my car
i was traveling
i was going on my way home from thanksgiving it broke like in the middle of nowhere
i had to get it towed and then fixed
big pain
i know
i know living in dallas
we've got bumper to bumper eight lanes of traffic
that was horrible
to have the
my car is getting old
it's about six years old now
i got it right out of college
it's starting to show the wear and tear now
when i cross that one i'll be okay
that was my graduation present to myself
that's nice
gosh it's really starting to wear
i've been thinking especially now is a good time to buy a car
i don't know if i want to pay all these repairs now to start getting it fixed when it's starting to breakdown
it's not worth it
i don't know
i need to have it tuned up and replace some of the belts
i was looking at the
i was thinking just a lot of money
i'm like that's the last major purchase for this thing
you have to in pennsylvania boy
especially don't you have what a lot of salt on the ground
you got to clean out the underneath of your car all the time when you get a chance
rust and the body too
i've been pretty lucky there
go like that
if something goes wrong i know who to blame
i think i'm getting too old for all that
i had four brothers
they used to drag me out underneath the car and stuff
i can do all that stuff
i think i'd much prefer to pay the twenty-two ninety-five to go have it done now
i can get my hands dirty
i'm just getting to that age i guess
working on the car is just not one of those things i want to spend my time on anymore
i'm trying to
i wouldn't have to worry about which car was going to run
that's nice
it became a hassle trying to keep up and maintain both of them
i think i got rid of the wrong one
i need a lot of repairs done on this one
that was something else
are our five minutes up
this must be a hard category
i guess
unless you're big do-it-yourselfer to fix up your own cars things like that
i guess they were talking about experiences
i did
i do know something about the really cold weather
i've always lived down here in the south
i took my car up there to their house
i guess i had a crack in the block
when i got up there the car
all right
i'm going
where are you calling from
i'm calling from provo utah
i'm from plano texas
you are from plano
her husband is the new director of admissions at university of texas at dallas
where's your favorite place to go
generally we just go on family vacations to arizona
mainly just being with family is it
my grandparents have a pool
we go swimming
we keep cool just by going swimming
it's fun to be with my cousins
i'm going to go for almost two weeks this winter
my goodness
actually i lived there
i was there longer
two weeks is the longest vacation i'll have ever taken there
i'm kind of looking forward to that one
i think i would like to go to arizona
i was in phoenix last january
it was rainy and icky
i would like to go to tempe
do you travel a lot
some yeah
i was a travel agent
i have been up until just a few months ago
i'm thinking of going back to work
you know a lot of good vacation spots
i know a lot of good places to go
you definitely need to go to hawaii
i'd like to take him there
he's traveled all over the united states
i haven't
i haven't been down south
where do you live
i live in yakima washington
it's cold and rainy today
we've had some pretty nice weather
that's a pretty good deal
do you go to school in provo utah
my goodness
i am my only b-
i'm my best customer
maybe the rejuvenating cream is the only other thing i would use
i use the celltrex
my gosh
we're supposed to be talking about places to go
you have not been to europe
actually since i grew up in texas i've only been here about two years and have gone skiing about five times each season
you are going to school
pretty down there
i said i do like to ski
where have you skied
it's kind of nice being up here just because it's all a vacation in itself when you get to go
you're a sophomore
just
don't be in any hurry
i'm not
that was just
i could have had that or a down payment on a new car
i took the trip
it was great
i traveled with a group of sixteen other students
actually there was two other graduating seniors besides myself
we just had a ball
six weeks
you should think about doing something like that
she was there all winter semester
do you have a pet
and two fish
what do you have
my husband
we have a black labrador
to me he belongs up in the farm
because we finally negotiated that i was losing my mind he sleeps in the laundry room
he goes out for the day
this is a beautiful dog
he is wonderful with our little girls
he's comes from a purebred line
there's nothing you could say bad about him except that i was more of a cat or a small dog person that you could sit in the chair and cuddle
this is huge
course when he runs around the yard he just digs
he does
the worst part that i had with him was when he was about eight months old
i did not know what to expect from a dog having not had one
i left him in the kitchen with the little baby gates up while i was gone for about an hour
i came home
he had ripped my wallpaper off my wall
my word
it was in the floor
i just about lost it
i called
i said come home and get your dog
he said puppies just chew when they're nervous and i wish you had told me
it was about eight months later he ate a piece of the linoleum
i didn't kn-
the tile in the kitchen and picked a hole in it
the last thing he did was when i had sat out a whole lot of begonias in the backyard he dug them all up and brought them to the porch
i told my husband
i said it's either me or the dog
he looked at me like
every night when he comes home from work he hugs it and talks to him
he's a good dog
it's one of those things i'm just having to get used to
that's why i laughed when they called with the topic
i thought boy do i have a pet
i grew up with cats
i'm very comfortable
i had to have her put to sleep last june
i started to say then you broke your heart
it was awful
she just sat there on my lap
she just waited
it was awful
her hair
the bad thing was though she would pee in my husband's shoes
she just liked his shoes
he'd have these hundred dollar shoes
it was just bad
my closet
it was something
that's awful
it was terrible
once she did it then she wouldn't
anyway i
i would bar the closet doors
and would clean the carpets
dear it was just awful
now does your cat sleep in the house
they are house cats
i have two cats right now
of course
my fourteen year old son has an extra pillow on his bed just for the cat
the cat doesn't destruct does it
it doesn't do anything
no i'm not going to have a dog
they both got ran over
were just my kids' friends
they would go with me when i would go running
the last one got hit as she was following one of my sons across the road to the school
that is
it's too heartbreaking
they do dig up
they just wreck things
i'm not a dog person
i'm not either
it's just been
it's just one of those concessions
i kind of ignore him
today's the first cold we've had in texas
it's really cold and drizzly
it's freezing people are doing their fires
i brought him in because he's just a wet mess out there
he's in the laundry room with this little carpet square
he's just huddled up like if you'll be nice to me i won't make
my daughters both have hamsters
i
how old are your girls
i gave in at christmas
they keep their cages real clean
they just sleep and eat bits of apple and carrots and
i don't want to answer
i've got incoming calls
i don't know why calling
i hate to cut it off
we'll just wait
they'll cut us off pretty soon
it's somebody calling for my kids
it's my son
i've tried to start a fish tank i keep losing all my fish
they've statewide raises
they raise ours it seems constantly
we just passed a new one
we had passed a provisional one that if they did locate here we would raise our taxes
at least we thought we'd get something back from that
how do you feel about taxes
it seems like a big politics game
up here last year the governor was up for re-election
he said the budget was fine
right after he won the election he said we owed a lot of money
they raised all our taxes
now it's election time again
they're trying to lower them
they're just talk about lowering them
they never do
actually they're going to here because they didn't have a budget for so long
they raised the tax rate real high for the last three months of this year
they're going to lower it for next year
i'll see
i feel like the middle class people are supporting the nation and that the rich are not paying their share
of course the poor can't afford it either
i really feel like
i feel like
i get tired of supporting the whole country
i'm middle class barely
i don't think the rich are paying not enough
if you're in the three percent bracket and they take a third of your check every month that's ridiculous
i don't know many rich that don't have enough tax breaks to
i'm talking about the really rich
they should just tax everybody the same amount no matter what you make
i'll go along with that
i think that would be fair
i
no ifs ands and buts
no big elaborate laws that call for a lot of enforcement or a lot of review
it's just you make this you pay ten percent
they have not gotten it
you withhold no matter what you do
you ought to be saving up some every month to make up for all what they should be taking out
now when you sign your w-two whatever that is then they always say do you want a extra amount for state
it's been that way for the last probably ten years
you come down to the end of the year
you don't have it to give it to them
if you have a lot of federal deduction it ends up hurting you state wise
you end up owing
you're going to owe fifteen hundred in state
it's just ridiculous
i don't know
they just came up with a twenty-five percent increase on personal property in oklahoma county and that is a chunk
i guess i've always been kind of interested in space and stuff
read a lot of the astronomy books and stuff like that
have you been following the progress of the space health code
to a degree
i haven't kept up as much as i would like
i've just been so busy
i think it's pretty exciting that they can
it would be interesting to see if they can find other planets that will be more habitable to humans
yeah
i think i would be very interested in space travel in the future if it is at all possible
i wouldn't even mind being a pilot on one
right now
i'm probably getting a little too old for that
they just made leaps and jumps
i think a lot of our technology we have is quite a bit due to lot of the space travel equipment and stuff that
i agree
as a matter of fact we're the ones that i have been to houston to visit the space center out there
one of the big advances that we use every day now is velcro that vacuum little space program was one of the big backers of that
it's amazing
i don't know if you ever watch gallagher
i've seen him before
he talks a lot on velcro
what would we do without it
we were talking about that just the other day
there's a lot of little things that have come up
i know maybe some of the big things that
i don't know
it's also just i've often pictured in my mind what would you find if you just kept on going
i guess our minds are so finite when we try and picture the universe as an infinite object
it's hard to see
i always thought what do you do hit a brick wall eventually
that is something that would be hard to think about
something that is infinite and just incomprehensible
yeah
i would like to see them do more in that area to make space travel more something that the ordinary person can enjoy
i think it's in people's nature to be the first to do something
i'd love to be the first one to step on a planet or some like
i think it's in everyone's nature to some degree to want to get out and explore something they haven't
or experience something indifferent
i think that's what made us progress to the state we are is our curiosity
there must be some better way of doing this
a better place to be or whatever
you are always looking for something better
i know at work people always complain to me
you are always whining
it's i'm always looking for something better
if you are just content with being with the way things are then then you must lead a pretty dull life
they are always finding easier ways
just because they don't talk about it or something like that
they are doing it unconsciously
i guess you don't really think about it too much
it's a subconscious thing
somewhere they can sit down and write down what things that you've improved upon
you just don't think about them
i think
we've gotten different programs at work to make it visible to management that we are doing things better
how many credit cards do you have
i think i'm down to one
my gosh
how do you use your credit card
do you just keep it in reserve
i
the way i'd like to try and use it is you make your purchases at prime buying time you pay that off and don't use it until it's paid off
that's my ideal way
how do you use it
i use it
yeah that's understandable
my car had a major problem seven hundred dollars
things just come up
you just never get to use it the way you'd really like to
actually i do have quite a few more credit cards than you have
i use them
my american express i use for gas things like that
i pay that off monthly
some other credit cards like store credit cards i do have them up there a little bit
living in this area i live fifteen miles west of washington d c it's a very expensive area
sometimes you have no other choice if you need to buy something
i know i was up in there and a lot of credit cards
i was just starting to get to where it was getting me in trouble we just disposed of them paid them off and got out of it
that was good that you had the opportunity to do that
are you married that you both you and your wife use a credit card
now we pretty much just pay cash for as much as we can there
our only credit card is sears
i have that for automotive purposes
well that's great
everyone i know here uses credit cards like they're going out of business
it's just too easy basically just get yourself in trouble with those
i have a diner's club where i work that i use because i travel some
i use that
i don't really have to worry about that because i only use it for business
i automatically have the money to pay it off
i wouldn't mind getting back into one if they would
they just keep wanting you to increase your limit if i can get one that'll keep my limit at five hundred i can never go over that or something then that's fine
eventually get's up there to ten thousand whatever fifty thousand
i don't know
i guess we've kind of exhausted this topic
what can you
you don't like them
i guess they don't care if we end it early
hopefully you have a good thanksgiving
maybe we'll talk again
bye now
how do you feel about capital punishment
i'm not certain that it does a lot of good that it ends up effectively avoiding a lot of the crimes that have capital penalties
yet on the other hand i don't know
there is things that
seems like it's the right thing to do
a serial killer or somebody goes in and machine guns fifty children in a school yard
i have the same dilemma i think
it seems right sometimes
other times you don't know
people
the arab societies and stuff end up having
they're extremely severe
i think to a certain degree the reason that it doesn't serve as a deterrent may be because you never know if it's going to be applied right
like in arab societies if you get caught stealing they chop off your hand
you walk around the rest of your life with one hand
everybody knows exactly what for
here with our court system and ways of sort of screwing it around and stuff you can kind of always count on the fact
there is a good chance you're going to get off
also it doesn't seem like it does that many harm
sure their life is taken
they'd spend the rest of their life in jail anyway
i think sometimes they'd prefer just to get it over with
it's more of the easy way out than making them pay
except that the average cost
it's
on the other hand i don't know if that is that serious that they're really never going to be out of jail
then again also you can't bring back lives that have been taken anyway
it's
it seems that by
doesn't ever really
i know
you can't
taking one more life doesn't get things back the way they were right
i really don't know
where are you calling from
right now i'm in utah
i'm from plano texas
i see
what are the laws like in texas
texas is one of the s-
i guess there is more and more states that are going back to capital punishment
texas has had it for a while
once it was reallowed
i think it was outlawed for a while by the supreme court or the interpretation of the constitution
it seems like everybody stopped
once they sort of reallowed it texas was one of the first to actually implement it again
they do it by lethal injection
i'm originally from kansas
in kansas also they almost immediately put back capital punishment
there they do it by hanging
still they have
i still remember the movie in cold blood
have you seen the movie
they do it that way
they show it
the movie was made in like nineteen sixty-two or something like that it's not particularly graphic
on the other hand it's fairly impressive to watch them walk into the room with gallows
i think that capital punishment is in utah also
i think they d-
a long time ago i think that they do it by like a bunch of men have guns
one of them has the real gun in it
has a
they don't know who killed
the rest of them have blanks
i certainly wouldn't want to be the executioner
i've always said that if i had to kill and clean and do my own meat i think i'd become a vegetarian
as long as you're sort of safely removed from it it seems not so bad i guess
what kind of car would i want to buy
the question is would i want to buy
would i probably actually
if you had all the money in the world or something
in that case i don't know
my dream car for years was a porsche turbo
i don't know if i'd want one of those now
of course i would want one if somebody was given to me
i maybe would buy a b m w
or even a volvo
i've got a dodge daytona
i have
we just bought another used car a couple weeks ago actually
what car do you drive
mine is a honda accord
it's funny because after i bought it i was doing a lot of business traveling
some of the cars that i got were like the toyota camry and the nissan maxima and some of the competitors i don't like them as well except it wasn't really a fair comparison because those were automatics
mine is a standard the reason i got a standard was because i thought it handled a lot better it had a lot more pickup and everything
you get a little more control over when it's doing the things it's doing
what rental agent did you go to to rent those kind of cars
usually avis
we have corporate contracts with the various companies it depends on your destination too
which is how i heard about this
i don't know
i would probably if i were to buy a car with the constraints of real money i probably would go with something like a honda accord
one thing i really liked about the dodge daytona is the fact that they have this seven year warranty
it really saved us some big money once
it did
my gosh
they had a whole bunch of things that sort of broke at the same time
i had to pay twenty five for the
that was great
usually something breaks
it's excluded
i see
we bought the extension at the time we bought it it was like four hundred and twenty-five dollars or something extra
you got your money's worth
we really debated at the beginning
of course i'm glad i did it
we still have three years left on it
i've been lucky
mine hasn't had any trouble except last week a shopping cart crashed into it i was real lucky because it just hit the lens to the light
that was good
it cost me twenty-five bucks to replace that
the store will pay for it anyway
if you were going to buy a new car would you buy another accord
i probably wouldn't just because i already have one if i had to make the choice again i'm perfectly happy with what i decided although we did just buy another car
that's a legend it's a used one my husband has really wanted one for a long time
the fact that this car that i have has performed so well
before that i also had an accord
it was a real old one i bought that used
it served me real well too
he's been impressed with all the honda cars
she drives a is it legend it's a
she's liked it
i have never had
we only had one car for a long time
yet most of our usage of the car was just this little shuttle back and forth
i bought a used yugo just to be a little car that i could care less about
it's worked
that's exactly what it is
it's a cheap little car just to go run around town in it's actually kind of fun to drive
getting back in the daytona now i almost don't like it it's too mushy
it's an automatic
it's too
that's what my husband thinks about my car now that he's had the legend it's windy
the steering you feel like you're in a boat or something
i don't like it
it's so
what kind of home repair work have you done
done a little repair on the shingles on the roof recently
been pulling them up or just loosening them until the rain came in
i'm right
plano's just north of dallas there are parts of downtown or near downtown dallas that are under water right now i guess
you're probably about halfway across the state from san antonio though aren't you
we're north and about eighty to a hundred miles south of the oklahoma line i guess
you're still getting a good bit of the rain though
we did have a little bit of rain yesterday
i suppose that means i should be getting up there to look at that shingle
i had something else planned today
i guess i'll let it go awhile
they're wood shake
as a matter of fact we've never had a leak actually yet
just before we took possession of it we had a fellow go up there and do whatever needed to be done on the shingles
i've just recently had to start looking at it myself
it's a small problem so far
i guess you just have to keep on top of it
we're in campus apartment buildings with flat top
then you don't have to do too much with it
it's pretty steep
parts of it are steeper than others
i imagine
remember to yell geronimo
have you been
was the house reasonably new
you been doing some remodeling work on it
they say that when the house is fifteen it's already old
just take good care of it
the main thing that we've had with this house recently has been some squirming i call it of the foundation
we're just on a concrete slab the soil right under this is a clay
it
depending on it's moisture content it either swells up or shrinks
of course the soil right under the slab retains it's moisture a lot longer during the dry season you have to water the foundation to keep your foundation from drooping anytime there's a change in the weather like the temperature drastic changes in temperature or in moisture you get little spider web cracks all around windows and doors
that sounds like a lot of fun
usually what you do is just wait until you think it's stopped
you patch them up
what is it stucco walls or
it's all drywall i think with yeah
somehow or other that does manage to show these little cracks
i remember my parents home is drywalled almost like a small grade stucco type plastering over the drywall to give it a textured sort of a look
made for kind of a hard shell on the drywall
that would be terribly exasperating to have the slab floor like that swelling and giving like that
the previous owner had a major problem with it because probably a variety of things
the only thing i've had lately is my kids got all these barbie
it takes them less than a day
they're broken in one way or another
i don't know if that's just kids or if that's
i don't think they're unduly rough
maybe they are
a lot of the little barbie sets
they're easily lost and easily broken
my daughter is twenty-one now
it's been a while since we've had barbie things
it's been a while since they've gone through the barbie stuff
we did have barbies and things
seems to me that became a craze when she was already third fourth fifth grade
she wasn't in it for very long before she was out of it
i don't remember her breaking a lot of stuff
don't remember her breaking
i also don't remember lots of little pieces
that's one thing they've got
camping on the beach and all of these come with tiny tiny little plates and little sunglasses
my three and a half year old has wanted this ken doll
i finally got her a ken doll
less than a week later the arm was broken
they were real good about replacing it
i guess if they'll replace them then they assume they shouldn't have broken
those little arms are supposed to twist almost any way
and she's not that big of a girl that i think could really
the main thing that they had when my daughter was playing with barbies was just clothes
that was about it
the barbie doll itself is usually pretty durable and that kind of stuff
the main thing my kids seem to be into nowadays are electronics
my children are twenty-one and twenty-five and twenty-eight
is that right
do you see that there's a big problem with electronic things
we haven't had that much problem with things that we have bought
they seem to last
in fact when they offer us extended warranties we don't buy them because
it seems like it's just an added tack on
a lot of the credit cards now will guarantee
if you purchase on your credit card then they put an extended warranty on it if it doesn't work or if you have a problem with it in a certain period of time
it seems like it's a waste of money
you almost assume if you're going to have problems with it it's usually before that warranty would expire
on a recliner once i bought an extended warranty for cleaning and stuff like that
i never used it
you never even needed it
it seems ridiculous
we don't even have a repairman come
it means it's old enough that it's time to replace the whole thing
None
when we first married we bought one on our t v
after the first five years
it was ridiculous
they charge you a pretty good price for them too
you're trying to think maybe i'll need this
you always think gosh if i say no then i won't
my husband finally just put his foot down
he said we're not going to buy any of these anymore
if it goes out
we really have been fairly happy with things
we take good care of things
we don't run out and buy a lot of things either
since our kids aren't little anymore i'm not buying a lot of those little things
you probably are real careful of the brands you buy
when you do buy things you
you look at the consumer guide
you go around
you look at the different ones and find the ones that have the
what do you think about child care
i'd wind up
too many kids and i think too many infections and things coming in
i'm sure there's some good ones
i just
i don't think that i would
i took cammy to a
some ways i didn't
i think the ratio of kids to teacher is really important
i think they had two teachers
i think there were twenty kids
i only had her going two days
most of the other kids were going more days
that was probably my own fault that she didn't
one thing i noticed is just they were trying to teach her to write her name
i didn't notice it until this summer when i was working with her that she would bend her wrist all the way not in a natural form
she did
i was kind of mad that they had never noticed that and either pointed it out to me or tried to say look you're holding your
she was
i hadn't worked with her on writing at all at that point
it was last year
then this summer i got the thing from the school that says things to work with the kids on
i w-
they'd never picked it out though
just never said anything
maybe that was
one thing that's kind of different too though a preschool than taking a infant
i think it's hard to take kids to somebody you don't know unless you have awfully good
reliable people
i think it's hard to leave them
they usually adapt pretty well
it is i think just hard to leave them because nobody will give them the kind of care their own
you know kind of their schedules
you know if they're upset and that type of a deal
i don't know how people that have young kids working work full time do it really without being stressed out all the time
i think it's
then on the other hand i think it's harder to stay home in some
at the end of the day your house still feels like it's a mess
you haven't got anything done
what am i going to fix for supper
the work never ends
it doesn't
probably people that take them to preschools and day-cares full time
they would probably just feel different
i just think it would be hard to do that full time
is everything okay
None
donna you said you have three children
what kinds of activities do you spend with them
we have an eleven year old an eight year old and a three year old
he spends time doing that with him planning and practicing outside
he's a real sports kind of person
he plays tennis with the kids
the baby plays in the playground
we do a lot of things with the kids on the computer
we watch a little t v together
my kids have a nintendo which they play
my husband sometimes joins them with that
my little girl jennifer likes to do crafty things
i'll take some time and do that with her
of course we always read a bedtime story at night
even the older kids sometimes sit down and will join in and listen to a story
once in a while he'll read the story to little one
that's basically my job
do you find it difficult to find time
is it pretty natural
it is hard because at the end of your day you want time for yourself it
that's kind of cutting into your time
with the kids getting older now on the weekends they get to the bed like at ten which really is late
on school nights the two older ones get to bed about nine
now this weekend we'll have a baby-sitter come
my husband and i will go out to dinner and come home probably not too late
you have to be a very unselfish person to spend a lot of time with your kids i think
last year i had a little part time job in a private high school tutoring high school students with learning disabilities
even just those two days just seemed like it was a lot
people that can do it all
with three kids and laundry and keeping the house the way i want it kept it is hard
that's another thing
i'll take one of the kids with me grocery shopping usually on the weekend
that's kind of a special time for just myself and my little girl or myself and my son
they'll be my helper
they'll get to pick out some of those favorite snacks that they get to pick out
it's
of course they have a pretty busy social calendar too
you fit it in with all that
what do you feel are the current trends in the way families spend time in general in america
i think a lot of people set their kids in front of the t v and h b o and rent movies and
kind of leave them to their own means
i think it's very easy to fall into that trap
i'm not
i think different parts of the country
that's good
None
families are facing a challenge
we're thinking about having children sometime in the next couple of years
it's very hard because when you get used to two salaries it's very hard to cut back to one
if you have the type of job
she can pick her hours
that's a great career
she has such a flexible schedule
it's very hard to spend time with the children and your husband and do everything at once
i do feel like it's important that you make the time for children because
i think it's a big responsibility
you do have to give things up
i personally feel that it is extremely important to be with your own child at least for the first two years of their lives if you
we have two and another one on the way
you have got young children then
we do
we have a six year old
our baby will be a year on monday
my goodness
i don't think we really even want to find out
we have got two boys and a girl also
we have got two boys and a girl
does it
maybe you will get lucky and get a girl this time
we kind of like our boys though too
our boys he is in graduate school at a and m
my goodness
the navy is sending him for his masters in ocean engineering we have got another boy that is out in maryland
he is a wildlife biologist
our girl is thirteen
we have got still all sorts of good activities since
you kind of got a span there
what do you do with your seventh grader
she is into a little bit of everything
she loves riding horses
she goes out riding as much
just she knows people that does
does she
she is into
she plays the flute in the band and
she is into this odyssey of the mind thing which takes a lot of time for
that is where the kind of
it is a program for advanced kids
i taught school for six years
i do know about that program
my wife is involved
she kind of heads that up for these kids
last year they got the state level
they got one local and one region
they got a new mix of kids this time
it keeps them busy
uh-huh
does she go actually out into a different classroom with other kids that are involved in this
yes
they have
you probably know a peace group
i think that this happens to be
None
how neat
as
you will get to different levels
they like to both boy things
we do not have any real
we don't really ski
yeah
we have done that
in fact he just goes right out here
we have got quite a bit of snow
you are welcome to keep that
i grew up in wisconsin
i had plenty of snow
when i was a kid
we have lived here about seventeen years
we use to take all of the kids tobogganing and ice skating and all of that kind of stuff it is fun really
i don't care if i ever see any
i don't care if i ever see it
keep it off of here
i don't mind it
the winter gets long
i get ready that
it is too early yet
we do
come about march it gets a lot nicer
out oldest son when
you probably more up on this subject than i am
the roles that women have played in the last couple of generations
they've entered the work force more since world war two is when they started
i think that that is very significant that the percentage of the work force today consists of such a high percent of women
where i've noticed it more i think is
i have traveled most of my life
i know just especially in the last ten years and really since
as far as boarding planes and driving cars and calling on customers
even in our industry there was virtually really and truly no women as far as selling the type of things i sell
even in the last five or six years boy we see more and more women being involved
it's a credit to them as far as how they're doing
you see more of them leaving their children in the care of their husbands while they do travel too
i have a club that i belong to on tuesday that
one of the girls travels quite extensively
she says my children have two parents
why not
i think that's a change
i think that's a change you're going to be seeing more of in the future people having that kind of attitude that the father's going to take more active role in child rearing
i think it's the age old thing
every once in a while you read in the newspaper or you'll see it on t v or something where the discussion comes out that women are paid less than men
they're doing the same or carrying the same job responsibility that's a very true statement
it shouldn't be that way
that i think will change in the near future also
i hope so
there's still an inequality in the work forces or jobs
it's
i've
you hear some people say
he's a man
he needs that salary
also i think a good argument for that is in the area of politics
a woman congressman i'm sure makes as much as a man congressman and the same as a senator or whatever
they certainly deserve it all the way
i guess just the most significant thing changed for me again as i mentioned was just in traveling
you see more and more ladies of all ages with briefcases and in their business suits and going
i expect you're right in regards to having two parents now
that's a good statement
i think if
in the future it's even going to be more noticeable and more significant
i think it will be
i
another thing i read too the other day
how much they're out there i guess is
the car designers are starting to design cars with women in mind because in the past the male bought the cars
now they're showing that fifty-five percent of women are actually making the new car purchases
and that they are looking for different things in the car
the man is looking in the engine
the woman is looking to how easy can she slide in under the steering wheel
can her makeup come off the upholstery
if they're out there buying that many cars then there's that many out that are self sufficient and mobile and working
my wife's always worked
when i first started my business
hers was the only income we had for three or four months
she certainly did her part in help getting me establishing in my business
she still works everyday
enjoying it
i work at medical treatment center which is at jupiter and arapaho
trying to think what else i can say in
i'm kind of out of things
you see the old cigarette ads about you've come a long way
you think about this when it comes to a subject like that
it's really true
None
i have a i b m p c myself
i'm probably eventually going to get a three eighty-six
mostly word processing applications and just as a dumb terminal
i think eventually i'll start using it for spreadsheets and things like that
what do you find that you use yours mostly for
i do a lot of word processing and spreadsheets and data base
about the only thing
i'm just starting to get into a little bit more communications now
i'll be able to send and receive faxes right over there without using
are you using windows
i think i'm planning on moving up getting a three eighty-six before i move up to windows although i do like the graphical user environment
it's getting to be more and more like a macintosh
i just want it more for multi tasking which i suppose is also like a macintosh
the one thing i used to use a
i used to use just an apple two e which of course looks pretty primitive now
i don't have any real programming capabilities on my mac right now
i don't have any compilers i'm
do you use your computer for just things around the house or in the
what do you do
i do consultation and testing of various kinds for english as a second language programs
do these programs
are they based on a other language
are they based
a lot of the english as a second language classes will have people from all sorts of parts of the world
the teacher just tries to teach english through natural understanding
that's the kind of thing i'm working with exactly
you seem to be better informed than the average person on that
it was just when i was high school i worked for the community school
they had a english second language class
it always seemed strange to me that all these people that spoke english not too well and spoke a variety of different languages were all being taught at the same time
i imagine it's a lot harder on a computer because you don't have as many cues
you don't have hand gestures and things like that
now we
most of the stuff that i do is not interactive i use it for data analysis on testing
to see how well they retain the vocabulary and things like that
actually just item analysis statistical analysis of the tests
when you write a test you have to look at some data from it and see how the different questions are performing and find out which ones are discriminating well and which ones aren't find out how reliable the test is
it's involves a lot of spreadsheet use
what were you doing when you were using an apple two e
i was doing some of the same stuff but doing it more slowly
it's amazing how in the general user community the expectations have just grown so much
i remember my first computer was a t r s eighty with four k on it then i started playing with apples
those had forty-eight
if they were really great they had sixty-four k
the original apple had forty-eight i guess didn't it
i know that in my school they had a bunch that had sixteen k on them is all
i remember that there was one game that i played that required forty-eight k
there was only one computer that had forty-eight k on it at the time
it's just so amazing that generally if you
i know i b m you buy a megabyte at a time
that's the low end
the s p thirty goes up to eight i haven't upgraded it quite that far yet
i think probably when i get system seven i may have to do that and get possibly another hard disk
i camp at least one weekend
during the summer we camp two or three weeks a year
that sounds good
do you have a lot mountains
you don't have mountains in texas do you
we do a lot of canoeing when we go camping we also carry all our equipment with us we canoe down the river and then
sleep on the river on one of the sand bars and then get up the next morning cook our breakfast and go down the river again
my word
that sounds adventuresome
i've done i would say quite a bit of camping mostly with my husband and i
we have five children
we have found that camping with the little ones isn't as enjoyable as just when we go ourselves
we've tried to get out once a year and go on a anniversary camp out
we have gone up into the mountains and not necessarily roughed it
we have just found it just real enjoyable to be alone up in the mountains
that's good
our boys are old enough now
they're involved in the scouting
they do a lot of camping with the scouts
this year they'll both be going
that's been real enjoyable for them
what kind of camping do they like best
do they cook on stoves
actually i remember they have taken the heavy cast iron dutch ovens and done their cooking there over the fire
i don't think they've taken the stoves
last year they camped in tents
this year i believe they will be in tents also
lots of times we don't even take tents
is that right
what does that consist of
it's just a piece of material that has a lot of places where you can tie off to it and make it into a tent like a
we use them when we go backpacking
we go backpacking fifteen or twenty miles then
they're not very heavy you carry them with you
they'll keep you dry or whatever
when we go camping here
i like to sleep on the air matresses
i like to sleep on the matresses
have you had any encounters with wild animals or anything like that
in fact last month we went camping
we saw a lot of deer in the morning and the afternoon just deer everywhere
even though it wasn't hunting season
we were with boy scouts
of course we don't want to go hunting
we got to see a lot of deer out and about
one thing that is a big concern in the evening at night is make sure that all the food's put away and so forth because we have armadillos
they're covered with a heavy armor type stuff
and possums and raccoons
we have those creatures down here that they like to go hunting for a midnight snack
that can be a problem if you don't put all your equipment away
they won't necessarily attack a human or bite you or anything
most time they run away from you if they see you're up
my word
that sounds a little less fierce than bears
we want to
i listen to christian music a lot because there's a christian music station here in in our city
i listen to it quite a bit
i listen cause on friday nights they have what they call saturday night alive
on friday night and saturday night they have christian rock and roll
they have that type of music
they just have different words i listen to that too
at least your
i like rap music
i can tell we're together here
we'll have to i have a lot of friends that like country music
do you listen to that really heavy metal stuff
i'm more into older rock like the psychedelic era like late sixties seventies greatful dead crosby stills and nash
you have never heard of the christian music that i listen to probably
i've heard a little bit of it
have you heard
i've heard of striper
the only one i can uh-huh
they're the really the heavy metal stuff i guess
the first of amy grant before became more mainstream top forty
cause she plays both secular and christian
she's real good
i like her
i like randy travis i like more of the real new ones
garth brooks
he's fine
i don't care for the older the dog left me stuff
i don't even really know who she is
None
actually i just went to see the greatful dead i guess about a week ago
aren't they done with
they are still on tour
i just thought that they done broke up and left
in fact there are people that basically just follow them around from city to city on tour selling tie dye and things like that
they are on up there in age aren't they
they're like late forties early fifties
whenever one of them dies off they get a replacement
they seem to have a really bad time with keyboard players
they keep on replacing them
the new ones in this thirties
they look pretty rough
i've seen picture of them
they just
it looked like leather day at the geriatric
they just
yuck looking
it just just looked like they
are you into that rock music all that druggy stuff and all that
they come on the stage
you
they don't even know they are there
actually i prefer my performers to be pretty sober just so if they're jamming that they don't just lose themselves and go into lala land
i just don't like
have you seen any concerts lately
do you think our politicians are honest at this point in time
my personal opinion is that the politicians are out for their own good because they're entrenched
i agree with both of those things
do you see any way of like altering it so that they would become more honest
i think by putting term limitations on you could slow down some of the problems
it has to be not just at the national level but at the state and the local level too
i don't know which ones
they've been in office since the nineteen forties i
they've never had a job
they've never gone out in the real world and paid normal taxes
they don't they get paid a hundred and twenty-five grand a year
i'm going like i don't understand how they're supposed to be my servants and yet they're paid more than i am they work less than i do
the only problem i see with term limitations is that i think that the bureaucracy in our government as is with most governments is just so complex that there is a learning curve and that you can't just send someone off to washington and expect his first day to be an effective congress person
i think there's a lot they need to learn when you get there
i think that's true
that's true of the presidency too
we seem to be able to get along with the president turnover ever eight years or four years
there is a lot to learn
maybe it will keep them on their toes and a little bit more active in trying to catch up
i think it would have to be extended
you would increase the length of each term of a congressman
maybe standardizing on a four year term for congress senate and the presidency and then staggering them so that you don't
the other thing that bothers me about our system is just that in congress the amount of power any particular congress critter has is based on their seniority and how long they've been there
it's for
unless you have actual across the board limitations the idea of
we're
i'm just going to vote against the incumbent every time doesn't work
it's going to wind up hurting your state if all the other states aren't doing it at the same time
i think that that's true
you have the same abuse of power on the flip side of that coin
the c i a is moving out to west virginia which is a really stupid location for a large agency like that and for almost any agency
the action isn't in west virginia
i hate to tell the senator from west virginia this information
it really doesn't
the world does not revolve around west virginia as far as this country is concerned
the world does revolve around d c as far as the politics in this country are concerned the national politics
the c i a is a very large very high profile agency and to have it located out in west virginia
yeah
it might only be two hour drive from here but that's a two hour drive i think it's a mistake to move large agencies like that is it the f b i
i think there's
l-
i don't see why it makes a big difference the c i a because officially they don't have any operations within the united states other than administrative
we all know that that's not necessarily true
i think that there are advantages to having seniority or not having a complete turnover every some small number of years
i think there's an institutional memory that you need to maintain
i think that with all the perks that we've given them
i heard on the radio back a few weeks ago during the incidents where they aren't paying their restaurant bills
they're bouncing checks all over the place one of the radio stations over here listed off every single one of the perks
we have
we haven't done whole lot of it lately
i'm kind of a sailor
i was in florida
we don't get to do a whole lot of that up here
we have lake sam rayburn out here and lake nacogdoches
we do a lot of boating on
you got some lakes around you can do that on
our
it was heavy when we were there though
not too many no
no
we went and had a kind of a picnic in the woods type thing
i had a boat last summer that i took out a catamaran that i did a lot of sailing on and stuff
my parents are pretty big sailors too
all we have up here mostly bass boats
i guess fishing's a pretty big thing
lot of fishing going on up here
where about in texas is that
it's
what major city is nearby
that's south or
that sounds pretty good
it's gets cold at night and then warm in the afternoons
probably eighties in the afternoon
that's pretty temperate
have you done any other boating then
i hadn't done any lately
that's all
i used to have a friend that his daddy owned a boat shop
when i was in high school we used to go boating every day just about
that's great
we had a different boat every day
that's fantastic
i used to kind of be that way myself when i lived in north western florida in the panhandle
i'd go to work
especially if you get a pretty fast boat
those catamarans are pretty fast
if you get one like that do have somebody teach you that
they just
actually i've known how to sail pretty much my whole life
my family's pretty into it i took sailing lessons when i was about six
None
it's kind of a thing where you get the hang of it after a while just kind of get a feel for the wind and how it works and the physics behind it
it's not too bad
some people are more motorboaters which is fine
that's about all we have
lot of people don't see the excitement in sailing
then again they may never have tried anything like catamaran that's when you really start getting into speed
some catamarans you can actually pull people behind the skiers
they get so fast
that would be something
i haven't personally done that
the races
i work with a guy right now that
he's got a good
what lake do you all use
he's from detroit he usually goes on one of the great lakes i think and does his sailing
for me i go back to orlando
there's a lot of places there you can go
that's a good thing
what do you do for a job
i build transformers
they have a worldwide
all we do here is make transformers electronics and stuff like that
no doubt
that's about as far as
oklahoma's nothing like it
that's good because i didn't like oklahoma that well
what kind of luck you been having with buying and returning products
not too bad really
i had a razor that i got from christmas that i really didn't want it
i got it anyway
it was a braun
they were real good about taking it back
i was able to get that back pretty easily
i don't know
it's the
i'm almost pushing it myself
it shrinks too much
i should have known better
i bought it from g i joe's it was probably made in china by slaves
they
most of the time i get pretty good stuff
i think that aside from the fact all markets being internationalized if you want to buy american
i was reading something in consumer reports tonight about that as a matter of fact
they were talking about cars
and about how you'd like to buy an american car maybe
the transmission may be made in japan or whatever
i've got an eighty-six ford ranger
i know for a fact that the transmission is made by mitsubishi
it's like what are you going to do
that's the way it is
i personally feel that if the japanese cars are better and americans buy them that's the way it goes
people more than manufacturers should get a clue
they should start making quality products
the days of don't buy a car made on a monday or a friday are pretty much going away
they've got all the cars rated
essentially i don't see much of a trend
just like every other time that you look at it the honda accords and the civics are right up there
there's nothing wrong with them and the same thing with most of the other japanese cars
again you look at a ford or especially a chevy
they're pieces of junk
that's eighty-six through ninety-one
i don't know
maybe they're getting better
maybe they're starting to get a clue
they got a three year lead time
technology that comes in right now is probably not going to be implemented until quite a few years down the road
because technology is so volatile and changing all the time
can you think of any other industry where in software they
maybe i say you paid five hundred bucks for this program so send us twenty and we'll give you a really great upgrade
they keep up with it pretty quickly
that's a real good thing i guess
i don't know
all the chips that make up the hardware are a commodity
the macintosh is about the only one that's going right forcing i b m and the rest of the d o s world to follow along
they're kind of the leaders right now
i used to see all those commercials for windows
you're like
gee they're reselling a macintosh under a different name
yeah
almost is the key word there too because i've used both
i really don't see an advantage of windows at all
yeah it's only an advantage for people who had to use pure d o s
yeah that's true too
i don't know
i've gotten a little bit out of the personal computer business just because i don't have one at home
i do use a mac at work
i really don't do much with it at home
they're ones were
growling consumer need to worry about the mac they're getting
if you bought a power book straight off a lot of them had to go back
you sound like you must work in the computer business
i have a machine at home
i belong to the user's group
i've been a mac fanatic since they came out
technically i'm not actually in the industry
that's all right
it's sort of like surfing on the wave of future shock to keep up with the changes as they happen
something that i find uncomfortable is you want to buy something say you want to buy a personal computer
you got to think about what kind of memory you want to get and what kind of technology that you want to go for
let's take the example the modem for
what baud rate do you get
it used to be that you get a twelve hundred ba-
how do you feel about the crime in your city
is it
minneapolis isn't too bad
i know that there's been some increases in crime lately in terms of murders
that's kind of gone up in scale
i personally had a little experience the other day
somebody broke my passenger window
when you look at minneapolis as compared to where i used to live it's really quite a bit better
because i came from florida
in orlando crime is getting to be a bigger problem than ever
here the real problems are the gangs
a lot of murders just in general the whole
before that we lived in colorado
in comparison to colorado it's real noticeable
i can just sense
i won't go to the grocery store at night
it's that kind of thing
we have a neighborhood watch program in the development that we live in which i think is a great way to reduce home theft burglary and things of that sort
interestingly enough right before i moved up here
i go back down in may
in orlando before i moved up we had a real problem with it
we've been broken into in my apartment about four times in like two and a half weeks
one of the things that i helped organize was a neighborhood watch type situation down there
they were just
it's one of those things where the new thing is that they operate in the daylight because everybody went to work
the houses were left unguarded
that's a good way to work it with a neighborhood watch
also i've heard that the newest thing is a lot of people are
is that right
a high percentage of free time
i think it's like fifty percent of most people's free time is spent doing yard work outdoors
they wait while you're outdoors
they just slip in
slip in slip out
i've heard that's really on the rise as far as a new type of crime
really
unfortunately it's starting to really look at people's habits and where they are at particular points of the day
one of the guys i work with really laughs when he looks at minneapolis because he's from detroit the crime level there of course is quite a bit more pronounced yeah
i'm not real sure
it helps to know your neighbors
you're supposed to make lists of cars
i know a lot of my neighbors right around my development if i see a car that's unfamiliar we have a list
is that what you did in your program where you have a list of license plates
i was basically involved in that in the organization of it
i left right in the middle of it
that whole thing of being alert and kind of noticing your surroundings noticing people who look suspicious activities like that sure
you hate to be paranoid
there are really only so many things you can do
you can have the house alarm neighborhood watch program as a woman not go out at night you can do that which is what i choose to do
one of the frustrating things about that is that you really are limited even if you know that the threat is there it's against the law to set traps
it's against the law to do a lot of things
they could basically
it's not
there was a case about two years ago where a guy knew he was going to get robbed
essentially what he had done is set a electrocution trap for the burglar in his own home
sure enough he fell into the trap and was severely burned
he was severely burned
he took the guy to court and won a settlement
that makes you think
it's like your hands are very much tied
i think if you had a handgun though in other words it wasn't premeditated you had a handgun it's the middle of the night someone's down-
i've had three boys through i guess some child care each one of them
now they're in school
it's all over
i guess i would say it's not easy to find what most parents would want
i can profit by this because i'm due with my first in about three months
i guess the only rule i can think of is that i like to look for places with good respectable nonprofit behind them like a university or a hospital or something like that
i think it's sort of the opposite of what you would want when you buy a car or refrigerator something
the child care center
i felt confident that they'd do right
don't everybody kind of use them for guinea pigs for their pet theories or some such thing
actual experiments they would have to get your permission
i suppose if there is a psychology department or an education department around you might find that they're pushing one form of education or another
they
the thing i really worry about is the sexual abuse cases you read about
you'd just feel awful if something like that happened
i never really worried too much about that the case with my boys
i think those things get into the headlines immediately when somebody finds out about them
i don't think it's as common as the newspapers would make you believe
another thing is cost
in some cases they're finding it's just not worth it to work because it's all going out in daycare
in our case we made the decision that my wife would stay home until the boys were in school
i'm really happy we did it although it was very very difficult
i think it was the right thing to do
we just decided that we would do it
we went ahead
not everybody can make that choice
even though my wife wasn't working we did have one or another of the boys in child care just for part of the day or a couple of days a week just so that other things could get done around the house and so on
we did look around
i would always trust her judgment on that
i'm just thanking heaven
he just got a new job
i'm just grateful that we don't have to worry so much about my working or not
do it as long you can
i think you have to look through a place
you have to get a feel for how they treat the kids and what kind of staff members they have and how much turnover they have and things like that before you commit your child to them
the main thing is that you have to determine that they're perfectly open that you're welcome anytime without notice in the middle of the day and so forth
if they're at all queasy about that then i'd look elsewhere
you have other friends that have kids being taken care of in child care
i have one
i haven't really had a chance to talk to her about that for a while
i really think the news reports tend to sensationalize the problems
i think the problems are more ones of cost and resources and pay and exhaustion and
things like that rather than these really wild abuse cases that you read about because it make good copy
i think the court systems could stand some improvement
trial by jury is good
a lot of cases is circumstantial evidence that convicts a person which i don't think is all the time good because sometimes it's hard to get all the facts and to prove a person guilty if you don't really know or you don't really have an eyewitness
how can you convict somebody on circumstantial evidence is beyond me
you think if trials were held by judges or experts that they would tend not to convict people on circumstantial evidence
that's the sort of system they have
the trials are held by a panel of three or four judges who are
they're lawyers i guess
they're experts in the law
they do the questioning also
they
i think it's a lot harder to get off on technicalities also because the judge is also sort of a jury
i'm not sure i like that
what i worry about is cases where it's the government against the individual
that's true
because anytime the government is the government against the individual you need the protection of ordinary citizens
i think that's really the only thing i guess where i would like to see the system change is there ought to be a
i guess i don't think that juries need to decide sentencing all the time
i think maybe a judge is a better judge of that
sometimes the sentencing is not fair
even if the jury i guess they do decide that
i'm like you
the sentencing is really light compared to what i think they should be in a lot of cases
people who don't have day in and day out life long experience with what prison is really like and what the options are to ask them to decide for one case on one person based on what they see i think that is maybe a little bit naive
it's kind of a hanging jury atmosphere
in a lot of places i think people bend over the other way
i guess i like the system that they have in some places where the defendant goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets to choose it
some cases in some jurisdictions they can do that
that's not a bad system
i do think it needs to be shaken up a little bit
the thing is too maybe they need more of a expert types to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick joe blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever and call them in
lawyers blow sand in their eyes
putting on a act or whatever
there would be more honest settlements instead of this tugging of people's heart strings and making them cry and feel like they're doing somebody good by giving them two million dollars to make up for the pain and suffering
i think in criminal trials you need the jury as a defense against the government
i can't really say recently
i think about a year ago i bought a product from some company down in atlanta georgia
i believe it was one of these mixers these juice machines
the blade they sent me at first that went into the machine it looked perfectly okay
i found that it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting after
even despite diligent washing it got rusty after about three weeks of use
i don't think it was my fault because i had made a point of drying it off and cleaning it
it was
i had to send it back after the third week because i realized it was not
what about you
i don't have so much trouble with products as service
i'm not convinced that any of them work a hundred percent
the one i have now is okay most of the time
that's it
that's probably the worst
my daughter has a charm bracelet i bought her that's guaranteed james avery
it's a very good company that sells sterling silver things
she has a charm bracelet with lots of charms on it a lot of money into it by now the catch broke
she was sitting in school on a carpet
when she stood up it caught and broke
we took it back
they said this was just obviously yanked
they were so rude about it
we wanted a different kind of catch
she said it's not guaranteed
i said put it on because apparently nothing's guaranteed
do it anyway
we got the kind we wanted
i was really disappointed with that
i felt that this was a company that should have been more reliable i happened to need a birthday present for one of her friends
i called there to see if they had it
the lady was very nice
i said my goodness
she told me
i said i really appreciate it
it turned out she was the assistant manager
at least your talking to somebody who counts
i felt kind of good about that
they might work on that
i find attitudes are more of a problem
up here in the northeast we have these mail order companies like l l bean
they are famous for i guess having really top-notch service
they've got i have friends and family who order from them because you can literally buy something from them one year wear it for a year and a half
even after like eighteen months of reasonably satisfactory use they will accept it in any condition
they will gladly no questions asked take it back if for some bizarre reason you decide you don't want it anymore
they'll actually do things like this
they bend over backwards service wise for you
i've found also a lot of companies nowadays they have eight hundred numbers you can call
i guess if you can call up any eight hundred number directory assistance you can get the eight hundred number of the customer service support line for a number of companies
i've tried that with a few companies lately
most of them have been pretty good
i was
one reason why i buy a lot of clothing through mail order is that if you buy through bean or though
i guess one of bean's big competitors is land's end out in i guess it's wisconsin somewhere
they're very good about insur-
the customer is always right
no matter how crabby you might be over the phone they are very understanding
they ma- make sure things are set properly if you're any way dissatisfied with their merchandise
nowadays with the economy the way it is i guess
there was a story on the news tonight about how because a lot of companies are
there's a lot of
the morale among employees tends to go down and that in turn
one of the things i thought about was a lot of the drunk cases that they were having especially for repeat offenders that
a judge i think would be the most appropriate person to be able to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day
i kind of agree with that
because i think in some cases the jury may not even have
i think that in some cases that's considered to prejudice the current case a judge you're right should have the whole dossier of the criminal
if they're judged guilty would probably be in a better position to give an appropriate sentencing
i agree with you
one thing i heard was this where instead of going to the regular court they have a mock court
it's supposed to be all legal and everything
you go
you present your case
you're done with it
it's not that we have such
it didn't backlog all of the cases that are all ready pending
i
in other words not
i don't
there's a point on which we don't agree
usually it is the defendant i guess that wants to have the jury hear the case
i'm not out for streamlining things to the point where we
take that
i didn't mean that
okay
i didn't mean that no
gee whiz if i didn't have that right not to have a jury that
yes i would feel you're right that my civil rights had been violated
i meant for some when both parties agreed that yes we're going to have a judge here
we're not going to have a jury
sort of like car accidents
i think that's all ready possible
jury trial
yeah i agree that that should be encouraged
i think most lawyers do a pretty good job of making that evident to clients unless they feel they can tweak a jury into
i suspect it in cases like
we're at liberty to talk and meander as long as it's all on the same theme
in the case of
civil things i think maybe the use of the jury is very
i think that may be where jury use is overdone
there are cases where they could be settled
the lawyers are really
as possible i was wondering too if they were thinking about the judge making awards in civil cases not just sentencing in a criminal cases
i'm not so sure i'm in favor of that
i am in favor of it for criminal cases
there's a difference of my view there for those two
you can tell i haven't been in too many
i was called once when i was nineteen i was doing so many other things that they took pity on me
i was doing school and things like
they let me out
i've never had to it since
that was almost twenty years ago
that would have been about twenty years too just last year
the case i heard was a criminal case
it seemed it really
we rendered a verdict
the judge was the one to do the sentencing
i don't know if that varies from state to state or if it
i guess the topic is trial by jury and how we should change that or how we would change it
i'm ready whenever you are
what are your thoughts on the subject there
i definitely think decisions have to be unanimous
it's to easy to get a quorum simple majority won't do
even two-thirds majority it's
there's always that chance that one or two people could be playing devil's advocate for a good reason
it's definitely
i don't know
i couldn't believe they suggested that judges should be doing the sentencing
gives them a little too much power
i know of a couple of people at least who would be arguing with that or arguing against that pretty vehemently
you may be doing a guilty verdict
it may be for technical reasons
about the only good thing i would say about that is that it would hurry the process up a bit even now i know we've got plenty of cases out there where people have been wrongly convicted and things like that
that's what the trial by jury
jeez if the judge was doing it himself without any checks and balances whose to say
i tend to follow it just to know what's going on
to tell you the truth i'm not real familiar with the system of jurisprudence the way it is right now
i know a little more about civil cases than criminal cases
it's more in how you present it versus who's right
a lot of those things it's largely a matter of viewpoint
it's kind of weird
you say okay we can't bring up this point because then they're going to
it's like boy the stuff that they can twist around is
it's like the truth isn't really important anymore
then you get people who bring in cases just because they want to bring them up just because
this friend of mine's pretty obnoxious
he really gets into suing people
he'll sue just about anybody just for the chance to get into court
it's for the more general
it's
most of the time they're looking to place blame and stuff
you're from california
originally from chicago
i wonder how the civil system or the court system must differ between there and where i am in minneapolis
louisiana is completely different cause it was based on the
the rest of the country is not or something like that
fortunately i never have had to go in even for jury duty
that friend of mine's telling me that i might have to go in as a witness
we'll see what happens
there are too many big problems
there's such a backlog of court cases right now
to try to get them all in a good time
we already have too many lawyers as it is
if it's criminal cases you can't put them in jail because there's no room left
in fact they're even letting some go
i'm originally from florida
it seems like every year they let out more and more just cause they don't have room for them
that's not a good solution either
i'm kind of in favor of it for certain crimes
i think first degree murder probably warrants it
i originally come from the state that has
they're pretty liberal on it
they tend to fry people left and right
texas i saw on t v the other night has had forty-six in like the past several years
they're pretty hip on it too i guess
i don't know
that's not
on the other hand there's a lot of advantages to it
of course you have some savings in terms of taxpayer money keeping people in jail or not with florida that's a big problem because there's so many people in jail that they have to let them out every year
that's
in fact a big gubernatorial issue is the turnover rates of repeat offenders being let out and doing it again
that's a big problem
there's not a whole lot you can do about it because there's only so many jails you can build it gets to be a big problem
go ahead
be a little more
a lot of these guys they get in
they get off for good behavior
i don't know
you can almost sense that people are just laughing at the system because they figure sure i get thirty or forty years for maybe rape or something
then for
if i elicit good behavior i'm out in maybe five or ten
sure
just because like we said before they don't have enough room in the jails there's a lot of incentive for them to be let out early
if you've got the death penalty hanging over your head
i don't know
i tend to think the repeal system for the death penalty is a little too lenient
kind of takes away from the significance of the death penalty
fantastic i'm a doctoral student at the university of central florida
i don't know
it's an interesting issue
you say in texas there's been quite a few
in florida in the last few years i think there's been a lot
i can't give you figures
i think it
is that right
the forty-sixth in the last twenty-five years i think is what they gave a run down that texas tends to be a little more robust and disciplined area then
i kind of
i've heard things about that
they don't get repealed as easily as they do
the guy in california got thir- twice before he went to the gas chamber
they said no
they took him back
None
it just seemed a little inconsistent
you have two
you have these people who are serial killers that didn't even get the death sentence back when ever
i'm trying to think about other crimes that would warrant it
i guess
what's the policy now with treason
do they axe you for treason or is it a life sentence
i don't think the military doesn't execute anymore
death before the firing squad or whatever
i think about the only one is rape
our public schools are really poor i feel
i'm not sure where georgia ranks in the nation
we're toward the bottom
there's a lot of things that i see that are so obviously wrong
the system doesn't allow for the corrections
that's interesting
she has a young boy actually has two boys now but only had one when she was there
she complained quite a bit about their school system there
cobb county is better than the county i'm in
i live in orlando florida usually
the schools down there from what i know are not bad
that's great
he says the schools there are just terrible
i feel that we're way behind
i have a son that is in the fourth grade they have just now taken up division
i-
we buy these math books and fractions and multiplication division things
i feel like there are several areas that we're just really really slow in
for one thing there's not enough money in the school system
the money they do have they do not use
my son's teacher has twenty-seven students
that's certainly is a lot of students for one person to deal with on an every day
that's one thing i worry about
when you have two kids in that class that constantly keeps the class in an uproar and you're not at liberty to do something about it other than give them on campus isolation or send them to the principal's office it can really be bad
also i think we have a lot of hispanics we have a lot of
the county i'm in the minorities are mostly hispanic
we're from the county they marched in
is that right
there's very few blacks
that's
i hate to say
it's not a problem because i hate to feel like they are a problem although they are
it's
then again
it is a problem
there is no denying that
especially in the inner city
sure
you have to admit that teachers have to slow things down for people who don't understand especially if there's not a very well developed special education program at the school
you can't put all the children in special education
if the parents do not care enough to take an interest in whether the homework is done
i grew up in nebraska the school that i went to there was fantastic
i really consider myself very lucky
we had a school that had classes probably about the same size you're talking twenty-seven thirty kids to a class
your teacher had control
we zipped right along
i was doing mathematics fractions and division and multiplication by the third grade easily
i believe i was too
you're right
it really is a concern of mine because if we could afford it my son would be in private school
i was going to ask you if that was an option
i'm of the age that could have gone although i didn't
i guess looking back on it i tend to think it was mostly a mistake
on the other hand the more i learn about the history the more i see it was incremental decisions any one of which was sort of understandable at the time
on the whole i think it probably was the wrong thing to do
None
i was in the last lottery
i was glad it was over by then
we
for some of them it was just kind of not so much a holiday
ever now and then they'd go and shoot their rifles
they'd
None
that they weren't really allowed to do anything
tonight i was
helping my kid with an essay on stalin
i was thinking in the course of talking to him about it how in world war two the personalties of stalin hitler and churchill more or less defined the war
actually when you think back on the big events of the war it was almost a personal struggle among these three
with their nations pretty solidly behind each one of them
i got a feeling that some of that was involved in the early decisions of the vietnam war that the
otherwise they'd get you someplace else
i guess you can say that a certain amount of resolve and willingness to fight brought the cold war to an end
i don't think you can just fight anywhere just in order to call the bully out and beat him
i have a feeling that that's part of what was involved in the vietnamese war
we were wrong
i
like i said the more i hear about it the more i can see each decision that was made as being understandable
the accumulative effect was to really get into a hopeless situation where
as you say going halfway was probably worse than committing to a completely and winning it whatever that would mean
i think we did learn some lessons that we weren't prepared for
the other wars they seemed like a valiant thing
you knew who was good
you're not
it was a traditional battle of kind of good versus evil whichever way it is
in the vietnam war it seems like it was
the sides and the lines that were drawn are all confused as to whose good and whose bad
the
it seems like even the people
the cambodians weren't even supposed to be involved
what about the domestic effects
i was thinking that maybe the most important effect it had was to make it possible and even popular to criticize the government
that pendulum started to swing maybe even too far to the point where supporting a government decision in foreign policy was sort of optional
that tradition is still
it's dying now
it's still alive as opposed to
this desert storm stuff may have killed it
i think that was one of the biggest
that the domestic unrest
about maybe close to a year ago now i guess i helped my dad add on another bedroom on to his house
i guess that
that was fairly large undertaking
it's a bedroom and a walk-in closet and a bathroom all on one side of the house
we did it all except for the sheetrocking
that was the only thing we didn't putting the ceiling up and things like that
we weren't sure how to do that
i did all the sheetrocking
we put the roof up and did all the roofing and put all the interior walls up
that's it because you have get those joints to go together whatever you have to put in there to take the gaps out between the sheets and on the ceiling and all that
we didn't know a thing about any of that
it looked very hard to do
we figured just
we left it to somebody who does it for a living
we'd never done it
we just left it alone
my vast experience of home owner's knowledge is not very much
it's just what i have to do more or less around the house for my parents
did you framed in new square footage
was it stuff that was already enclosed
it was
you knew how to do the framing
my dad knew how to do most of it
we'd gotten a couple of books
he just started doing it
he did all the flooring himself
he put the whole floor in
i just started with the walls and the roof and started there
we put a not necessarily a garage but just a off the side of that
it's not enclosed
it's just somewhere to drive another car to park
do you build on slabs down there or did you build it up off the ground
it's off the ground
it's on about twenty-two inch piers something like that
you had those poured you did them yourself
those are
the last thing i did completely myself was an outside deck which i was pretty proud of
those are
i've done one
those are
we didn't do that way
i designed it from scratch and did a pretty good job
they're pretty forgiving
especially when you get done you've got something
you just sit down on the deck and do whatever have a barbecue
i built it two levels and with a big toy box and some benches and a backrest and all that stuff
all done by yourself
we could pour concrete and support it with a nice firm four by four posts
the rest of it i just did
a contractor friend helped me with some of the foundation work
it was pretty
that's a good size deck
it's not that expensive
i think it cost me three dollars a square foot and no less than that
cost me about six hundred dollars all together
the wood may
it got surprising as to the fact that how much wood is
to get good lumber it costs
i don't know about dallas even in this little town it's not cheap at all
i'd be surprised if it wasn't cheaper where you are
it probably does
i'm not sure
it's nothing but woods down here
when i drive through that area that's all i see is pressure treated lumber yards
i haven't
that was just when i was a kid
i don't really know what the cost of living is even in dallas anymore
i don't know we're a college town
that doesn't help us out any
gas is a dollar twelve a gallon
that's probably about what you're paying
my current project is a walkway which i'm building around the house and out to the backyard digging it out and laying sand and putting pavers on top of that
what do you think in terms of benefits
personally i think
i think that we've probably got one of the best around
besides they tend to offer adequate vacation i guess
the paid time off is wonderful
one of the things that we were just talking about as a matter of fact this week at work was the coda plan that is offered
i think that is just a fabulous one
i don't know if you participate in that or not
isn't it great
it's just a miracle how fast that adds up
i have to agree with that
i was thinking about importance of benefits and that kind of thing other than salary while i was waiting for the system to find a respondent
i started thinking that over the years that importance has changed
i suspect that that's probably true for everyone
when i was much younger it was less important to consider retirement and less important to consider medical benefits
as i grow older and my family grows the medical benefits are more important
the retirement is more important
i guess that's true
i'm still young enough that the vacation's real important to me
the paid time off is real important to me and that kind of thing
as a matter of fact i just celebrated my fifth year at t i the end of last month and kind of started looking through the book because of that
now that i'm a hundred percent vested you kind of look through the book and see what does that mean and what is the pension all about
when you're in your
you tend not to think about retirement
it's
does t i have a pretty good retirement package do you think
i think they have one that we need to recognize that we're going to have to supplement ourselves
that's certainly one of the reasons that i'm sure that they've begun the coda plan
it's certainly a supplemental way
i suppose maybe in your instance if you're started with t i in your early to mid-twenties and happen to stay with them until you're sixty-five then you'll have a very good retirement plan
i had another career first and then came to t i a little later
it's not
all by itself it won't be adequate for my situation
i have to find a way to supplement that
they seem to make it so easy to save
one of the things that we're doing which is probably the worst investment in the world
i've got money coming out to buy savings bonds just coming straight out of my check
it's probably not a great investment
if i wasn't doing that the money wouldn't be being saved anyway
i kind of have to trade off
i understand though
believe me i do that myself
i disagree with you
i debate about whether it's really good or not
it's in terms of guaranteed return on investment
maybe you don't start looking for that word guaranteed
it's shown a history that sure beats anything else
we went and did a thing through i b s which is a financial consultant
one of the things that we talked about with the counselor there was
they work up this whole big profile for you all the things that you need to work on and you need to do
one of the things that we talked about with her was the need to save for our son's education
we have a two year old
we can't start saving for college when he's sixteen
they have a way that they can figure what
he's two now
in sixteen years when he's ready to go to college this is how much it'll cost
it's just really scary the thought of how much it's going to
what it costs now is ridiculous
they sat down and figured up that we needed to save between fifteen and seventeen hundred dollars a year at a six percent interest rate to be able to have money for his college
that's exactly what we have coming out in saving bonds is about fifteen hundred dollars a year
i guess it
in that way at least we know that that's taken care of
we can worry about other things
except that mine are a little bit older
i've shown them the numbers and said this is what's going to be available
that's what she said to us
she said now do you all want him to go to a state college or a private college
our answer was that we will have enough money available for him to attend a state college
if he wants to go to a private college he can get a scholarship to attend
that was kind of our view on it
you just can't do it
i don't know
i don't
it amazes me how much the costs are going to go up over the next ten or fifteen years
boy it gets really scary when you start talking to them
i have an eleven year old daughter now who's saying gee dad i want to be an allergist
i said that's wonderful
he says i don't know
i said that's great
t i offers some good stuff
i think there's some negatives
there's going to be some negatives anywhere no matter where you go
i have all
always been involved in little small privately owned firms
i've never had the big benefit package
i really don't know how to compare it to other big companies
when i came on it was great because i had never had anything even close to what they offered
i've been real pleased
that's fantastic
on whole i would say that they're equal to most of our competitors
i can see some potential changes that probably would not cost very much but might make things a little easier
such as offering a smorgasbord having a larger variety of benefits
here's the amount that t i is going to pay for it
you can pick what you want
i don't even remember if it was in the dallasite or the insite one about companies allowing you
they said that t i was looking into it to purchase extra vacation days which i thought sounded like a good idea
if you've been there under five years you get two weeks of vacation
that's really not enough
you want an extra week then you can purchase an extra week of vacation by saying okay i'm going to want an extra five days this year
they'll take a set amount out of each paycheck
they're deducting it all along
you can have an extra five days off and be paid for them at the time
it's coming out a little bit at a time instead of all at once
that is kind of an idea that a lot of people sounded like that they were really interested in
t i said that they were looking into something like that
i could certainly personally stand seeing them go to a standardized compensatory time for overtime
i don't believe any of us would have to purchase any extra vacation days
i would certainly support something like four to one or five to one
maybe they want to get generous and make it three to one
as a repayment for
it should be a standard and not left up to either the whim or the current overhead rate that's running in each department
a lot of that is left up to whoever your supervisor happens to be and what type of relationship you have with that person
i see a lot of differences from one group to the next about who gets it and who doesn't get it
that's that way with a lot of things there
it seems like it depends on what group you happen to be in what you're going to get and what you're not going to get
that's for sure
it's probably that way anywhere
i'm sure personalities always come into play
just in this size of organization
i live in garland
we're just beginning to
we just built a real big recycling center
as far as trash pick up and stuff that a lot of the communities are doing
they're really not full force into it
they're trying
we're attempting it
i wish we could do more
there's been no emphasis on recycling at all in san antonio
there was discussion for a while about building a garbage burning
it just wasn't cost effective at the time
there's little recycling trucks and things throughout the city
there isn't any advertising campaign
i recycle my newspapers and my aluminum stuff
they make it as hard as possible
we have those which i think is one of the best things is those cash for cans
i really like that because that makes it real convenient because they're in almost every shopping center
you can just stop by
now everything else like the paper and plastic and stuff you still have to go to the centers
for aluminum that's real nice
i started doing that at work
i put out a trash can for people to put their aluminum cans in
that's really helped a lot
everybody's pitched in
it doesn't bother them to walk little bit farther put their aluminum in a can rather than just throwing it in their trash can
i really like that
people are really concerned
which is really sad because i wish we would do more
at work we started all the recycling stuff
that really started a lot of stuff off
sometimes it dwindles down
that's about the extent of it
that's
it's just
i'm sure that the driving factor for recycling the computer paper is that we get paid to do so
do you really
we sell the paper back to a paper manufacturing company
that's a neat idea
it defrays the cost of buying the paper i think
that's really good
at least they're trying
that was one thing we noticed last week that we had some new people move into our building
the nice cardboard boxes that you move packing boxes
they were just used one time and thrown in the dumpster
i thought i don't understand this
we're trying to cut cost and everything like that and recycle and all that stuff
here we are wasting
i don't understand sometimes the logic behind it
the last time someone moved offices in my building
the properties people came in with the good cardboard boxes
i took several home because i'm moving pretty soon
they're good boxes
they were just going to throw them away
i didn't want to waste that
it's hard enough to find good packing boxes
these boxes are
they don't take up much storage space
that's very good
i felt a little guilty about taking the boxes for about two seconds until i realized they would be thrown away
i thought i was doing them a favor by taking them
i found about nine of them that had not even been folded into boxes
so many people go to the grocery store and stuff and get those boxes
when these are perfect
you can't use it anyway
the real sturdy boxes that copy room paper comes in with the nice lids those get thrown away
i am constantly scouting out the copy room for those boxes
that's what i do with a lot of my daughter's things is i'll store her out dated or out of season clothes in them
they're just perfect
what i've done in the past
i would buy some cheap wallpaper from somewhere and cover those nice boxes with the lids
you can stack them up and leave them out and put things in them even
they look just as good
it's cheaper than going and buying the kind at target that are all ready with the little design on them or whatever
you're recycling
that's neat
do you all have
we have places that pay for paper to recycle
for newspaper
ours are real hard to find
i recycle paper
they're real hard to find the places that pay
that's really discouraging
i just go ahead and take it to the regular place where they just accept it
i think they should
if they want people to recycle i think it's
the aluminum
it gets people doing it
you don't have to pay them a lot
there's a big huge dumpster looking thing sitting out front
it's for recycling
they have aluminum and newspaper and plastic and some other category
you don't get paid
it's real convenient just to chunk the newspapers in there
that's good
the one thing i don't like about the newspaper also is
at work we have two different trash cans at your desk
in the paper one you have to separate
you can't throw certain file type things away
i just think it's such a hassle
it seems like it would be easy to take it all
i do get tired of having to separate paper
it gets to be
you have to get so used to doing it that it's a habit
we had a write up in our paper this last time at work about
every other day they do your recycling trash
somebody was writing in complaining that the people had dumped all the trash in the same bin
when they were questioned about it they said we're running late
we didn't have time to do those bins or something
that's real discouraging thinking you're sitting there working to separate it
they
someone else isn't going to take the time to put it in two separate bags
they're really trying to start keeping an eye out for those
talking to the people again about
that is discouraging when you do that
luckily that will all get straightened out
they'll start separating them
i don't mind doing that
i feel like i'm doing something for the community when i'm doing that
i've enjoyed talking to you
i thank you
i think
i haven't had that much time to think about it either
i guess the biggest thing i find is the financial aspects particularly the ability of people to access your financial records or for example your credit rating almost at will
using your social security number of course permits people to do that almost anything you do now a social security number is required
of course there's another aspect of this too in terms of invasion of privacy
being a professional of course you probably belong to
that is that
some of the organizations sell their mailing lists which i think is an invasion of privacy
in fact some of these things i get some of these questionnaires
it's funny because i was in the process of filling one out when i decided i would make this phone call
when you have to send that back in the mail with your name on it your salary information i just have a real hard time doing that
they ask you what type of household items do you own like stereos and t v and v c r
you hate to send something off with your name and address
what types of things do you own
what kind of money do you make
you wonder who's going to get ahold of this and think that's a nice place to go rob
not only that it opens you to
i've had them of course for real estate investments you get please send in this particular card and you get a free trip or something along those lines
that bothers me because of course i enjoy being at home and i do not enjoy getting called by strangers particularly soliciting
having your
i know that a lot of these of course are random phone calls they just start going through the phone book or going through a series of numbers
some of them are sold
i know you
for some
the address is the same my office address
they have one under my first name james
they have one under my first name and middle initial
then they have a third one under just my two initials
i know that they have sold their mailing list
i can't really think of anything else offhand that
it's one thing to get junk mail because you can just put it right in the trash
it's the phone calls
usually when they call you it's going to be right when you sit down to dinner because they pretty much know that you're at work all day
they call you right when you've just gotten home from work
if it's a salesperson it's just something you don't want to have to mess with
i've gotten a lot of them lately
there's a lot of hang ups on my answering machine
i'm just assuming it's probably a salesman that called during the day
they'll probably call me up and call me back and bother me when i sit down to dinner later on
i find that very annoying
yeah
it's not nearly as obnoxious as the phone calls
i think you mentioning the phone calls during dinner
i know when i sit down with the family and want to have the opportunity to talk and see what's going on and all those things
i try to
i actually during that period of time usually from six o'clock or six thirty whenever i get home until eight or so i will shut off the phone my daughter gets irate
when i do that because she's a teenager she'll
i guess those three things are the most irritating to me
when i come home from work there's times i need to pay bills
even though it's friends calling sometimes you just feel like this is my quiet time
the phone ringing bothers me
that's where answering machines are nice because if it's really important they'll leave a message
i can call them back
at work i have so many phone calls from customers calling in
sometimes i just want to get away from the phone ringing because it really does annoy me
if i've had a lot of phone calls during the day occasionally when we have
this past week
phone rings like crazy
you come home
the last thing you want to do is have to answer the phone
if it's some salesman that just makes it even that much worse
it just
i get to where i turn the answering machine on and just let it pick up the phone
now with this thing i'm participating in i kind of have to answer it
now we have a voice mail system at the office
what i have done is i have forwarded my home phone to the answering service at the office so that i do not have to have a ring at all
if i want to do that
i will just let the phone ring three or four times and know that it will forward to the office
it makes it convenient
at the office when i
on our system and i imagine on most systems
when i want to be not bothered during the day that's exactly what i do
None
yours is probably the same as ours
it's tigon
isn't tigon part of g t e or vice versa or something like that
tigon is part of g t e
we had been using the aspen service before they purchased tigon i imagine we will be shifting over to that service in a while
dana i think we have probably conversed long enough
thank you for calling
i enjoyed talking to you
i honestly don't feel like it's strict enough in my opinion
and that the penalty ought to be out there and be enforced
if your going to sentence somebody lets say twenty years let them stay twenty years
there has got to be some kind of punishment
if they turn around they get away with it
they get away with it
they get away with it
they do something worse they get a slap on the wrist
thirty days in jail they final get up to where they kill somebody else
they go through fourteen appeals and how many hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars
they certainly are living at our expense
they sure are just because
it seems like really a rough time i'm not saying innocent person
when they go to prison it really seem like it's a rough time for them a murderer well go to prison
and be paroled and have served the sentence
that's what people face with that choice
one thing i really hate is they don't explain to the jurors in a capital murder trial or in cases of rape or in different things that are so horrible what it means when they sentence them to
they'll sentence them to ninety years and say that it's going to
instead in
given the choice of either sentencing to death or sentencing to life they'll give them ninety years in prison or something and then turn around in thirty years that
less they're out
if they're even in that long
they appeal
they get an appeal that says it was an unjust amount of time
i would just be
i would love to see them just really get real strict on parole
i think people know that it doesn't
it's not a deterrent right now because it's not really effective
there's should be for this crime this is the penalty
someone in cold blood or whatever
it sounds horrible
i
i know
they let them back out again
they do the same thing over
they put them back in jail
they get out
more and more innocent people are hurt or killed these guys just are on the endless merry-go-round in the legal system
it's like i said at our expense
a lot of people really doesn't think that much about it because it hasn't happened to them which it hasn't to me either
still it could
you read about it in the paper
every day somebody who's done this or that something really horrible they just get away with it
nothing happens
as far as the other states i honestly don't know what their capital punishment is
i
haven't kept up anything
i think texas the southern states seem to be somewhat more conservative and still have the death penalty
i know california had it for a long time
they took it off the books
they repealed it people like charles manson and some of these other people who were sentenced to death at the time they repealed the death penalty were sentenced to life in prison
and are now that even though california has reinstated the death penalty for whatever various crimes
the people who were there originally when they changed the laws to revoke the death penalty are in prison in quote for life and are now coming up for parole
like manson who's come up
still it came up though didn't it
uh-huh
the jury that sentenced him sentenced him to death while he was on appeal on his thousandth and one appeal the state of california revoked the law in the early seventies
they reinstated it later
the penalty didn't go back
it seems like a lot of times the law is totally on the criminal side and isn't protecting the rest of the people
especially in things you pick up the paper
you read
the laws are all the rules
you think oh my goodness uh-huh
some of the things that would make sense to tell the jury that this guy has a prior criminal history where he's raped ten women he gets up for this one trial
they don't finds anything out about the facts that he's done this over and over and over again they say this is
i don't know if they say it's the first time offense or whatever
they give him a lighter sentence thinking he's not a habitual criminal
or plead insanity
that seems to be a good way to get off for a lot of them too
they plead insanity three years later they're cured and let loose on society again
it just doesn't make sense
it's a scary world out there anymore where your afraid to go out
i know in the dallas metroplex area i don't go out hardly if i don't have to at night by myself i grew up in a smaller town in texas
it wasn't that way when i was younger
like i
boy
said i live in a small place
now i'm raising children
it really is
when i was a kid i would run between my neighbors three and four blocks sometimes as long as my mom had a general idea where i was and i was back on the time
now i don't let my kids out of the front yard that i can't see them
we're probably fixing to run out of time pretty
i've enjoyed talking to you
good talking to you too
i don't find a lot of time to watch t v
a lot of time i find it during the day when i'm rocking my little girl to sleep
i watch a lot of reruns old shows
your a homemaker
she stays home too also
i guess i have a wide variety
not so much the things that aren't
for example the cosby show to me is just kind of like a waste of my time
i like sixty minutes
he likes tom and jerry and bugs bunny and all his friends
if i'm ever home during the day on a vacation day i have to catch at twelve o'clock the andy griffith show because he's one of my idles
i don't know
it seems like nowadays everything is so electronic magnified and animated
i do with the cosby show
i do
some of the crap that's on t v nowadays
i do watch the special shows that they come out with the nova stuff and
i think there's enough out there to pick from
we don't have cable to the point of the h b o or any of that stuff
i find myself watching just a whole lot of whatever is geared for children because
i don't want them watching something that i don't think they should watch
i'd eat
at work we'd have a t v or whatever
as my kids got older and started recognizing what was going on i thought this isn't really very good
i gave it up
i had watched it since it started
now i don't know who the characters are
i'll turn it on every once in awhile
i don't recognize anybody
i guess that's a good sign
i used to watch
this might date me here
you're probably about the same age as me because my mom watched the secret storm
i think they were back to back
i was like my gosh
i think as the world turns may
i think some of the tones of the daily prime time is questionable
that could be
keep them on the channel twenty one
the nature stuff
it's real interesting too the difference in my kids
my oldest loved sesame street
she's more into walt disney kind
we watch a lot of movies that we've got on tapes
we do a lot of kid watching
sounds like you got your hands full there
i do appreciate speaking with you
it inspired me to make more phone calls
i don't really
i've never made one
we got a lot of european dishes
we got what some people call the best beef in the world
it's bishu
every sunday you go out
you buy all these parts of the cow
you just cook them over a grill
in our house it's already built in
you can make a barbecue
i've had that meal in new york where they bring you a plank sort of with all this wonderful beef parts of beef cooked and barbecued it's marvelous
they have an argentinean place down in georgetown
i'll keep that in mind
you serve that yourself or for a family
the problem is i'm only twenty-two when i'm down at home and somebody says okay when are we having this
i'll cook it
you have to prepare the fire and then put the sausages on
you put all these different meats which take different times
do you buy them separately at an american grocery store now
do you have to
you don't go buy it from a wholesaler
what happens is in argentina they have all these little places like the fruit stand and the dairy and products and whatever
i know
they got the meat place
you just go there
you can't find chicken there
you have poultry place
what dishes do you serve with it
basically it's what we call it impenadas which is like
i love those
we also put sausages on a bun
that's to start out with
what you have is also three different kinds of salad
that's about it
i guess he retired and went back to argentina
i guess in the early seventies
that's before your time
he was wonderful
what i also eat now since i graduate
being argentinean we also have a lot of pasta
None
there're many italians in argentina
my mom makes what we call niokes and
all this stuff that it's like lasagna and everything
my grandfather came to the united states through argentina
actually a little bit later like nineteen thirteen
pure italians
i'll tell you
we both love continental cooking french cooking
we cook
our meals are
we don't usually mix
i mean that sometimes if we're entertaining we'll do a chinese recipe there are really easy recipe
with chinese you always have several dishes
nowadays with microwaves
if you like chinese food you can take filet of fish and put a little bit of soy sauce and a little bit of sesame oil on top of it and chop some scallions and a little ginger and just cover it with some waxed paper and steam it just until the fish is done
it's a wonderful flavorful piece of fish
i was at
it's like when you go buy fish i buy the fish
you can do it in the microwave the breaded fish
i've seen the filet
buy a fresh filet of fish a nice one at the fish counter
any white fish
sole is good flounder sole or flounder is real good and even grouper
we put soy sauce and sesame
little bit of soy sauce and sesame seed oil
not too much soy sauce
some chopped up slivers of scallions
and slivers of ginger and then just cover it and put it in the microwave for just say two minutes check it after two minutes to see if the fish flakes
if the fish flakes it's done
i got one of those little microwaves
you see just check it during
another quick dish if you like do you know what hoi sin sauce is
if you go in a chinese store ask for hoi sin h o i s i n
if you take little pieces of pork and you fry them like little cubes of pork
and you fry them with garlic and a couple dashes of hot pepper and then mix some hoi sin sauce with sherry just a little sherry to thin it and stir that in you can even put a spoon of ketchup in
that makes a great pork dish with a sort of a spicy sweet sauce that you can serve over rice
for two people if it's american style i buy a half a pound if you're just serving that
if you're serving another dish with it say the rice dish with guys pretty healthy appetites i'd probably go a third of a pound
you could
and you can always heat it up again and save
it's just since i'm from argentina i just love meat
you can also do the same thing if you have ground beef
you've got a very colorful side another dish
how much does it cost
the hoi sin sauce
a dollar twenty-nine a can
a can would serve you for quite a few meals
i thought it was maybe five fifty or something
listen it was good talking with you
it's hard topic because
is it doing a good job or a bad job
you got to divide it two different categories whether you live in the city or whether you live in a more rural place like i do
are you talking about public schools being lower level high school level or state school
kindergarten all the way up to high school
you're excluding high-level education
i am
actually i think that higher level education
it's the job that the high school and the grade schools are doing that i see in a area like ours
even a bad school is a good school up here where if i lived in new york city or washington d c i would seriously consider moving if i had a child
of course people are trapped economically
they can't do that
i know down here the school's are
the schools down here rate bottom ten percent across the country
having been through grade school up there and coming down here to high school i can understand why
they're so far behind and so poorly staffed half the time the teachers don't know what's going on
that's really too bad because it's giving some people unfair advantage
our high school up here is like a junior college in florida what we learned
that was my experience going through junior high up there
i'd been in a parochial school before junior high
even the public schools are behind the parochial schools
i like the concept they've got now where they have more directed education
you pick a career path
you get counseling earlier
you learn the things that help you rather than spending four years learning the same things over and over
they have that down there that
they talk about it
there are a few in some of the more like in
some of the better parts of the metroplex the suburbs that are richer have those kind of target schools
None
it's like if your father owns a grocery store and you're really interested in that
if you're going to go the science route you can go to a target school that specializes in science or art
there's no point in
if i have to go take art classes i'm not going to use them
through high school i could have gone so much further if i'd gone to a school that was directed
i'm a technician
we had a vocational electronics in our high school
when i went to my first year of tech school i had a very easy time because our high school had a good program
i think the schools today they're just overrun
too many of the kids don't care
i find that
the parents send them there because they're supposed to
it gets them out of their hair
i also find that you can send a kid to school
if don't work with them as a parent i think you're putting your child at a big disadvantage
there's some kids that want to go learn
most of them just want to go play
i could see if a kid doesn't have any encouragement if they're come from a broken home and they're parents are more concerned about trying to work
maybe they're unemployed
they're mad at the world
i can see where that wouldn't be very good for a kid
they're no get away from me
it's got a lot to do with economics in the area that you come from
it's not at the moment
a lot of the industry's moving southward
are they going to move to mexico
i don't know about that
a lot of the industry up in the northern states is moving south i'm wondering if that's going to have any effect on what you see now
we're behind down here
that might not turn around in the next twenty years
maybe they'll bring their good schools with them
i know the town that i come from the large i b m plant has something to do with the top rated high school because of their tax base for one
for the type of student that's going to that school it's going to raise the level of the school because your parents are engineers or chemists
you're most likely to do better in school
i think
i don't know
i just think it's a duty of the parent to do that
jeez my parents always helped me
i don't know
she's got four kids
is it
whose supposed to make the change the state the federal government
is it what do you advocate more taxes or better management of what they got
actually i think it should be the city level and a system level really to find out and to see what they need and not overinflate it
if the teachers are getting six percent raises every year when people in industry have been getting cut back and you're getting raises every eighteen months you got to go now hey wait a minute
our town didn't pass the school budget this year for the first time in many years just because people are in the recession
even though we've enjoyed very good employment here for the past ten years
now we got eight percent unemployment when it used to be four or five
i always
it's all money based
what you can do unless you just get down to the parent level
if you're in a bad situation where you have to send your child to a bad school
maybe we need some more catholic schools
they seem to have done a good job in the past
in some places you couldn't go to a public school
the only school you could go to was the baptist school or the catholic school
you have to learn
you aren't given the chance to screw off all the time
i don't have any good ideas or anything that would contribute
this isn't a subject that i think a lot about because i'm never faced with it because our school system in vermont it seems to do a really good job
i know i'm in the
the only reason i asked about secondary schools or advanced education is because down here going to the university of texas the education i'm getting i think is kind of shoddy for a public school
i don't think i'm getting what i should
in texas it's next to free because they pay so much of it
at the same time it's not like going to m i t
it's really too bad that's
you get people out of high schools and junior colleges that don't have the background for an m i t kind of curriculum
you have to go to a lesser engineering school
a degree out there means a lot
it's university of vermont
we also have some two year college
there's a four year colleges
like you say you
i think the weather lately has been a bit warmer than i would expect this time of year
the bermuda grass is greening up in march
sometimes doesn't really start doing that until the first part of april
i think we're a little ahead of schedule on that
i noticed all that grass coming up
i thought ooh
it's been a fun break
the break is over
i guess another thing i've noticed too here lately is that even though we've had some pretty warm days it's been awfully gray just
the last couple of weekends have been nice and sunny
it seems like every time at work i look out my window it's gray
i'd rather have a sunny weekend than a gray weekend
i go for that
it sounds like it's going to be a little bit on the cool side
it's supposed to be cleared out at least by noon tomorrow
the rest will be without rain
that's good
i think the highs are going to be in the sixties and the lows in the forties
i haven't seen the weather on the news in the evening lately
i think the average high should be about seventy
you're probably right
i like it when it's sort of a medium temperature maybe seventy-five to eighty somewhere in there
one of the remarkable things about the weather in the summertime here is that quite often the average daytime high of say ninety-nine degrees is within five or six degrees of the all time record high
what that tells me is that the summer weather is very predictable that it doesn't vary very much
any other time of year that's not the case because it could be very warm or very cold
and i think it was one day this week a year ago they said that we had a freeze and some kind of bad weather it wasn't just a super bad storm
it was that sort of thing that we never like to see in the late spring time
i was going into the grocery store
a lightening bolt was almost directly overhead
it was twenty- six degrees out
i thought gee i've never known it to lightening at that temperature
that is pretty unusual
you really take notice of it too
it probably was a lot warmer up high
i don't like that super cold stuff
i'm really enjoying this now
this has been interesting
you have a good day
i think i am
it's been a while now
i've
we bought a house
we're about fifty yards from the golf course unfortunately the house is taking up my time
it's been almost a year i guess since i've actually swung a club for a purpose
i haven't played in about two years
i went out two weeks ago with the guys here
i played in a tournament out there
i shot a net fifty-nine
i have a hard time inventing shots
let's go around this tree and try a slice through a hook here
i can't do that
i've been watching quite a few videos
i took out a few videos and watched them for a while
i hope i'm on the right track
shot a career low eighty-nine my handicap is twenty nine
that's great
now like i say it's been a while for me too
i've got my wife motivated about it i think that's probably going to be one of the next investments is get her a set of clubs
we'll get out of the driving range and get some interest built up
hopefully we can start in
she wants to get into it now after i came home and won the tournament the other day
great
she's ready to get off into it
i just like getting out being in the outdoors
i'm a hunter and fisher anyway
None
at least i can get out and play a few hours of golf
it's not going to cost me an arm and a leg really
i walk
i get a little exercise there too
i tell you
i took it as a p e course and then kind of left it alone for a while
finally got into it while i was still in school since then we've made it
as the friends start getting married and things like that we've made a tradition of having a thursday
have probably a thursday night bachelor party and a friday golf day before the wedding
it
that's back in south dakota where i grew up that's been my main involvement
eventually i get people to come and visit me in dallas
i'll show them we can play golf in the middle of winter when we can't do it back home
here it is sixty-five degrees
they're freezing cold back there
actually i picked it up when i was in high school on the same as a p e course
when i got into the service i got into it now when i come out here i just kind of let it go
one of the guys mentioned to me at work one day if i played golf
i said yeah
i haven't swung them in quite a few years
i got into it and then back out of it
it just seems like every couple of years i get back in there
i really enjoy it
it's a lot of fun especially if you can find somebody that's got the same level of interest
that's true of any sport
people don't want to play with somebody that they are going to beat every time
we've got some guys here that they are four and five handicappers they don't like to play with me because i'm too slow for them
get somebody around your own handicap and you can just mosey on out for three or four hours and have a good time
i've
never yet have i walked up
i've walked up a few times on the golf course by myself with nobody else to play with
never yet have i met anybody on the golf course that wouldn't allow me to join their twosome or threesome
sure come on out
they don't mind if you make a mistake
they don't mind saying let me tell you how to do that or teach you how to do that or
that's so
it's pretty nice and friendly out there you can't find that in all sports
you can gain a lot of ground doing that too if
you get in a rut if you do play a lot
you play with the same people you aren't going to learn anything
eventually i'd like to work up if my wife does get interested and maybe get involved in a mixed doubles league or something like that
we have one down here in the summertime
it runs from five o'clock to seven thirty or eight o'clock because it doesn't get dark until nine thirty or ten
we play in the summertime out here
that's what i'm trying to get her ready for
it's going to start when we change time back whenever that is next month i guess
it will start then
we had a lot of girls out there a couple of years ago
they were just starting to learn
they were shooting a hundred hundred and twenty they were
it won't take her long
that's good that's sounds like a lot of fun
it's something we can do together
she doesn't do much hunting
golf would give her the exercise
it sounds like we've got real similar situations
i've gone home every year now since i've moved to dallas to go pheasant hunting
the last time i took my wife along
kind of the same situation
she's up in the house and talked to my mother the whole time we were out hunting and stuff
she'll make the trip for fishing if
it's interesting
it's a game that you don't
like bowling you feel bad if you bowl a hundred
if you shoot a hundred in golf
you don't have to be an expert in any aspect of it at all
i've kind of formed the attitude that if i could pick two or three shots out of my game every time and put them together on one hole then i do pretty good i keep rationalizing that i can do it
i just got to do it all on the same hole
it will get better
you just keep going
in the meantime just enjoy what you're doing
it really works that way
when i first got back into it i used to get mad because i knew i could do something
i didn't get it done
i need to slice this ball around here
the ball will go straight
i go
i'd get upset about it sometimes
now i guess being in my forties i just kind of mellowed out a little bit
that's great
i've enjoyed talking to you
you bet
i haven't had too much of a chance to watch t v lately
probably everything i going to say is kind of dated
i can understand that
my wife and i just recently moved into our house
we're spend a lot of time on the house and out in the yard and things but
like to keep up to date too
since i got out of college which was about five years ago my t v viewing started to tend more towards documentary news programs things like that
i've kind of gotten away from being a series watcher having to keep up to date with
i think when you're in college you have more of a regular schedule in terms of you can watch every week
i used to
right now the last things i watched regularly was thirty something when it first came out
i started too and kind of worked away from that
i have a hard time sticking with something on t v because it gets real aggravating if you miss it for a week or two
right
i tell you what
one night couple weeks ago it was just happened that we were exhausted
they wanted to watch
we said okay we'll sit down
we'll look at what you want to see
it was prime time
it was what eight o'clock on a week night we have cable
there wasn't anything on any channel
the stuff that was on the prime the networks a b c n b c c b s was
it was just dribble it wasn't even funny it wasn't creative
it was the worst i've seen
i have not watched prime time week night t v i guess in a real long time because i was shocked
when i first moved down here moved into the apartment and got cable i guess i kind of became numb
nothing surprised me any more seeing it on the t v
all of a sudden i started paying attention to network t v again once in a while
it's surprising how much it's changed the whole moral situation everything is just gone one whole complete direction different
we don't have any kids yet
i feel the same way
it's really tough to find something that's going to be good and interesting for the kids even cartoons you watch some of the cartoons
kids aren't even going to understand half the humor that's in there
it's just like a necessary evil
when our children were younger when they were like four years old three years old five years old we just had sesame street
that was about it
now in order to seem humane and normal we do allow them to watch cartoons and stuff
it's just one of those things
you have to shut your eyes or not listen or something because those drive you crazy if you're in the room
it's such a shame because it could be so good
that's true
second of all why the networks think that we enjoy that kind of stuff
their demographic studies that they do that show that everybody's i q has dropped dramatically
i didn't have to
that's the
i sit and watch some shows
i'm embarrassed for the people that are even involved in the show
why do you do this to yourself
i like stuff that's on great performances
we used to watch mystery quite a bit and things like that
as a matter of fact when i was a kid
there's an idea
if they saw us watching something
there was some other
we had to give a little oral report before we could watch our program
do you watch sports on t v
it's kind of like reading magazines any more
i'd personally rather see a game on t v than fight the crowds at the stadium
no
i'll sit down for the big games the super bowl and the championship things like that
i don't follow any team
i know how everybody's doing
that suffices me
i like good humor once in a while
i enjoy that
do you get that come-
again you're in a situation where you're watching mostly commercials
you're trying to pass the time to wait until the next comedian comes up
i'd fast forward through the
that takes too much planning
if there's any series that i pay attention to i try to watch cheers once in a while
now is that still real good
in fact i think it's on tonight
i i'm kind of out of it
i consider that fairly intelligent humor
they do have good writers for that
that makes me think
it was just automatic too
we started watching again
it's real different show than it was when it started
it's better
it's real different than what it used to be
you can't be outrageous
if you keep that same format
None
i guess there are a few things around still
you have to hunt hard for them
been good talking to you
what kind of cars are you looking at
we've test driven the oldsmobile delta eighty-eight and a cutlass supreme and a used cadillac about three or four years old because i get married in a couple of weeks
i have two kids
my fiancee has two kids we need a car that's big enough for six
we went car shopping and looked around
we found something interesting at crest oldsmobile cadillac up there on central expressway that
it's been a demonstrator model for two or three thousand dollars even cheaper than the best deal they can give you for a new car
they call this program cars
they come
it just seems to make sense to me to get the most car for your money to get something like that
in fact my dad recently got a pontiac believe six thousand he got a demo
it's been a real good car it's like new it only had very low mileage on it
i think he got a real good deal
i think it's a pretty good option
are the oldsmobiles that you're looking at are they the demos
they used
the ones that we were test driving were the new ones there
None
the cadillac is definitely a used car
it's probably gone by now
of course we can't consider getting a brand new cadillac because those are twenty-five to thirty thousand dollars
when they're three years old they're
it becomes more realistic
that's what i'm thinking about on my next car is do i want to get another brand new car because last two cars are brand new do i look for a used car that's maybe three years old but that's low mileage and in good shape
i kind of worry about getting a car that's that new with low mileage on it because you wonder why did the person that owned it want to get rid of it
is something wrong with it
i guess that's a risk you have to take
you can reduce that risk by having the car checked out
if you're going to look at fifty different cars you don't want to do this if you've narrowed it down to one or two you can have the car checked at an independent service station and have them go through it from top to bottom and tell you if they can find anything wrong because they don't have any financial interest in it
you'll have a realistic assessment of what you're getting
i'm thinking around twenty or twenty-five dollars
i would think so
it's kind of hard for me to talk about buying cars because i just got mine paid off about a month ago
it's still in great shape
what you can do is take your car payment and put it in the bank for three or four years when you're ready to get another car just pay cash for it
if i continue taking good care of it it's going to hold a pretty good resale value if i consider going the used car route and save up some money i shouldn't have too much trouble at all
i would think that's true
i was picking up some background noise
i just switched the channel up on it
i really enjoy the car i have now
i do want to hold onto it and enjoy it while it's not having any mechanical problems whatsoever
in fact it never has it's been kind of nice
surprisingly enough after four years i'm not tired of the car at all
i want to hang on to it while it's still being a good car and while i'm not tired of it while i'm single and can handle a two seater for now
one of these days i'll be getting a six seater probably too
the first two cars i ever bought
i've always bought them new
i've got a hundred and twenty-two thousand miles on that
that's kind of in the way i've done things is to get things that are new and then keep them forever
my gosh
about a quart every hundred miles
it runs fine
that's a sign that i'm going to have to do something sooner or later
it's a buick century
my fiance is selling a nineteen seventy-eight cutlass supreme that she has
she's going to sell it rather than trade it in
maybe more than that as i've learned
when i bought my r x seven best offer i got for my other car was twenty-five hundred
i turned around and sold it myself for forty-two hundred
there you go
i'm glad you're taking care of it yourself
i think trading it in they just use that as additional
they just are going to give you that much less for your trade in
that's fact
strangely enough the best bargaining i had made with a dealer on my car was also the same place i got the best price trade in
it's a place in arlington
i think maybe as you get outside the dallas area
maybe because it's outside of dallas they are giving a little bit better prices
i was going through that t i fleet discount program
did you use it at the car shop place
it's before they had that
they had a little file where they said which dealers participated in the fleet program
what you could expect they said a five percent over cost and then options at cost and everything
i figured out a price based on that
i guess i got a pretty good deal because i went back to the town north mazda right off central and offered them the same price as what i knew i was going to be able to get it for in arlington they said there is no way you can get this car for that price especially if we add on the equalizer and the cruise control
they just laughed at me
i went the next morning to arlington
they gave it to me for that price
what's so funny
they took the car i knew they were going to pull it from town north because that's where the white one was
they had already told me we located one at town north
it was that same car
unless you're selling car with hail damage and flood damage
you laughed all the way to the bank
i did
i laughed real hard when i took it in for the two thousand mile checkup that they required you to do
i took it to town north
sure enough i saw that guy
he recognized me
he said hi dana
he kind of looked down and saw that car
i'm sure he probably knew what was going on the very next day of course when the place in arlington went and took the car because i told him there's a place in arlington that's going to give it to me for that price
the next day they pulled the white car and took it to arlington
i'm sure he knew
i loved it
i just had the biggest grin on my face
dana it's been really interesting
we just got the dog less than a year ago
he's still a puppy
what kind is it
you
the only chow he's got is his tongue
he's got a blue tongue
i was out ruled
i just love them to death
was the guinea pig for your child
anyway she enjoys her though
that's what matters
our chows we've had them i'd say right around six maybe seven years
they're registered
we've been breeding them
my husband's always wanted a chow
i'm kind of concerned about having cats
how they socialize with cats which is one of the reasons why we got a mixed breed
we thought they would socialize easier
my husband had originally wanted an
his brother has an
he so far he's bitten ten people
the people that he got the from used to have cats
they no longer have any other cats
it's telling
when we had a cat when we first married no took
we got the chow
you would think that they were all dogs the way she would prance around them and paw at their face
they'd just play
they never harmed her
they got along great
i don't know how it would be bringing in cat to a full grown dog
i wouldn't feel hesitant about bringing a puppy in
how old is your child
you had the dogs before you had the baby
i was
i think a lot of that we hear all the time is how you bring them up
ours are real friendly
they're very friendly and lovable
you think they're lapdogs
they'll just come jump on your lap and want to have their bellies rubbed and everything
the female's red
the male is black
i bet the black one's pretty
he's a big old thing
i was concerned about the female mainly
as luck had it she had puppies the same week my daughter was born
it was kind of like she had her babies and understood about
i think that really helped my daughter since she's little has been playing with them
they let her tug their hair and get on their back or whatever
she's grown up with them and loves them to death
they love her
as long as they don't have any allergies to them or anything
i think it really helps them to understand when they go to other people's houses
they have pets
i see so many times kids just
that the other extreme
they're terrified of them
i hate that
they shouldn't be
some maybe
our miniature schnauzer she's just a little hyper thing and just prances around and jumps all over everybody acting silly
a lot of kids are scared of that which i understand because she is a lot of movement and everything
when she calms down they're so scared of her
that bothers me because she's the friendliest thing
she wouldn't harm them at all
that's mainly people that have never had pets around their children
i think it's a good idea to have them
in the past we've had birds too like cockatoos
the cockatoos are those the big ones
birds with the orange crest on top
those are neat
they're very messy
a lot louder than a dog
a dog you can tell stop barking or whatever
the birds it's hard to keep them from squawking or whatever
they were neat enjoyable animals to have
we've thought about getting an aquarium
partly for the cats
i think the cats would really enjoy it
so far we just
starting up an aquarium
we're thinking about getting a saltwater
they're so expensive to start up
in your the luck of keeping them alive
few days
the saltwater fish have so much more color
they're so much more beautiful
the freshwater tank's just
really to me there's
i really don't care much for them
you have a little bit of ocean with you or something
i don't mind having
my daughter had a little goldfish
about a year or two ago
it finally died
that was neat
they're
you can't roll around and tussle around with it like you can a dog or a cat
i wouldn't dare have a goldfish here because
my cats would knock it over
if the cats will jump up on things and knock things over all the time
they're always up where they're not supposed to be
that's hard
that's just like kids
they know that they're not supposed to do it
they're going to do it anyway because they know they're not supposed to
they're so independent
until we got the dog it was real easy to go to town for three day weekend or whatever
we never even thought that about when we got the dog
we just saw him
the first weekend we had him we were in a two bedroom apartment
my husband went out of town and left me with the brand new puppy
i had to work twelve hours that day
i left the dog locked in the bedroom
i put paper all over the floor
when i came home i opened the door
there were chunks of carpet
he had tried to dig his way out from underneath the door
i had the carpet fixed
i didn't even tell the apartment manager
that was my first real experience with a puppy
when we had our family dog growing up i was eleven or twelve i think when we first got him
i wasn't really involved in the paper training
and teaching him commands and stuff
this was to me a whole new experience
they don't
we found she's right at a year
we finally got her house trained and everything
if you do not pick the trash up the container
i don't care how full she is
it's not like she's hungry
anything that they think is good
it doesn't matter where you put it and where you hide it
how tight you have the lid down on it
i hate that
the cat's just looking at me like sorry
i just
she knows it's wrong
she'll cower and go hide under the table
she knows she does wrong
she continues to do it
he's still chewing
is he
the last thing he chewed up was when we
in dallas there's definitely a crime problem
i know it's worse in the larger cities
it's kind of a concern for me
it's
you definitely are going to worry about the location and accessibility of people to be able to break in
i'm real concerned that i don't want to be on a first floor where you can have problems with things like that
the
the area i live in right now is real good as far as crime rate is concerned
we don't have anything at all no burglar alarms no guards
some places do have guard gates that you have to get through or electronic access gates and things like that
i went to dallas when i worked for t i in abilene
i'm a little familiar with the city area forest lane and through that off the freeway
it didn't seem like it was that congested in that part
to me where we live out here in the north east there are a lot of buildings very close to each other
the cities are very populated with tenement housing
with the people that are coming into the country from other countries not knowing the language
they're going to the big cities
i've seen the same thing that you're talking about much more crime than ever before
drugs of course a big part of it i think
i don't know
a lot of younger people into more violent crimes
that's really sad
i don't know if it's the family thing where they're not bonding anymore where mothers are working all the time and
i really think that we're falling by the wayside with not incarcerating these people
i agree
they're getting paroled too easily
they're just getting put on probation or something because the prisons don't have enough room
they get lighter sentences
some of those people they don't deserve to be let loose
they had
in fact on the news last night we were watching this man who lost his ten year old daughter
he had left her home alone
she's old enough to be alone for a few minutes
while he was gone he had went looking for a job and stopped at the store
someone who was in the neighborhood cleaning carpets these two men went in raped the girl murdered her
my gosh
one of the men got i think it was seventeen years
the other one was in for life imprisonment
he's out
that's terrible
the man said that if it weren't for the fact that he would go to jail that he would eliminate this person himself
and then go to mcdonalds and have a hamburger and not think a thing about it
i think that what this is going to lead to is people will take things into their own hands
that innocent people
i shouldn't say innocent because actually if they commit a crime that they're in the same circumstances
the reasons that they're doing it compared to the reason someone else is in jail for it it's like two different things
i like the idea that if someone is from a foreign country
and they come to this country and commit a crime i think that irregardless of whether they have already become a citizen or anything they should be immediately deported
once they have been arrested
if they know beyond a shadow of a doubt these people are guilty
they go right back where they came from
we have enough problems with overcrowding in the jails as it is
let their country take care of it
i guess we do have a lot of people come in from mexico that cause problems
they're so close
i don't consider mexican people in the same category with
especially people who come from cultures that don't have the same kind of moral upbringing that we have
you take asian countries or the eastern countries where women are in the background and the men are in the foreground
it's like
they live back in where we came from two hundred years ago
we've advanced beyond that
i think that their mentality as far as the way they treat them and that kind of thing
i went to the far east back in october to do some training for t i
some of those countries were so safe it was unreal
singapore is supposed to be very safe
in fact tokyo
i thought tokyo would be dangerous being such a huge large city with so many people
at the t i there i said is there any area i should avoid
the guy said let me ask another girl here
he turned and asked this girl and said can you think of any place where dana shouldn't go by herself or anything
she thought for a few minutes
she said no
he said is there any place you wouldn't go by yourself
they said
somebody will turn it in
nothing will be missing
they said they can just about guarantee that that would happen if you did that
i was thinking boy in dallas if somebody asked me if there were places you wouldn't go by yourself at night i'd have to set them down for about five or ten minutes to list all the places out
i couldn't believe that she couldn't think of any place
they said apparently the crime is just
what's the difference there
i know what it is in singapore is they have the death penalty
they really enforce it
i believe in the death penalty
for drugs they enforce the death penalty for that
they're just very very tough
i guess maybe that's the way tokyo is too or japan is too
we take the civil liberties stuff too far
people that are in prison we didn't put them there
as far as them entertaining the rights that they should have
we educate them
they no sooner get out on the street and they're back in again
i think people who are guilty of really serious heinous crimes
if they're overcrowded
i think that that's the whole key here
where they plead to a lesser crime or they plead guilty or tell about someone else and they get less time
if they're in there and they've got seventeen years and they're on good behavior for every year they're in they get so many less that they don't serve the full penalty
i really think we're going to far overboard with all of this
i agree because it's not fair to those of us that deserve a safe life to have to
that if the laws and were were harsher and were enforced
you have to set an example
i think that people know that they're going to get a slap on the wrist they might serve a little bit of time and that they'll be out on the street again
i feel bad for the policeman
this craziness people with automatic weapons and all this other stuff and trying to do a job
let's face it
especially not in some of these big cities
in dallas they've had
they're up in the top five i think of cities that are getting policeman killed in the line of duty
that's really sad
it really is
they're the first ones that take the brunt of everything
i'm not saying that they're all good either because there's good and bad in everything
they're already have three strikes against them when they're out there
they'll arrest someone and go through all that paperwork and writing a report and all this and having all kinds of evidence
you have to even be careful how you arrest them how you talk to them what they say
what go ahead and tell me about your home
is that right
i live in pensacola florida
that's interesting
i own a home in pensacola
let's see
it's a relatively i would say
god it
it's upper middle class
kind of an environment
that's neat
it has around thirty-two hundred square feet
i would imagine in terms of size and so forth it's relatively typical for the area
there are several larger
based in terms of in that area of florida
it is
that's not too bad
it's
in terms of cost and size and so forth it
the housing there is extremely affordable compared to other parts of the country
you're kidding
what it's
i really haven't
when we built it ten years ago it ran around a hundred and forty thousand dollars
it sounds like
from the way you described it a home like that here would be at least two hundred and fifty thousand
dallas is a very marked up
because of all the layoffs and everything
there's been tremendous amounts of layoffs
really housing is real bad
housing is still real bad
pensacola has
it isn't because of the
perhaps not in dallas
i'm sure people in galveston and so forth would be knowledgeable about it
home porting was a possibility a few years ago
a new carrier was coming in and the attendant support vessels
that's no longer
do you think
it is
the number of single family units on sale is phenomenal compared to the population
i-
overbuilding has been a real problem there
you can still get a good house for a very very reasonable price
None
we have no basement
up north and everything do
anyway
most of the houses around here were built pretty much the same style
we have a friend that lives two blocks over
his house is almost identical to us except his is three bedrooms and ours is four otherwise the layout is pretty much the same
i think most of them are
most areas that are built
there were probably two or three styles you could choose from
that's pretty much all the houses in the area
i just
they bought their home
they paid like
they had it built from
they designed it and everything
when they left the area they sold it for a hundred and twenty thousand
that's not unusual yeah
i just wondered if the whole area was like that
i was just looking
for example there is a condominium complex next to the apartment complex where i live
i was over there recently looking at the possibility of buying a two bedroom condominium
it was very nicely done
i can't envision spending that much money
it's
i guess you pay the piper
the taxes around here are phenomenally
for the
you on that
it's not unusual for example for somewhere around here on a
what you described as your house and what i would describe as my house
maybe a little bit higher than that now
that same house here you'd pay almost six thousand dollars a year
it's
the question of whether to buy here or move to another county say drive
the taxes would be
it's really sad
this is one of the most highly taxed areas in the country
the cost of living around here is so high
i'm not
this is the figure
by administrator i think i mean
they did not define it
what do you think about it
most of the stuff up until now in the recent months i don't have any problem with
it's
it
i agree with that as far as the mess that's developing as a result
as a country the united states
i think our hands are tied as far as any further involvement
i heard a comment on the radio this morning that it gets to a point where if enough people are going to be slaughtered over there over the internal problems somebody may step in again
i really think it's a u n issue
the funny thing i find about american opinion is that when we have gone in to destabilize a government before the american public goes crazy
now the fact that we're not interfering with the internal rebellion in iraq they're going crazy
i think that i agree with you
that's an internal problem to iraq
until he starts doing something so inhumane that the u n gets involved then it's nobody's business
these types of internal things go on all over the world all the time
yeah
some of them have been going on for tens of years
if i understand it right in places like the sudan and
it's certainly been going on over there for hundreds of years
it's going to continue
as long as you have so many diverse groups that are vying for power it's going to happen all the time
the kurds have tried it before
this is just another time that it's happening
that's absolutely right
they'll regroup out in the mountains
they'll try it again in a couple of years
it was
you
i don't have any doubt that through some back channels we encouraged it
i'm not real sure that we promised them anything
i don't think we did it
it really doesn't make any difference
this is just another chapter in middle eastern history
there are many of them
the british occupied the place
it's happened so many times
this is really nothing special
so many of the conflicts really don't have a basis in politics or human rights or anything like that
it's mostly religious anyway
by self-proclamation this is a holy war
it is right
we go on from there
it's a mess
i think one of the big problems
looking at it from the american public's standpoints they don't understand the middle easterners
their politics really isn't politics
there's a big difference
we sit there
we think that they think the way we think
that's a big mistake
there's a complete different set of values
there's different value placed on human life
right down the list possessions and everything else
what's right is wrong and what's wrong is right in some cases
that's it a lot of the time
i was stationed in turkey for a year and a half
it was tough
understanding those folks
they're so completely different culturally and socially and religiously
it was very strange
i can believe that
i don't claim to have an in-depth understanding by any means
shoot i think some of these people that they claim as middle eastern experts don't have a clue sometimes
they sit there and read their books and then proclaim themselves an expert
i'm not real sure that's appropriate
that's
a little bit of background study has never made an expert in any field
i sort
we make experts by reading books
the japanese and the germans and everybody else make experts by doing
i guess you work for t i
you guys are well aware of the problems with the japanese markets and everything else
it's like our car industry
the only reason our car industry hasn't gone down the tubes is because the japanese came into it and helped
it's an overall problem in this country understanding foreign cultures
it bites us over and over
the
until we start changing our educational system we're going to be
we've already been overtaken
it's going to get even worse later
looks who's getting the engineering degrees and the the math and the science and everything
we've got folks running around here who get degrees in basket weaving and underwater psychology
or some ridiculous stuff like that
where are the engineers coming from
they're coming from various places
a lot of them are going back there
my roommate is a
it's not industrial engineering
his degree was in industrial engineering
he's from the philippines
the only reason he came here was because the education is so much better for those who will go after it
i see it all too often
we've got loads of foreign students they're coming here going after the hard degrees
they're going back to korea and japan
they're applying it there
to me it's amazing
we're going to become dependent on these other folks sooner or later
every
the country's got a problem with quarterly reports and annual statements and things like that
the long-range views are just kind of become a thing of the past
i don't think there can be anymore long range planning
i think it's sticking your finger in the holes in the dike
here's a crisis
let's plug it up
that's the way things have gotten
i wonder
i read in the paper just last week i b m's unveiling their new laptop computer
at a price tag of six thousand bucks i don't know if they're going to have a whole lot of takers
now i have the i b m p s two i'm sorry i got it
there are many better machines on the market right now for a
the only reason i got it is because i got it through an educational purchase plan through the school i saved forty-eight percent
i said if i can have an i b m for forty-eight percent discount i'll take it
up to that point i had always said i would never have one because i wouldn't pay that kind of money for their name
now you watch
unfortunately the way the high tech market goes by the time you can get something in your hands
it's obsolete
we fight that battle every day here at work
i can imagine
years ago i remember when i had a t i ninety-nine
things just kept changing so much
i kept getting rid of them
i finally said you can't do this
i just
at an opportune time i got one that suited my needs
i've just stuck with it
the only thing i've done to it is just add a mouse and a hard drive
that's all i plan to do
i'm stuck with six forty
i'm not a power user
it doesn't matter
that's the key whatever works for you
if it does the job then that's what you need
my roomie on the other hand he is a power user
he's looking now to get rid of his
this kind of stuff
i don't know what the last thing i've done as far as car repairs go is change oil and filter and that kind of stuff
i haven't gotten really involved in anything extensive in car repairs in probably a year or so
i had a similar thing that i've worked on cars ever since i was a kid
that was some time ago
i've gotten to the point where the newer cars are getting so complicated to work on that most of the cars
i try to buy as simple a car as possible
changing the oil changing the spark plugs
there's
most of them now you don't go through the ignition stuff anymore because that's all solid state or fuel injected
there goes the carburetor
if the fuel injection system breaks down
somebody once said i had a car that said fuel injection on the side of it
a woman asked me what that meant
i said that means that i can't work on it
they've gotten so complicated or so high tech that average guys can't really go out in the garage and do a whole lot of repairs
i've got an eighty-four chevy van that's a one ton van with a camper conversion on it
it's got the good old three fifty
that engine i understand
i can actually work on that engine
i used to have chevy van
that had the three fifty in it
basically it was a motor
you didn't have all the other junk around it
you could get to it to work on it
it was really fairly easy
you can just stand there and work on it
the hardest part about water pump changes is getting all the junk off before you can get too it
that's true
you're right
that's kind of the way i was
i don't think i had too many nuts and bolts left over when i got it all put back together
the
i bought it when we were living in lubbock
i don't know diesels got pretty unpopular
you couldn't sell the thi-
though for what you could get for one
the injector pump went bad
i found a outfit down here to rebuild it
and reinstalled that
that was probably one of the most miserable things i had gotten into in a long time
i-
that's true
i think the closest thing i've come to a diesel is i've worked for a tractor repair shop when i was in high school
we used to overhaul farm tractors basically
they were nearly all diesel
as far as cars i've never never been involved with them
the injector nozzle and stuff in the big diesel farm tractors are about the size of your thumb
yeah
you can get to them
the ones in the diesel cars were little tiny things and just almost impossible to do anything with
i finally gave it to my son
he drove it literally into the ground
he finished it off
i guess you're right
the diesel has almost fallen into unpopular status
i'm beginning to wonder where do you get gas at
i don't know if it's still limited like it was
i don't notice
maybe because i'm not looking for it
i'd bought a g m c diesel pickup and loved that thing
it turns out a pickup wasn't what i really needed
it was the van that i needed then to buy the
sure enjoyed it
you got the three fifty in the van
i'm convinced that detroit or whoever it is made a major mistake
i'm convinced that the small v eight like the mustang's original two eighty-nine or some of the chevy two eighty-threes
they had enough power t- pull all this weight
the four cylinders just don't have it
i think the little chevy v eight when it started out in fifty-five i think was two sixty-five something like that
little not whole lot more than the six cylinder that i think was like about two thirty-five or so
i think those little v eights could have been made to be pretty powerful little engines if they would have gone with it
that was a short stroke engine it could really wind up
it was normally carbureted
it's fairly easy to work with because there's not just a whole lot in it to go wrong
changing the plugs and stuff
my first car was a fifty-six mustang
over the years all
i had a dodge pickup several years ago
i can't remember the size of the engine
it was a three seven or something like that
i remember working on those cars
there was basically nothing in there but an engine
the friend of ours over here he's got sixty-five or sixty-six mustang the six cylinder
i was look under the hood of that the other day
like you say you can see the road
if you had to you could climb up in there and do what you needed to
you could stand in there if you really wanted to i guess
my dad's got a new
i guess it's an eighty-nine or ninety chrysler something or other
he was showing it to me
we're looking under the hood and everything's nice and clean
you can see the three spark plugs there in the front
i said where are the other three
he'd never really thought about it
he says hopefully i won't have to change them before i trade it off
they just about complicated the things so much that shade tree mechanics can't do much with them
when they went to the
started with the newer engines
when they started putting all that pollution control stuff on the older engines is where they started getting into so much trouble because the three fifty with all the
actually i guess her-
the three oh five was that
v eight that they put in the three quarter and half ton van
it had all the air pump and
all that stuff
all the anti-smog stuff
boy that was really a mess back under there in that van
all that stuff loads the motor down
it's trying to push the weight plus have all this drain on it from all sorts of belts and things
that's one good thing
i've got a eight ninety chevy blazer now
it's got one belt on it a serpentine belt
it's that one that's about what an inch and a half wide
it looks like it would be better than having
i had to get all those off when i was replace that water pump
i had to struggle with that for a while to figure which belt goes where
when one of them breaks
it's usually that power steering be-
something that's way back in there
it's a pleasure meeting you
we'll
i've got five stickers here from t i
i guess i've done probably i'd say seven or eight of them
i hadn't gotten any calls here in the last
i don't know if it's tapering off or what
if it's winding down or what
i had a difficult time the past couple of times of getting answers
it sounds
it's taken them fifteen minutes at a time
people are either not
let you go
do you do a lot of cooking in your family
i do some every now and then
i work
my wife's home during the day
she usually ends up doing most of it
do you like to cook
there's a few dishes
i grew up with having polish and ukrainian food
my wife she likes italian and stuff
we definitely have different tastes
that's neat though because you get to have different stuff
i'm a pretty bad cook
he's much better cook than i am
when i was home i still cooked a lot
i was in to a lot of vegetarian stuff
now i went back to work about a year and a half ago
one of the things that he took over was the cooking
the kids are thrilled
one is nine months
the other is two and a half
two and half
that's the hard part is cooking with kids around becau-
are you not at that stage yet
we try our hardest to get them to eat what we eat
my sister she's the master of the fast order grill
she makes six different meals
my gosh
like to have one thing
my gosh
she makes noodles with
soy sauce or whatever
all things
yeah
i was thinking of the one recipe that we made
that was
scallop
you pour it over rice
what is that saint jack or something
it was basically just ground up swiss cheese and then standard cream sauce base and then the scallops
it sounds sort of funny
it tastes really good
we had a lot of seafood before we moved down here
that sounds delicious to me
we're just thinking of having a dinner party
they had a murder mystery
you came dressed as one of the characters
you had to solve the mystery during the dinner
it was really fun
we were going to try doing it ourselves
we're trying to decide what can we serve because at this one the hostess was pretty busy running around trying to get stuff ready for the table
that kind of interrupted the game
i was thinking there's this beef bourguignonne recipe that i've tried before that's pretty good
you can make that ahead
you can just leave it in the pot on a stove until you're ready
that's
she doesn't like the beef dishes
like i said we always ate beef and pork
a lot
they always made sure they had a lot of meat at the table
my dad could eat a meal with out any vegetables at all
my gosh
susan's they had meatless meals
do you
they did the
they sort of come with the
my family didn't
when i got into the vegetarian cooking we got kind of used to that
my husband always did it kind of grudgingly
there were several things that he liked
it never was really something that he would have chosen
he had to put up with it
there was one thing that he couldn't stand
that was soybeans
he just could not eat it
i never
i like them every now and then for a change
it's nice
it was a tremendous amount of cooking
you do have to make sure you have the right combinations of different proteins to make sure they're complete
we had little kids at the time
when i was home with them and it was just so much cooking
i don't like to cook
i'm not really that great at it
it just turned out to be
do you get into that
we used to do that
my mom used to go crazy every sunday until my dad like blew up
after he gained about eighty pounds after coming back from the navy she stopped doing it
she used to have two dozen sticky buns three bread rolls every week
the sticky buns of course would last three or four days
that would be it
i don't mind baking at all
i can do a pretty good pie
my mother taught me how to make it
i can make a pretty mean pie
i don't do it anymore because it's just too fattening
it's supposed to save you money
you eat like three times the amount of bread that you usually eat
we had that bread that was
you ever seen the starter bread
they call it the amish bread here
yeah
it's made with
you just leave it out
you let it spoil sort of
i've heard of it
i've never done it
yeah
it's the sort of thing where you let a portion of it go bad
you add all these other ingredients to it
you make the bread
you pinch off a portion or save a portion of it for the next time or something
you take some of the batter out and give it to someone else
that's how they continue the thing
i know it always sounded
i figure you're baking it
yeah
that's got to kill anything i guess
i'll talk to you later
must be a t i connection
i thought for sure you were in dallas or something
i talked to so many people from texas
i think that's why they call me because they want to get people outside the state
they're trying to get all different amount of people
gee my husband is from richmond
i went to u v a
really
i went to school at west virginia university
you did
i grew up right here in falls church right outside d c
one of my friends here he was just talking how he's thinking of leaving the company and going to dallas
things are doing pretty good down here
we tried to move over to raleigh last year
there was such little going on in raleigh
we decided we'll try in a couple of years
business is
we were saying we could sell our house here and buy one down there cash
you probably could
northern virginia
it's good talking to you
i don't know what you think about the subject
the i had never really thought of what they said before about allowing the sentencing to go to the judge instead of the jury and allowing him to do that
i don't know that that's not a good idea
that
they probably need to change it somehow
and are putting too many people in jail that probably don't need to be there
it's another form of sentencing
on that one thing i still think it should be a unanimous decision
i think we're getting to the point now where they're going to eventually let it be majority vote
that's not going to be good
i know my husband served on a jury a few months ago up here in denton
it was a drug conviction
i don't remember
he had some cocaine and was accused of selling it
i don't remember exactly how much he had
not selling it
couriering it is what
he sat on that jury
they found him guilty
they went through the sentencing phase and everything
they were told that during the trial that this is this guy's first offense
he's got this clean record
they ended up
the jury decided it's time to crackdown here
it was time to do this drug thing
let's crackdown
let's really
they sentenced him to fifteen years
which they thought that that was a good thing
they sentencing him to fifteen years
after it was all over they sit down with the judge and with the other two lawyers
they were told that he would probably serve three
however they could not tell the jury that during the trial because all three of them were in appeal
the jury didn't know about it
here they based their sentencing thinking that this was this guy's first offense
we'll give him fifteen which will teach him a lesson
it's just horrible
he'd been convicted three times before
the jury was very upset
my husband came home very upset
he felt that they had been tricked
something
i wonder if a judge didn't have control of that if some of that would change
at least it wouldn't hurt to switch over there and see if it worked any better
what we've got
we definitely need a change in the system
obviously what we are doing is not working
there's people in our prisons that are not being rehabilitated in any way shape or form
either they're in there
forever or when they get out it's a matter of a few months
they're going to be right back for the same thing
the system
we're just a society not willing to spend the time or the money to do what it takes
i said i understand that there are a lot of countries that rely on the united states to
the people in those countries rely on our money to survive
i really believe that we need to take care of ourselves
we
the-
i know people say it would be cruel to pull our aid from these other countries
maybe so
tell them you've got five years
we will continue funding you for the next two years
after two years we'll cut it down seventy-five percent
after another year we'll cut it fifty percent
in five years it sh-
by then you all should have a plan worked where you can make it on your own without our help
we will have the money if we would do that to work on your own system because we've got some serious problems here
we're trying to
heal the world
it's just not working
i look at the aid presented to the kurds
i feel sorry for them
i know they're suffering
i know they're dying everyday
we've got kids here in the united states that are dying everyday too
and being
i don't know
trying to heal the world when you're so sick yourself
we seem to agree on the jury thing
we'll need an unanimous verdict
i think it would be a good idea to try it
we all agree
i own a p c a t at my home
i could never justify owning a personal computer at home
that's quite an expense to look for
who is this
that's actually a good question
my wife works out of our home
in fact she sits in the office
she uses it to compose and print out letters
that's a very regular use of it that she has
in addition to that i tinker around with it
i write programs to do little things
also i'm interested in writing some programs that will kind of remind me of things like remind me that wednesdays is trash day and the like
None
years ago t i sent me to their computer school down in austin
i learned to repair one
i never really learned to operate one
that's a key thing
that's a
that yo-
if they were careful they could make the use of it totally without understanding how the computer works
i think you you really hit the nail on the head
if your wife isn't working out of the home and sending letters
if you don't want to build a data base to keep track of the
your issue is then there really
space is a handicap with me
i see
i'm preparing for retirement
congratulations on that
i'm not to far from it another year and a half
actually one other thing i might ought to mention is that they are actually getting quite cheap
just like the computers
remember how they started out running three four hundred dollars
the calculators you mean
calculators
i wasn't including a printer
you can buy a printer now for a hundred dollars
make it seven hundred
of not being particularly interested i don't keep track of prices on them
that does amaze me
you can buy just the guts with the power supply
the keyboard is another fifty
the disk drive is two fifty
what is a good brand a inexpensive
that's the deal is you're not buying brands now
it's twelve inches the narrow side and seventeen inches the tall side
it's probably an inch thick a thousand pages
the magazine is full of these computer mail-order houses
they're all competing with each
you just flip through there until you find a
it's the original p c
we call an i b m p c compatible
you'll find the monitors forty dollars and the card that drives the monitor that goes in the back of the board for twenty-five dollars which is amazing to me
you mix and match
you do it by mail-order
there's no real brands
they're available in the b daltons that type of thing
you'll notice that although it's a magazine it's large
like i said it's about an inch thick
getting back to the p c
they are pretty stupid because they add one and one up and come up with ten
anyway that's one ever my favorite jokes
course it's kind of an inside joke
do you work with a computers at t i
i was a scientist over in central research labs
just recently i've changed my job to actually do some of the marketing
now i type that one
i don't use it anymore
i just recently started using one
i keep track of an inventory here
of course now that is where a computer is very handy
it's my responsibility to see that equipment is sent off to be calibrated
i'm with the q r a lab
i see
naturally our equipment has to be in top condition and is constantly calibrated
they're dated
i have to keep up with them
it's very handy doing it on the computer
it puts me right up-to-date what i have to do what i have to ship what i should be expecting to be returned
it is handy
i must admit that up until i did start using one i had very little interest in computers
they are amazing
let's see
i guess with respect to the question
i guess i've had to return something
can't decide
i'm not sure whether i've had to return that many things
i'm having a problem right now with a computer that we've just returned
are you
for me it's actually a pretty good topic
we'll talk about that some
we could talk about that
we could talk a bit about just quality of products in general
if they're better or worse like if they last longer or something like that
for years i did all that shopping and whatnot
for the last four or five years i've had eye problem
i've had two cornea transplants
i don't
i can't see good enough
it's hard to tell what i'm doing
it's just aggrav-
you can't
i just thought of something we have to return
it'll come to us
all right
we bought a computer because my husband needed to use it to do some work for a consulting project
we called up the company and asked them details on it
we bought not a name brand because the clones are so much cheaper
we called up the company that somebody else we knew had dealt with
they were very happy with the system
they felt they've gotten a good price
we went in
we had to go across the george washington bridge to new jersey to meet these people
we went there
the guy said that the computer would fit our needs
he told us
it's called a user boards
slots is what it's called
he told us there's four sixteen bit slots and two eight bit slots available for the user
we can put full size cards in there
we said great
we put in our order
a week later we went back and picked up the computer
we got it home and tried to put our own board in it
there's only one slot we could put it in
at this point we only have one board
it wasn't so bad
we used it a bit
we tried to figure out whether we could put three in because we really need to be able to put at least three in
it has them
the problem is that you can't put the type of card that we need to put in it in it
i see
even though they told us in advance that you could
they told us there would be no problem because
we went back in
we struck an agreement with the people
they did that
we said are you sure this will work
they were doing it at their own costs
we said fine
we went back
we talked to the person a second time and things like that
we get the computer home
we couldn't go get it sooner because i just had the baby
life's just a little bit complicated
he goes and gets it brings it home
second thing we still can't put the boards in
now we're dealing with having to bring it back again
they say they can do something different and change some connectors
we hope so
it's a hassle
you know it's just this problem with sales people just not knowing what goes on
much time goes past before you finally get any kind of satisfaction
some things are pretty good with that because i put it on a gold credit card
i just called the credit card company and explained to them the situation
they said you don't have to pay for it yet
that's an advantage isn't it
i think there's a lot not to be said for credit
that's one thing to be said for credit
None
i think that's really important
these guys if they give us a hard time we're going to say you look
if you can't fix this to our satisfaction
if we do that
they'll just
hal bought me small
i have my ninety-three year old mother living with us
she doesn't remember anything
to keep her entertained music and some of these things do help
i thought if i had a nice little tape recorder so that i could put some good music on in there for her every once in a while and then also so that i do some musicals and things like this and if i can copy sections off that i can use someplace i figured this will be good
the first time i turned it on i was recording
the next thing i knew the tape was chewed up in the
after that then
on the other side when i loaned it to my daughter the other day to take it over to videotaping they were doing
she says it's wrong too because the little thing pokes out too far
you can't get it to run the right way
i wish i could tell you
i was wondering
i was wondering if you
i think this is maybe a name brand
i suspect that it's probably
we're going to just take it back
i think it was like a highlands or something like this
this was a regular electronics store
i don't think there will be too much problem
i guess i'm not sure whether i think things are not made as well
i think they deliberately sometimes
what are you
wel-
None
i like electronic stuff
for one thing i know their work
the fact that they have competition with the japanese and whatnot sometimes dwells on a fact that
i've known people who have had toyotas for years that have had almost no repair work to do on them
they may cost a little more
they don't have to take them to the shop every other day
i loved it
it did a good job
part of it is that we need to develop more of a pride in the kinds of things we do so we make them better
it kind of has to start from the top or from the bottom maybe and go clear up
i think part of the problem comes in sort of shoddy workmanship
the whole
nobody cares nobody's
attitude is just get me my dollar so i can go do what i want to do and on
it's a shame too because when you get right down to it most things if you do a good job nobody can pay you enough
if you do a good job you feel enough satisfaction
whatever you're paid is enough
also i think
i do research
i'm used to sort of being underpaid for whatever work gets done
you get satisfaction out of it
i think they underestimate how much value the satisfaction
i think things come both from the individual side and also from the company side
the companies that give the attitude that
you'll be the first one fired
we just want you to do your days work
we don't really care about you
it probably basically goes right back into the home though unfortunately
starts with the one person that
you need to really work hard at helping your kids to understand that there is value just in work for itself without any pay
that the value is in doing it well
right at the intersection of the busiest highway in the state and a north south tollway
it's the looper that goes around the city the tollway is called the dallas north tollway
is that right
just moved here about a month ago after twenty-one years two miles to the east
how about that
it's a very different house from the typical dallas
it's a duplex type thing
very modern and very open and light
it's different than the long texas ramblers
we live in a brick story and a half
have a big sun room on the back of it
it's got a lot of openness and light also
it doesn't
that's what my wife really wanted
None
our last house wasn't too bad
it was just too traditional
if
the next time probably a year and a half from now we're going to try to build
make one really contemporary and and very modern and very open and very light
they usually get back at least two of them for the summer
we have a lot less than we had
it's about twenty-five hundred square feet
that's good size
we had
it has one wing built on that's a kitchen family room and then the big room on the back
we had four bedrooms two and a half baths in the place we just left
now we're down to two and two
it won't be terribly wonderful when the kids are home
it won't be that long because we not sure how long they're going to stay or whatever
i was just reading an article that there were nineteen thousand properties available in texas for sale by the resolution trust corporation
if you can find one in the right area you can really pick up a steal
i guess so
we really didn't go that route and didn't look
the planning of them
the housing market probably still going to even go lower
there are many houses for sale just by the regular route
we just decided sell
we got a pretty good price for what we had
not as good as it would have been say three or four years ago
that was just the timing
our daughter and son-in-law moved back up here about a year and a half ago
they never did sell it
they stayed six months
she got her job back he got a job down there
that's a good example of it
we've been here for twenty-five years
my wife's from kansas
i teach at a college here
it's sort of home now
i'm at it's called brookhaven college
it's just about two miles to the west of where i'm living
it's very nice
richland college it serves richardson and garland
that's about nine miles to the east of here
it's good to hear from you
i enjoyed talking to you
i hope we did them some good on their little computer dealy
have a good life the rest of it
what changes do you think have taken place in the last generation
few are basically staying home and being homemakers and raising kids exclusively
i grew up in sixties and early seventies
my mom didn't work at all when i was growing up
she didn't start working until i was well into high school
i had the advantage of having a mom at home that nowadays it's a luxury item for mothers to be home with their kids
mine taught kindergarten
she was always
she was always
that statistic i guess has been growing every year
i'm not sure what the future holds for that
it seems that there's a grass roots effort or whatever going on
i clean houses part-time
almost all the people that i clean for believe it or not are mothers that don't work
they're all
i think it's kind of a new movement
it's going back towards
they're wanting to go back to the old days where women stayed home with the kids and try to give the kids quality time
i think you're going to see a lot more women choosing to not work after they have a baby
i think with the salaries that
a lot of the women that i work for have husbands who are vice-presidents of companies
i think with this it seems like it's more the upper-class people
i don't see it as much like in my situation where i don't have children yet
ideally i would like to be able to stay home with my kids
realistically i'm realizing that's probably not going to be possible for middle-class people to be able to live just on one income
it's going to
the quarter of a million dollar home or whatever
believe it or not though all the women that stay home are real busy when they are home
they're real active in volunteer work
one of the women is real active with muscular dystrophy and does a lot of work with them on a volunteer basis
it's almost like a job
i guess that's good that they've got something to keep them active
when your wife has her baby is she going to stay home
is she going to
we're going to try and have her stay home for as long as possible
that
i would like to be able to do that
we think it's that important
i kind of hope that the trend goes back in that direction
i'm a counselor and a therapist
i work with adolescents
i see some of the problems the kids have when they don't have a real good family structure
i see a difference in even the generation before me
were mom was like june cleaver or whatever
where the attitudes were a lot different
as far as i think the kids back then seemed to be a lot more
there wasn't a lot of the drugs and alcohol and
a lot of the things that are going on in today's society
i think morally it seems like people were a lot better back then as far as higher standards
the husbands' roles are almost nonexistent in family anymore in terms of being the father figure
with women working so much they're kind of pulled out of it too
kids are raised around their friends and by the media
that's contributed
i think you're going to see a lot more of that in the future
if there was some way for women to stay home even if they could work
and those types of things that would at least in some ways bridge the gap
i think that in the future the family unit as it once was known is going to be nonexistent
what do you think
do you think there's going to be still a family unit
do you think that the trend is going more towards single parenting
the divorce rate keeps hovering around fifty percent or so
it got higher than that for a while
that's hard to say
i see a lot of families where
in the back
back in those times we pretty much were taught how to be responsible
nowadays it's not the case
kids are bombarded with all kinds of junk
one of the reasons i guess is because there's so much more income in the family with both parents working
they don't have to do anything around the house
they come back
you got twenty and thirty year olds who are living at home with mom and dad
you create a bigger family generation after generation but not really on purpose
it's not a real functional situation anyway
i don't know that that trend's going to change the single parent type families
the families as long as we've got so many other crazy things going on in society
i think that eventually the family unit's just not going to even exist anymore
like you said the divorce rate is getting so high that i think there's going to be more single parent families than there are two parent families
i guess unless there's a major swing in the change of what's important to people probably keep going downhill
i i don't know
we feel that we can make it on one income
it may be tough
we may have to give up on some things
i think in the long run though your child will benefit from that
it will make the strain worthwhile
i need to go ahead and wrap it up
it was really nice talking to you
i've enjoyed it stephanie
thanks a lot
have you grown up in dallas stephanie
i've only been here for the last ten years
where are you from
we took a lot of vacations while we were there because everything was within driving distance
there's a place i'd like to visit
we travelled all over europe
that's neat
when i was very young unfortunately a little bit too young to really appreciate
i was grade school age
my husband took a bicycle tour about five months right after the second world war
we've seen lots of pictures of the beautiful
that would be to me a really nice vacation because i'm not in physical shape for something like that but i sure would work on it
that's neat
my husband and i are scuba divers
we both like to go to dive resorts
we went to hawaii on our honeymoon
we dove there
we did about six dives while we were there
we were originally planning on going to cayman
last year we weren't able to get enough people together for the trip
we had to have eleven people for
this package deal
we couldn't get enough people together to go
it ended up falling through
when our children were younger we lived up in new jersey and used to like traveling into upstate new york and camping we had a little collapsible sailboat and liked to sail and that sort of thing
we've never really did any diving or anything
little bit of
water skiing
not much
my husband and i both like water
any vacation that we go on is usually
close to the ocean
or something like that
when we were in jersey we used to go down to the jersey beach a lot and really enjoyed that a lot
they had
after we moved away from germany we moved to new hampshire
i lived there for seven years
i see
i really enjoyed that because the mountains were real close
we like the white mountains
unfortunately i didn't really get to go skiing much while i was there
we loved the new jersey area too because
you could drive within twenty minutes to an hour
then we weren't too for from the appalachian trail
are you a hiker or not
not so much
not really so much
if there was some place that we went to where there was hiking involved i would be happy to go hiking
your plans are try to find someplace to scuba dive
our next vacation will be scuba diving
some of the things are not quite as adaptable
it's a little more difficult planning a vacation
when you have children
i think wha-
diving is something that
especially for small children
i think the minimum age for diving legal anyway would be probably about sixteen
maybe fifteen even
i know that one thing that happens to vacation trips now is that usually that try to involve some of the members of the family
we go wherever somebody is
that's kind of
we just came back from grand rapids where we saw one of our sons graduate
with his master's degree in social work
that was fun
the summer we have a reunion in salt lake area up by park cities
where we're going to camp for a week with as many members of a rather large reunion group as we can get together
that sounds like a lot of fun
that there were several hundred people
they all kind of met at a central place
i didn't go
it would have been a nice vacation
we've moved around enough so that we now have people in different parts of the country
i guess my favorite vacation idea would be to somehow figure out something kind of mobile where you could stop and sleep maybe like a small camper
we've travelled in a big one
maybe a pickup with the back on
something like the volkswagen vanagon
you could kind of sleep in it sometimes
you wouldn't want to do it all the time
we have enough friends here and there
and visit for a day and then go on and
my dad has been talking for years about getting a fifth wheel and just picking up
he's retired he's in his sixties
he would like to just get a fifth wheel and just travel across the country and spend a month here or a couple of weeks there
and just not
i would like to maybe not take great long trips but have your home base where your home is and then just travel out for maybe a month maybe go
he does that quite a bit
he hasn't lately though because he's been ill
he's been known to be gone for a month or two at a time
he'll say this is my itinerary
i'll be back in about two months
there are a lot of neat places to visit in america
i haven't been much to the south
i haven't been in georgia or florida or mississippi or alabama
i guess those are the only states i have not visited
up the coast in maryland and around there where the early history is there's some
johnstown and in that area is just really neat
None
have you been to a lot of the different historical sites
we took a trip around to the civil war battle grounds and things back in nineteen sixty when it was the centennial or something
had about three kids then i think
that was a really fun interesting trip
we were ready to look up the places we read about
i think right now while my husband and i don't have any kids we'll probably take as many vacations as we can doing things like scuba diving and adventurous types of things
eventually when we have kids
his folks did a lot of traveling across country
they went to the grand canyon and did things like that
camping is fun with kids
even some little ones do pretty good
when they get a little bigger they can help
that's a fun way
it's enjoyable too
i find
i do enjoy camping
i find the outdoors very relaxing and kind of
i'm with you
it was great to talk to you
i have wallpaper in both of my bathrooms right now which is really pretty disgusting
it's a rent house
i decided it's too expensive to rewallpaper
i decided i'm going to paint
i've been buying some magazines and stuff and looking at different ways to paint
i'm thinking about maybe sponge painting them
what would be interesting
you get some beautiful effects with them
one of the books that i bought where it's describing the sponge painting said you can layer different colors
i've seen that done where there's
it had a little bit darker sort of peachy color
in between there was a sort of a rust put on very sparingly
it gave the impression of very old weathered stucco
what i'm trying to do is i've got yellow tile in both the bathrooms i want something that's going to tie that together
i'm changing the fixtures out to make them wood
it's going to have kind of a country look
i haven't even decided as far as what kind of paint to buy
i'm really in kind of the beginning stages right now
it's going to be a big experiment
because you might find that it's beyond what you're willing to put into it
i sure did my share of just regular painting
i've painted several houses inside
what kind of paint do you normally use
we used a latex wall paint and then a semigloss enamel for the woodwork
my job was mostly the woodwork
i got to do all of the masking tape and then all of the little fine trim work
where i'd use a small brush and try to keep the paint from dripping on the windows and things like that
only one of our bathroom has a window in it
i'm hoping that it won't be too much of a problem
i'm wondering if my bigger problem is getting the wallpaper taken down first because i think
i was going to ask if you planned to paint over it or try to strip it
i'm planning on taking it off
i tried to get wallpaper off once twenty years ago with a just a scraper and wet sponge
it took forever
that's something that's worthwhile checking into then 'cause i
if you can rent a steamer if it's modern wallpaper it should come off without too much trouble
it's hard to tell
i know the house was built around the mid fifties
it may be the original wallpaper
if it's vinyl it should be easier to strip too
in one bathroom it's probably paper
it's silver and yellow
the wallpaper that i was trying to remove was black
this was in a bathroom too
the tiles were sort of a mottled grey and had a little trim strip of maroon and white
the wallpaper in that bathroom had a black background
it had vivid almost neon colors of hot pink and turquoise and lime green and silver and a little bit of yellow that looked like coral sands and sea horses and things like that
that's kind of an odd color for a bathroom
it was awful
we had a dinner party before we started renovating it
a guest went in there
he said it's a good thing i went to the bathroom before dinner because if i had had something to drink and went in there i would think i was having hallucinations
after looking at all these design magazines and stuff i'm thinking about maybe painting the bedroom walls too in a color that will kind of tie in our comforter
with a color that's kind of a burgundy and green and yellow and blue and beige floral design
i'm not really quite sure
i'd say tackle one project first and see how it goes
if you discover you like it then you can always upscale
the bedroom would probably be the easier of the two because it would be just plain painting
it wouldn't be any kind of special effects type thing
it's not hard to do if you get everything prepared ahead of time
because if you use drop cloths to cover everything and you use masking tape to trim out all the parts that you don't want to slop over onto you don't have to be quite as precise about how you do it
it can be done a whole lot faster
with rollers and modern latex paints
they dry fast
you really don't have to be disrupted for more than about a weekend if you have some help
if you discover the little tricks and tips about how you get through corners and how you do trim and how long to leave the masking tape down because if you leave it too long and it dries it can flake when you pull it up
it peels the paint off when you take it off
if you leave it on for weeks it will do that
you want it to get dry but not just real hard
i was told
i've heard from people who tried to get by and skimp on narrow masking tape that it was more trouble than it was worth
because it rips as you pull it off for one thing
you end up tediously scraping these tiny little shreds of masking tape
the whole point of using it is to save yourself work
use good stuff and buy it at a paint store where they have the right brands
i really appreciate all the helpful tips
i think you just made my project a lot easier
i wish you very good luck with it
i will tell you that i have retired from the painting business
i decided that was too much to tackle
if you were closer i'd tell you you could come over and supervise
i hope your project turns out great
i really think that it's exciting that you're going to try the sponge painting
i think that could give it a
we'll see how it goes
of course that's the other advantage of paint
i need to go to the dentist
i think i get most of my news in headlines from the radio
i follow-up by reading the newspaper and news magazines about things that attract my attention
i do about the same i guess but in a different fashion
i'm from new york originally
that i live in florida
i live in the florida in the winter and then go back up north in the summertime i feel that the only legitimate paper
i try t-
i guess i do watch mcneil lehrer on p b s because i lean to that coverage
i guess i'm
they take so long
it's an hour show each evening
we turn it on when we start dinner
i find that i'm leaning on
i travel a great deal even overseas
i find that i lean on c n n quite a bit for concise and quick stuff
i'm quite satisfied with the way they put it out
i don't believe everything they say
it's coverage
they seemed to have the best coverage
i
peter arnet was reporting direct from iraq
i think he reported what he saw if you didn't like it that was just too bad
i know that the coverage he was allowed to present was slanted
i think they said that frequently enough
None
that you shouldn't criticize the man for giving us one perspective
that's right i think so
i guess when it comes to magazines i don't read
i have seemed to slide away from that and rely more on the local paper
i also subscribe to something called world press which is a magazine that only talks about other excerpts from the world press
that i guess and the radio
i listen to p b s radio a lot
i also listen to these twenty-four hour news stations when i'm driving
i'm from
what is that
the san francisco paper out there is
that's a terrible paper
i subscribe to the san jose mercury news
it's a whole lot better than that san francisco paper
what is that the chronicle isn't it
they're both run by the same peo-
they really are probably the worse papers i've ever read
i
they're just horrid we read
can you get the l a paper up there
we can
i don't like it
we subscribe to the new york times and the wall street journal and mercury news
that's another one i read
not as in depth as i used to because their articles seem to be getting even longer and longer
again i read that
i agree with you that the problem seems to be they don't have enough time to do all the stuff
i feel pretty well versed in what i'm doing because i do spend more time on that than i do say on sports
i find it very exciting for the coverage we have now today
i think we do get pretty good coverage
i don't feel that the american people is being shortchanged by the news coverage
if anything i think they list-
i don't know
i hear a lot of criticism about listening to these the dan rathers of the world and taking their word for it their comment
i think they slant things
i cannot stand dan rather
i hated him then
i would not watch that man for money
he and barbara walters just really turn my stomach
was he
i watch peter jennings and tom brokaw sort of alternately
i guess i got to say if the subject is do i feel that we're well enough equipped to
if it said that i feel i'm well enough equipped
do we get the news that we want
i do
i think you got to segregate some of it
that's about all i have to say
nice to talk to you
we
i think we do get quite a good value for the tax dollars we spend in most cases
i think so
i think i'm a little out of the ordinary in that i think i'm more worried about the national deficit than a lot of other people are and think that we need to either raise our taxes or cutback on something
i don't know what to cutback on to get that settled
None
i know i'm out of it in terms of taxes
i'm think that we really ought to seriously consider what an income tax might do for texas
at this stage i think we've taxed property almost to the limit because
the property taxes on the homes have reached the point that it's precluding people from being able to own a home because of the cost of the taxes on them
i live in richardson it's up over two thousand dollars a year for taxes on my house
now we're getting public services the schools the hospitals
if it weren't for the taxes we're putting in there look what the schools could cost you
now i
when we moved to richardson one of the reasons we chose it was for the schools and realizing that that quality of schools might well have higher taxes than other places but that we were willing to go for that
then again the community college system here is excellent for the dollar spent
the public
i don't know which one it is down there whether it's hobby or
if you double the tuition it would still be considerably less than the public school tuition in most other states
that would provide possibly some relief there to utilize some of the property taxes for other things
eventually i think you may tax people out of smoking even
i quit ten years ago
that would be true
i know
all the various taxing authorities that come through i think the one tax i resent the most though is the additional sales tax for dart which is probably never going to be in existence in my lifetime
even if it is isn't going to provide you with any services in that it's not doing to provide a route from your home to a business for instance
this is a thing
i think it's like back east
and had a public transportation system starting in the horse and buggy days and when land was cheap and construction costs were cheap you could afford it
the other thing is that when the public transportation is established that early on then the business and residential patterns develop to take advantage of that
whereas in dallas here those patterns were well established before we really tried to do the dart
for instance all the office buildings and stuff that are out here in north dallas as opposed to downtown
to try to provide efficient transportation from everywhere around the metroplex to both those centers of business plus everything else that's scattered around here and there as opposed to having a concentrated business area
like new york does
someone made the analogy with texans as being like the old cowboys and their horse
most texans will jump in their car to drive across the street
i'm just as guilty as anyone else
i drive to work every day by myself without even any thought of car pooling
here again i think i resented where they were collecting the sales tax for five years before they turned a spade of dirt
and doing all these studies and the things
the c-
that's about all i can say at this time
i think so
do you own a p c by the way
they live just about three miles away
we use that one
my in-laws also have one
they're almost as close
what kinds of things do you use it for when you go to them
usually word processing something
i have a nine year old that i've been home schooling for the last three years
we got
the one that my parents have is an apple two e
i have a sister-in-law who works in the fort worth school district
she got me copies of several of the apple for school programs
we use those
there's some
my husband has used the one at his folks house for mostly business things
his resume his letter
that type of thing forms for his photography business
i tell you once you get used to having them you get spoiled really quickly
they have a bunch of computers leftover from that we're hoping that they can put
they're kind of
i'm not sure that we'll be able to get too many other programs for it
i'm a writer by profession
when i was first here in dallas or in plano and i was finally able to afford a new typewriter and i got an i b m selectric i thought i had died and gone to heaven because
i thought they're so wonderful
then
then my husband worked at t i
he got
i learned wordstar on that
boy once that happened there was just no way that i could ever go back to doing anything of length of the typewriter
i learned wordstar
i did some typing for my father when he had the company i learned that on there too
have you ever used wordperfect
i guess i have used it once or twice
it's the one that's on my father-in-law's computer
that's the program that they're using there
i have that on my computer here
also i do some work at u t d
that's what they have there
it was just so nice to be able just to step into the position and already know the software
i don't know from my own experience
wordperfect is just so much better than wordstar at least the version of wordstar that i used to have
wordstar was never very intuitive to me
you
some of the commands just had nothing to do with what they did on the computer
like going forward and backward a word or up and down a line that sort of thing just didn't match with the kinds of keys
wordperfect is just a lot more intuitive in a lot of ways
it does a lot of things too that if you do any kind of research or anything like that where you have to use footnotes it is just wonderful
that's neat
if you put a footnote in the middle if you come up with some new piece of documentation and you put that in the middle of your paper and have to footnote it it just automatically changes all your footnoting numbers for you
how wonderful
i had heard that that was a better one
i think about how it used to be if you were doing a paper
it was just awful
i don't know i think we have just become really spoiled
i think
i have not really paid much attention because i
unless you have some other things you want to talk about as having to do with p c
what kind of things do you write
i was a technical writer for many years
my husband and i actually met in a computer company
i was a tech writer
he was an engineer i did tech writing for a number of years
you don't need to drag it down the hall
trying to figure out what all that was about
i have
that was the majority of my writing although i have also done free lance magazine writing and some educational writing
i did some advertising and p r
actually i'm not working anymore
i'm a graduate student
i'm doing a lot of writing
now all of the sc- scholastic majors though
i just know right now that i couldn't have put out half of what i did if that much without the being in computers
that's been really great
i'm real spoiled
they just talked the other day about setting something up again
hopefully pretty soon we'll at least have the word processing
those are skills that she certainly is going to need early on
None
i think that that would be a real advantage to her to have that and
d-
we've been writing a story together
i wanted her to put it into the computer
make a book with it
i decided if she's going to do that it would be a whole lot easier if she could type
we'll slowly learn just to type here put the story in
that's a skill that she can use for the rest of her life
might as well start now
nola i have enjoyed talking with you thoroughly
my husband is a ham radio operator
i think about all the people that he talks to all over the
steve did you go to college
that's good
you probably could give some great advice
i don't know about that
in fact i'm in the process of trying to choose a p h d school
what's your interest
computer science and cognitive science
that's similar to what
i see
my area of expertise it's information systems which is a little bit less technical i think than computer science
my area of expertise is human computer interaction
i think that's one reason why i'm part of this study because i'm working with voice systems
good luck
what type of advice do you think you'd give to a parent
the thing is when you're a kid and the kid at that age especially if they're going into undergraduate it seems like they think they know what they want
choosing from my experience i thought i know what i want a lot more than my parents know what i want
i don't know
the size of it or
i know very few people that started in one field and stayed with it
they
i think that's what you just said having to do more with the size of the school the environment of the school
i'd advise a parent to send a kid to a school though that has a number of different types of programs
that some of the smaller schools might be very limited in what they can offer
some of some of the larger small schools i guess around three or four thousand students can offer a broader range of curriculums and things
if the kid does change they don't have to transfer
they don't have to
i don't know they don't have to give up years of credit transfer and things
parents hate to hear this
i actually teach college
i hate to talk to the parents
i always say make sure you major
i think most employers would probably rather hire a three six
i always tell them that you should major in something you're going to get good grades in
because that's always i think more important overall
you're at the office now
would you advise a private school or a public school
what's the trade off there
it would
i tell you
the public schools here are
i know that the s a t scores for our admitting freshmen are higher than a lot of the private schools
i would full time at a public school
right now i'm teaching part time at a
i see
i think the kids are a little bit more challenged because their parents are probably college educated
where at the public school i don't think as many parents are college educated
i think because it costs less the kid doesn't take it quite as serious
th-
it's the minimal cost
i think you can also get a bad education at public or private
i you have to look around at the school
i think the bad part is that most parents or kids don't know what to look for
i think i would agree with that
in fact i'm going through the same thing where in graduate school
a particular institution might be better for my area the university of small town in arkansas or something
yet if i go to u of i or c m u or any big name school my quality of education might not be that much better
it's the same thing
there's what will the name recognition
yeah
is it a pac ten school
i think
i'm at the university of maryland in this region though i go to a smaller branch of the university of maryland my diploma will still say university of maryland
i think i'm actually at a smaller program
i'm not at the big college park campus
i think you're right that there's difficult decisions there based on name recognition
it's got big name recognition in this area a big science school no football team but a big science school
technical people know that
i don-
when i
i was in education at first when i was looking for jobs
most people recognized that institution because it was a teaching school sort of
then when i went
when i went into higher education even at other universities they weren't aware of it
i think yeah
i guess another thing that concerns me is it seems like everybody today is still in that job market
where was i at
in going to school you get taught the things you learn in school
there is also a whole other dimension the growing up while you're going to school part
actually in the midwest especially a lot of the schools like university of missouri will have a main campus like columbia which is big multi disciplinary
they'll have a satellite campus usually in a smaller town
you've really i guess sacrificed some social exposure to different groups and everything
i know that at university of maryland where i am in a p h d program i haven't even met someone outside of my area of information systems except for
it's not really on a regular basis
usually sometimes every few summers
all the family lives in once place except for a few of us are scattered about
they're pretty much just reunited always it's just once in a while we get the special gathering with everyone together
it might be a good time for you to start a tradition
in my family let's see last october was the forty fifth annual reunion
that's good
all of the descendants of the civil war veterans come together
they come as far away from california
there's usually
where do you meet
there's a big community hall in vernon
that seems to be sort of a middle ground for all of the texas family
all of his direct descendants have now died
the grandchildren are in their seventies and eighties
we're talking about second and third great children here
None
they're grown and gone from home now they take their family
it would be the second great grandchild
they
this town hall that you meet in is that like a
it's a community hall
you just bring the covered dishes
every family brings a dish of some kind
you get all the wonderful old family recipes
potato salad and
we try to stay away from those things which might have salmonella in them
that's good
we choose to bring congealed salad
most of us are very conscious of sanitation aspects
that's nice
that happens to be my specialty for that family
there are others in the family who do them better
that's good
i had a professor in anthropology at school who studied family reunions
i learned a lot about them
we talked
a lot about the rituals
it was an interesting theory
she talked about the catholics
it's all family centered anyway
you usually are living where your parents live
it's all
you don't have to come home
the catholics would make a pilgrimage in older europe
when the protestant ethic happened in america there were people who ever went out and went away from the family to seek their fortune and then had to come back home for their reunion so that
she had
it was interesting
she talked about that and how the big picnic table was the symbolic communion of the people gathering together and about the bread and the ritual placement
do you have a certain way that everything is placed out on the table every year
is there kind of a
it's
we have kind of a core group that serves as quote officers of the organization
they plan the reunions
the organize who is going to see to it that the coffee pot gets there who's going to rent the tables who's going to see to it that the silverware gets turned back to the caterer
each year it's done a little bit differently because different people serve in those roles
that's pretty
we have a biographer who continues every year to save clippings on any family member
they're entered into a wonderful scrap book and pictures of new babies and new people who have been added and and obituaries to those who are gone
it keeps the family alive
even though it's very fluid
they're very dedicated to that
it's been really wonderful
it helps you feel a strong sense of belonging
i got to talking to him
i said how is his nephew doing
i don't know
my son keeps in touch with him i think
i don't
i'm
i got busy got together and put a reunion together for his family
that's incredible
liked to kill me because i didn't have that group cooperation
nobody brought covered dishes
i fixed a salad in a number three tub
we had to provide sleeping arrangements for all of them
i told him
have you done this repetitively or just once
then the following summer we did not have all of the family there
it was when his step father had died the year before
his mother was alone they came to support her
one by one he began to lose family members
it was difficult to hold them together
of course he died two years ago
that family has gone down to one brother and one sister now
it
the family unit falls
was our problem
the first major reunion was probably six or seven years ago
the second reunion people who maybe had sacrificed things to come to the first one thought it's not that big a thing this year
it kind of wound down
finally you get the shreveport relatives there but no one else
those people who are at that core group manage to keep the vigor alive
hey guess who got elected to the legislature
guess who our local sheriff
i am assisting them with their children in their selections
my children are grown
they're teenagers i have three children ages fifteen seventeen and twenty i guess about when the youngest one was in kindergarten i started working at a preschool and doing some work
i took a couple of years off and then went back as a music teacher in a preschool
i am around not a day care situation but in the child care environment
i myself really feel like the structured day care program is more successful in today's environment than the one on one care is
when my children were growing up up until they were in the preschool situation i had them in a home with a lady who kept two or three kids
i felt like that home environment was very important to them
it was important to me i feel that they had that one on one that's so necessary at that age
it is
however in today's environment it may be more critical to have the ability to interact in large groups simply because that's the way our young people are dealt with
that's an interesting point of view
i
seeing the children in the school the way i do we can always tell the ones that have not been around children at all when they come in as three year olds as opposed to the ones that have been in the program that started at twelve months maybe and were even in there one day a week which is all our school provides for the under three year olds still they have an opportunity to be with other children it is true
absolutely without a doubt
as far as looking for a place i think it's very important to have very caring people to take care of the
i was sitting out in their little playground while my granddaughter was playing on the things and was visiting with another mother who was there with her children
she was telling me that she was given the opportunity to manage a day care center
of course she had just gotten her degree
she was so enthusiastic
she was excited about it
she was going to accomplish all of these things however when it came to hiring and staffing people who cared and who were willing to take care of those children and spend that kind of time the pay is minimal it takes people with total and complete dedication who really don't want to make a living for themselves in order to be in that environment
that maybe have another salary in their family where they can do that
that's what i had the opportunity of doing i could concentrate on the creativity and really having a lot of fun with the children and providing
they ask
so much of those caretakers for the amount that they pay
they are to be there ahead of time
they have to be there at sometimes six o'clock in the morning
then they have to work until the place closes at six p m
it's their responsibility to clean up and be prepared for the next day because they don't have cleaning crews in most of those
she just had a terrible time keeping sincerely dedicated people simply because they could not live with a kind of hours and the salary
she
ours is a church
we don't have the expenses of a building we share the expense with the church
we don't have enough taking care of a whole building and that responsibility
it is a lot different
i know that when my youngsters were small
my older son was adopted
my goodness
he went into child care at two weeks my younger son went into child care at six weeks
they were in that environment actually up until they became seven and nine
at that point i said look they have been given the custodial care that they need
the after hours care has been as good a quality as i can provide for them
you did
i quit working after my kids started to school and got involved in volunteer work in their private school so that i could help direct their learning experiences and their development
i felt like that anybody who cared and loved the kids could change their diapers and feed them and bathe them and hold them
when time came to direct their ability to make choices to develop the kinds of things that they're going to need to interact with other people i felt like i needed some strong influence there
i di-
that's different than most people do it
a lot of people do it really the reverse and go to work after the children are in school
i just felt very strongly about that
i did not work as a matter of fact
when he started at skyline high school i asked him son where do i go to sign up for the p t a
he said mom don't do that to me
i knew it was time to go back to work
i feel very good about spending those years with my boys
i was just really grateful i only had one bad child care experience
the care taker that they had had since they were infants just could not do it
she was from argentina she was going back home
i couldn't just wait for three or four months and then bring them back to her i had to find a new place i put them in this home
i could hear the kids crying when i went to pick them up they were always cranky and irritable i just took off and went there one day
the children were left unattended in a room
how awful
they were not well cared for it didn't take me long to take them out of that place that's the only bad experience i had
the rest of the time they stayed in la petite academy i was very pleased with their development and their progress
they're going to learn it sometime
for the most part they did have good care
it did appear to me that the people who cared for them had a good concern for them
in one particular case they had a summer program where they were to be taken to the y and taught to swim which just pleased me to death because i've always been afraid of the water however my older son came home
he said mom i don't like that man
she said kids do exaggerate
she said let's go ahead and send him another day or two days
i promise you faithfully i will watch the instructor every minute and see exactly what's happening
what were you saying
do you work around children when you work
you have friends that have children
i have some friends that have children not that many actually
i was a student for many years and then graduated and went and worked in france for awhile
i am just taking a little bit of time off right now
i might
i hope you can stay as long as possible with it
if i can do that
i might start to go crazy with it too
at the same time it would break my heart to give her to a stranger right now
i think it does when they are real little
they are changing every day
you just miss the little things
None
i do not think i would put her in day care for joint
situation right now unless it was one other child with a person
i would not want her to be in a large day care situation so young
maybe if i needed to work part time like four hours a day i might do that cause you should get enough stimulation from you the rest of the time
i just think that when there's two year olds running around the care givers are going to pay attention to the two year olds
only when the infant screams
if not the infant is going to lay in the crib all day and maybe have a mobile above it to play with
i play with her most of the time she is awake
i think that is so important
it is important for the bonding that they do it
such as things for learning gives the child stimulation i think is important
our oldest grandson when he was eighteen months old went into a montessori
they took infants starting at six weeks
they have a program that was devised by this montessori person
a certain type of stimulations
there's times of day that even when the child is awake that they lay quietly and look at certain things
they deliberately keep the room not real bright
they have different things they will put them down on the floor
of course they never have more than five
they will put them down on the floor
i think one of them was a little mirror
some were just different objects that had a definite purpose for kids
there's something about their eyes
she's just been doing all kinds of stuff where she's
she's just drastically moving her eyes from one side to another and things like that
she's just started that yesterday or the day before
every days are different
i think child care for infants is much harder than when they are older
i will probably be going back to work around january
i think she will be at a
you might have a real problem with that
i think it
i think it hurts the parents to leave when the child is crying
it would be ideal if you could get somebody in so you are not really
that's unusual
i am trying to leave her a fair amount even at this young age with her grandparents just to
it's a little bit harder
during
she's met them already
she's met them
that's nice when
i have three grandchildren
if they were where i could not get my hands on them i am afraid i would probably
i like that
if you do not have to put them in child care that's an ideal situation for you is to stay with them
you can set up your work program and your husband's so that one of you is there all the time
that's wonderful for the child
if i work part time that might be doable
if you do decide to go with child care you really need to look at what your options are and look at what they offer
since this is
i just find that incredible
my sister-in-law is going to have a baby
she is intending to stay home with the baby
maybe do some free lance type work at home
if i go back to work on a part time basis i am hoping i can leave my daughter with her
that would be wonderful
when she is a month or so
she might be able to do it a couple of hours a day
we might even be able to do it on a trade off basis that i watch
and not be bothered
we will just have to see how things work out
ideally
parents come down to supervise or
have some kind of real good program
set up so that when you go you can be assured that if there's an emergency that person in charge knows c p r or first aid
they adjust to what the parents
she's been staying up late at night and
you know that works until they start school
that's a problem
society is geared to a day person
i think i would like something like an economy car that gets really good mileage and one that's really reliable
i think probably not a brand new car
maybe something like a nissan sentra
or something like that
of course it has to have air-conditioning
air-conditioning and a radio a m f m and a cassette player
what else do i want
i would think kind of a subdued color would be nice
a navy blue or a
i don't think we're looking for another car right now because we just bought one
when we were looking we were looking for something that had enough seat belts of course
we wanted air-conditioning and a five speed
that was kind of iffy
that made it better economically
we'd look for about what you're looking for
probably real cheap too
no
i think we would want one that even though it was a compact car or whatever that it would still be nice enough that you could take someone in it and not be embarrassed
doesn't really matter
probably that would be a good idea
it's hard for people to get in with a two door sometimes
if we wanted it to take people out that's a good thought
i think that's all that we need to say
thank you for calling
what is your feeling
i think that it's kind of discouraging to
it's really discouraging to be in a phone bank and call people and not
a lot of them are so ill informed they have no idea even that there's an election
these are people that are registered
it's the most discouraging thing in the world
up there if they miss three elections then they have to reregister
i have often wondered if maybe that would help the situation
that's a thought
can you come up with anything else that maybe we could do to these people
i like that idea
i had a thought just a second ago
it slipped my mind
probably one of the reasons that people don't vote more is because they don't know the candidates
i think sometimes
that's one thing that i have learned working in elections and things is sometimes even when you work for someone you don't really know what they're like
when they got in office it was just a disaster
i'm not sure how you go about really finding out what people are really like before you vote for them
i'm not sur-
it is
i'm going to vote each time
if i'm unhappy with it i have the right to express my opinion
there was something else i was going to
i'm like you
they have been little more effective in oklahoma with having this program that you vote or you lose it
if you just skip one election
you have to skip three
of course they can be a long time apart
what do you think of this no excuse absentee balloting
i'm not sure if i'm familiar with that
you don't have to be sick out of town or anything
there is no excuse
i think that's great
actually my husband has run for office before
sometimes it's nice to be able to go ahead of time and vote because if you're going to be tied up that day campaigning or whatever it might be that just kind of takes that load off
that is an excuse i could live with
this idea of anyone wel-
i am so bitterly opposed to this
to have the expense of
i don't know why we couldn't have duplicate voting on some of this
hopefully once they've checked them off the list
they do have to check them off a list when they vote
hopefully they couldn't
is every list checked as thoroughly as a
we
this is a subject that you never think you'll be assigned to
one that kind of comes up when you've lost the
as i was sitting there i thought the weather's been perfect
it's
it didn't foul one launch
that's kind of unusual
it's kind of cold in the mornings
you dress up warm
how fun
i spent the weekend in ohio with my family the trees are changing color there
it was real gray as soon as the plane got through the clouds
i saw all those trees
the high was only fifty
it was supposed to drop and get sleet in the afternoon it was nice to get off the plane where it was in the seventies
they have tons of canyons where the leaves change
they're gorgeous you could spend every weekend of the
they actually printed out maps of routes you could take so you would get maximum leaf exposure
on leaf weekends it's bumper to bumper traffic
i can't complain
my family said that in ohio there was just an article on at the t v news that they are three weeks ahead of schedule as far as the coldness of the temperatures and the first frost
then we're back to being warmer than normal this week or last week
i don't have to live through any of those really
nothing comparable i guess to what you've had before
i've only been here just a short time too
i haven't been through any of those either
i have in michigan
in michigan you can get twelve inches of snow
life goes on
as i understand it here if there's anything they'll call off schools and close businesses
they get ice
no one can drive on ice
we used to think they were pansies
then when you decided what ice was
it was good talking to you
what a deal
did you hear what the topic was did she tell you
if you're ready then i'll just go ahead and start
i guess we're supposed to talk about the changing roles of women
seems like to me everything is just changing so much that it's almost like you can't keep up with things any more
everyone's striving so much to make it equal between men and women
i like it the way it used to be
i think it's kind of coming back around to that don't you
that there's a lot more people that stay home now than before
i guess more than anything i think maybe people were just kind of wanting to have the choice of what they could do i don't know
i think sometimes some of the women's lib though is kind of like they wanted it all
you can't have everything there's no way i could have a career and then be the kind of mom that i want to be to me that's more important
how many kids do you have
mine are two and nine months
being home is real
i just am fortunate because i don't know a real lot of moms that get to stay home
it's just weird that i was just talking to somebody this morning who's a working mom
these people have secretaries and these high power jobs
it just seems like
she told me now her daughter took her first steps at the day care
i just don't agree with that
i think it should be that people should get back to staying home and being more family oriented than not
it seems like everybody's always so busy with everything that they're doing that there's no time for this and that and the other
i hope it just doesn't get to where there's more and more women going into the work force
i agree
i hate for them to make people feel bad that have to work too saying you should stay home otherwise your children aren't going to turn out or whatever because that's not fair to the single moms that have to work
if they wouldn't be able to make ends meet not working or whatever
i think it's got to be a personal choice
it's nice that we could have the choice to stay home
i find that whenever i'm in a group of people and we're discussing things
just over the weekend i visited my family and some cousins i hadn't seen in a long time
everyone's all interested in what everybody's doing
i had my baby with me
i found that all i talked about was my baby
it's like here these people are
they kind of looked at me like i was from the dark ages
you kind of feel little bit like an outcast for a while in social situations sometimes
which is too bad because obviously i don't get paid for my job
i should get paid at least double what my husband makes
i don't know
this is kind of a
at least here i've noticed
i've really noticed that there are a lot more people that are more comfortable at least with some women being home at least in the circles i've travelled and in the church that i go to
i think a lot of companies are realizing this and offering more opportunities as far as job sharing or even having a day care on site and that kind of stuff
i think that's really important that they do that
they realize there's a need for that
i don't know
it wasn't where i had to be there every day
we were going to the doctor once a week
i don't know how you could have a full time job and ever have any vacation time to do anything besides go to the
i think i'm concerned about the large number of children that each teacher is expected to deal with in some quality way
i taught for fourteen years before we moved to texas
the one thing i see is changing is i was held accountable so much
instead of spending my time coming up with creative learning stations and things like that i was filling out all these forms for all the children everything had to be documented
i had file cabinets that weren't filled with neat stuff for kids
i have three years toward a teaching degree and am trying to get headed back
i'm just really in a dilemma if that's what
i'm really having questions if i can deal with that system and have a good conscience about what i do
i don't think it's the teachers
i think it's the system
they're so worried about lawsuits and the scores the children get on tests now and teacher competency
it's not like the teacher can just get in there and do her best
what child's going to say something some parent's going to overreact to that's true
it's hard on the children too
i think because the teachers are overworked
just like a mommy that's overworked you're not at your best
one is in seventh grade
i'm home schooling my kindergartner this year
we live in a district that has open classrooms
i wasn't particularly comfortable with that for her
i have one in ninth grade at clark
one at hendrick this year
my sixth grader came from an open classroom at matthews
the very first year i taught back in seventy-three we had open classroom
it didn't work then when we moved down here i was just appalled that they were still doing it here
the explanation
they seemed to admit that it wasn't working
they didn't have the money to restructure
looks to me that it wouldn't take really that much money to at least come up with some kind of partitions
partitions or just to face the children different directions or to do something i know last year my son had to eat in the classroom because there was no cafeteria at his school he spent all day in this one large open area
i didn't really care for that
we were from north carolina
of course north carolina has a terrible reputation as far as education
i think they rank about forty-ninth our children got a very good education there they were in the magnet school program
from the time they were about third grade they changed classes several times during the day which has its pros and cons
a lot of their classes there were only eight or ten children in their classes it was wonderful i'm coming to plano thinking gosh it's going to be really great
i don't understand how they get this reputation unless it's just that they spend a lot of money
probably so on publicity and letting realtors know and key people how wonderful the schools are
my son is at clark this year too
we're
i don't guess i've been in
i ran over and picked up her report card
she did very good
that's good
she seems to be studying and has just about the right amount of home work i would expect for a freshman to have
yet she has some every night
eric seems to have quite a few nights where he doesn't have any
that's interesting
his grades i haven't seen them yet
supposedly they're good
i did hear the end of the prompt this time
it said do we think that cri- certain crimes should fit certain punishments
i was thinking about it after i got off the phone that i really wish that there was some way to send a message to people about child abuse and things like that uh-huh
too often i feel that people get off
i agree with you although i will say
i'm not sure
i sometimes have a problem with some of the especially more famous people who all of a sudden are crawling out of the woodwork to say that whatever problems they have was because they were abused as children
the parents are saying hey wait a minute
we didn't do anything like that
i guess before i'd like to see that severe of a punishment for it
i don't buy the routine they're just sick
they were abused when they were little forget that
sometimes they even wonder when criminals plead temporary insanity for crimes that are so severe and then they get sent to a mental institution
they play loony for a while
they're back out in public
i can't see that either
i don't feel that that should be any excuse at all or any reason to not use capital punishment
i agree
None
my family may say that on occasion
i don't think it's that hard to do to convince somebody that gee you just had no control over what you were doing
too they can always be blaming the other person
she looked like my mother who abused me when i was a child or something which i think is unfortunate for that person and yet shouldn't be an excuse
i guess a lot of
i was just seeing in the newspaper or the grocery store that some miss america was abused by the man she loved
i couldn't realize if it was the husband or the father or what
i thought if children are being abused i'm wondering how our school system is failing that they're not even seeing this
that kind of worries me with my kids only being under two and not having to deal with that yet
you're right
yet did you ever in your life when you were little know
never i lived in california which i feel like california
i was from conservative wisconsin
there was nothing on it
which makes me wonder if it's as prevalent as some of them claim
it's
it all
unless they're caught in the act or the child is very badly beaten up it comes down to a one word against the other that type thing
texas is capital punishment for
now they added mass murder
i really would have no idea i don't really know
are those the only two things that we i have a feeling it is
i think there ought to be more things added to it
i
killing a child or kidnapping
possibly not
i guess kidnapping maybe if the person gets very badly hurt
i've heard when i
i like dining out
i'm a divorced woman
i have one child when we dine out we go to medium priced restaurants
i don't particularly
i think it's sort of a waste of money to go to a real high priced restaurant
do you go home cooking like black-eyed pea and that kind of thing or cafeteria
we go more for the chinese and italian and stuff like that mexican stuff that i can't cook
we do too
i like chinese food
there's a little place down on coit road chinese pavilion or something
i like it
i do like chinese buffets
we've gone to august moon
we think that was real good our favorite when you have a little more to spend is to go to taiwan or may dragon
those are excellent
it's not the rinky chinese decorations it's a very elegant nice place to eat
very often we go out for fajitas
we go to on the border
and lots of places that have i think
some of those and get fajitas
he'll just eat chips until we've got three or four baskets coming back
last weekend we went out for italian also
for some reason the cooler weather makes me tend to want to go eat lasagna and garlic bread
we went to el sorrento
have you ever tried pappasito's
that's real funny you said that because we were coming back sunday on central from church
bob pointed to it
he said i keep hearing good things about that place
it is delicious
i guess we'll have to do it
you always stand in line when you go it's worth the wait
that's what d magazine said that
that's a good sign
have you ever tried the macaroni grill up on
my kids didn't like it because they just wanted to get plain old spaghetti
most of those things were a little more northern italy
they like just the traditional
they're the spaghetti warehouse type
my little girl likes spaghetti warehouse real well
not really
a steak is something that i cook at home
that you grill out i really don't particularly
i'm real curious to try this one that has such commercials that del lincoln
what is that guy's name
there's one over there in addison
there's a second one downtown
they have these really corny radio commercials they're steak is supposed to be wonderful
i had not tried that
it seems like i've been
we found those one time
they discontinued
they closed up
most of these places are pretty much just theme restaurants around here
i think that's what really goes right now in the dallas area
that's exactly true
of course down next to downtown up around mckinney and everything there's a different class of restaurants up there that i can't even touch
it would probably take my whole paycheck just to go in and
i haven't been
we've gotten so used to doing chicken and things at home that that's usually the way we'll go if we're not going lasagna
when i go out it's normally to get some specialty type of food besides chicken and steaks and everything i grill at home
i understand
really they're a lot better than what i get in the restaurant
save you some money too
what's your child's favorite place to eat
favorite place
she has a lot
mine enjoy that too
they'll our favorite thing on fridays we generally order pizza in
not pizza inn but pizza to our house
we've done
is there anything else you'd like to discuss about it
i think it's come to an eye conclusion
i'll talk with you later
i don't have one at home
actually my husband and i are taking a class at our local junior college called micro computers one o one
we're just touching on data base spreadsheets and word processing and just different kinds of
we're just kind of touching on a basic computer
that sounds interesting
i have a p s one i b m type
i use it all day at work
i put all my personal stuff on it at work
i really haven't had a need for one at home
probably if i didn't have access to one all the time at work i'd want one at home
i didn't
what is that tracking the flights and things
this is my very first time
it's time for you to wind up in the next thirty seconds or something like that
i'm going to ignore that
i'm just going to ignore it
i have that too
other times
where do you work
you do
of course
that's
i see
this is a pretty good deal
i work in the legal department
i'm pretty busy
i use my p c there mostly for creating legal documents
you do know lotus
that's great
i know there's still a hundred things i don't know how to do on it
you learn something every time you use it
on this survey or whatever
do i wait for people to call me
eight hundred number
you can only make one call a day
only one a day
you cannot make a call now until tomorrow
i see
then do you get the five bucks
do i
we both do
that's a
you both do
that's a pretty good deal
why are we doing this
actually i'm doing this for a friend of mine
it's a research type project on voice activated electronics
it's they call it the speech lab that is setting this thing up
it's almost like a voice command computer type thing
that's wonderful
i don't know everything about it
they try to get as many people as they possibly can to contribute to this
that way they can check voice patterns
get the computer where it recognizes voices
see that's why it's interesting because i'm going to say you have an accent
i probably do because i've
i think that i don't
to you
i was born and raised in texas
i probably do
you're in what city
one of my sisters lives in plano
that's right outside of
richardson's right between dallas and plano
i have a sister that lives in austin
what are you doing way in washington
we're actually all from nebraska
that's interesting
my sister works at the air force base
i imagine they use personal computers
i think they just send christmas letters on it
children's games
what i believe is one of the major things that is wrong with our public school system is that we do not have enough discipline the parents do not let the teachers discipline the children the way that they need to be disciplined right now
when i went to school i know i was scared to death about being disciplined
the discipline that my daughter receives now in going to school is just totally different
i did not see anybody in my classrooms when i was going to school act up the way that kids do these days in the classroom
what grade is your daughter in
my daughter's in the fourth grade there's children in her classroom that just totally disrupt the classroom where the teacher cannot teach when i went to school that just wasn't put up with
they just don't do that any more
the school system's afraid of getting sued and all sorts of lawsuits i'm sure because of things like that
i also believe even though i feel like i pay a good share towards the school system that the teachers are still underpaid
we still don't have enough money put in toward public school
i think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more that maybe that could solve some of our problems
we'll just have to wait and see whether that's approved or not
i don't know your feelings toward that
what else
i have heard stories from other parents that i know of that teachers are out there giving drugs and selling drugs
i've heard some horrible stories about high school teachers to be more careful of the teachers that we place in our school
that's basically about all that i know that may be wrong with the school system
with what they have to work with i think they're doing a pretty good job
i do too
then what do i know
this is probably a real hard subject for you
i guess we can discontinue our call now
it was good talking to you too
what do you know about latin american policies
i just have a feeling that we've kind of talked out of both sides of mouths down there like we do in some other situations
half the time we don't know who to support
are you relating this to the affair we've got going on in haiti right now
that and maybe it's tough for a big powerful nation to deal with countries like that that depend on us so much without running their country for them
that's just it
you still have to let them know how you feel
like you said they're such small countries that we're bound to upset somebody
we seem to be lacking the ability to take a stance
it worries me that the economy of so many countries in south america and central america depend on something that damages people like cocaine from columbia
that's a tough deal
maybe it's i'm reflecting how i feel about it
i have a feeling that we really don't understand basically the competing factions
they've been hammering for the last you know ten centuries
it's still going on
we dabble in it just enough to make both sides angry at us some how
i was speaking with a woman
i believe she was from the honduras or guatemala or somewhere in there
she was from el salvador she was from a relatively wealthy family
when the contras came into power of course with
gosh darn what's his face
he's in florida jail now
marcos no
marcos is philippines
i'm blank
you know who i'm talking about
i know it
anyway when he came into power he basically just took everybody's property just assigned it to himself
she's been a real strong supporter of the sandinistas and has been trying to back the u s government in that respect
in that respect i have to agree that i think we're taking the right stance because they were a democracy turned yeah
it seems like those countries are so easily susceptible to that kind of thing
unstable
what do you think of this u s free trade agreement we're working on with mexico
i think it's long overdue i just
there's so much difference in the economies of the two countries i have a problem with whether it's going to work or not
it seems like there's
it seems like there's a lack of honesty in foreign policy a lot of the times
the mexican government is trying
a lot of the larger mexican businesses are trying to
the big problem with the united states is we have our basic nine to five schedule
we don't have the siesta
the cultural differences it's what's really hurting the mexican people because they've had their way of life
we've had our way of life
i think their version of the good old boy network going that
has a lot
let me just start by asking what you think of this middle east affair we've got going on
i think that for once we shouldn't even be at these mid east talks because with the exception of our hostages we shouldn't have too much of a real interest in deciding who's land it is
just let these people fight it out we've got so many domestic problems
what does it cost these people over there
how about the soviet union
i'm glad to see that
again i don't want to see us pour a whole lot under any circumstances because i don't know
i'm a believer in the old adage that if somebody earns something it's worth more to them than if you give it to them
i'm not much in favor of it
i'm glad to see us advising them that doesn't seem to cost a whole lot of money
i'm ready to have a president elected that at least has some sort of a domestic agenda
even if it doesn't work at least he is somebody who is working on that problem
i haven't seen that in the last eleven years
all i've seen
they don't seem to have a clue
i think bush's kind of followed suit
international is important
we've got a budget deficit that just won't go away unless it gets seriously addressed
there's the homeless issue
there really is a lot we could be doing stateside without hurting our international aspects or straining any international relations i think
we wouldn't have to spend the billions and billions of dollars each year that we're spending
i agree
once we started economic aid overseas we have really set ourselves up to be sort of the world bank
i think there's a limit
we passed it a long time ago
we've been writing off way too many country bad debts
that's another thing i don't understand is things like selling technology and even military hardware to foreign governments and then forgiving their debt
as much in debt as we are i don't know
i don't see anybody
it's either one way or the other
it seems to be we're turning into a black and white society
you do it that way
there's no in between it obviously isn't working
i think it wouldn't hurt
i know the independent party's been trying for years to get a real force in congress
you're right
there's just too many issues that come up that our senators and our congressmen vote on simply because it's a democratic issue or it's a republican issue if they would vote with their conscience and with what their constituents feel i think we might have a lot more efficient running government and a lot better laws passed
i agree with you
of course we have the national embarrassment in our state jessie helms
as soon as we can get
of course it seems to me that every time he opens his mouth he just lines up people against him
it's not too often that you see him swaying too many opinions
he's usually on the ninety-eight to two side
he's one of the two
let's see
senators are in for six years right when did you guys vote him into office
unfortunately nineteen ninety
you're stuck
unfortunately for him but maybe fortunately for us his health is not great
i hate
what do you do on your yard
typical lawn stuff
saint augustine with a little bermuda mixed in in some of the sunny areas really all i do to it is
in fact i didn't even fertilize it this year
i mow it with a mulch mower so the particles fall down yeah
comes back in the yard you don't have any one do your yard
what the heck
my husband does the same thing
he wants me to learn how to work the lawn mower
i keep putting off learning
i had recently gone out and planted mums
while my husband was painting i went out and bought about fifty dollars worth of mums over at calloway's and put out yellow and bronze
they're just gorgeous then last week my mom comes in town
she says those are going to die just the first frost
i went now you tell me
the first night that around halloween
we went out and covered them with a sheet
they did okay that first night
the second night we were at the movies and didn't do it
i guess i've lost them
the worst problem we've had here with this grass was about the third year we were here
we did not know in august to put down the whatever it is for grub worms
the next spring i guess in that march every time we would go out and just try to walk on the grass or reach down to pull a weed we'd have big whole patches come up
we pulled up almost half of our yard just by raking it
we had to go out and resod the whole thing with squares and wet it and put it down and rope it off and everything
the most careful thing we do on our yard every august is put down that diazinon
you think that's what it was
you could see them
they said they turn into black bugs in the spring yeah
in the
those kind of brown what we call june bugs some people call them may beetles
occasionally i find them in the flower beds
they said that every yard has some it was a preponderance of them that caused our problem
that's the number one thing we do whether we fertilize or anything else just because we got burned so badly before
i had some of that problem
mine was freeze
i'm still replacing that in the back especially under the trees kind of slow and as you say very expensive
i caught wolfe with one of the sales where they have those big blocks for fifty cents
i bought about
i put that was late
because i started to say there's different times they say it's okay to do it
i had to water it gosh
out here we don't have as many trees in plano
a lot of the shrubbery that we have in the front like the pittosporum all died
all those variegated things died
we pretty much go with that dwarf yaupon and that yaupon holly
they just live
they're pretty tough
you can stand those
pittosporum is kind of borderline here usually it'll do pretty well
every once in a while we get one of these really cold deals it zaps it
it's kind of like one of these
wax leaf ligustrum is the same way
they warned me of that one finally
i said you need to either read neal sperry's book before you shop or get a reputable nursery because lot of places are just trying to sell whatever was pretty out there
we didn't know the difference
every year we learn one more thing that we didn't know before like about these
my backyard we had it really nice
then my husband wanted a labrador puppy
it was about
the first summer he was here he dug up all of my bushes and plants and brought them to the front door and the back door
it's like our backyard is just kind of like
if there's anything he'll hurt we just don't put it out there any more
i had a small vegetable garden that
it's on the apron of the parkway out behind the garage our garages come in from the alley it's a little piece of land over there
i had tomatoes and peppers
i had okra
by the fence i had cucumbers which didn't do real well they kind of came out looking like gourds
you say i made it though at least it's mine
i had squash
i had zucchini and yellow crook neck squash
i guess my initial view is our tax burden hasn't gone down in recent years despite tax cuts among industrialized nations we have one of the lowest in the world
i take the view that cutting income tax rates has been good for the economy that most other countries have a higher share of the tax burden in various kinds of sales taxes energy taxes particularly and that to the extent we need to raise more taxes that's the direction we should look
i guess i kind of have mixed feelings
you always sit there
out of each pay check so much comes out of it
you wonder where's it all going we have such a huge national deficit
i guess a lot of times there's questions wondering if it's doing a whole lot of good
you kind of always wonder where's the money going
one of the big tax that has gone up a lot in this year is the social security tax which in principle is going into a big trust fund
that is a particularly regressive tax
senator moynihan's proposal to cut there i think makes a lot of sense
i think senator moynihan's proposal to cut the social security tax which isn't really going to beef up the social security program could make a lot of sense
as far as other countries i don't keep up on it too much as to far
we were in ireland last year i know that the tax there is extremely high much higher than we pay here
as far as other countries i'm not up to par on
i think japan is probably about equal to ours other major countries are higher
our friends were amazed that the cost of things when they went to canada not so long ago
as a whole most other countries have a higher level of cradle to grave government services
it's a real
they're real trade-offs there
you sit there and wonder
i guess this doesn't really have to do with taxes but just money in general and wondering if you're going to have enough when you retire
that's a scary thing that there's no real knowing about
there's a lot of inflation risk that isn't taken care of in most private pension plans
are you involved with the legislature up there
part of the commerce department
you picked this topic
you didn't
i didn't pick it i don't really recall
i may have filled out on the form
i certainly have the feeling i've been given topics different from the ones that i mentioned before
did you
i haven't placed any calls
i didn't know that
i haven't made any calls yet
you should try it
i didn't realize that
it can be a rather controversial subject depend on who you're talking to
many of the subjects are taxes especially
one thing that has kept our tax burden high is the level of the defense budget that same subject
i'm calling from plano texas
i'm in garland
would you like me to go first
i have three children two who are in regular school eleven year old an eight year old
my little one three year old is in a university of gymnastics
it's a preschool i think it was really hard to pick the right day care or preschool or mother's day out
some of the qualifications that i look for was the cost and exactly what they did if it was structured or nonstructured if they had a little academic in there and what the qualifications of the teachers' were and if the place was clean and the hours
just kind of going by word of mouth and finding out if anybody else has been pleased with their program that kind of stuff
we don't have any children
we're going to have one next year
that's something that i'm probably going to be looking at maybe in the future
i don't know if i'll be doing that or what we're going to do
if we do then i'm going to need to find somebody
our church has a mother's day out program which they started last year
we know a lot of people at the church
i would feel very confident with leaving my child there
that's where shannon had started in a mother's day out program the churches always have i think a pretty good program
you have to make sure that you apply pretty early because a lot of places have very long waiting lists
another question to ask is if they're state certified if the teachers have their master's degree in child education and child development
what kind of a structure is it going to be
when your child's a little bit older like a three year old you'd be more concerned with if there's a type of care that it's torture for them to lay down and take a nap
is there a mandatory nap time
they lay on these little mats
if they fall asleep they kind of let them sleep
the teacher stays with the sleeping ones
the other ones get up and go do something else
she doesn't have to necessary take a nap there which is nice
it's kind of scary i guess because you hear so many bad things about day cares lately
i guess it's such a growing concern
then there's a lot of good things you don't hear
sometimes when the child's a lot younger before three years old the church is a good program
sometimes you even consider having a private person come to your own home when they're real little or something like that
another consideration is what's the ratio of teachers to children because that makes a difference
if your child would be maybe sleeping in that crib all day
just your child or do they just put any child in any crib
you would want maybe your child to have their own sheets all the time and not have another child use that bed
i'm sure that whatever you decide you'll be happy with
it's exciting time to have a new one
that's wonderful
we have been thinking about that
it's a little ways off in the future i figure i'd probably start asking around at church because i know they have a limit as to how old they can be before you can bring them in
some places take them as infants i guess like eight weeks even
there's a place to look into
a friend of mine who's a nurse was telling about a wonderful new place that opened some place on fifteenth street
it's in plano somewhere where
nurses that used to work in the hospital take care of infants and then only up to like two years old it's supposed to be really a
some places just specialize in just real little ones other ones are the older children
it is a difficult situation i think
when they're little it's almost easier to leave them because when they're three and they're cry
i'm calling from plano texas
okay
i find exercise kind of a task i guess i'd say
i also have
they keep me pretty busy
i enjoy
i have
i walked and run almost every morning
it's about a thirty minute exercise every morning
that would
my husband swims every day at lunch which he loves doing yeah
once in a while or if he has a business meeting or if someone invites him to lunch he'll not go
he goes every day
he's a runner too
he gets up about five and does his deal
some days he doesn't
then maybe he'll catch up on the weekend and go for a run
we
i had an exercise bike in the house but didn't seem to use it enough
somebody sold it in a garage sale
i'd like to get a bike and just do biking outside
the bicycling is nice especially with the weather around here
i know my husband and i both do it to just
we need to keep exercising just to be able to
i'm fifty-five
it just gets worse
i know
you just
i take my three year old with me
it's kind of another day out for her to have little friends
i enjoy the socialization of it
there are some parts during that exercise that i think i cannot do
i know some of it is so tough especially when somebody's planning lunch for you and they know what's good for you
anyway thank you for calling
guess it's logical to ask do you exercise any
unfortunately very little
much less than what i need to
i do a little bit
i don't really get out a lot to exercise
i am an assistant teacher in business technology
i think the most exercise i've gotten in the last three to four month is jumping up and down to go answer the kids' questions
it's not really the kind of exercise that gets your heart rate going
it really
i realize that
that's the way i feel
i've got
i go to school during the day and work at night
when you exercise what do you do
i usually play at home
me and my brother play basketball and have a bunch of guys come over and play
a lot of times we're up at the church
i got a hold of richard simmons' tape what is it
the sweating to the oldies
sweating to the oldies
that's not bad
every once in a while i'll put the cassette in and go with it
i don't know
my fingers exercise more than anything now
do you ever ride a bike or anything like that
i'd ride about two or three miles a day
it would last about a couple of weeks
it got real cold for a little while
i gave it up
here about the most common exercise for people is to go to the malls and walk
no matter what the weather is they can walk at a pretty good clip and not have to worry about the weather summer or winter
people will walk around the mall
it's safe
it is fairly safe
that's inside the mall
i know a doctor once told me it
a friend of mine suggested swimming as being the best exercise there is
we have a swimming pool
it's an old concrete pool
we haven't got to use it much
i love to swim and water ski and stuff like that
the swimming they say uses more muscles than any other exercise with
the water takes the resistance
you don't get the soreness
i've done some water exercises
our pool is not heated
hot tubs are not too bad
what part of mississippi are you from
we're about two hours from the coast
you do have cold weather down there
it started about yesterday i believe
from there just
sunday the snow and ice came in
there was no exercise
i think i played better golf when i was fifteen john than i play right now
i know i did
course i know i watch my thirteen year old play now
it's like they don't have a muscle in their body
i know
i'm a guy that plays
i was raised by a man my stepfather who with a two handicap he could get down on his knees and hit the ball further than most people could hit it
my mother who is now seventy-one
all they did every day in their life was to play golf every
they'd leave work and go to a golf course or a little country club they belonged to back in richmond virginia and just play nine holes of golf
you need to play that often to get a really good handicap
i just never could do it
i have a brother-in-law who is an ex-college coach and like a pro
he has a very good handicap and plays good golf
i went to
i went after it
i really didn't find much improvement
go back up
i think i need to
i probably need to take some more lessons more current and practice more often
it's a hunter's type affair i buy in austin texas
i live in the dallas area but i go down to austin and go with my good customer and friend of mine we always buy this weekend at a country club in the hill country
at horseshoe bay
we just have a ball
we play three days in a row three different courses
course believe it or not by the end of the third day and the end of the third course my score has gone from a hundred and twenty down to about a hundred and five
that makes a lot of difference to me
i've also found too i try to work out regularly
when i am doing that and feeling loose that i swing better
i get through the ball better
i also if i
i just sort of
that's something my stepfather never could teach me just to relax and hit the ball
subsequently when i do tire out from playing like twelve fourteen holes a lot of my energy's gone
when i do swing it's an easier swing i do actually hit the ball better
have you ever tried a one iron
off the tee
that's why i need my driving lessons
i put mine back in my bag this year too
i used a three wood rather than a driver
i had a lot more control on it
i wasn't in trouble every time i got down the fairway
that's a good idea
i think this next year i'm going to attempt to play more
i'm going to do the same thing
i laid off my woods about three years ago
i just use a two wood off the fairway
i'm a fairly strong person
i get a pretty good little drive and i guess control my irons better
i still remember that watching myself and my son
i think the key is you need to play more often than i play
i read recently here if you're scoring well you should play more
if you're scoring poorly you should spend more time on the practice range
i think there is less frustration factor there too
makes good sense
i
the one iron is something i've been thinking because my driver's gone so badly lately that i should pick one up and try to start
with practice i would imagine you could groove that swing too
i play with a fellow that can knock a one iron
his accuracy is what's so startling with it
it's an iron that he's really practiced with
it would be fun to get that good with an distance iron
my challenge of the game is just if i can get off the first tee when everyone's standing around watching you i'd be
if i get off the tee box and i've anything from a hundred fifty to two hundred yard drive through a straight i just want to get down and kiss the ground
get away without embarrassing yourself
do you exercise regularly
i am a school teacher
there is girl that went through our school district who does aerobics at the y w c a
any way she comes to the school
there are a group of teachers
we exercise regularly for an hour
we do it twice a week
that is good
we do aerobics for our cardiovascular fitness for thirty minutes
then we do stretching and toning and cool down for another thirty minutes
it is an hour
my husband and i take ten mile walks as often as possible
not on the nights that i do aerobics
if he wants to he jogs
we take the fast walks
we walk a couple of miles and then come back to the house
we take it seriously
i use to exercise regularly
i haven't lately
i use to also take an aerobics class about three days a week before work
i guess my job change my husband's job change and it is just not easy to get up early in the morning any more
i understand that
and too i just make myself
i am at school at seven thirty
school is not over until four our class
it is in the building that is the big difference
there are other people around that
there is motivation around there
we can change right there in the building
i just go
we exercise
until then i have belonged to exercise clubs
i have gone to these gyms like in plano and richardson where they offer aerobics
i have done that before but it has always had to be late at night after i have got home and after dinner
you are just kind of going ugh
i have tried it immediately after school
try to get some place and exercise from five to six
by the time you get home and you get dinner you are eating so late
i know some people go during lunch
by the time i get over the gym and go for my class and shower and get back to work it is probably two hours or more that is just too long
they are nice because if we are running late it usually
they know we are in the building and coming
where as at another place you are paying a lot more money
it does going to start whether you are there or not
this has worked out real nicely
that is not much
it's
we pay her for six weeks at a time cause that is a unit in school report card period
it is like twenty-four dollars every six weeks
we belonged for a period of time to the signature club for about a year
we were paying a hundred dollars plus month for our family membership at first we used it
it got where we weren't beginning to get out money's worth
they offered lots of things
we weren't taking advantage of them because we didn't have the time to
we decided to forget that
we have one through work
its probably about a hundred and fifty dollars a year which is bad
i don't know
i still just don't end up going cause it isn't at a convenient time or i don't know something
i need to do something
if its only walk the dog or something
if you have somebody who will do it with you
for a long time my husband didn't want to walk cause he wants to jog he decided that maybe
i'm not planning the menu
you're not
we usually go out to either one of our folks
they both live close to i don't know
it seems like a big thing for christmas is usually ham
funny you should mention that
you are
it's kind of a hobby more than anything else
we're going to have wild boar we killed a boar the other day
it was mating with the sows
you can't use the piglets
we shot him and cleaned him out and had him processed into ham
we're also going to have a little roast suckling pig because i've got one that's got a hernia rather than pay the vet four hundred dollars for surgery we'll just cook him and eat him
is that hard
i tell you what preparing a little pig is a snap
you just
you kill him
they go
in a second they're gone you just dip the carcass in boiling water pull it out and gut it and just stick it down in a pit with some cloves and some pineapple about three pineapples sliced them up and cover him up with wet sacks
my goodness
after about six hours you put the fire out and dig that baby out of there
it's the best eating you ever had
does a boar taste just like regular ham
just like a pig it has a lot less fat
this wild boar weighed probably about three hundred and thirty pounds he dressed out to almost two hundred and ten pounds
my goodness
we took the skin and the head and the feet off
that was about a hundred pounds of just ham
how many people are you planning on serving at christmas
we're not going to eat the whole thing
we're going to drive up to kansas city see my wife's folks
she
what's your mother cooking for christmas
her mom's doing brisket
it's just tough as a boot they used to use it for leather i think
my goodness
no
it's a part of the loin the rib cage
it has a lot of muscle in it and a lot of
my goodness
it's really a tough piece of meat it's so tasty you can't stand it
you just take it
that softens it up huh
you marinate it for a couple of days
you just put it in the oven
we're going to have that
we'll have cranberries and hominy
we're big on olives and cucumbers and stuff up here
we have black olives and cucumbers and tomatoes
do you
we just got lots of snow
it's thirty degrees this morning
it'll go up to fifty or sixty almost
my goodness
it's desert
where we are it's the edge of the desert
it's part of the great plains
in the day time in the summer it goes up to a hundred hundred and ten at night it goes down to about sixty
we get a fifty degree temperature swing in about four hours
everything that lives around here is real tough
that's trees
we got hundred year old trees that are twenty feet tall
they're just hard as a rock
until recently i was taking the wall street journal
i thought that was a good way
i have about five different magazines that i get that keeps me up on things
it's a week or two late
that's how i'm staying up
occasionally i'll read the paper
do you like how it's presented on the news
they allow you
they try to lead you too much i believe
sometimes they're not very open
i don't know
like for example the kennedy rape case
the coverage on that was
they try to have you form opinions or whatever
i didn't like the things that were going on when we had desert storm and stuff like that
basically i think they don't present the whole sides of everything
it makes you feel like they're wanting you to take their opinion
it's more like an editorial i believe on a lot of issues
it's kind of distressing isn't it
i've noticed that they do it just with subtle little words usually just that sway the whole report by just a couple of words
when i was in school i was a communications major
i'm well aware of the little subtle words and persuasive speaking and so forth
communications
i ventured off in a whole entire different field
i went with the department of state treasurer in retirement disability
working for state government you hear all about current events about things going on within the state itself
that's another source where i keep up with current events
it says a t and t to account for the benefits that the a i c p a now says you have to show as a liability
it'll drop their earnings by a hundred million a year forever more
you have to stay up on stuff
i bet in your job that you have to
i primarily deal with the state employees
i find interesting tidbits in what the news reports as far as the state of north carolina's budget and stuff like that
i really know what the budget is
when they were saying we were so poor and they couldn't pay taxes and pay people their income tax refunds and things like that
i'm well aware of the billions of assets that the state has
it's just funny
that's
i don't have a whole lot of faith in the news
they get what they hear from
it's not always i think one hundred percent reliable
i think they need to go into a little bit more depth before they would just report somebody wants to make a statement or something like that
another example is the aids issue or whatever
someone said i found a cure
two months later it's discovered it's not
before they come out with something like that they need to research the matter i believe a little bit more
i guess they do that so they don't get scooped
they have the big story
my husband does the majority of the gardening taking care of the lawn and fertilizing
i tend to all the planting the annuals and the spraying and taking care of them and maybe putting flowers in throughout that season and later on maybe planting some mums and that kind of stuff and any kind of decorating for the holidays
basically he does all the heavy stuff
i do all the fun stuff
my wife works
she's sedentary all day long so when she gets home she likes to mow
we have about ten acres
she tries to mow about half of it
wow that's a big job
it keeps
when we got this place the dirt was just overgrazed it was bare dirt in a lot of places now since we've been mowing it
of course we water a little bit
just by keeping it mowed and getting it mulched in we've reclaimed a lot of it
i bet it's beautiful
we don't do much in the way of flowers
we have one little flower garden that we work with
the rest of it is just wild flowers in the summertime we get the prettiest yellow flowers
that sounds lovely
they're about i guess a third the size of palm of your hand in the spring we get the bluebonnets and indian paintbrush
the wild flowers are beautiful
i was thinking about throwing some in the back just way in the back behind the swing sets
just have some wild flowers growing back there would be real pretty
my wife and i really enjoy that sort of thing
she enjoys mowing
i hate it
a lot of women do
i've just never really
my husband takes it on
i'll help rake up the grass
sometimes i'll help him edge
we don't have that much property
we're on a corner lot
there's a lot of edging to do that's what's nice about living more in the country
that's nice
it's been a little more country with the trees
we do miss that
if we had a chance to move i think we'd move back to somewhere that was a little more countrified and a little less maintenance required as far as that goes
yeah we do everything together
this spring we got a thousand pine trees from the
two weeks ago we got a thousand pine trees from the soil and conservation people we're in the process of planting we're building a stand just to the north of our house and along the east property line i think what we're trying to do is create sort of a wind break because i tell you in the winter time when that wind comes out of the north it just cuts right through you like you're not even there
i put
on the other side of the house though that's where we have all the delicate flowers and the mums
we have morning glory we have trumpet vine and moon flowers
we planted those out by the septic so that they get plenty of water we get hummingbirds come in the spring all summer long
that sounds so pretty
when we leave the doors open they fly in the house
they don't do any damage though
they don't like it in here because there's nothing to eat when you're as busy as one of those babies you've got to eat most of the time
we got a few
for the most part gardening for us is
we got asparagus
we've got some plum trees and some apple trees and some tomato and some blackberries and strawberries
that sounds wonderful
i love home grown tomatos
these are accidental tomatos
last year the birds came and ate a few of the tomatoes
of course you're going to lose some that way the seeds go right through them
wherever they pooped
the ones that are out now
i've watched that sisters a couple of times
i like that one
i'm trying to think
i don't even know if i have any other real regular ones that i watch
i like l a law not because it's realistic but
when there isn't a good movie on too
i just like to have the t v on if i'm home alone or something have
i do
i've been home with a
i've haven't seemed to have gotten out as much
i'll watch a soap occasionally
i don't because i work all day
i pro-
i usually do if i'm home for a couple of days around christmas or whatever
after a while i'll start watching it on
for a while i'll ask people if they know what happened then i'll just forget it
oh what ones do you get into
i don't even remember
it was general hospital or something i maybe watched it for a week i know that people used to arrange their whole schedules around the
i don't get into them that much
when i'm home sometimes in the day i'll watch them i was really trying to think
you said you have kids
i have a six year old
i have a
you aren't a sesame street fan
they watch it
i've started to turn it on a little bit for the baby
he's entertained by it
i do watch that one
they're not entertained for too long with it
he's still too little
i do like donahue
let's see it's on at four
other than that i don't know
i guess it wasn't a real good topic for us
it snowed a little bit probably about four days ago they said we weren't going to get any more for christmas
wow do you have snow on the ground now
that's nice
i wish it would snow a little bit more
we still have some highways closed
it stopped raining almost twenty-four hours ago
my goodness
just phenomenal
i
until you've really seen it it doesn't really hit you
i was driving home from work friday
i saw there were some stop signs submerged up to the writing on the stop sign
that was just it was amazing to me
there has been some flooding
there's been a lot
it's too bad
the thing is that this happens
i don't know
you got to wonder how long they're going to keep doing that for
they just finished cleaning up from the last flood
what a mess
do you work for t i
this has been an interesting thing to do
i've probably talked maybe to five people
he's talked to a few more than me
it's been real interesting and kind of fun
five dollars
don't you have to do it as part of its
i really enjoyed
that was nice
i like driving to different cities because of the scenery
that was nice
i've been all over the states except for pretty much east
it's very pretty driving up north in wisconsin too
how far do you usually end up driving
the furthest i drove was probably texas
i've taken a train before to california
you're from where
we went to california this last year and liked it
it was too crowded walt disney world and other places it's just the wrong time of the year to go
course you get in any of those tourist traps and everything's outrageously priced
kind of
you wonder if it's really worth it to pay thirty-five dollars or forty dollars just to get in
there's lots of fun places to see
that's something do to to get up in mountains
i think the biggest limitation is a lot just time and money isn't it
probably when we go to wisconsin
it's pretty fun
you have to like crowds
it's a huge amusement park they have water slides it's just a big big tourist attraction
the downtown is all little shops and candy shops
it's really neat
i don't think hardly anybody lives there
it's just kind of tourists
it's mostly a summer place
from kenosha it's about three hours
that's nice
it's a pretty ride up there too
i like all the nature things there are to look at
you can probably
you have probably a lot of green and lot of real pretty things
our climate's real dry you have to kind of get up into the mountains to get much of the greenery
most of the land's pretty brown
idaho is where i live
it's by
it's lot different kind of
it's a real different land and scenery than there
i think there's a lot of places down even in southern utah the canyon lands
boy they're gorgeous
that's real pretty over there too
i think i'm kind of a summer vacationer
me too
are you presently looking for a used car
as a matter of fact i just bought one
just within the last three weeks
they're talking like it was an american built car
it sounds like it but it really isn't
it's marketed of course its own dealerships
usually somebody that's maybe got a cadillac or lincoln and lexus dealership sometimes they do that
it's a brand car
i've really liked it
it drives just wonderfully
there is
that's their big selling point other than general luxury
the particular seems to be
i can play those
that wasn't a standard feature was it
there is not very many options on that car
some of the tracking control things and skidding control things for up north
it's not just antilock brake
this is
there is a further traction control
probably suspension tied into the brakes
also the suspension can be raised for driving like in the ice and snow
shoot some of these muddy driveways could use it around here
mississippi probably doesn't have to worry too much
originally i'm from west virginia
you had some there
i got down here in june of eighty-four
the first winter down here was probably the worst winter they'd seen in twenty years
it was amazing how a few inches of snow would turn normally sane manly adult men into playful little children
i know
we had this group of surveyors come into a shop i was working in four or five of them these big old flame worn suburbans and the snow all over the place
while they were there they set back
the lexus really
the moon roof i think is also an option
there really is only about a half a dozen things
everything else is pretty standard
i did not get the traction control which also when you take the traction control
that's kind of
you go out and get in that real cold car you turn that on
it kind of
that's only available with the traction control and the other option
those two are sold together
you have to take a two thousand dollar option there to do it
i opted not for that
the dealership i dealt with they order them all with the moon roof and nice floor mats and everything in there
the only thing i had to decide on was whether i wanted a c d or not in the stereo system
that was pretty much it
they had three or four basic packages that they offer
little mercury tracer imagine or not they make a luxury mercury tracer
i'm leasing the lexus
it
the lincoln ride is certainly good too but this lexus is nothing like i have ever been in before
it's got a lumbar support in the seats
adjustable power
just kind of brings that support up in the sma-
i'm a vietnam era veteran
i was fortunate not to have to serve in the theater
however my support roll in the service was to support those in the theater of operation
i'm of the old school that believes that the contracts that we made back years ago needed to be honored
however i think we could have executed the war gotten it over a whole lot quicker
those are my personal thoughts
i think that if we'd let the generals run the war like we let the generals run world war two we'd had got it over a whole lot quicker and lost a lot fewer people
as it was the politicians ran the korean conflict and ultimately the vietnam thing
we managed to come out losers all the way around
this is what ultimately triggered us united states per se deciding to get out of the role of world policeman
as i understand it
as it turned out they were in a civil war one with another
really we
i question us now
we have to deal with the situation as we played it
jerry what did you think of people like jane fonda another anti-war activist
before jane fonda did what she did i thought she was a wonderful person
after
i just don't want anything to do with her any more
you support your government
i don't think we can determine whether we were right or wrong
you're having to deal with again
i think we could have made a different agreement back in the late forties era that would have kept of there
i didn't realize that we'd signed some type of deal like that
the mutual defense thing was
i don't think everybody knows the whole situation
from what i can gather is we went and said yeah we will help the south vietnamese should they ask
the french went in and tried their old style warfare and got soundly thrashed
we didn't do a whole lot better
had thought that they had colonies there or something
that was the old french colony but see the french were our allies in nato they're also our allies in seato which was the southeast asia treaty organization which has since been disbanded as far as i know
nato is on the way of being disbanded
the french
we go in as an ally to the french and says yeah we'll help you out if you get in a bind
they got in a bind and says we don't want to play any more we kind of got the ball rolling ourselves versus a bunch of top secret silly operations and then the full scale troops et cetera et cetera et cetera
i bar-
i missed it
i guess i like to play golf
i also like to plant flowers and do some gardening and do arts and crafts
we will play either out there or at firewheel
i have played different courses in in the dallas area
do you ride or do you pull a cart when you play golf
sometimes we pull
we like to to a lot of the times just walk for the exercise
i find that when i ride in a cart i play better
i think it is cause i don't get as tired
that makes me so mad
it is not going to do that much damage to the course but apparently they think differently
i like the course but i don't play over there because they don't don't allow you to pull a cart
i don't think a cart damages the turf
the reason why we play over there is because its where since we are a garland resident they gave us a special deal where you can get ten rounds of golf for a hundred dollars
it is half price what the normal green fees are
that is
we have got our card
i guess i could use a card too
i live very close to the firewheel golf course
do you
you live in garland then
we are in south garland
next time you go check into it
they have
it is just like a bus card
they just punch it
every time you go they just punch it for you
in the last two years i have not played very much golf because i am involved in boy scouts
you must have a son
i have children boy scout age
i am very active in boy scouts
i would have to say that camping and hiking and canoeing and boy scouts is my hobby
that sounds like fun too
i my golf clubs will probably rust before i get to use them again
my boys are still right at the beginning age
it is probably going to be six to eight years before they go to college
you need to teach them how to play and take them out on the course with you
they would probably never make it then
i don't think
as a course for p e you know
that is the only time i think i have ever really taken golf lessons
that was kind of a group scenario and not individual
besides that i just try to make the club hit the ball
i don't want to play strike out
i have fun doing it
i have some good shots and some bad shots
it is just nice to get outdoors and do something
you said you work in the gardens too
do you have special flowers
flower gardens
those ought to be coming up around spring time
my wife had just put in a bunch of i want to say they are pansies
they have been
they do great
i don't do anything to mine water them or anything
they just
i even had i guess it was last year or the year before i had some out
it froze
the pansies looked terrible but they came back later
they are good to plant in the winter time
if you start putting them you can put them out in the spring too
once it starts getting real hot then it just kills them cause they can't stand the hot weather
they make it through probably winter and spring
i love flowers
that is good
i try to do some arts and crafts
i love to go
you have a
we went through the process of searching for child care and finding what we consider to be
real good child care at a pretty reasonable price we think
he just turned three months
university of southern mississippi
are you going to put your son in child care in a year or two
probably
spring semester a year from now he's going to have to be in child care five days a week more than likely
depending on how my class schedule runs
my wife will be doing her internship that semester
it will be forty hour week no eight to five type of thing
we just as a matter of fact just yesterday hired a girl to watch him
my wife is already supposed to be on her way to her class
for about twenty thirty minutes a day we got a baby-sitter comes in
that's a good experience i think
the articles that are written on the topic
they kind of boil down to
any other important decision you really have to explore the alternative what we found to be the best guide was our own instincts about
people who were going to be loving
we could have sent her to a fancier facility
she goes to a home
this is
a couple emigrated from china early in their lives
they're both there
they have a kid that comes in and helps them in the afternoon
our daughter is healthy happy well adjusted and enjoys going to see her friends
that makes a big difference
it's a good experience
if it's
that's really what we've learned about it
she'll have to go on to something more stimulating in terms of preschool in a year we feel real fortunate
we were able to just choose in the marketplace
i don't know what it's like around hattiesburg
we were a little slow getting on the waiting list with the their home ec department they have a subbranch american family counseling
their people staff the child care center just off campus
they have a pretty good size waiting list
that's
i know it's a real hard thing to do even for people in university communities
out here at manford they have a real good facility
there is quite a waiting list to get into that
it's an important
it's best
it's an industry that's still a cottage industry i think this is buyer beware
if you over
it is the best way to do it interestingly
i think that my own interest in human development leads me to believe that that's a good sign and that private enterprise is the way to go and that it will lead to a fundamental change in the way we learn
i think what we're going to go to is much more commercial entrepreneurial learning ventures in the market
as a matter of fact my future is banked on that professionally because i believe that there are pressing needs in the marketplace unmet by schools colleges universities for learning a lot of things that kids can learn watching sesame street and in child care
it's amazing how much good things like sesame street will do
it's phenomenal
it's phenomenal the human operating system
i like a lot of different types of music
i have a tape collection that i like to listen to cassette tapes it's pretty varied
i'm very varied as well
i don't think i've ever met a type of music i don't like except for maybe heavy metal and that
that doesn't appeal to my ears
as far as the rap goes i think there are a few artists that appeal to me themselves i like some of their songs
as
i agree with the general rule i wouldn't choose rap either
i like to listen to what you might call pop easy listening country western jazz
i don't
i like like i said pretty varied music
i really love to listen to her i even have a tape of lady smith blackman bazo
they're interesting to listen to
i listen to specific
most likely i would be listen to jazz or classical music
i played in the jazz combo all four years
jazz can get on my nerves after a while
you can't just listen to it especially a lot of the deeper stuff
you just can't listen to it for enjoyment
it's too
unless you're playing it
it just doesn't do anything
blues are okay
i tell you i do like
None
i like some of it
as far as what they now call country western it doesn't sound like the old country music at all does it
some of it sounds more like pop music
i even liked jim reeves merle haggard and faron young that type of country western is what i like to listen to
sons of the pioneers stuff like that
i like sound tracks a lot
do you
think about like the twin peaks and stuff like that that's just real recent things like that i like to listen to
i like instrumental things
i have some spiro gyro tapes
they're great aren't they
they're wonderful
i mean like i said that's pretty varied
he's kind of jazz inspired but still kind of pop too
what i like the most about him is he looks like he's having fun
some people sing
he looks like he's having a good time
he's up there moving around and smiling like he's happy and like all he wants to do is make the audience enjoy it too
he is real fun to listen to
bonnie rait i like her a lot
in fact whenever she won her big grammy i think it was like five of them or something was it five
it was last year wasn't it
i was listening to a particular radio station
the one d j said who the heck is bonnie rait and why does she deserve five grammies
i vowed then that i was not going to listen to that
mark our situation is that we do have a daughter that is in the situation of choosing college
i guess
it comes down to the dollar
you have to
it does
it comes down to trying to come with a trade off of the costs
what do you feel about come of the things that need to
damn it i agree pretty much with everything you've said
the one thing that i'd advise any parent or any person looking for a college is that i think it's really important for them to actually visit the college and actually try and get away from the guided tour of the college and try and talk to the actual students there
they're just in my experience
i've talked to people at other colleges that
the lifestyle pictured in the catalogs isn't always
the college
the catalogs are sales material
it doesn't matter whether they're selling school
true
it really is helpful if a parent and the student can get there and see the real character of the school and the real life experiences of the school
i guess there's a difference in
the university here in saskatoon is primarily off campus resident students
they just live in the community
i know that there are a lot of colleges and universities particularly as they get to be a little bit on the smaller side where dormitory life is is right on campus as well that changes the character of it quite a bit
i go to georgia tech which is primarily an engineering school i think i really do miss the fact that it's not a university that there's not the
there doesn't seem to be the diversity of views that a lot of universities will have
i guess we're here
this is the university that has for years had the car that will travel the farthest on a small quantity of gas
in competitions
that's the kind of thing that also if you can see the kinds of achievements that have been made by students as well as graduates can give you idea of the character of the school
whether you've got a spirit of innovation and excellence or whether you've got a spirit of somewhat unkind but producing graduates
as sort of some development and some training
it's easy enough to crank out graduates but to really challenge them that can vary between colleges and faculties even as to what the attitude towards achievement is
do you have anyone that you're seriously needing to feed information to
i don't really know of anyone that's looking for colleges now with the exception of people's younger brothers and sisters
no
actually i'm more interested in choosing the right job when you graduate
that's really a valid point that people need to consider as well
to
going to university is going to take four to eight years depending on the programs person's involved in
after that you have to be out in the real world and have to be able to support yourself if you go in an area that there is just not much of a job market jeez
best training in the world is not going to put food on your table
i have two dogs
i have a sheltie
it's a miniature
i'm going into all this because i just got done
the schnauzer i'm watching for one of the managers where i work
he's been transferred to germany for a while i'm taking care of his dog
i had just got the kitten when he asked me that
he says my dog doesn't like cats
i said we won't tell her it's a cat
they just love kittens
she doesn't know that this is a cat yet
they get along real good
let's see
a sheltie
she's real sweet little dog
they're not as aggressive as a schnauzer
the schnauzers are a little aggressive
they're a good temperament they just
i think they have a higher level of intelligence than other dogs that i have encountered
also some poodles they're kind of
there's also some not so smart ones
it seems the smaller the are the worse off they are
maybe there's some credence in that statement
they're bred down so much
i really don't know what the best pet is
some people seem fairly well suited for miniature poodles and such
i don't know about these now what are they called pit bulls that are so vicious
they're really nice
i've dealt with quite a few of them
customers that bring them into the shop and ask me they fit collars and stuff on them
they are just really nice really friendly kind of like medium intelligence
how do they become s-
because some people want to train them as
they train them to be that way then
the poor animal is doing it in self protection
they aren't by nature really nasty critters
they are very determined critters once you get them going it's not good
i was impressed by them
they're real sturdy little critters
they aren't that big
and just really friendly
that's unusual
i was overwhelmed
i suppose you were surprised
after the reputation that
they have quite an notable reputation as far as
they're banned in some areas i understand
any pet's can be bad if you train it to be that way
that
in my hometown they just outlawed ferrets because they had one incident of a ferret attacking a child in a house
these people had left this infant in the same room with this loose ferret
the ferret is used to running the house and was kind of wild they should expect something like that to happen
bas-
did it attack the child then
it bit him
that was not a good thing
i think it was probably an individual ferret thing because it was a fairly wild ferret
they hadn't
the people that owned him should have been on the lookout for that
they really should have expected it
taken the precautions
then the animal's in trouble and not the person
have you every been tested for a new job or anything
in my job we are allowed to be
this is the rules that they can do this anytime
i don't know of anyone who ever has been picked out and been tested
it's just sort of
have you had any experience with it at all
not really
i've always worked on a university level
a lot of my friends had to be tested before they got summer jobs and stuff
what do you think about that
i don't think they're very accurate
i know their lifestyles changed prior to the drug test
i know they changed afterwards
i know of that too
i also know that things like antihistamines sudafeds things like that can really throw it off
you cannot get a job because of it
they may not tell you the reason why
i had a friend
it came back that she tested positive for using a hallucinogen
what it was was she had been in the jungle
it was some malaria medication
she tested positive for that
it really is a dangerous thing that way
i know of somebody that tested for an airline and didn't get the job
they weren't told why
a lot of people say the reason why after you take a physical will be because of the drug testing
i always
i thought you got called back if you tested positive for more tests
you should
you should be given another chance or at least be able to justify it or something
do you know how wrong they are
is there a margin of error
i know there are a lot of things that can influence them
i think that a person deserves a second chance with it or something because most things will stay in your system for a long time
if you could show that
i interviewed for a job recently
i was taking entex
my doctor gave me a prescription for it
he said this way if it were to make the drug test positive you have proof that your doctor ordered this for you
it didn't come up that i needed to do it
this could happen to anybody
if they would just say this person's drug test is positive we won't hire them then you could lose out on a job when really you didn't do anything
i don't know
i'm not so sure they are that needed
they say they can spot check
the occasional person then it's almost an infringement of your privacy
it sort of is
this is it
as a health professional i wouldn't want somebody to take care of me that was using drugs
as a patient i feel we probably should be protected
on the other hand there's a lot of things i should be protected from that they don't test my patients for too
i don't know
i think it could be used to hassle somebody
they could keep on doing this to you or something i guess
it seems like now they have tests
wow
a lot of people as kids or young people get into some things that they get out of later on
i don't think they should really have to pay for that forever
you can't say it was wrong at the time
that probably wouldn't be too good either
i have five
you do have a hard time finding time then don't you
four of them are grown
i really have just a thirteen year old at home
i work at it
to have them
i don't think
there's not much i can do about it
my wife and i are in our forties
it's hard to raise one child without them thinking they're the pivot point of the universe
i was an only child too
that's one reason i have so many
my thirteen year old is pretty separate from her brother and sisters
she is sort of like an only child
it's the same type of thing
i have a brother in his twenties
i was the youngest
i understand how that worked
he was treated like he had five fathers or something
that's exactly how it is
yeah
it's a little bit difficult though
we really did not
we did a lot of things together
that was a lot of fun
i guess you could consider that organized
there is a competition all the time
i think that's probably true the
if you have a large number of children then you don't
you can't afford to
there's not enough time my son is in little league this year
they practice three times a week
they have a game
it's just if there were more than one child i don't know there would be no way to do it
one parent go one direction
i'd have to go in the other
we could only cover two at that
i know i spent hours in the gym every day with my daughter
my little one also competed because really she had no choice
the three of us just spent a lot of time traveling and competing
of course the competing itself really didn't matter what it was
it was a really neat experience
i did not work when i did this
it's just
we really have to keep it together to get just her activities in and still have time to spend with each other
i don't think although i-
i think more than one child probably three children is probably the ideal to me
i'm not sure i could afford three
i don't know how my parents did it
there were five of us
i don't recall wanting anything in particular
i don't know how my father did it
he just didn't make that kind of money with five children
we did okay
now my wife and i both work
i don't believe we have as much as my parents did
we only have one child
things cost a lot more
i don't know how it is in georgia i don't think our part of the country is particularly bad compared to some
we have a lot of people moving here from boston and different areas
from talking to them they're shocked
they
i work with a lot of them
they think they have really done something
then when they get down here they realize the cost of living is outrageous compared to where they came from
that's about it
partly due to ownership
victor kiam owned the patriots for a period of a number of years
he always had this wonderful quality of being able to put his foot in his mouth every time he went to say something
they've had some financial problems with the team and so forth
it recently was sold
hopefully this ownership can set up new direction and keep the patriots in the new england area anyways
it will be fun for you to watch up there anyway to see what happens now you
i've been to a few games before
now you're from texas
you've got two football teams down there
it depends on where you're from in texas
i see
there's that type of segregation
we've got our cowboys here
i don't think anybody roots differently
i have a boyfriend that lives in fresno
he is for the raiders
i just started to this year because of these silly raiders that didn't do very well
i'm trying
it's a good past time
they say football attracts more men because of the physical aggression on the field
supposedly psychologists say that men take out their frustrations by watching football
they get together with a bunch of guys
they have a good time and everything
that's suppose to be some of the male bonding and the the male instincts i guess or something about the
i shouldn't even try to do it
it's good in terms of a contest
i think that
i personally like hockey better because it's a contact sport
it takes a certain skill to play hockey
i bet up here in new england as well as in the minnesota area
i don't think we do
there's no professional hockey teams in texas
we have a soccer team that comes and goes
they have this world football league
you see we have the n f l that dallas and houston are in and new england patriots and l a raiders and those teams
now they have what's called the world football league
they have all these teams from
None
there's teams in the united states
they're playing now during the summer months
it's really
there's only so much football you can watch
i like to do
it kind of annoys me when people just lay in front of a t v and watch all this stuff
i can see what you're saying about the male bonding
the guys get together
that's kind of cool
that's fun
it can get really overdone
have you ever been to a professional football game
did you do the whole thing the tailgate party and the whole
that's what you got to do
we talked our
the same thing
we talked our wives
we talked our wives into going with us one time
they had a real good time
it was basically for the social atmosphere
that's the thing
you go three or four hours before the game
that whole
it's not so much the contest itself and the game itself
but it's the whole atmosphere of playing of going to a game
that you miss sitting home in your parlor with a six pack of beer and some potato chips you miss that
any professional sport i think
the atmosphere of being there
in high school i went to every football game
i twirled
i didn't
i still had a good time
do you have children in school
i have two that are now just about ready to graduate from college i also have two that are just entering school
you see a big difference then in before and now do you
i think they're just pushing them entirely to fast
it seems to me that kindergarten is now the equivalent of first grade
i think that's such a long day for a kindergartner
i think that's awful
i have a preschooler
i was told by her preschool teacher that she thought maybe she was to immature for kindergarten
i thought how mature do you have to be
what's the new criteria
there is a
it's over and over
it's i t b s and just everything
they test test test
i don't know if you've heard of plano
it's a very transient community
it's just north of dallas it's grown in leaps and bounds
we must have maybe a hundred and fifty thousand people now
most of them from other places
j c penney's come down from new york and of course t i and xerox from rochester
we just
it's a very wealthy community
not that i am
other people seem
i would love to know why
they do
i would
they just have beautiful beautiful homes
they have everything
it's one of these things
that makes it hard for you doesn't it
it does
it does
we do it to a point
not to where she feels different
some of them are very rich
we just kind of have
we have a very goal oriented population because their parents are
i don't know how much of it
the kids are expected to excel in
it's almost impossible because you have so many children and just so many activities that everybody can't be first
they're expected to be
their parents expect it
texas wants very badly to be considered tops in the school system if you read national surveys they're far from it
there's just a whole lot of testing and a whole lot of pushing to do well on these tests
not very well
they make a big deal
say just do this
i just feel they do better that way
i have older children too that now are out of high school
they've always done this here
it's always been the same
it's getting worse and worse
i just think it's really awful
i'm with you on that
i think it's a very long day
it is
my feeling is that you're only a kid once you don't want to spend your whole life in school
my son came home
he said mom all we do is work
i don't think that's right
i just find this a real problem
she had a
when she went back in six weeks she was ahead
what does that tell you
my gosh
my gosh
they could be using this time better
for example in my son's kindergarten they're really finished at lunch time
after lunch they have some
then they have naps or rest period
i think either send them home or do something a little more interesting
i think that working parents have kind of demanded this
they don't want to send them to daycare
do you have the before school care
we have them at one school
that was a really good movie
i thought the story was pretty good too
i think kevin costner did a really good job with it
i've visited the wyoming area
i haven't been to south dakota
have you been up to that
i lived in omaha for five
that rolling kind of
is fairly famili-
i had been told you wouldn't notice that it was three hours long and all this
i noticed yesterday in the paper something said that it
all the critics initially said that it wouldn't go anywhere that it was just going to be a dud
it has surprised everybody
the interesting thing is i had heard that
i tend to i think overreact occasionally when somebody tells me it's that great
the thing is it was a good story
i guess that's what i really like
i've heard that's really great though
you have to go see that one
how about silence of the lamb
i
sleeping with the enemy isn't that a
is it a terror movie
is it just suspenseful
there's not really any blood and guts in it or anything like that
it's more suspense
the other one silence of the lambs is kind of a gory movie if somebody's not into that kind of stuff
it's pretty graphic at points
i think they're both excellent movies
do you listen to gary cogill
he's the movie critic
you've
he has a talk show on the k l i f
people call in
if you keep up with movies it's kind of interesting
they've got a couple of kids ten or twelve years old
they call in
they review movies
it's anyway he
you go watch the movie
in fact people had just seen
anyway it was the
it's interesting though
the difficulty with dancing with wolves is that when you make a movie like that and you produce it and then you star in it the question is did he really know it was going to be good
did he just do it
i think he really
i don't think he really knew it was going to be as big as it was
he wanted to star in it
he enjoyed the story line
i think he really wanted it
whether it won all kinds of awards or whether it just was okay at the box office i think he would have been happy
i think he did a good job
the self-satisfaction he got out of it is much greater than any awards that they can give him
do you know who the guy was that was playing the wagon driver
the guy when he first headed out from the army post
he plays
he does
he's eldon her housepainter
i'd a never put those two together
i thought it
it was him but with the beard and all that stuff
it's
it was really funny that he winds up
i thought it's good that
we're at about five minutes
i haven't been watching my watch
i don't know
it used to just automatically cut off
it says when the conversation is over just say your good-byes and hang up
i guess so
how is it appropriate to be talking about exercise attitudes
my husband is right now teaching an aerobics class
he's an aerobics instructor and is going to be entering
how i met him was through the aerobics class that he used to teach
i'm an avid aerobics
enjoying anything dealing with sports
how do you feel about it
i am a person who wishes i had more time to exercise
i don't feel like i
i try to do things that involve exercise
i very rarely do things like
this is my exercise time i do lots of outdoor sports and things bicycling mountaineering a little mountaineering this and that
i spend a lot of time
i probably get more exercise than your average person
it's not a structured sort of thing
i have to admit i have a certain resistance to the idea of exercising for exercising's sake
perhaps it's because somehow that implies to me it's not fun or something like that
i've
she feels like if it's something that you have to do
then it becomes a chore
she doesn't enjoy it when it's a chore
i feel that way too as far as just sitting and the idea of doing fifty sit-ups or something
you're a calcu-
do your calisthenics
three times a week
i do try and regulate how much exercise i get a week
is that why you like aerobics classes because someone else is doing the counting for you so
it's got
i've always enjoyed dance
it involves
i can't get out to dance all the time
i mean you're using different parts of the body
it is like dance
it's structured like that
you have the music and like you said someone else is counting
it makes it easier for me
someone else is telling me okay let's move this way let's move that way
all you do is follow along and enjoy yourself
i'm like you
i also like to participate in things like
we just went to the myererson symphony run this past weekend
that was a lot of fun
you get to meet different people
and just get out
it's something you can all
it was quite a lot of fun
i love to swim
i love it when it's swimming weather
you're talking to someone from california where it's often swimming weather
i'm in texas
i just assumed that i had
i didn't realize that they were going to reach out to people from
it's actually
it's interesting because there are real regional differences
in california there's almost an assumption
unless you're sort of clearly of an older generation or something in your sixties or something like that
i'm not
there's an assumption that you do something for your physical fitness at least in urban california
maybe not
in urban california it's just
the craze really picked up big here
before that there was the running craze
california tends to be a bit faddish
there must be something to some of them
i think people are more inc-
people from california seem to be more health motivated all around as far as the diet and everything the diet and just your health consciousness
it just
seems like a lot of those ideas generate out of california
health related ideas
there's a sense of it being a package
i think there is a sense of whole
there's a lot of
the university of california at berkeley puts out the wellness letter which turned into a fairly well subscribed to newsletter
it doesn't deal with just exercise or just stress management or just diet or anything
it's on fairly solid scientific ground
it's just dispensed with these distinctions
it says all sorts of factors go into health and there's no reason to talk about one rather than another so that they combined them all together
it's had that orientation for quite some time
there's been some progressive medical schools out here
do you think that's because they've realized that for whole health that you have to have that combination or that people are motivated that way so that they've incorporated that into their program
i can say there's a correlation but i couldn't say which caused the other
each developed a little bit and then would feed off one another and develop a little bit more and a little bit more
i
somebody's got to be willing to pay for it and believe in it
part of it is california
back in the sixties had a lot of alternative movements
some of them fizzled out
some of them were disastrous
others of them had an impact on the society around here
one of the ones that had an impact was people becoming interested in alternate practices
i'm not sure if it was a meditation practice or if it was similar to a stress management practice or alternates to a m a approved medicine
you have major acupuncture schools and things out here
you could have them around long enough
more and more people start believing them or wondering how to combine them with other things
before long you get this whole kind of gestalt this whole package of health care and options exercise is strongly considered one of them
the irony is its people in the cities in my experience that are most oriented towards doing the exercise
i guess because they spend all day in back of their desks
the average person out on the farm at least traditionally the laborers
don't you think they tend to be older in the rural ar-
i sometimes think that it's almost frantic effort on the part of the people in the city
like everything else
i see that
it's frantic to achieve something that a person in a rural area almost doesn't worry about it to such a degree but stays almost healthier
i think so
you've
if you look at other cultures
i know a little bit about people who were considered very healthy in china
they don't do very much vigorous exercise at all
they do a lot of low keyed low impact low stress exercise
they combine it with a meditation or whatever some sort of relaxation they seem pretty
an awful lot of exercise is sort of image conscious
they live to a hundred and ten some
that's
don't you think a lot of that is diet too
a lot of that is diet
they eat a lot of carbohydrates and not much fat
for economical reasons not for preference
as we can see
i'm a practicing vegetarian
i've read a lot of information knowing that to be true
as am i
are you also
is that pretty predominant as far as california do- doe-
for example most restaurants in an urban area will have a little vegetarian section now
that's wonderful
most sort of modern looking restaurants will
we
it's such a trouble here
you just have to eat at home basically
i was actually applying for a job in texas
None
of course in the cities
in the cities
which
you get an influx of a lot of people from all over the country
you're going to have more choices
in urban areas it's steak places
it's not a
it's definitely
it's changing to a degree
it's very frustrating
even with health food stores and stores where you can buy natural products or organic materials
you would think
i'll just hand it off to you
hobbies in our spare time is what we've been selected to discuss today
the hobbies that i pursue in my spare time are crafts
i've been involved in making hat stands and rag dolls and different type hats with flowers and roses and that kind of thing straw hats and
i enjoy it
you kind of get absorbed in it
the time goes by before you realize anything is going on
i play the organ sometimes just for my own satisfaction
i'm not that good at it
i like to bang on the keyboards once in a while
hobbies gee whiz
i never have time to deal with them
i used to do that a lot
i like
i'll take a lot of pictures of her
that's great
and spoil them
i really love that
if i could make it on the road i'd like to play on a bluegrass band or something
that sounds nice
i've done it before when i was in high school and college
it's really a blast
that's the way life is i guess
she's into aerobics
that's good too
we did aerobics together for about a month and a half
that went over real well
that's about it there
it's good
it's healthy too
we have a treadmill and a bicycle and that kind of stuff
we try to get twenty minutes at least three for four times a week
that's great
we like movies
we have
we've been out twice in this year so far
it's kind of become an issue you could say
i like messing around in your house building things and
those kind of things
we put a kitchen in and that kind of stuff and painting and some wallpapering
i like things that two people can do
i like the quiet of doing things away
that's what i find in making the dolls and things that it gives me something that i can create
i like to crochet and knit
we're all skinny farts
when it comes to
to have mainly i guess i get to
it just
smoking and all that stuff
i lived in abilene for a little while
and worked in the abilene plant
we used to go to joe allen's barbecue
that was great
it's
there's pluses to everything
seems like there's just so many things to do down here
i did horseback riding too
that was kind of for them
they weren't as interested in it as we were
that was a real
i'd say probably for maybe fifteen years we dabbled in that
i really enjoyed that
i was disappointed when i went to texas
you have to look real hard to see a lot of things besides concrete
that's about it down here
that's great
sounds like you have a lot of nice hobbies there
look
the thing is that i
since i'm in school i don't basically have a monthly budget because i'm living off my dad
he controls that part
then whenever
the only thing that i basically spend my money on is just food
None
the thing is that i live in a dorm
what happens is you pay six hundred dollars at the beginning or even before school starts
the tuition is also the same thing
the thing is basically that i spend maybe thirty-five forty dollars every two weeks on groceries
that's about it
the thing also is that if you want to go out if you want to go to a restaurant or something then i have to moderate that because it's like i can't go eat out at a nice restaurant and spend twenty dollars three times a week
it's
for us it's like i can spend that money
it's not what i want to spend it on
are you working anywhere while you are going to school
they don't allow me to work since i'm a foreign student
the government doesn't allow me to work
all the money comes from home
you got to make
how do you keep track of where you are in your monthly spending
the thing is that i basically know how much i have right
the thing is that i can tell
i get all my money out of the teller
besides one of my biggest expenses is telephone calls since i have to call international
the bas-
they want me to call down there every so often
i told my dad dad listen if you want to save money i won't call so often
i doesn't matter about the money because we need to hear from you
you call him collect
any
it's considered a luxury in other countries
you just call him direct
since it's his money anyway
you get the bill and send it to him
i got money to pay that too
it's basically
it's not too much money
it's not too little money
i won't have to rush a letter to him or something
he really wants me to concentrate on my studies
what are you studying
what do you think you'll do with that
i can work here up to a year
what's the specialty that your looking for
computer communications and data transmissions
you want to find a data transmissions
you're looking for long distance type stuff
anywhere from local area networks metropolitan area networks all that
you have a family right
does your wife work
she does
it's kind of hard to say now days other than taking care of the house she does a lot of sewing herself
she gets paid for that
she brings some money in
she is trying to start her own business where she does that full time
do that on a full time basis here in town
you have a monthly budget
sort of
we're probably like most american families i guess that we sort of have a budget in that we know how much we've got at the end of the month
we know what bills have to be paid
we pay as many of those bills that can be paid with the monthly budget
you don't have any problem in overcharging on your credit card and stuff like that
we're like everybody else
we've got several credit cards that sometimes instead of paying them all off every month maybe you have to slip some you pay part of it this month and part of it next month especially around christmas time
that's when everybody goes crazy on charging stuff
that's one of the points which i don't see
i don't give a lot of gifts during christmas
i don't like to give any at all the thing is that it's like if i want something i'll ask somebody
for christmas my roommate goes what do you want
i said i want a backpack
no
i told him if you want to give me a present for christmas give me a backpack
i needed a backpack
he gave me a backpack
i knew he needed an alarm clock
i bought him an alarm clock
the thing was that
the thing is especially remember when i was down in argentina to me it was ridiculous
you have to
you spend all this money on all these people
some you don't care about
the thing is that
especially being a college student your
i don't know that you need to be involved in a lot of frivolous gift giving
that effects the budget especially around christmas time
what about when you have breaks like christmas or between sessions
for example we had spring break now
i went skiing
i spent around like maybe two hundred dollars
its like
because it's like we were saying let's go eat out before spring break
if i felt like i spent way to much then i won't go out
my roommate went home
i went skiing over the carolina mountains which aren't anything
i guess it was worth it
any time you can get away and
it was a nice place
get away from the daily grind
let's see how long have we been talking here
nice talking to you
i like to cook foods i like to eat
i find that that's pretty easy to cook because a lot of it is one dish meals type things and
that would be good for a dinner party to cook that because you don't have to deal with eight different things
i usually have parties that are smaller groups
i've never had a real big dinner party except at traditional holidays like thanksgiving and such
yeah
i like to cook heavy sauces and
what do you like to cook
it's funny that we're talking about this
we had
i catered to their diet is the only thing though
it wasn't something i really wanted to make
i really wanted to make red beans and rice with
sausage
i'm from new orleans originally
i was going to make that red beans and rice with those cajun sausage and french bread with garlic butter and stuff
there's salad
then for desert i really wanted to make just brownies
french donuts would have been good
it's real hard to make them
that's what i want
instead i catered to their diet
i made baked chicken in the crock pot
it was good and everything
it seemed kind of boring compared
it kind of down played compared to what you would like huh
do you find yourself with all the cholesterol and high fiber changing the way that you entertain
i guess i feel like if they're on a diet like that i'm going to honor that
if it's just
another couple came over a couple weeks later
i made
i made
anyway i asked
when ricky and carrie came over we made a pot roast with rice and gravy and salad and the whole bit
normally we don't eat like that during the week because of the calories and the fat in it
when we're having guests we just kind of say oh just do it
i made blueberry cobbler
we had extra crust with it
i don't think we gained any weight from it
every once in a while i think i feel the same way
a lot of women will turn down dessert if it's too rich simply because they don't want the extra calories
i think dessert is the only thing that i kind of down play sometimes
she didn't eat it
i did bake apples so that it would be not brownies
i've read a good brownie recipe
that's good
anyway i guess that's about what i did when i entertained
do you have anything else you want to say about it
nothing comes to mind right off
i guess not
it was nice talking to you
all right
i would like to talk about just briefly
i think it's refreshing to see the support that the president got from the american people
i read an interesting article in the paper that discussed that
seemed that every other time a president tried to get support for an action like president carter and his thing with the hostage crisis
he always did it through rhetoric
this time president bush did it through action
he drove policy by the course he took and almost forced public support
he left almost no alternative
it was very interesting how he did it
i'm an air force officer
None
it was interesting for me
i'd certainly
i think it's great that all the support
i have friends of mine from the air
i'm an engineer and work in the rolm laboratory
other guys here on base
they're getting a tremendous amount of support out of it
that's great
if you remember the vote in the congress to authorize war if necessary was actually pretty close
if my memory serves me right i believe a majority of democrats may even have opposed it
it was
i don't know the exact figure
i would imagine that because of how close the vote was almost certainly would have to be
just based on the disparity of
i
gosh this whole thing now with all the political cartoons on the democrats and how
they're in a sad way for ninety-two now in terms of the presidential election anyway
how many years are we going to wait
what do you do with the people that are over there in the mean time
all those factors played a part in the
everyone was discussing whether we should wait longer
i know that there's a lot of reasons to wait longer
i think we were genuinely concerned about their military capability
i think we over estimated it
we were worried that they were getting dug in
in fact they were so well dug in that when we sent our tanks around behind them they couldn't get turned around in time
they couldn't
saddam thought he had the whole thing figured out to which way we were coming and what our doctrine was
had we done a frontal assault it probably would have worked more to his favor
i think this political situation over there now is
it'll be interesting to see what comes out of it whether this opposition will
today the turks agreed to support the kurds which is something they've never done before
this
the arabs all of a sudden are cheering for baker on his drive to reconcile relations with the israelis
it's like
baker is really not very much pro israel
did you know john sununu is half arab
i think i did hear that at one time a long time ago
i used to live in massachusetts
in fact when he was governor of new hampshire i believe
my gosh
now he is a conservative
he is not a conservative that favors israel
that concerns me greatly
i don't
i'd certainly support israel in their policy in defending themselves and in their handling of their foreign policy
i think the stand they have or the way the command respect i support that
i think that is a positive thing for them after thousands of years
they ha-
when they became a country they more or less decided they weren't going to take it anymore
they didn't have much choice
gee
okay
i can't say whether that i'm pro israel or anti israel
i'd like to see them resolve something in that situation and get some stability in the region
looks that the joining of forces for this desert shield and desert storm thing ended up being a positive thing
it is a positive thing
however every time an organization such as the p l o says we'll see if we can work with israel then they get embarrassed every few months by documents that reveal that their ultimate purpose is to totally eliminate them
you basically have mutually exclusive interests
the arabs are going to occupy the area
i'm just not sure that there's going to be any easy permanent solution
i think that's the problem the p l o has is that whenever one group of them decides that they're going to negotiate or they're going to do something they're going to try to make some peace the end result is that there so many factions of them some more violent than others some with a certain agenda different than the others or they split
they end up becoming divisive themselves
i'm looking forward to seeing what happens over there in the next couple of months
that's
i commend israel for their restraint in not responding to the scud attacks
that's absolutely unprecedented
an incredible foreign policy coup on the part of the president and the state department
that's never happened before
i don't know if it will ever happen again
it's been fun i enjoyed talking with you
i guess maybe the computer will pair us up together another time
you're from north carolina
my name's mary
do you
i was visiting my son down in dallas
his wife has a contract with t i
that's how we learned about it
i'm down at n c state
i took a class
he said sign up and get some money and just talk for five minutes
what do you think that
what do you think we can do to solve the crime in america
if i knew that i'd be a very wealthy person
what are the steps
you have to see
the way i look at it you have to think first of all why
has crime increased
if so why has crime increased
the problem is that
in the country people still respect the property of other people
as
the people in the country don't want as much as the people in the city
what happens is all those that don't have any money in the country move to the cities
they rush to get the same thing
the thing that we can do is we need money for drugs
what we have to do is we have to go get some stuff steal it and then just resell it
that certainly is one reason why crime here has increased
that's the main reason i think everywhere
you have deaths
you have murders
you have people stealing other people's stuff
the thing is that it's like you might be standing somewhere right
let's say you're driving out
you're driving back home
it's late at night
you stop by one of these twenty-four hour gas stations joints
somebody walks in there with a gun
they're going to want the money
you can tell by the people who are always caught that these people are there to get money for drugs
they don't want the money so they can do something else with it
the perhaps not strange but something that many people don't realize is that you can go back as far as nineteen fifty-one and fifty-two and find that there were drug dealers at that time trying to influence the high school kids
i'm a retired educator
in fifty-one and fifty-two the police came to the high school where i was and were telling us how to recognize when kids were on drugs how to recognize the pushers outside the one entrance that they were giving their drugs away in order to get the kids started and so on and so on
it's a problem that's been around for over forty years
we're just really now trying to figure out how to cope with the problem because it has grown so huge
there's a song that i know which says tha-
it's like in nineteen eighty-eight nineteen eighty-nine the local state and federal governments spent the least amount of money on crime in america
their figures i think are so
it's like compared to weapons or stuff like that you're spending nothing on crime in the country itself
what you're doing is you
it's like you have other things
we're going to solve try to solve the aids problem while some people are getting killed here and there
another one of the problems is that the people who are the dealers the big dealers in drugs
may be part of the power structure that's keeping us from spending the money in that direction
those people never get caught
the people that i
their theory is that if i'm surrounded and i'm going to be caught i'm going to try to find my way through
they're not going to take me alive
i have such a big army outside of my place that nobody can touch me
it's like
of course i might be the leading drug dealer here
you won't find me dealing in drugs
there's no connection between me and the people that were caught
the guy at the very top the one who's really making the millions and the millions is the one who also many times is part of the power structure and had the political pull to keep the interest or the emphasis in some other direction other than on the drug dealing
it sure is monstrous in this country
i was at a party on saturday
this guy comes over
this guy was from jamaica right
he's got his little brother selling drugs
he goes yeah i just came up here to work
i go oh you did you make very good money up here
he goes
in the movie good fellows
within two months he has all his house payments gone everything paid
he had enough money to
it's like those guys at one point they had so much money that they didn't know what to do with it
really
even in our prison systems they're finding that they're having drugs smuggled into them
that was also in the movie
hello mary
that is a wonderful movie
goodness no
you don't even realize it
we all heard different opinions about it
one that
they thought at certain points that it was going to end
it didn't
it kept going on
i thought it was great
i've seen some different clips of it
it looks good
i heard a story about there's a certain scene in the movie where they're on a buffalo hunt
they have a particular child actor who's being supposedly run down by a buffalo
when they were trying to film that the buffalo that they used for that scene was neil young's buffalo
he has a fetish for oreo cookies
now i've seen another clip of the guy that plays in murphy brown
he played the character in it that was very dirty
i saw the one clip of him
i guess he was taking kevin costner to the site where he was going to be or whatever
that was rather gross
the wagon driver
other than that i've heard
the costuming
the only thing about the costuming my husband remarked that the indians all appeared to be wearing new things
they should have taken them out and rolled them in the dirt a little more probably to age the material
they did very authentic reproductions of the actual stuff
they didn't age it quite enough it seemed
it was a very good movie
i guess i will have to see it then
actually have been to the movies
i didn't see that
very suspenseful
i don't like stephen king
i went with someone
once i was there i couldn't believe
it's an excellent movie
just generally that kind of scary stuff i just don't want to have anything to do with it
it's not necessarily scary as it is suspenseful
it's not
i think i heard somebody talking about that she cuts his foot off or something
in the book apparently she cuts his feet off
in the movie she disables him but not by cutting his feet
she breaks both of his ankles
that i couldn't watch
you could tell when it was coming
yeah
you wouldn't like to see anything happen to anybody
it was just how she got so caught up
her emotions she feel madly in love with this writer
there was this
she was a killer
the character prior to that had been someone that had killed other people no one knew that
we went to see not without my daughter
mostly we wait until they come out on video tape
we rent them
yeah that looks really good too
there were a couple others that i just haven't had the time
i
i'm intrigued by it
i'm not sure i want to go see it yet
i think
we had some friends that went to see it
they said it was okay
it might not be as
i think they may be playing up some aspects of the movie that aren't the main aspects
we went to see the jagged edge
i liked that movie
it seems like that kind of thriller suspense and not real strange in other ways
i guess that's about it
i think
i think that's the way everybody has done it so far
anyway i think that we are paying a lot in taxes
i think that we have a government and we have a lot of freedoms and we have a lot of things that the governments do with our money
we're probably one of the only countries in the world that has all the things that we have
the
as far as the quality of the streets the school systems the hospital stuff that the government gives money to the all the things that the government does like that i think they need to manage it a little bit better
i don't think anybody is just going to come in and fix it in a couple of weeks because they've been messing it up for many years now
you're right
we do have a good government
we do have a lot of things that the taxes are there to support
i do think they're mismanaged
i think that sometimes it's i don't know to easy of an answer
it seems to say i'll tax them if you can't get enough money instead of trying to figure out how to cut budgets or cut spending or get all of the waste out of the spending
i don't know what y'all are paying in dallas
it seems like we pay the state
there's a
the taxes set by the state and the city can add theirs
the county adds theirs
we're paying almost eight percent sales tax right now which seems to me nuts
when i left there we paid six cents on the dollar
that was one of the highest in the nation
i'm thinking everybody is sitting here screaming about we don't want a state income tax
yet they allow the sales tax to go up and up and up and up
they don't do anything about it
we're still one of few that don't have the state tax
i did pay state tax in california
my goodness
what did you call it the sales tax is just getting outrageous to pay
where do you come from originally
i've lived in the dallas area here since i was like four
it's i don't know an urban area i guess
you just managed to escape the real texan accent
i don't know
what did they say to
even in the story where they had to pay the taxes the disciples
and jesus said the money in the fishes mouth or in the fisher inside the fish
i thought of those two things when i was holding for a long time
were you really
back then what they tried to do
that's what they were trying to do with the tax situation
of course that's when he said well you render unto caesar's what is caesar's
of course there
i believe in paying taxes
yeah
i don't want to pay more than i have to
i get outraged when i feel like they go up for useless reasons
i believe that they're necessary
i really do
do you deal with taxes much in what you do when you work
i spends a lot of time with our income tax though especially this year and last year
i have been married for just a few years
i've had to really switch around from the e z form to the
i saw that too
that was one of the main pluses that we have about buying a house
it will help tremendously
at the end of the year you've paid all interest and no principles
that will definitely help in taxes and what you will get back
i get twenty six paychecks
if you pay your rent or your house payment every two weeks
instead of once a month you'll come out paying one month extra every year
if have you a thirty year note it will take like seven or plus years off of your note
my parents bought a home in san diego about four or five years ago
they did that
that's exactly right
that's going on the principle
when we bought this house we looked at doing a fifteen year note because it added more to the payment
but not significant amounts
we're taking our time
that's good though
we just started two or three weeks ago
we're not going to just kill ourselves
that's good though
that's good
anyway i can't think of a whole lot more to say
i can't either
my wife she went to the school out there in lubbock
she was at school out here
what was her name
good luck in your house hunting
y'all work at t i
i used to work
i did all of their capital and financial planning for about eight years
i have been in human resources for the last two years
i work with those same people all those nine years
i'm turning in a capital request right now
you work in back grind
i'm sort of an acting process engineer
that's pretty much what i do
that's what you do
do you
good deal
i like him
we needed that
that's good
he was very good for lubbock when he came to
that's what he said here
he's broadened the devices that we're making too
that's good
anyway it was nice to talk to you
you too
i know they will
besides my daughter wants me to put her to bed
have a good day
why do you think it sounds
i think the country is too ingrained in the inches and just the general background
i don't think there's a big advantage in going to the metric system
it's going to disorient and confuse a lot of people for years and years
there are going to be people who die because of it because they don't understand simple things from the amount of medicine they should take to how fast they can drive and how far away something is
it's not in our national consciousness to do it
i agree with you
i don't think the benefits of the metric system outweigh the disadvantages that would happen to the people in america also the
it seems almost like it's a peer pressure thing is why we keep wanting to do it is so we'll look good to the other nations
i think that's an area that the other nations especially europe look down on us like we're just backward wayward children who still use this backward system who haven't really attained it yet
i feel it's just pride of why they keep trying to push it on us
it's like hey we're content with this
probably intellectually doesn't
it's not as sound intellectually but like you said come on
i don't know the metric system i don't care to learn it i'm not some kind of an idiot
it's easy to trans-
if it's necessary to translate back and forth between them it can be done i'm a mechanical engineer
i've had to work when i was designing packages for people
i had to work both systems back and forth
it was not hard
you can get a cat cam system that can take any design you want
you can push a button
it'll convert every
you're educated
a lot of people are flat not educated
if i have a hard time putting that into my life can we put that off on the other eighty percent of the population that doesn't have any college
i don't know how much of the
a large percentage probably over half of the rest of the population they don't have any college probably much at all
if we can't take it and use it easily how can you put that on elderly people and just people that maybe just aren't blessed with as much sharpness and mental acuity
or even have had the chance to go to college or to learn about
they do
that's acceptable
like what you said hey this is ridiculous
if you look at the average family it's like man they barely have time to stop and get gas much less to try and figure out how much gas they're really getting and do all this
it's like come on let's take the pressure
you know you need twenty gallons but you need how many liters
it's just like another thing the american family doesn't need any more pressure
leave them alone
it just doesn't make that much difference in the average life
the scientific community and places where it's needed that's fine
the rest of the world we are
let them come to us
if they don't like the way we do it just don't worry about it i think
it's kind of like expecting everyone to suddenly speak german
it is it is another language
instead of saying the world speak german we found out that we can translate
that's what i think we ought to do with the metric system
that's good
we'll end up one man was telling me about his grandfather in lithuania
we were talking about income tax or something
i just
good talking to you
like i told you before
you're talking about
i had a delightful evening one night cutting a bunch of those suckers up
i wish i had
you should try it
i had a business going
i had a coin shop
everything was going great while gold and silver was up
it started falling
i started paying expenses and stuff on my credit cards
things got worse and worse
finally boom
i ended up going into bank-
it'll get better next week
there i was in old bankruptcy court
you weren't charging gold and silver were you
you can
they take payment any way they can get it
that's a nightmare
course on merchandise that i was buying on cards i was getting the money back
i was selling it
i wasn't buying just to hold onto it
it was things like rent and phone bills and advertising and all that other good stuff that ate them all up
i remember before i got married
when you graduate from college they'll send you all those credit card applications
i had stuff for sanger harris
it got up like to couple of hundred dollars
i thought well that's okay cause all they wanted was ten dollars a month
every time they had a sale there i was
get such good bargains
i don't know
just today in the mail i got my guaranteed acceptance by american express
they started sending those things to me again
course i guess i've been purged from their records
back when i had my business i got one
they goofed up bad on my very first bill
i was using the american express strictly for the travel expenses
the bill would come in
i'd pay it
the very first bill
i got this nasty letter from them saying you're overdue pay
i said it just crossed in the mail
i didn't do anything about it
said we're going to turn this over to our attorneys if you don't pay
i looked at that
i said uh-huh
by this time my checks had come back from the bank
i made a copy of the check that they had cashed attached it to their letter and sent them a nasty letter with the card cut in little bitty pieces saying thanks but no thanks
what is it now
no
what's the interest
that's the card see
interest is like eighteen or something
of course on the green card you have to pay it when the bill comes in so there isn't any
on the optima card it's
let's see right now it's running at about
it's about sixteen and a half percent which is pretty good
credit cards
they're dangerous
my parents don't hardly use them
my mom has a mastercard and a visa card
that's it
now i do use gas cards
impact is kind of bad too though
especially if you forget to record those little suckers
that's the whole problem with it
you're tempted if you've got cash a little bit of cash and you don't have enough for the purchase right
my husband says i might buy it
i don't really usually consider that an option
having been out of the credit game for some years now i've gotten used to either paying in cash or not getting it
it's hard isn't it
it is
i'm kind of grateful for the experience because it's taught me a lot of restraint
it makes you feel good when you whip out the cash instead of your plastic
i just went out and got a new v c r yesterday with cash
it's
there's always a sale
circuit world or something
their prices aren't that terrific
they used to be
they've got to pay for all that national advertising now
it's national
they're all over the country now
what else
they used to be good
i don't know if you have a place there called
you probably have something similar
circuit city came along
that was the place to go to get your t v and washer and dryers and refrigerators and all that
after the years went by they just sort of kept creeping up on price
actually service merchandise is cheaper than them now
north carolina state
you're on spring break
ours doesn't start until next week
where are you
what are you getting your degree in
what do you do with it
what is it
it's more psychology and engineering
my master's is in industrial engineering
you're working on your doctorate
that will sound wonderful won't it
i b m
a lot of people use human factors
i b m is what i'm looking at right now
aren't they laying off several thousand people
not at the human factors level
i heard it on the news today
as a matter of fact the i b m in carey which is a little suburb of raleigh just hired one more human factors person
i'm going into the dissertation this summer
get that done this summer
i'm going to start this summer
i probably won't finish it until the end of the year i'm trying to get a intern position with i b m right now so that i can find an area to do my dissertation in
that and it's limited application in some respects
in the area that we're in here there's a lot of places that use human factors people
as a matter of fact this past weekend since we had a long weekend i took on a painting project in my bathroom
i had wallpaper up
it took me all weekend
the wallpaper getting it off i had to wet the walls down
that had to dry
the spackling had to dry a day
the painting took another day
you didn't try rewallpapering
you just
i just painted
i just used a semigloss
did you get good results
it looks so
i need to either paper back over it or do something
it didn't cover it
it just didn't look as smooth as i wanted it to
we moved last august
we're getting a house
we decided
they just said you can get by
i forgotten what it was you put down and then you can just paint right over the dark
more or less
after about half dozen coats it looks reasonable
it kept
the dark
it was just a real dark wood grain type paneling it was smooth
we put this stuff on
it supposedly textured it or did something to it
because of the dark behind it it was really hard to cover
it was something like that although when we got through i wished we hadn't done it
we were trying to make the house look nice to sell it
we were painting it and trying to make it
it really was
the advice they give you is
particularly when you try to
i was talking to somebody else who had a lot of wood panelling
they had gotten somebody to come in with an estimate
it seemed like it was a good sized den with a lot panelling
the people quoted thirty thousand dollars to paint it or something
my goodness
have you tried getting outside estimates to see what it costs to have something painted
when we bought the house that we live in right now we had a company that came out and painted it
that was one of the requirements from f h a that the house be painted before we bought it
it was fairly reasonable
all the trim around the house was
that's quite reasonable
that wasn't too bad
problem i-
have you tried matching paint lately
we built a shed over the long way
i did finish it
my wife went to the home depot i think it was and took a copy took a piece of brick she wanted to paint the shed
it's a wooden shed
she took it
they've got this machine that matches the color of paint
they got
in fact she put some right ba-
they mixed a gallon of it
it's just remarkable how close it will match the paint
it does it electronically something
they
it's electronic
you put your sample under this thing
it looks at it and determines the
it's really remarkable
the problem they had
they wanted some gray to do the trim
didn't occur to them that they could have taken a sample from
anyway it's remarkable
that's one of the problems though when you start painting to try to get the
you want this to look like this
you want that to look like that
when you start getting into colors
as a matter of fact what we've got ours painted now is kind of a light creamy color and a blue
the blue even two years later or so it doesn't match
what's your
i have no idea
at least you'll get very good at it right
you could go back and paint
this is an interesting topic that they would bring up painting
it seems like everybody has to go in and do
although the
it
we painted the house to
we painted the whole inside
it had all this dark trim
we thought
i think we left most of it because it gets to be
good luck
actually i don't know whether it made
it's interesting that the white makes the rooms look bigger
in our down stairs in our dining room it has molding like picture frames i don't know what you that actually that are along the walls up a couple of feet
my wife
i see
it makes the room look remarkably smaller
she painted the insides dark blue and then the trim
the molding by
she did that all the way around the room which makes it look very attractive
it makes the room look smaller which is
it explains why they have everything white
you wouldn't think that i
maybe that understands colors would know all of that stuff
what about the lighting
not particularly
the house has so many windows it has
the living room has four good size windows
of course at night
with the
the lights shine right at our house
that
the color doesn't really matter because you have that light
i think it's just the dark blue to about three feet
anyway it didn't change
the interesting thing is that paint we wound up having to go back and scrape some of that away
it kind of bled under the masking tape which i guess is probably the topic we're really on to that the masking is
it takes a long time
i'm sorry to hear your color didn't come out so good over the weekend
i've got to go to a meeting
i wondered if i was going to get to talk to a male or a female on this type
this is probably more interesting if it had been a male and a female
i guess there have been certainly a lot of changes in the last couple of generations
for the roles of women
i guess the most significant probably is that so many are working now
and trying to juggle job and home and family and all sorts of other possibilities
they may be going to school or may have elderly parents or all sorts of other things
it seems too me like though that women's roles are changing faster than the men and therefore the women are spreading themselves thinner
i think so
i think it's extremely difficult to keep up with all that we have to these days
they are not quite as much of a responsibility
they are still there
i still provide most of the things that go on around the house
yeah
for a while i was going to school too
it was tough
i think that while it's a good change for i think women to be able to fulfill their potential in whatever they feel
i think sometimes other things suffer and tha-
in some ways i think we are expected to do it all
that's where the problem is really
i decided that it was very important to me to stay home
when i happen to you know be
i'm very active with other people with children my age
most of us do tend to stay home
when i run into people that just have recently had babies or have very young children and are working full time there's almost a friction between us
not people that are necessarily good friends
even though that has happened too
if you don't then sometimes you feel like you're looked down upon by people that go back to work and so you're just wasting your time
i've done some of both
when my kids were real little i was at home for a couple of different periods of time
i think the longest was less than a year
still at least i was able to spend those first months with them
i mostly went back to work because i was tired of doing without things
even now i would like to not have to work in some ways
it's kind of pull and tug
on the other hand i can't imagine just being at home although i have a lot of interests and a lot of things i would like to pursue
still there's sort of a feeling of accomplishment with having a job and all that goes with that
that's definitely true
in fact i work out of my home
i'm an accountant
i do taxes and bookkeeping
i
i still unfortunately have to be very disciplined
it's worked out for my family
do you think things are going to change
are we going to keep having to try to juggle all of this
i hope that they will change
i'm
i feel as though a lot of people are going back to just having a one wage earner
i'm just thinking of my circle of people that i know
i know quite a few people who have decided to not have both of the parents work
yet i we-
i hope to see employer based helping out
child care centers at the place of employment and things like that that will help out
i see some people wanting to stay home more and take care of the children
even those who may not do it seem to be spending more time with their kids and really trying harder at making all of the family things work
i don't know if they're going to ever give up their careers
it would be nice if there could be an in-between a middle ground somewhere
i think it's hard though when you talk about families and raising children
i think children have a hard time understanding a middle ground
i think they need security
yet they
from speaking from my children they aren't real flexible
they want to know things are going to be a certain way
i think they like a routine of sorts
we will see
i'm hoping to see more female leadership in our society
i like the fact that gradually you're beginning to see women in public office and executive positions
it's still a long way from being what it ought to be
the numbers are still very skewed to say the least
i enjoyed talking to you
i am basically retired now
basically i wore dresses
and heels
i because my work often took me into court never was one that got accustomed to wearing pants suits and pants to work
that was just me
i know many people are very comfortable in the classroom and what have you wearing pants
i guess i was just old enough not to be very comfortable in it
i work at t i
they don't really have dress code so to speak there
it's pretty lax about
you can pretty much wear whatever you want to
i wear anything from jeans when i'm feeling really casual to suits and dresses when i'm meeting with a customer
i teach training classes
when i'm teaching a class obviously i wear a suit or dress
it definitely fluctuates mainly with what i'm going to be doing that day and kind of what my mood is
when it's raining
when it's really cold i'm more likely to wear jeans or pants or sweaters or that type of thing
it just really depends on the weather and my mood
obviously when i'm doing anything that i'm in front of people or making presentations teaching whatever
i think that does make a difference
when you do have to be in front of people
i think the tendency there is to wear dresses and suits and more classical style of clothing
i've never worn
even to
jeans aren't exactly professional
for some reason a mini skirt is to me a little more unprofessional to wear to work than jeans
maybe it's just because of the sexist views and everything
you just feel like you're showing too much le-
they weren't overly shor-
they weren't overly revealing
for me i just wouldn't want to do that
there are mini skirts and there are mini skirts
there are some that may be will come like four inches or five inches above the knee
again it depends upon the size the shape of the person
i also
even though i retired from education i do modeling
i teach at a modeling agency here
when we are doing wardrobing and we have two hour classes in wardrobe we do discuss a great deal the mini skirt and the types of clothes to wear on the job
even though i may have them from sixth grade on up through grandmothers
i always try to emphasize the clothes that you wear should not necessarily be the greatest fad
maybe those are not the clothes that are the most appealing to you or the most complimentary to you
the mini skirt many times will evoke comments you don't really want
then you're in the situation where you're very unhappy
i feel like too on the job when there's men around and some of the managers are men you don't want them looking at your legs
to me i just wouldn't feel comfortable in that at work
i have to agree with that even when they was very very popular in the early sixties
i
we had no regulation against it
a lot of the kids did of course
it could be very embarrassing for the men teachers
they were not that careful in how they handled themselves in those mini skirts
i think of course now i go the other extreme i do not like to see in the corporate areas all the women dressed like men
with the suits and white shirts and ties and what have you so that they all look exactly the same
i don't like that
even with the very tailored look of a suit sometimes i like to have just a little something that's feminine
not
i can be professional too
i don't think that you have to be manish and extremely tailored to look professional
i think that you make of that what you wish
you can go the opposite direction and over do all the frills and laces and flounces and what have you which don't belong at least in my opinion in the work place
that
you can have a classical look without a great deal of adornment and what have you and still be very feminine
that was one thing i always fought against
i was always fighting against the idea of looking tailored or manish
people would never ever guess that i was phys ed
that pleased me
then i of course just continued what i considered the best style of clothing for me at work
i find even at home here now
when i go out somewhere then unless i have a pair of dress slacks i don't usually wear a lot of blue jeans
i just feel that each person has to dress to their own liking and for their own comfort
there are certain norms that companies should be able to put out as guidelines for their employees
that's one thing i like about t i is that they aren't overly strict about what you wear
your boss doesn't come up to you and say now remember tomorrow you have a meeting so you'd better wear a suit
they leave it up to you and your judgment to use good judgment and dress tastefully and dress for whatever occasion you may have
the only real restrictions they have are no halter tops and no shorts even the long walking short of the squirts the split skirts
anything that could be considered shorts they don't allow
they don't allow any sweat shirts or t shirts that might have vulgar or anything like that on it
other than that it's pretty lax
i think that's good because it does allow people to be individual
it allows you to kind of dress the way you feel that day
if you want to be comfortable and casual you can
sometimes i think you may be more productive if you're comfortable with what your wearing and can feel more relaxed
whereas sometimes when your in the suit and feel kind of almost stiff and maybe you can't get as comfortable to sit down
when i'm writing training material i prefer to be more comfortable unless i know i have to meet with a customer later during the day
i think that is good that they're like that
they must wear blue or gray or black and a white shirt and
no variation
i don't quite agree with that
i did have a group come over from one of the banks over the children's hospital where i was volunteering
they were doing a presentation
every one of the young execs coming up were dressed exactly a like men and women
they all had on the gray jackets and the gray trousers or skirts and the white blouses and the same color tie
you could hardly tell the women from the men except for the lengths of the pants
one was a skirt and one was a pant
i think that's sad because that doesn't allow for any individuality
that can stifle creativity
it's been nice talking with you
i want to go see that
i just went because we could never get to go see it together because it's so long
i finally just went to see it
i just thought it was fantastic
i watched costner
he did pretty good on that one
i bet
it just blew me away
dances silence of the lambs
i'm afraid to go see that one
that's what they said about the exorcist
you'll have nightmares
we laughed about it
i thought man
i guess it was because i'd read the book before i saw the movie
the book to me was far more frightening than the movie was
he had a way of putting you in that scene
of course i was living alone at the time
it was late at night and scary
you start hearing noises
there's rats in the attic
let's see
i can't remember
with that new michael j fox movie the hard way
where he plays a actor that's th-
i didn't even like the previews on that
i know
i ended up at the theater
there didn't seem to be anything else on
i'll try that
it wasn't worth anything
i don't much care for michael j fox anyway
the last two i saw him in one of those back to the future part three deals
that was crummy also
i know
i think the only i've ever seen a sequel was two thousand and one
two thousand and ten was far better
i hadn't read it
i couldn't figure what was going on half the time
the book was so much
a lot of that stuff that was going on in the film you say what is this
what's the significance of the apes
the book is really good
i keep a little library of books that i just like to read over and over again
that's one of them
it's so well written
i have one i bet you haven't seen if you don't have kids otis and milo
you're right
it has to see it on the big screen because it's just the most gorgeous nature scenes you've ever seen in your life
it's all this
it's not
it's just so realistic everything they do
it was
those a real dog and cat
all the other animals
the cat gets on this treacherous journey
he winds up all over creation
it's just really an incredible thing
sounds sort of like the incredible journey
of course the only sound is dudley moore narrates it
there's nothing else
it really keeps me going
i've seen it twice now
that sounds a lot like a walt disney film
i mean i was raised on walt disney films
old yeller big red
all those old good ones that you wish they had on more now
it was so good that i had forgotten that it was christmas eve
that's something for a kid
that was something for greedy old me at christmas time i'll tell you
i just saw one on the video
have you seen the gods must be crazy part two
the second one
that's my sense of humor
i'll have to go get that one i guess
i guess i'm just middle america or something
not really interested in the terminator or some of the schwarzenegger
i get so tired of these sequels
yeah
yeah
freddy eats a nuclear warhead
i'm just
i haven't seen a one
i was afraid that rambo was going to do the same thing that rocky was going to do
i just
i don't even rent them
i figure if i find a movie i like i'll buy it
once he has one he likes he likes to watch it over and over
my very favorite one that the top of the tick for me is excalibur
i loved that film
i lived over in england for four years
it was just gosh
it was filmed in ireland
they got pretty scenery in ireland
i've been down to the south of england where supposedly king arthur's castle was
that really has a lot of meaning for you to see that
it was unimpressive to look at
the whole thing was about the size of a medium house
when i was in england years ago
i went to shakespeare's and stratford-on-avon and all that
it was like you couldn't stand up inside of it
it was so short
i spent four years traveling around and didn't see hardly anything
stonehenge of course
everybody makes the obligatory trip to stonehenge
that was a riot to see that
come to think of it i don't think i went to the movies one time
where i lived it was a little town called newmarket
there was another town called barry saint edmunds about twenty miles away from us
they had a little theater company there
we use to go out to that about once a week
amateurs but really quite good
that was interesting
other than that i just didn't have time to go to the movies
never sho- anyway anything that i ever wanted
the closest movie theater was barry saint edmunds
who wants to drive twenty miles to go to the movies
a lot of people did
it would have to be a good show
i us-
they have all these neat phrases
like critically acclaimed
i see
they can't
it's kind of like waterfront property or something if you're two miles away from water
waterfront property here at love canal
critically acclaimed
good grief
there's a lot of reasons why i don't go to movies
primarily now i'm probably going to upset you
people who bring kids irritates the heck out of me
the guy called me
i'm in the middle of going out for bids to have my house painted
painting is not hard to do
as long as it's not to the point of where it needs to be scraped and peeling
our house is not
it's starting to bleed through and burn through because the paint's real cheap
it's just a hassle to go through it
i'm looking for the easy way out
i know
is easy to find painters to do this for you
you have to be aware of how messy they can get and are they going to put on a good two coats and are they
interior's not so bad because it's more fun
when we've painted
there isn't as much wood that has to be painted
it
the problem is that the sun hits it
preparing is a real problem
else it will flake
they put up a quarter inch masonite basically
they painted it kind of like a spun of a sorts
it's real cheap
i've had thirteen hundred dollar bid and as low as five hundred and forty dollars
there one guy brags about his piece of equipment he's using and the drop cloths and all that kind crap
i'm so much worried about that as what
which might be a bigger problem than it would be
y'all you haven't had any jobs painted in your house recently
we have done a little painting ourselves
we painted the bedroom well within the last couple of months
we have some more that need to be done
the problem that we've owned this house almost five years now
when we bought it it had been vacant for a while because the family will retired
the daughter was a real estate agent
she was selling it
it's been lived in briefly by her before she bought her town house
she told us that the house had been professionally painted recently
it looked pretty good the interior walls all basically white
they obviously had been done without to much wear afterward
the only problem was when we started having the movers move the furniture in we identified various rooms by pieces of masking tape on the door frames
that's not very
what had happened is that professional painters had not prepared the surface properly
some of still has to be redone
they just painted over varnished wood
actually it had been a repaint job
they had not
they hadn't really roughed it up or whatever
it was woodwork
it looked as if it had been painted
correctly with an enamel or something
it had not
it was greasy or something
it comes off in strips not even little bit
we still have some of that trim work to do because we put it off
you almost have to strip the whole thing
who is your favorite football team
i would say the saints
i want to tell you something
they
i'm a buffalo bills fan
from a long time ago
it's good to see the bills doing so well now
of course i watch every saints game that i can watch
i think they're really going to do good because it seems like they're finally all
the n f l draft really seems to be doing its job
got teams like buffalo who certainly weren't a powerhouse ten years ago
a few years ago denver was a powerhouse
None
now the other team
you see how
they're hurting
they got so much bad publicity too
i think that hurt a lot of
yeah
firing tom landry and hiring jimmy johnson
what kind of
any team where the owner would fire tom landry is one of the greatest coaches of all time
just because they had a couple of bad seasons
you can't even attribute those bad seasons to bad coaching
all the problems
if you think about those years that we had the losing season of how bad
his players were constantly getting kicked off the team because of drugs because of
messing with young children
it was just one thing it seemed like right after the other
he alway-
had a lot of trouble with injuries too
he'd never seem to be able to keep his guys healthy
even like what is it eric dickerson left
the team
people were jumping ship right and left
i don't know
then the team was sold
that jimmy johnson came in too though
he just
when he bought the team and all it just seemed like he just decided this is the way it's going to be
it was bad
it really was
anything that tom landry wanted or had he was going to change it
that's the way i felt about it
look how good we did without a quarterback this year
i can't even think of who the new orleans quarterback
had quite a few quarterbacks if you think about it
i can't remember that guy's name the one that held out for the money
he was across the river
i can't think of his name now
really we didn't have a quarterback
we had one guy that couldn't run
it was just bedlam
it was defense won all the games
were they able to draft anybody this year
they gave away a lot of their drafts
other places
i don't know
i hadn't heard whether they have a new one or not
when is the
has the n f l draft even gone yet
i don't know whether they have one of the first
ye-
i don't know whether they'll be far enough up where they can do any good
even making the playoffs
that doesn't help you in the draft
really really and truly we just don't have a quarterback
the players and stuff they finally quit giving away the really good players and started keeping them too
we had some
he was good
every time we'd get a real good player they'd treat him bad
of course we had a different coach then too
they'd treat him bad
he'd leave
either they'd trade him off to somebody else for two of these nobodies
it was weird
it was like they were trying if you were good boy let's don't have you on our team
this year they had all good players except for the quarterback
i think they played
all of them were bad
they were terrible
they couldn't even take handoffs
it's one thing
our defense was unbelievable
lucky though to have jim kelly than
then with the defense with bruce smith there at linebacker there they've got a very well rounded team
it seems that they've gotten over their bickering and their fighting as problems they had in the past
now they're really playing good together as a team
do you watch it every sunday
i'm a musician
the band i play in i
the band i play in we tend to rehearse quite a bit on sundays
i missed a lot of sundays during this
did you ever get to watch any of the new orleans games
i'd have to confess i don't really scope out the new orleans games per se
i don't like the broncos
i lived outside of boston for five years
my family lives in philadelphia now
i tend to look for
i lived in detroit too
i
i'll normally check out the eagles or the patriots
patriots were so depressing this last year that
first and foremost the bills
i got to go to a bills game this year which was fun
it was the bills eagles game which appropriately enough fortunately the bills won
it was good weather
we beat buffalo in was it third of december
my goodness
we couldn't a done much better than that in buffalo
usually it's snowing
i tell you what
i don't know how it will be this year
these games
it was like i was sitting on the edge of my chair going no no
one
it was about
we're watching the game
we got the ball back
they had to kick to know whether we were going to win the game or lose a game because they got one point ahead of us
we had to sit there
they cut the show off and started showing us another football game
my gosh
here everybody is sitting on the edge of their chair
then they changed the game
they changed it and gave us another game in the middle of another one that was going on
the station finally
it was funny
everybody was furious
we would be ahead
it'd come right down to the end
either we made it or we didn't
it was something else
the quarterbacks just didn't do anything
that's the guy that counts
maybe we'll get your guy
i don't think jim kelly is about to be swayed away from the bills any time
do you think
i wonder
the assumption is that it is a problem
i've never actually had too many people explain to me why it's a problem though i have the same instinctual feeling that it's a problem
it's not clear to me that it is
it's a problem if those voting don't represent the population demographically or in terms of their opinions
if those who don't vote if you made them vote
it those who don't vote would have voted exactly the same way in other words if forty percent had voted for that person and sixty percent for the other just like everyone who did vote it's not clear to me that it is really a problem
that's interesting
i had thought
i feel that it's a problem also
i see your point on that
i assume that those who don't vote
if you look at the break down of those who don't vote they tend to be
i assume that they would vote differently if they were voting than your average voter
i don't know if that's the case
i guess not
i vote religiously
i guess i'm a fan of democracy
that's right
it's funny because here in california things are getting increasingly democratically oriented in the sense of people being able to vote for things
we have these state initiatives now
the first really wide spread one was proposition thirteen which was a tax revolt
now we're
that was whatever ten years ago
now we're up to proposition a hundred and fifty or something like that
we've just
there were apparently voters who just threw up their hands after the last voters pamphlet because they were being asked to make decisions on topics that would have three different competing proposals
you had to vote for yes or no on each of them
no one could make heads or tails out of some of them
it was incredibly complicated and difficult
a lot of people revolted against that
that's why we hire people to make these decisions for us
i kind of feel the opposite though
they're not speaking for me
i wouldn't mind having more votes than i get to have frankly
maybe not in a deep philosophical sense but in a selfish sense it probably would
it's interesting some countries voting is obligatory
it is in australia for example
i don't
australia considers itself every bit as much a democracy as the united states
it's not for me to say that they're not
they feel
here you have the right to vote
they simply define it as a duty there
just as we have a duty to pay taxes
we don't have the right to pay taxes in this country
in that country it's a duty to pay taxes
it's a duty to vote on how those taxes are spent
it's not clear to me that that's so much less democratic
part of me rebels against that
i'm an american
it's complex question when you start thinking about it isn't it
some people don't vote
there is
i think they're eligible for a fine
i don't know if they actually are fined or what happens
you're eligible for some sort of fine if you don't vote
None
if you vote and your guy looses you least tried
you can say something
if you don't vote part of me feels like if you didn't vote you get what's coming to you
certainly that's true in the overall
no one individual that's true for but for the population as a whole
i sort of feel that way especially when
i say voting for the lesser of two evils is still important
it's funny because technically you do
you have the right to do a write in candidate
of course that's not really a vote
it really doesn't
it's a complicated situation
i would like to see
i'm thinking of actually moving to australia
perhaps i'll call you back and let you know how the australian system works
i'm not thinking of moving there because of the voting
i see
i
are you a t i employee i'm interested
i'm really quite curious how that would work to have both
i believe in a certain
soviet bloc countries you are obliged to vote too
that's what i think of when i think of you're obliged to vote
when you actually really are given as much choice as you are in this country with its two party system
part of me likes the idea of having it be more of a duty
maybe they should
perhaps they would be indoctrinated that this is their duty
that's a thought
certain privileges come from voting which aren't that important but are nice to have
that's an example of a right not a
technically most people
most people think of it as a right
in other words if the government denies you a drivers license people get very upset
actually it's a privilege
fortunately voting isn't that
maybe it should be
except if you're a felon
they will take away your right to vote under certain circumstances
gosh
we don't have a great solution yet do we
i think it was hamilton who wrote number ten or something where he was arguing for a republican not in the sense of the republican party now
versus a democratic government and arguing successfully why the united states should be a republic not a democracy which indeed it really is a republic not a democracy
where he defines democracy as everyone votes for the issues and republic is people who vote for someone who then in turn votes for the issues
the whole idea was presumably those who get voted in would be wiser than the average person and a specialist and able to make more informed decisions and can protect against the tyranny of democracy
just as you can have a tyranny of a single bad ruler or something you can have a tyranny of the majority
he makes a very passionate good argument for why you don't want some things decided by democratic process
anytime you have a majority they can change the law in a fully democratic process
there are cases when you don't want that to be the case
if there's some minority that people don't like because of racial hatred or something like that the majority can just simply vote against them
cases like that he argues need to be constrained
actually i agree except that i don't trust the people who are appointed to vote
i feel that wa-
their job is to be reelected by in large
they work on that job
there's also an antigovernment mood in the country where government is misspending your dollars
they're all fools
throw the bastards out
there's a notion that somehow if someone isn't as much as a government person they're less corrupt and they're more likely to be good which is really strange
if i'm hiring a plumber i want a real plumber
it's scaled back considerably
right now my exercise is pretty much limited to softball league and occasional ride on the bike
i just nine months ago got married and bought a house
my outside activities have been curtailed a lot
that's true
there's always something to do
it keeps me going
you are so far ahead of me
i used to walk two miles a day
i really enjoyed it
the two miles went fairly quickly
that's not stopping and talking to everyone along the way
it's a lot
i could sort all kinds of things out and make plans and everything
i don't know what i did to my knee
i mashed it wrong or i did something
the doctor has had me on medication
she doesn't want me to walk
she said that's while it's healing you're going to mess it up
i can't walk
she said the most conservative approach you do the medicine again and again before you think of surgery
i don't want her to think of surgery on my knee
that's a tough situation
that's that microscopic stuff
i'm being very good
i miss it
it's so aggravating to have an injury like that
my wife likes to run
she's
we moved down to the north end of oak cliff in the castle park area
she started running down there and all the hills
she lasted about two weeks
her ankles couldn't take it anymore
she was used to running flat tracks and whatnot
ever since that it's just been real difficult
her ankles will start hurting again and stuff even if she does get on flat ground
she's kind of in the same mode
she was all ready to get back into it and start running five k's and ten k's and stuff this spring
she just hasn't been able to stick with the training schedule long enough to really get back in shape
when you want to do it it's really really aggravating
it's one thing to get motivated to start doing the exercise
it's another thing to already be past that and then not be able to because of your health
i don't really want to
if i do it okay
i will do it
it's not anything i would want to
i can really tell the difference since i have not been able to walk
you don't spi-
it's harder to get out of bed in the morning and all kinds of stuff
your body just gets used to it
i don't particularly enjoy it
i used to lift weights an awful lot and stuff like that
as far as the working out and lifting and things like that i can't say i really enjoyed it all that much
once i got used to it it was habit forming
my body was tuned into that mode
if i skipped it then it kind of threw the whole system out of whack
hopefully my knee is a hundred percent better
you're living in the castle park area
just close to methodist hospital
in fact i lived there until late nineteen fifties
that area is it changing back again
we're on a little street called bison trail
it's over on the other end
it's over by the far edge of stephen's park golf course
i know exactly where that is
it's
our street is an awful lot of retired people
the other half
three sold the summer before
everybody in their late twenties to mid-thirties are buying and starting to rebuild and fix things up again
everybody is real excited
that's wonderful
it's a lot of fun
we've got four regular parties every year
we do a neighborhood recycling program and all that kind of stuff
it's a lot of fun
it's a really beautiful area
some of the higher dollars lawyers and stuff downtown too are picking up some of those great big houses
they're getting them at a real bargain
they're getting four thousand square feet for a hundred fifty a hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars
they're just going to town with them
people are putting in pools and completely redoing the outside restoring to the original nineteen thirty nineteen forties look
it's really coming around
it's worth the trip
i'm sure it must be
it was a two story
story and a half really because we had a basement
the guy that built it was weird
i just loved the neighborhood
everyone had houses like that
so neat
ours is kind of a little ranch style with a great big i guess it's twenty-eight by fifteen front porch
the guy moved in and completely redid
it's got a rounded front on it
he's landscaped his yard
he's about ready to put in a pool and things like that
why couldn't your wife run around the golf course
she could a little bit
they have a quarter mile track there
she has started doing that rather than take off
for her she can't run in the morning
you don't want to
there's somebody in the building watching her and all that
there's a lot of consideration
i really hear that
i think you're in oak cliff
i'm in plano
we live on one of those blocks that it's a neighborhood watch block
the street doesn't go anywhere
still i want to get up early in the morning and walk
my husband had a lot of heartburn with that
it looked darker to him because he was in the house with the lights on
even he was real concerned about that
it's not just because you are in oak cliff
there's only one crazy out there to make any difference
it goes all over
you got the
i want to talk about our family budget
you can help me out a little
at the my-
i introduced you a little bit to it a few minutes ago when i said that we're on the east coast now
we both decided we wanted to move to north carolina
naturally we put ourselves
what we did was draw up a budget that we thought was realistic
we had to make some adjustments
we really are kind of looking for something that we want to do and he wants to do that's satisfactory
we've been here seven months
he's still hasn't hit up on anything permanently
you see
we actually planned for about one year
that god because
None
what we did was just decide how we had been spending our money before
we put that on the computer
we took about three months and adjusted
we really lessened our living expenses more than what we thought we would
was this just your own design of
just our own design
we've had budgets that didn't work when our
tell me about
do you all have a budget
we've been married for five and a half years
we started out without kids of course and found it much easier to save and used to do a lot
the
when we first got married we were in graduate school
we were just dirt poor
we virtually did that for about two years
and moved to texas bought a house immediately which of course is now devalued with the housing market
i don't know if
at least we've got a place to live
now since we have a three year old and a two year old now
that threw our budget really
an we have been just forced to budget much more because i quit working to be home with the kids
we just really have
we've tried different times
we've done a survey of taking the past three months of where all the money went
we really don't spend on anything much of a luxury or anything at all
it seems like there's times when we just have to get out where we'll go and get a baby-sitter and we'll go and we'll blow fifty sixty dollars in one night going out to eat going to a show or doing something
i think that's important for your budget to be realis-
it's not really that realistic
we do find that we want to go and do something or splurge for birthday for somebody
we even do things real frugally for the kids
we get a lot of toys and clothes and stuff at garage sales or from friends because they don't know the difference at this age whether they're jordache new or whether they're
something
they're both boys
they just one year after the other in each other's clothes
that's the hardest part for us is that it's really budgeting and some extra things that are more nonessential items
i found that in the place that it was harder for me to stick to a budget was not where we were concerned
we tended to want to keep on giving lavish
i really believe that if you're going to cut down on yourself you need to cut down somewhat on your
we have so many unexpected things come up so often it seems with
something will come up and wind up having to spend a thousand dollars on the car in two months or something
a lot of things like that that really are hard to plan for
i really do
that really should be in your bu-
if you don't spend it it should be in your bank account at the end of the month
i forget which way we do it
we get more money back at the end of the year
that's not a good way to
this last year he changed it of course
we didn't get nearly as much back
it was like oh no
i do realize that that is realistic for some people
it was for us many years
if that's the only way that will make you save and have a little nest egg at the end of the year then doggone it that's what you should do
we don't miss it
we're trying to put a little money away for the kids because we can envision the expenses for college already
i was just reading an article in a north carolina paper today where a high school student obtained over two hundred thousand dollars worth of scholarships for herself by sitting up at night and typing at letters of applications to universities
she was third out of a class of two hundred and twenty
it can be done
where there's a will there's a way right
i have enjoyed talking to you
i enjoyed talking to you too
don't spend any money this weekend
i know
i like all kinds of books
mostly something i like true life
documentaries or real stories about real people and that kind of stuff or dramas in real life
i also like romantic novels
i like readers digest believe it or not
that kind of a thing
as far as real novels i haven't gotten into shakespeare or any of that type of thing
i wish i had in some senses
i don't have time really as much as i would like to get into that kind of thing
i like like you said real life
especially athletes
for some reason it seems to interest me people that make a big comeback
orel hershiser things like that
i like to read books on improve like family marriage things that are written by christian authors or doctors about family and how to improve your home and all that kind of thing
i like to re-
they usually have some good articles in it
i don't know
i'm more true
nonfiction
i haven't found a lot of fiction books that i really like
not to say i wouldn't
eventually
i think it was a romantic novel by danielle steel or one of those
i don't do as much reading like i say as i would like to
of course
it's
that type of thing
i set a goal for myself to read a book a month this year which is about eleven more books than i would have read last year
so far i've only read two books
i'm not doing very well
i do crafts too
it's hard
if i have a minute that's what i do
i let newspapers stack up and magazines stack up if i don't really set aside a time to look or read them
that's like myself
i miss it because i really find it a very relaxing hobby too
i don't know
it seems like you can get lost in a book
it's like an escape for me
if i'm really interested in what i'm reading hours can go by
i look up at the clock and say my word
i would too
i think you get out of the habit like you say
you have to kind of set yourself
have you ever read or heard of the book this present darkness
it's really fast paced and intense
it is a fiction book
it was ar-
it was real good
it was one of the few books that
it
just hurry up and go through without putting down
that's the other problem i have
i'll stay up until two or three o'clock in the morning because i'm so engrossed in it
before you know it's time to get up and go to work
i don't know
i'm kind of a nut when it comes to stuff like that
even if i'm doing something like an afghan if i'm close to the end sometimes i'll
i really like books that you can get into
that's that
i have a lot of craft books that i have too and magazines
i like people those things that are about real people
i like to read about people who made a success of their lives
what book have you read that is along those lines
to give you specific titles i can't
how about who
like i say haven't done it in such a long time
i went to seminar on
it was by american business
some of the people
he's one of the
it was more like
how he started out as just a salesman and now he's multimillionaire and that type of thing
how you have to be aggressive and really want something for yourself and that type of stuff
it's up to you in other words whatever happens in your life
i find that fascinating that people can do that kind of thing just make up their minds that that's it have this one direction
do it
i'm off in all directions
i'm not a planner which i wish i was
kind of off the wall
if someone says do you want to do this tonight and i got a mountain of things to do it's okay we do it
that's all right
i wish i was more the other way
you're more fun though
i like it that way though
i don't want to change that part of me
even though i admire someone who isn't
like i am and i wish i could be more that way
about twenty
that's not bad
that's important
most of my family's in indiana
i've only been in texas three years
i loved abilene too
they have storms here
it's so surprising how it just happens
i've been up here about three
we were down there from eighty-five to eighty-six
part of eighty-four to eighty-six i should say
i had thirty-three hundred dollars damage done on my car
he was telling me about it
that's good
with the other part of this thing was how do you feel that this influences family
that books influence
i feel like it's important for young children to read too
when my children were younger of course
i have grandchildren now
they were
i think they've all developed kind of an interest in reading also
they do read where a lot of people don't have any interest in it at all
i think it's important
even today where people are so illiterate and they go off to school and really nothing happens they don't learn anything
that i work with
people
things are misspelled
it's unbelievable
it's pretty sad
a lot of people that work for me that can't even spell or read
i think that that's why reading is so important
i think even mentally when you can do some
guess we got our first credit card back in the early seventies when
was a visa card issued out of a liberty bank in oklahoma city
my sister worked at the some bank americard center there
we were still in college
had she not worked there i'm not sure that i would have qualified
they have become also a real bother sometimes
tell me about it
especially if you catch yourself short on cash or if you're on vacation
i find if you're not careful you wind up a month or so staring those bills in the face
you go i don't remember doing all that stuff
it adds up
sometimes especially traveling with t i
everything goes on american express
it makes it a whole lot easier for bookkeeping
as far as personal life goes i guess i really try to use them as little as possible
i kind of like having them for gasoline purchases
we like to keep one on hand just for emergencies
other than that i guess over the years tried to avoid the national credit card syndrome
then you really get socked to it if you don't watch it
how do you look at counting credit cards
we just quit using them
they got us in trouble
we keep one gas card and visa just in case there's an emergency or
other than that we don't use them anymore
that's kind of the way we were doing
i guess for that very reason that if you're not real conscious of what you're doing
if you got a bunch of cards
for some strange reason those people think they need to get paid
i give them
maybe they're not really concerned about getting paid
some of them add late fees on it
i guess that's one of the motivations behind
the american express card with t i
there's no late fee
there's no interest rate
you either pay the thing off
they come get it
it's turned into personnel
they come get you
they've got quite a bit more motivation i think to get paid then
that's the one that your call center manager sees every month
you're a little bit more careful about what you put on that
you can
i see
you know that somebody every month
who knows how many people
are looking at those bills that come in and those statements
you want to make sure that is that okay
is that okay that those people see what it is that you are buying
most of the time it is
most of the others i've sent back all you get is card offers
from gas companies and visa gold and some
i usually just throw them away because i
i do too
you carry around a wallet full of credit cards
one of these days it's going to all be full
she found an ad for one in a good housekeeping magazine for eleven percent
that's not bad
years ago i had my visa card through this bank in oklahoma city for
probably fifteen years
they started charging annual membership fees
i said adios i'm not paying you
they've been
they get enough on the interest
i guess they figure they've got enough people out there with cards
they're going to get cards at
then a couple years ago i found a bank here in plano that if you kept a minimum balance in any kind of account whether it was a savings account or what it was you can get a visa card through them and no annual membership
i went over and just stuck three hundred dollars in my son's savings account in his name and got my visa card
it would be okay
i can't see paying someone to use their card
i guess that's it
i agree with you a hundred percent there
it's gotten to a point where the schools are expected to take care of everything
if you've some kid who's from a broken family the schools are supposed to fill that void
it's gotten way beyond
teaching classes and maybe providing extracurricular sports activities or something like were kind of traditionally the school's roles
we're just having conversation on this with a couple of people yesterday
i was expressing my frustrations that so many problems are that kids don't have a degree of self-discipline which may be reflected in society at large
you can't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home
it's seen more so because when you call parents up many parents won't even recognize that there is a problem
you wonder don't these parents know that teachers talk
we do check with other teachers
other teachers find the same things in this child
how do you tell the parent hey wake up and smell the coffee
it is a problem
i'm not sure
whether maybe through a commitment of the p t a and the parents being informed better that in fact that the problems that are nationwide are problems of society and that the school can only do so much on it
then again when you have a society where a certain percentage of the parents are doing drugs in the home either unemployed and have their own problems how do you expect the
you can't really expect that parent who's quite frankly a loser in life as it is to care about the situation with their child
these are children that are born with low attention deficit gosh what's going to happen when these kids start coming into the school system
i think there are a couple of areas where the school system can improve
this is something that i see
in fact they're not
they get put in our school system in a class that's limited for skills children that really have to master skills
that's not their problem
at the same time i've seen we have an international population
the school systems can improve both in standing up for splitting classes having slow children in slow classes but not mixing them with behavior problems
the case where they put the behavior problems in the average classes
you throw in kids that are not motivated maybe bright but they're discipline problems
you sometimes
the gifted and talented are fast classes
i've seen more incredibly intelligent underachievers than
i would take a person who's motivated and a little less intelligent than the person who is one of these very intelligent people who just kind of isn't motivated to do anything
not to toot my own horn here or anything but i was graduated from my high school
i know that there were a lot of kids that were an awful lot smarter than me
they proved out late when it came time to take the s a t
they weren't great
when i got into college i struggled just to get my degree in the field that i was in
they got motivated in college
they did a lot better than i did
when it
as a teacher you try to be understanding that there are different ages
is he a problem child
teachers are asked to diagnose so much
we're have to be
we're alerted there's all sorts of systems where suicide predisposition
we're alerted to what the moment we see something
if we see a child that's on drugs such as if he's got a beeper or if they're if they're flashing lots of money around there are certain things to do
the school system's asked to do so much
you can't operate in a vacuum
you actually have students with beepers
we're in a rather wealthy suburb of washington
a student with a beeper immediately gets sent down to the principal
where
how
it's amazing
you get all sorts of things in the schools
as a teacher you're alert for the kid who's very drowsy
you're alert to the kid who suddenly has a behavioral change
you refer them to the nurse
you have to find out whether there's a legitimate reason
None
parents frequently resent when you ask them is there a problem that we should be aware of
i was sitting in the barber shop
i was having my hair cut the barber got a call while i was there from his son's school
his son was failing gym and having trouble
it's like this guy was like why there's no problem with my kid
basically his answer was i gave him permission to miss
so many parents are facilitators
they're manipulated by their children
i have a son who's a sophomore in college up in massachusetts at amherst
my other son is a senior in high school
he's going on to williams
they're really super
we've been very fortunate
they had to be held accountable too
at some point a parent does help their kid in some ways
you have to say at what point isn't the help becoming negative
i think this is where the school system is suffering and not through any fault of the effort of the school system
gee it was good talking with you
there are people throughout the country that feel the same ways that you do and are connected with the schools
i've had interesting conversations on several subjects not just this but the different things
it's amazing how the people you talk to have some interesting conversations
it's too bad that all this stuff is just being thrown into a data base and that none of the ideas or thoughts are being used at all
we are though
what movies do you like
i think the last one we saw was teenage mutant ninja turtles part two
i like the turtles
he loves them
we don't have any kids
we like them anyway
we're late twenties
you just don't have any yet
i've got two
my little boy just turned four
he's a turtle fanatic
i've been wanting to see turtle two
when the topic came up i was asking my husband right quick what's the last movies we saw
he said ghost and turtles
that wasn't too bad on tearjerker
it was good movie
that was just so good
i like demi moore
i've been hearing a lot about it
we don't get to the video store very often
we don't have cable
we don't really want cable
it's just glued to the t v all the time anyway
we get two channels down here
we used to get five channels without cable
forty
i don't think you all have the same channels
here in texas we only get two channels
that's
once in a while when i'm home
we get the channel with young and the restless on it
i think general hospital
that comes on different channel
that's all we get
that's no cartoons for my little boy
we've got a v c r and a lot of tapes
my husband is a movie fanatic
it was really a
what about total recall
i was disappointed in it just because of how violent it was
my little boy he loves robo cop
that movie i'll fast forward it every time they come to the part where there is
that's horrible
the language on that's filthy
everybody knows that the language is there so they could just ignore it and
i think lately pretty woman's been my favorite
my husband bought me
he bought me pretty in pink
you're glad you ain't got a four year old
this is the first time he's interrupted my phone calls
i haven't seen pretty in pink
does that have
it wasn't
i like the sixteen candles or sixteenth birthday or
i think sixteen candles was the name of it
that was so good
i loved it
if you like love stories it's sweet
it's sweet
that's a tearjerker
it makes you feel really sorry for her
it's hilarious too especially with that little guy in it
i don't know he looks like a little boy next door
he's sixteen
it's a cute movie
i don't know
i was just thinking another good one i saw not too long ago was sleeping with the enemy
i can't remember it
that's julia roberts' new movie
this one was a lot more dramatic
sort of
it was a mystery
she disappeared from her husband who was abusing her
that's the one i wanted to see where she was at a carnival on a ferris wheel or something
did that come on t v
did it come out in the
i think around here it's all ready quit playing
i don't know if it's still playing any where else
i think
it was one of those that kept you on the edge of your seat
i seen the previews for it on t v down here
it's just been down here a couple weeks i think
we saw it probably
i know it hasn't been that long since i've seen the previews for it
he was a real psycho in the movie
it was scary
i'd like to see that
what about
i didn't like it
the only reason i know why it ended is on arsenio hall one night christopher reeves told
that
who was it
might have been michael douglas that starred in it
arsenio hall is the one that jumped up and said that i can't believe they killed them
christopher reeve or mike douglas went after his throat you dummy
i know that they die
i haven't told my husband
it was weird
they marked off routes that they could go or something
mi-
one bathroom is at the end of one side
one's in the middle of the other
we could do it
he could climb out the window
our whole house has
we can yeah
i know it's going to be on c b s tuesday night
that's kind of in a way how it kind of bothered you the way it ended and stuff
parts of war of the roses was funny
other times it was like it was just deadly serious
it just left you with this kind of uneasy feeling
i want to see it though
i'd like to see that and the never ending story came out on disney this month i think
i've heard about that
i don't know what it's about
it's good
they're some of the best that are made
it's about this little boy who
he got scared
he starts dreaming
he's saving the land of
all's i can really remember is him flying this great big dog this great big huge sheep dog sort of looking thing
he's trying to save the land from some ooze
it's really good
it sounds ki-
it had fred savage in it
with
he had
it was the princess bride
that was a good one
i like slapstick comedy
a lot of times we'll go to rent a movie or something
you're not sure whether it will be any good or not
i heard
she said that was hilarious
we saw that
they're coming out with a sequel to it
said it was real good
working girl is really good
i seen that
that just reminded me of that
we try
it's a big mortgage in the sky
someday maybe we might even own it
for all practical purposes i guess we hold the mortgage
that implies ownership
we have had this one for five years now
before that we lived in garland probably about four blocks away
it's a
it is a residential homeowners
there's a lot of activities a lot of pluses and common land
we thought we were buying at the bottom of the market
we were wrong
five years ago
it bottom out about a year later
just recently i would say i would give it two years back when it was i think bottomed out
oddly enough two years
i think that
maybe not in your area
it was just different areas
not in this area
this is about the
besides
it's richardson
hold on a second
i hate to say how long that will last too
this area up here is all custom homes
we were not the first owners
they just watched the water pour in on the carpet
the houses here in this class of housing never dropped below two hundred
i think somebody told me it's also on a creek side lot
the guy around the corner is being transferred
he said he did comparables that it's about
i think the high end is definitely somewhere there
try and think if it was a hundred dollars a square foot
this house has around thirty four hundred square feet
it would never sell for three hundred forty thousand dollars
maybe that's pretty close to what it would have sold for brand new
that's pretty much what it was built for
i think it's going to be a long time if ever when nice things and really quality construction and all the other additional amenities
it's seems like people go for square footage only now
i just see him as trying to squish as much house into the space as possible
they are
i was in one today
that's
there's just the two of us
the two cats can yell at each other from one end to the other and be heard
we thought that was important instead of getting
when you have kids you like to be able to
i have been watching these houses go up
i don't
i don't think they exceed more than twelve nails per house
it takes them something like thirty days to complete a house
that's amazing
these guys are phenomenal
they are doing such a terrific job back there
you pay for it too
it's really worth it
it's just they are doing such a fine fine job
the house is built around the trees
with these decking that a corporation and a large area for the trees to come up
it's real real shady
what i was going to tell you these perry homes back there
they are used to the virginia area metropolitan d c
my god they come down here and those houses that look the colonial look what the
the idea of ever owning anything that has four thousand square feet in it for less than two hundred twenty thousand dollars
those things are selling like hot cakes
one of the people that was living back there was telling me that there is his air conditioning bill per month last summer was in excess of five hundred dollars a month
i thought
he was talking about how you keep up with the utilities here
i was thinking i know why your god damn bill is so high
it's because there's no
what a trap
any yet
they show very well unless you have lived in a lot of houses around the area
i think that makes a big difference
i like this area
everything that i have been saying
i do too
still it's worth it for the area and for the school and things like that
you're in the
i think that plano has really done a fantastic job
at least their plans are good
however i was
maybe you saw in the paper this morning that they've had some problems with
i thought it was sad that it
that concerned me that people were using it as a way to get rid of things they just didn't want to set at the curb or take to the dump
None
it's too bad that people have to ruin
i was thinking about many many years ago when we were first married and he was in graduate school in
this was probably
it have been like nineteen sixty-seven or sixty-eight
i went to a meeting
one of the speakers at the meeting was a woman who was recycling
she had this fantastic family effort in recycling
she was dividing her colored glass and her plastics
i thought wow one person is doing that
my thought was it's a shame
it's wonderful that she's doing it
wouldn't it be much nicer if we all did it
her effort would have really really been a good example for all of us
and we were just sort of talking about it at the time
here we are
city wide basis in communities
it's wonderful that we've come that far i think
if she
was she doing it on her own
things herself
it wasn't something that was being picked up
i think she was encouraging other people to do it if they would
i remember her saying yes i have a trash can for this and a trash can for that and a trash can for the other thing
you have to really want to do it though
even what you recycle
we do the plastics and the aluminum
of course then you try to buy right too
a lot of our neighbors say you have to rinse out this and you have to make sure it's that
we had neighbors that complained when we got the new garbage cans
i thought what are you complaining about
None
when you're only going to get picked up once a month
i know what you're saying
it's for everybody's benefit
sure it is
it's not
maybe we don't realize it in our lifetime
you have to think grandchildren
i have a real concern about that
while
gene's family wasn't big
they weren't rich
they had to recycle
the fu-
they didn't
i know
she was always
she is to this day
i mean she'll even
if she
for instance she would take the waxed paper out of a cereal box and use that for when she made cookies
if she needed sandwich paper or something she'd use that
she recycles everything
i have done the same thing
i recycle zip lock bags and
i think they give me a hard time
i think they know that it's the right way
they do
when they actually get out away from the home
they appreciate how much it costs to do that
then they say hey mom used to do this and dad used to do that
pretty soon they're figuring out that's not such a bad way
i don't know
i wonder how you instill in people the necessity for doing just a little bit extra to make this whole thing work the extra like washing out bottles and jars or the extra of actually making sure that you take stuff over to
some people now are complaining because the stuff isn't picked up at the curbside
i think golly moses you just do your part
people are not
you can't be waited on all your life and expect things to always work out
this is what concerns me
you've got to be in a country
even in mexico
what we throw away is a ransom a king's
even to people in our country
i think you have to get into a period of need
this is why i thought jimmy carter was never very pos-
people didn't like him
he tried to say
None
nobody wanted to hear it
i
you have to grow up with it being important in your life
before the message really takes hold sometimes
i don't know
i'd go to the u t d cafeteria for lunch sometimes they use styrofoam plates when they wouldn't
i think to myself that's crazy
i wonder if maybe i need to bring that to someone's attention
i'm seeing more and more of that
i think it's just mcdonald's effort to reduce the number of styrofoam boxes that they use
i think is a good example that even
i think the big question too we're looking at is would you be willing to pay more for a product
i think that's kind of what it's coming to i'm sure
that's right
do we have to wait until all the landfills
i don't
that isn't harmful
that wouldn't surprise me
they will go dump it out in the middle of some ocean
it's sad
hal what's crime like in dallas
it depends where in dallas you are
it's the situation
it is very location dependent there are parts of town here where when they talk about the nightly gunfire
i live on the outskirts of baltimore
we live right outside the city
our neighborhood is pretty much working class people though i'm in graduate school
we have
it's really funny
the only crime we really see is just the kids being malicious
i think most of that is because their parents aren't around
what they call the latchkey children
no one's
fathers are just missing
there's no consistency there in the home or whatever
there's no one to tell them what's right and what's wrong
sort of on my end is more of the upper middle class
i think our
not that we don't have a certain amount of local problems on the other hand we get the affect of the city
the main crimes within the suburb here are the theft crimes
if we have one murder a year that's probably as many
you go into dallas and they are unfortunately having murders at a rate greater than one a day
i think we're about the same in baltimore
though washington i think is close by
they experience a lot more
i think they definitely have more problems in the area
what do you think can prevent crime
the thing is i don't
it's one of those things where if you're a grad student you can appreciate the statistics on unfortunately there are often these correlations that are inverse of what they should be like wherever there are more criminals there are more policemen that's which came first
on the other side of it is
basically the problem is in the society and the society's views
since now i'm in my mid-forties when i was in grad school or when i was an undergraduate growing up in a more rural area i thought crime was reasonably unknown and just the situation that's developed with the drug
aspect of the pushers the dealers and the addicts
i think i agree with you there
it just was not something back in the sixties that i even had to worry about
i think that there is a lot in the society where things have changed
it's effected all of us
i think the drug culture definitely is one of the main problems
our mayor in
he gets on national television and says that
it's
he was a district attorney before and a prosecutor before becoming mayor
that's a really stran-
it's a different viewpoint
in a sense i have real mixed feelings on that it comes a bit from the angle that the
it would certainly be an interesting test the other side of it to me
the other side is that unfortunately some of the down side
i think if i look back fifty or a hundred years i'd say back then there were the opium dens the thing is if somebody ruined their life society didn't try to then save themselves from it
they let this person who had ruined it die or whatever
they probably became weakened physically and other things to the point that their life expectancy was real short
now we tend to believe somewhere in the health care system otherwise
we need to take care of people even if they have physically ruined themselves
yeah to me that's
i would certainly like to see a real test of making drugs real cheap to see if when you make them available people then don't use them
i think they did that in alaska that actually alaska just recently legalized marijuana
i never heard results or anything like that
i never
plus
that was interesting
i don't
crime is one of those things that's
i don't know
the
i see it with the kids in the neighborhood just stealing things not thinking anything wrong with it
some of that
of course i'm a baby of the old school it bothers me from the fifties on
basically we have so much more of the something for nothing mentality
they in the
nowadays there's so much on tv where people seem to have the idea they can get something for nothing
of course i work for lawyers a lot
i see unfortunately we have this whole mentality that somehow there are these pots of money out there that you can sue somebody and there's a million dollars you can have for mental duress or whatever
the other thing that bothers me in the crime is the
drunk driving is a good one
in this country and for example with alcohol or with drugs we don't seem to understand how to handle it as a society to say it is okay under these circumstances but if you step outside these bounds the punishment is extreme
i think that the drunk driving has actually just caught on
i really
my father was hit by a drunk driver when i was in high school that was an awful three years afterwards of recovery and the difficulties and everything we did
the guy went free because this was twelve years ago thirteen years ago
his father was even the police chief of the town
there was no repercussion at all other than insurance
he was uninsured
our insurance paid for everything
it was a very difficult time
later my brother and i were picked up by the police for questioning because this fellow had bought a new car
somebody had taken a baseball bat to it and broke all his windows and his lights and dented it everywhere
they came and questioned us
None
that kind of shows how our attitude toward drinking and driving was misplaced for years it was an acceptable social behavior
those are some important points
those are
what does your city have for gun control if anything
maryland is one of the most
we just voted in strong gun control here in the state of maryland
i think
the weather certainly has been hot
it's been humid
i don't remember a year in a long time that the humidity has stayed up this high this late into
it's not really late into the summer
the humidity has hung around all of june
i've been in texas for fifteen years
i know the summers get hot
it certainly
it seemed like last year was so strange having all those heavy heavy rains in april
this year we really didn't have heavy rains until may
now it's kind of lingering with kind of still a bit of humidity
it just tried to rain
i was coming in from my car just a few minutes ago
it was trying to rain which seems strange to have it raining in july
normally we don't have too much humidity or rainy time when it's past june
that's right
you get those great big cracks in the ground where it's been so dry it just gets so dry
the earth opens up
i can remember the first year i moved here it didn't rain
i moved here in late august
it didn't rain from august until december
it was great after growing up in michigan and every day was cloudy
you sort of forget how much it did rain
coming here and then it didn't rain
i lived in ohio mainly
i lived in pontiac just a little while before i came down here
so many times when you were trying to schedule outdoor activities you just never knew if it was going to be a go or not because of the weather
here it was like pretty much you could schedule some activity outside anytime
you really didn't have too much of a chance of it getting rained out
i grew up in dearborn which is a suburb of detroit
a teaching job
you teach in plano schools
i did for a while
i'm home with two children
new career
anyway
that kind of
i had been down here to visit
i school and said hey let's find a place that has a nice job
that's how it worked out
i think a lot of people were leaving michigan all about the time i came here in the early eighties
it seemed like it was almost a mass exodus
you know the little joke about will the last person leaving michigan just turn out the light
it's a nice place
that's a nice place though
i said i lived in the pontiac
i forget the county
where all the lakes are around there
it was only four miles to work
it was wonderful being on the lake like that
in the summer you feel like you're on a vacation all the time because you're right on a lake
everybody's out enjoying the water and such
in the winter time the lakes froze over
i thought it was just really neat to be out there on all those lakes
maybe a mile two long
that's enough to do some boating it was lots of fun
i think lake whitmore is the only one i have real memories of
i think it's toward ann arbor
it's probably out in that direction
that's the only one i probably could name after all these years
None
it was just lots of little lakes
of course it was a little more expensive to live on the lake
i just thought that was grand
i think a lot of people didn't really know that there were all those lakes out there unless you were from that area and kind of spotted them
there was quite a few lakes all around there
it was almost like you were living on an island
i was way out to the west maybe four or five miles from the city limits
it was really nice out there
we had pine knob to go skiing and stuff
there were things around there
isn't that where they have a summer music festival there too
in the winter time they make snow and have a ski slope
we didn't do a lot of it
we did
those are always fun
alpine was it alpine was another ski slope that we went to
my dad would kind of bank up the snow in the backyard and turn the hose on make a pond in the backyard for us
we probably did some ice skating on it
then it chipped
it would melt or whatever and get pretty uneven
christmas time some of our relatives would come up from alabama
i think most times we would have snow around christmas
the kids when they were young would just go nuts
they were from alabama where it never snowed they just had a grand time watching the snow and getting out there and playing in it eternally
i came down in early eighty-two
there was just a freak snowfall early one morning in december couple days before christmas
by noon it was gone
i remember getting up and somebody telling me hey better wait to go to work because the roads are all snow
i was laughing going yeah right that's a good practical joke
there was but a very short time
the weather got warm so quick it just melted it all away
when we get an ice storm that's not too much fun
i just as soon have all the slushy snow on the streets than have the ice on the streets
we have
we get the sled out
the kids go down the hill on the sleds when it's icy
they just go down the ice
sometimes the ice is pretty bad
if you get on the the grassy kind of part you get a little bit of traction not slip and fall
first
i don't feel very good about it
i think that at some times it can be the right thing to do
as
he was either in a nursing home or a hospital or something else that he would have been spending most of his time in those days
what type of recommendations did you have when you decided where to place him
the
he wanted to get into a mennonite nursing home which is very popular and hard to get into and had a ten year waiting list right
we wound up just choosing another mennonite nursing home that was easier to get into
naturally
it was actually not a particularly great nursing home
the convenience
what do you think
my grandmother lived with us until august
we made the decision to put her in a nursing home
she has leukemia the rest of her family and her regular doctors and everybody she trusted and knew was in dayton and were several thousand miles away i made the decision to put her in a nursing home
my sister being on the other end found one that she could have what was called an independent living facility
she had her own little room and didn't have to share it with anyone and could bring in her own chair and t v set
the other major factor is that she needs blood transfusions every week to ten days and would have to be hospitalized a day or two
in this facility they can do it right there from her own room she didn't have to be transported back and forth
she's been there since august the thirteenth and seems to have adjusted pretty well
when it got to the point i was spending more time at the hospital with her
right that
i've got little children here who needed me here she needed somebody to watch her twenty-four hours a day
that becomes difficult then
all kinds of physical problems
it just became too much for me to handle
he was essentially too proud and too independent so that even though his heart was getting incredibly weak and his knees were going bad he lived in his own house as long as he could he was living alone had an upstairs apartment could barely make it up the steps to the top without a great deal of pain
eventually things just went too far he allowed himself to be put into a nursing home
i think sometimes when people get to be a certain age other people have to kind of help them make decisions
she's accepted it real well now
right that's right that the children have some responsibility too to their parents and such to help decide what's the right thing
we enjoyed having her here
we feel she's much safer where she is now
when she does a nurse is right there to help her i know she's eating the right things
her doctor's right there where he can come in and check on her
it became dangerous for us to keep transporting her back and forth in the car because she was so wobbly and needed a walker or a wheel chair i think she'll adjust
while i was waiting for you to connect i thought of a couple of menus
i decided it had to be in it informal or not
if it's informal i'd probably choose something just like hamburgers or steaks out on the grill
if it was formal i'd probably go with something like a chicken breast or lasagna or something
i'd probably go with lasagna a green salad and garlic bread
what do you use for cookbooks
it's kind of the bible of cooking for me
then i have some from church that are more family recipes that are more useful
budget cookbooks
of course you get a lot from when you're growing up
i cook a lot the same as my mom did
what you serve or what would you
i think we come from different backgrounds
that's good
i
it diff-
i find the joy of cooking to be a remarkably useful book to fall back on
it has almost everything in it
on the other hand it's not very inspiring
i think that's the title by marion burroughs which has recipes which allegedly can all be prepared in thirty minutes the whole meal she's yeah
i find that the cutting up of the food and all that really makes it take a little longer than thirty minutes
they're interesting menus combinations that nobody thought of
the one i had most recently was one that ha-
she describes as jim beard's favorite summer menu or something
it consisted of grilled kielbasa sausage a potato salad with olive oil and some tomatoes that had been chopped up with onions and curry powder and probably some yogurt was in there
that's certain you can do in thirty minutes
there are a whole lot of
i would recommend you look at that book if you're a busy person
i find a lot of the cookbooks i don't know that you buy over the counter ask for really strange ingredients or things i don't keep on hand all the time i have young children
our budget's set at this time
i want to use simple recipes that i have things on hand
that's why sometimes i shy away from more of a traditional cookbook
you had said dinner
we had some friends over as recently as saturday night put here
the inspiration was a combination of julia child for the dessert a chocolate mousse recipe and a sort of cookbook which has a recipe for a thing called chicken marabella which is this wonderful thing you can do
basically you're baking chicken in an open pan having marinated it first
my wife did this part so i don't remember all the details marinated in olive oil and some seasoning and cooked with some olives and some prunes
it bakes up
it's a delicious thing
it's easy comparatively
i'm sorry
maybe a little more leisure time to do it
yes that's true
they won't eat too many different foods right now
there again sometimes it was easy
they'd
nice talking to you cheryl
we have two sons
one's a freshman in college
one's a sophomore in high school
i spend most of my time carpooling
my son plays football
we did spend a lot of time
it really helped when the older one was old enough to get his license and could drive around by himself although that brought in a whole other set of problems
i fo-
we do
our two had totally different interests of
there was not much overlap as such
the older one was not at all into sports for the most part
he participated
band and scouts were his two big things
the younger one is the sports one
whatever season it is he's playing
yeah
we spend a lot of time carpooling and then trying to be up as much as possible with anything that they do
we also didn't spend
just family time
we didn't do it as much or as often as i would have liked to
i would like to do that as a family and some t v watching
i've heard of that
i've never actually played it
it's really fun
one of my neighbors moved here from memphis
a lot of them played it
she started a group going in the neighborhood
my kids wanted to learn how to play it
it's more fun with four people
it's a game that none of their friends know how to play
they both enjoy it
if they want to play they have to play with mom and dad
we play that a lot of them
we like to go miniature golfing and to movies
we go visit both sets of grandparents and take car trips
my husband and son go camping with scouts mostly
my daughter and i hate camping so we go shopping
that just kind of works out real well
i'm a writer by profession
my daughter enjoys writing too
a lot of times she and i will travel to writers conferences together
that's neat
that gives us special time together too
she's on the yearbook staff and things like that
i can help her with that
she gives me ideas for my writing too
good
in terms of any sorts of trends i
obviously things are different for me and my children than when i was growing up
i grew up on a farm in iowa
the whole family was around the whole time
then what my father did was obvious to me
i helped out with it
although i have brought my boys
it's certainly not at all common
they just don't really have that same idea
they
it's a whole different kind of thing there then
we still don't know what he does
that kind of covers it
that makes it hard though in terms of family time with him
i've been lucky in that respect that i don't travel too much
those are the real killers
that's mild compare to the big ones
i just do the carpooling and handle whatever needs to be done
something major
you just have to handle it until he gets home
hopefully he won't have too many surprises when he gets home
let's see
what gets you
the thing i think that annoys me the most is i have young children a baby in the house
inevitably as soon as they're asleep someone calls on the phone trying to sell me something
i think that that is probably the most aggravating
it invades my time
if i want to buy something i'll take the initiative and go find it
that just really does
what do you think
i
just as we're preparing dinner or eating dinner the phone rings
it's one solicitation call after another
None
your time is valuable
it's like you say very annoying
why do we let this happen
that's interesting
the market seems to just be growing too
i guess enough people are not speaking out
would you
if you could legislate something what would you legislate
i'm not into
i do particularly find it annoying
i haven't given that a lot of thought if it should go
it seems to me that we should have the ability to designate with the phone company that we don't want to receive calls like that
that might
the people making these calls would be obliged to compare their lists that they're going to call against this list of people who don't want to be called
that would be an interesting way
that way those who want it can have it
those who don't want it don't have to have it
is that right
that's interesting
they just get everybody
i do wish that it would stop on my end because it seems to happen at the worst possible moments
i guess the next one is door-to-door solicitors
that's just kind
when it's adults selling a variety of things and especially when men arrive at about ten o'clock in the morning it makes you not feel particularly safe it's annoying as well
these people may in fact be just looking to find an unoccupied house to rob
you really don't know
i find myself being a bit abrupt and a little bit ruder
what about these telephone callers sometimes they're door-to-door but usually they're telephone callers who want you to basically help them fill out a questionnaire
i think these people were hired from different sources
with
therefore there's no one answer
yeah
basically it's a market survey they never say who they're really working for or
there have been a couple of times when whatever the subject was i guess caught my interest and i went along with it
there have been several times when i just said i just really don't have the time to deal with it at that moment
i don't get too many of those
generally someone's trying to sell me something
sometimes this is just the lead in to a sales pitch too
a dollar isn't it
it's
i also sort of worry that sometimes people giveaway personal information
i start answering
you go down a path you don't know where it's going to end
in fact you don't even know the totality of what you've revealed
None
this isn't most likely not going to be used against you
it could
that seems to be something that should really be outlawed
asking for information is
i think if nothing else they ought to spend money for a postage stamp
when it arrives at your house i
we live in a brick home in far north dallas
it's four bedrooms and three and a half baths and swimming pool in the back
it sounds like ours are pretty similar
mine's about twenty-seven hundred square foot
the four bedrooms
all the rest of it sounds just
you've been there longer
we built this one about
we subcontracted it out ourselves
we bought the lot and had an architect draw the plans based on our specifications we subbed it out
i bet you
we've been here a little over six years now and have really enjoyed it because we built what we wanted to have to live in
we have a three car garage that he has a big work area in he likes to rebuild cars and redo engines
he has all the work space he needs
that sounds interesting
i bet he's enjoyed having it that way some-
kind of hard to find one prebuilt that kind of fits those specifications
that's why we decided to build
we looked at things that were already built
if the house was large it seemed like the garages were small even if they were three car garages which is what we have
then most of them don't have a three car garage
we put a three car garage in
even if they had three car garages they didn't have a work space
he has a big
we've just got a two car garage
my husband's got a big space in between where the cars are and the house where he has a big work shop workbench and everything
sounds like our husbands have similar interests
mine does not work on cars
i see
he likes to have a spot to keep all of his piddling things
that's nice that it's not in your house
they have a lot of things of their own
i wouldn't mind having
i at one time was going to fix up when one of my daughters left a bedroom to where i had a room to just put all of my craft stuff and sewing machine and all that kind of stuff
someone
i didn't end up with my vacant room like i had thought i would
we still have a son and daughter in college that come home
the other room we use as a guest bedroom because my husband's family
also the kids have friends who come and stay
it seems like it's always used as a bedroom
i still
some of them coming back home and things
i understand
we've got grandchildren now
when they come they have to have a place
you don't want them to not be able to come because there's no room
i haven't reached that point yet
my middle son is engaged
he could afford to get married but is not engaged yet
my daughter's been going with the same boy for a while
she's still in college
we're just as happy for her to finish her education first
i don't blame you for that
i hope so
i have the three girls
we ended up with four grandsons
little boys are around the house a whole lot more than girls
i enjoy them coming but for short doses
they're fun
you're all back to the safety catches and the whole nine yards or either watching them every minute
i just watch them
i never did put things up when my kids were little
i haven't with them
that's the same thing that i did
it's worked pretty well
all in all they mind pretty well
i guess most of the hou-
we have
i guess that's all i have to do right
i pushed in my number
they kept saying you have the invalid code i found out that my new phone wasn't working right
this is the first time i've even done it
this whole thing like for two months or something
i don't know
back to crime
i think at this point i for one am worried about every aspect
especially you since you're in the same metroplex
there's so much going on here
i think the drive by shootings are getting to be so common that's really something you got to protect yourself from
that and in the schools too starting to put metal detectors in
i just heard
we had a vice principal shot at here last year on the school grounds after school
the one boy killed himself a few years ago in a grade school
these kids don't have any trouble getting a hold of guns in any neighborhood doesn't seem like
you wonder if he's going to get shot
we didn't have to
it's getting
it just continues to get worse
we can't really depend on the police to solve all this
how we going to bring that back together
i think that's where it stems from is that and you've got a lot more women that are working nowadays that aren't home with the children that may impact it as well
then there's a drop in the training of morals really
some of these young kids you read about just doesn't bother them to kill someone at all i think years past maybe our criminals had a little more
either that or i don't know if it happened and it wasn't as highly publicized as it is now or what the
my mother she's seventy-four now
when she was a young girl she had a beautiful beautiful cousin that lived in california
she was dating this millionaire's son
he wanted to marry her
she wouldn't marry him
he drove out in the country one day and shot them both
i know
the point of the story is that that was so unbelievable a thing in those days that it was in all the papers all over the country for weeks now you wouldn't probably read about it here in texas it's just another killing
they were
they were talking about mass murderers they brought up what happened in killeen here recently
they were saying that these guys want attention and that when it happens they're glorified because it's on all the newspapers and t v and everything
you get to their life story
they came from a broken family this person had mental problems
i know how we straighten up all these twisted people before they do something terrible
that story i just told you about my mother's beautiful cousin the same thing happened here in arlington when was it i think it was almost a year ago in december to a girl that my daughter had graduated from high school with
she was a real attractive blond girl in her freshman year of college some boy she tried to get rid of he was like in his twenties
i remember seeing that
that's just
he had her in the car in front of a taco or something he just shot them himself and her
yeah
the police are not going to do anything until they've committed some sort of a crime
he was just begging her on the phone
there are times i think gee i should give my kids gu-
i do love to fish
i don't know how much you can learn
i do enjoy doing it
it is fun what little i do
of course i don't
i told my husband last night when i had called and they had told me that this was a topic i said i can tell them how to fish with a minnow or how to fish with a worm
i hope it is
i get seasick
we have a lot of lakes here in this area i do a lot of fishing for bass
we have a couple of lakes in our area that are just filled with good sized bass
when i get tired of them outwitting me i fish for catfish we use worms and shiners which is pretty much like minnows a little bit bigger than minnows
i also use spinner baits and plastic worms
it sounds like you do quite a bit of it
there's a lake maybe two or three miles from here
it's very convenient on afternoons when i want to just get away and sit and think
i have a lot of friends who like to go fishing
i have a friend who has a little inflatable raft
we use that sometimes
i don't
the ones around here are so big that you can fish off the dock unless you have a boat you can't really get into where they call the good fishing holes
my in-laws live on a lake a little bit east of dallas kind of in the piney woods
the lake is beautiful
i like to go out and stand at the end of the dock and fish
actually catching fish to eat per se you don't really do much of that right there
i catch a lot of little old i think they call them perch the turtles try to eat up all my bait
it's so close to the dock that i think all i do is feed them a little bit it's kind of fun
we don't have a big problem with turtles
we do have a awful lot of snakes in our lakes
i would be afraid of that
i can't think of a time that i've been fishing that i haven't run into one or two of them
occasionally i'll catch an eel on a hook but never the snakes
we have a lot of cotton mouth
they are definitely they live in little coves that i like to fish in
i seem them swimming by every once in a while
they're certainly ugly
we saw a large snake right off the dock there at my in-laws' place last year
it was probably four inches in diameter or something like that
of course it scared the women to death
the men come out and said that's only a king snake it won't really hurt you
it looked so bad it was so big that it might not would have hurt us
we sure felt like it was hurting us just being there
they're scary looking
i think that probably around here people fish for bass and crappie and catfish more than anything else
that's pretty much the same way here
they have a lot of bass tournaments
we have those
i don't inevitably if i enter one of those i never catch a thing
that's kind of
i see a lot of people
early in the morning there'll be all the boats going out
they'll say there's a big bass tournament this weekend
all those people are here for the tournament
i think there's a lot of people that have i guess that you'd call it really sport fishing
it's a very relaxing sport to be able to just be out on the water and looking around
what did you have for lunch
None
we went to the officers' club for a little mexican food
that's interesting
our topic is food today
if you're having a dinner party what would you serve
if i was having a dinner party i would probably have some fruit to start with with some apples sliced up and maybe some cheddar cheese and crackers and grapes and probably serve maybe some wine and beer and maybe have some salsa and chips around and peanuts
let's see i usually have a little theme when i have a dinner party
i would have maybe say if it was greek night or something
maybe
and mushrooms and tomatoes and onions
we'd have
let's see what else
maybe some rolls and i guess some some rice or something like that
when is the party here
being the bachelor here that i am i don't think i'd b-
it's not a question of capability here to do something like that
it's just there's no motivation
i want to throw some charcoal on the grill and throw a steak on there and some baked potatoes and stuff like that
that sounds good too
i have three kids when we have friends over i have my oldest kind of baby-sit for the little two younger ones upstairs
usually we just have very plain kind of not very interesting meals
once in a while when we do something like that it's kind of fun
it's not a regular thing
are we supposed to talk for about five minutes
that's what they are shooting for here
let's see now
you would have a barbecue wouldn-
i live on a lake here
it
during the summertime it's real nice to be able to entertain outdoors
that's a little more a casual thing
in the wintertime it's not bad too because then i've got a fireplace and a nice nice house and all that
that sounds wonderful
i just haven't really tried a whole lot
i don't know
one time i did have a dinner party
i served a
and kind of southern food even though i'm up here in new york
you are in new york right now
i'm in texas
i didn't know this was from all over the whole country
i see
i'm originally from long island
no kidding
where are you in new york
is that where you are originally from around there
i was born in buffalo
been all over the place
sometimes when i have a dinner party i'll have everybody bring something
that's real interesting because then you get different kinds of foods and new recipes
sometimes somebody will be bring something that you really like
get the recipe from them or whatever
we are just getting interested in mexican food
here in texas they have lots of
we're just getting into the fajitas and all that stuff that you could
and had the pleasure of their good mexican
i
you boil them maybe like four chicken breasts
you boil them until they are cooked
then you debone them and kind of shred them up into the meat that has gotten cooled
you take little bit maybe two tablespoons of butter in a big frying pan and chop up some onion and put in oregano and salt
i guess i've always kind of liked golf
i worked on a golf course at one time
that's how i picked up golf
i don't know
it's just kind of a challenging game
i got to start all over again
i'm one of those rare left-handed golfers
i do enjoy playing
i was down at about four or five quite awhile ago
it's probably up there to twenty now if i start again
if you play with some consistency though you can get it right back down
i know with our long winters i enjoy watching it
i don't know if it's just because i like the game or i just like to see the warm weather
we can usually play here year around
there is usually two or three days in the week that you can get out there and play
i'm pretty much addicted to golf
i get out there one way or the other
the reason i like it so much is because i'm essentially playing against myself
i play in a lot of groups
they keep score between themselves
i really don't care
i go out
each shot i say this is what i'm going to try to do i see how close i can come to that
inevitably one facet of my game isn't working at one time or another
i'm not hitting long irons very well
i'm not putting well
sometimes it all comes together
when i used to golf out there i'd putt well but i wouldn't chip well
one of the two
something would go wrong
i always managed to get near par anyway
we just had the tour championship here in pine hurst
i went to that
we
we have a lot of
we still have the greensboro open here every year
do you have long waits to get on the course
it's only been that way in the last five years
now you
most of the courses have a two day advance tee time you have to call
i'm going to try and get into one of the golf courses here
was from the
i wish that's all we had
last week we were in the seventies
it's like in the low forties right now
it's supposed to leave early in the week and then be back in the sixties
we don't get any snow anymore
i don't know what changed that pattern
at least that doesn't get in the way of golfing
i have played golf in the snow before
if you got
what do you think is the worst culprit for air pollution
i think it's probably a combination of things
factories that burn coal as an energy source with sulfur and nitrogen contaminants
you get sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides
those are the ones i think primarily contribute to acid rain
i think that's probably hurting us a little bit
it's hurting germany for example too and some other parts of europe where they have high industry
we're not the lone ranger here
i
it's hard to put the finger on what's worse know the acid rain situation or the ozone depletion with your hydrocarbons causing the damage in which
i know we haven't cured it yet by a long shot
i notice on one of these home shopping networks they were selling these halogen fire extinguishers the halogen is an ozone depleter
it got hydrocarbons in there
it's a very clean fire extinguisher
it's really bad on the environment
you know how we are with our love affair with the auto kind of hard to do anything about that i guess
in the twin cities area
they had a new policy where in order to get your your car license renewed you had to meet the pollution standards
it's part of the inspection sticker
the computer reads whatever the ionization is coming out
that's the way they're dealing with it here
as far as where i live i don't have to do that
i have an old car which i doubt would pass the inspection a seventy-six
there's no way i would put in a lot of money to repair it to meet standards
although i do what i can to cut down pollution
i was just reading an article in mother earth news magazine they've got a new
a lot of places are burning wood a lot of people are burning wood
i've got a place in the country they've had catalytic converters on those on
i think they're required in california and oregon and washington
they've had up those for quite a while
somebody's come up with a new one that sort of
it's a catalytic converter
it's a plate that fits into the smoke pipe apparently it sort of feeds itself
the more smoke is produced
it sounds real neat
that sounds like that might help solve that problem even on older stoves that don't have any kind of e p a requirements on them
sometimes we get a kind of a
especially in autumn it seem like we get kind of a brown haze sitting on us
most of the time it's blowing out pretty well
around here we get
it depends
in the winter time it blows it your way
in the summer time
i really think we're doing some important things
i know school kids
this is one of the big things with kids
kids are writing letters to the newspapers telling adults to clean up their act
it's
we're having all kinds of recycling
it that's a big thing too
i kind of look at the way people treat our
i don't get anybody at five thirty don't get anybody at nine at night
i'm at
i just happened to walk back into my office
i go to school
i'm home certain days
i really haven't been making any phone calls have you
i haven't ever made any
have you received many
it's
the first time we were on this it came just about every day
anyway i guess we're supposed to discuss this subject
i never gave it any thought myself
i don't have any objection to people doing that
as a mother of two daughters i might be afraid of where they were sent
i'm just concerned about their safety
if they do good work in america they'll probably be sent to a ghetto
if they were sent to a third world country i couldn't help but wait worried
i think maybe it should stay on a voluntary basis
i think it would be good for everyone to do something like that
i guess i don't feel like it should be something forced upon you
it probably won't
i don't even know how we'd pay for it anyway
we can't seem to pay for all the little things we have going now
i don't know
some kids are so spoiled nowadays
it might be a real eye opener
sometimes my kids are on the other side of town here
they just see some really tiny modest wood frame homes
they think
they're just kind of shocked at that side of town
that would be an eye opener wouldn't it
right next to us is such a pitiful country
what do i know right
i'm just sitting at home and doing laundry today and certainly not up
anyway how did you get on this program
you do work at t i
you're in lewisville
it looked like a sight
how did you get on it
my husband works at t i over on central
why we're living in arlington i'm not so sure
just my daughter and i are registered this time
like i said i hardly ever get any calls this time
i can never find anybody
now it just seems like it's in the dallas fort worth area that i get calls from
i don't know
there's so many with this one town
even in some families some people talk a little bit different
one of his sisters does things that really sound funny to me
he doesn't pronounce them at all that way
that's one family right
how that goes
i'm surprised she hasn't told us to cut it off yet
or overloads
please end your conversation
do you have any more words of wisdom about the subject
i don't know if mine would want to go live in the ghetto
one of them is real idealistic
i guess we have to talk about magazines
what
what kind do you subscribe to or do you
i did subscribe to people for a long time
i do
now
i take a computer magazine
and also better homes and gardens
are you interested in computers
my pet peeve with magazines is all the little cards inside
that would be one of my peeves
it's really geared to
i just don't
too many recipes too many can this marriage with saved nonsense
i like to read articles about things that matter
of course people magazine is not one of
it's nice light reading
if i want something intellectual i usually read a book
that's true
i like it
redbook used to always have a good short story in it
that's true
i haven't bought a redbook in a while
i guess
i really very rarely ever pick up a magazine anymore
is redbook still in existence
i'll tell you the only reason i subscribe to the journal is because of
they told me if i didn't subscribe they were going to take me off their list
my last chance to win ten million dollars
i figured hey look
for twelve dollars
i went ahead and sent in my subscription because of that to entertainment
i was real disappointed with it
i don't know
that's one thing i don't like about people
it doesn't seem to have enough story to it
i don't know
i just think it's light reading
you don't have to concentrate
it's entertaining
that's
i enjoy it
i
that entertainment is very
isn't it similar to the tv guide
not the one i take now
it's a magazine
it goes into all the movies previewing the movies that are going to be released or behind the scenes
i see
i'm a real movie buff
that's why i thought i might be interested in it
it just hasn't been what i thought it would be
my mother is the reason i get the
otherwise if i really want to take the time to read a magazine and i see one on the grocery shelf i'll pick it up then
rather than having them delivered and think i really need to read this
i'll tell you since i've been getting the journal maybe i'll read two maybe three
if i read three articles in one of the journals i figure i did really well
there's just nothing in there that interests me
i'm not into recipes
i do like recipes and crafts
i'm not into crafts
that eliminates three quarters of the magazine
i just got the new issue
that should be one article that i'll read anyway
do you
how is the weather out there
it's really cold
supposedly for this time of the year it's unseasonably cold
they've gotten more snow than they've ever had
it's about same
nice for skiing and all that kind of stuff
let's see the snow here is different from utah's
i have lived in utah for ten years
the snow is really cold
it's really humid
it seems wetter or something like that
it seems like when the winds blow it goes right through you
i think iowa is a lot colder
that's how it is in texas too
when it's cold it's really cold
the humidity is i think what does it
i noticed when i got here too
i'd
when it would snow in texas we'd be really cold
we'd have to get really warm
here you can almost not even wear a coat outside when it's snowing
you don't feel super cold
how long ago
did you
i graduated in nineteen eighty-seven
he just graduated this past year
you just barely moved away
None
we really miss utah
it's really flat here
not flat but hilly
you just moved away a year ago
in august
what else can i say about the weather
it was forty-five
what's the temperature up today over there
it's probably fifty fifty-five maybe
probably about
it's not that cold really
whenever i remembered the weather reports in utah i never really remember them talking too much about wind chill
they talk about wind chill here all the time
they said it could be six degrees out and negative forty-one wind chill
that's what we're not used to
that makes a big difference
i
did you used to ski when you were out here
i've only skied in utah once
do you do a lot of skiing there
not tons
i like to when i get a chance
is this your first year in utah
you're going to school there
i'll be here a long time
it was nursing
i'm in the process of changing it right now
it's really really competitive at b y u
you have to have a
i think i better get into something that i can enjoy the process of going to school
that's a good idea
elementary and special ed
she got her doc-
i can't
have they
they since stopped that program where you can get it double pretty easily
it's really
i guess the first thing has been for the right for women to vote
i think that has been a major change and also the fact that there are so many more women in the work force nowadays than there were
that's probably going to increase
i think women have kind of had in the past the real subservient role
we do to some degree i think it's not as much as it was
i agree
especially i think with women increasingly working they're going to have to demand more
there is just impossible to keep up on everything else
they've been talking about
i don't know what the status is on it
women get maternity leave and stuff like that
i know that there has been discussion about men also getting maternity leave to help out
i haven't really heard much about that recently
there is a lot of companies that won't give women maternity leave for that very reason
in fact i know the school districts down here they don't have maternity leave
is that right
you simply have to accumulate your sick leave
i don't know if bigger company companies do
when i was employed with the school district i didn't have maternity leave either
that was the reason
they thought was showing prejisim to women and not to men
that's interesting
None
you have to save all of your vacation time
that's usually how it's happened
what do you see changing in the future
we'll prob-
top level
probably we'll see more females in political roles
more governors and i think roles like that
in texas we have a female governor
we had a female mayor here in dallas
her term just ended
i think we're probably going to see more of that in the future
maybe not so much that we sit on the back burners
right
that's fine with me sometimes
i'm not a women's libber by any means
i do
there are issues that as far as equal pay for men and women and that kind of stuff i totally am for
i don't get into the real
i'm not capable of lifting what a man can lift and that type of thing
one of the big changes they're doing in salt lake is
they're probably
i'm sure in dallas since you're big places a lot more women are working right out of their home with their p c's or with their lap computers or whatever
i've heard of that
i haven't really talked to anybody that's too involved with that
i think that is a
is that what you're talking about women working out of their homes
i think it's wonderful
i kn-
course they're talking about that we're going to be able to do our grocery shopping and
it would be kind of exciting in some ways to see a little bit more of that
some ways it might be kind of
there is the process of selection
when you shop you usually compare the prices
would be nice though
that a little town or a bigger city
it's not one of the bigger ones it's probably i compare it to the size of plano maybe a little smaller
anyway we're supposed to talk about education
they really teach you about forty percent less than they used to
it shows up
i don't know
i think i'm pretty satisfied with
i grew up in plano my dad is actually on the school board there
i kind of kept up with a lot of things that went on
plano improved greatly in the last twenty twenty-five years that's for sure
arlington is excellent now
i'm just speaking overall across the country
one thing they don't spend as much time just teaching reading and writing
a lot of kids are just being promoted from year to year
they truly can't read i don't know how they expect them to pass history when they can't read anything even read a word problem in math
that's definitely a problem
what do you think is good about the schools
it depends on where you are
there's no national curriculum
what they'd be teaching in an arlington school they may not be teaching in a plano school in the same school district even in an arlington seventh grade for instance you may have an english class
that's kind of odd to me
it depends on what school you're in and who your teacher is actually is how you end up
i guess we lucked out when we moved here
of course we have a slight problem in that the number of the illiterate in america is mushrooming at this point
where our kids might be in a great school we're still paying an awful lot of taxes for people who are on welfare and unemployment because they can't read
do you think that there should be nationwide curriculum
i had never even thought of it
sometimes a third grade teacher will get kids from second grade that didn't even learn what
they should to do the work that she is supposed to teach
i guess if there was a national curriculum we'd at least have a certain amount that all kids would learn
we actually rank forty-ninth in the world as far as just plain literacy goes
that's pretty low that there's forty-eight countries ahead of us that have more citizens percentage wise that can read and write
unless we want to keep paying for these people that can't make it in society we're going to have to do something
i probably can't
i do think that we have to cut out some of this folderol stuff and go back in the first five six grades and just keep going over and over and over until most of those that are capable can at least learn to read and write they can't even get the menial job without being able to read something nowadays
you can't even work an answering machine if you're at work and had to get a message or something
i think that's a start at least going back to the basics in the early grades they say that the average english student nowadays does at least fifty percent less reading and writing than they did twenty years ago
that's a big jump
up there maybe you guys don't have as big a problem with air pollution as many do you
we have a terrible air pollution problem
our summers are extremely hazardous during certain wind directions because we get the gary indiana chicago pollution we can look out on the lake and just see the brown haze coming up along the lake
they do post warnings for people who have heart diseases or respiratory problems during that summer season
if the wind comes basically from the south it can be really bad
the state of wisconsin as a matter of fact started some litigation against illinois because of the air pollution we were getting
i don't think it's going to go very far
it was a way of triggering awareness
what's the conditions like in dallas
in dallas i haven't seen air pollution quite on a level that we had in denver
i've lived there most of my life
we used to have the posted warning days
however in colorado now they have the emissions control law which has really cut down
probably only once every couple of years do we ever have pollution so bad that they have to post warnings now as far as health concerns
due to the emissions
wisconsin has a law in which we need to take our cars in every year when we apply for a new license tag and they are tested for their pollution control equipment
if they don't qualify then they have to take it to a mechanic and have it gone over and then verify that it is drivable
they've tried to do a lot of that i thi-
there seem to be at least in certain little pockets
we were talking earlier about madison madison has one of the nicest bike road sharing programs of any city in wisconsin all wisconsin has probably the most extensive number of bike trails for recreational use of any of the states
there is a real promotion of biking there are still a lot of people who insist on driving their own automobiles to go everywhere
it becomes
maybe to you and i who have grown up in some more beautiful parts of the country i think that we become a little more aware rather quickly of what's happening with air pollution and how horrible it really is
i notice people in dallas seem to say sure there's air pollution but really how bad could this problem really be
send them to wisconsin
we'll let them try to drink out of some of the lakes and try to fish in some of the lakes that have been suffering from the acid rain they may wake up
it's really a serious issue for those of us up in this sector up here
do you hypothesize that most of the smog or air pollution comes from vehicles
does it come mostly from industry up there
i do know that it is a problem
i was born in muncie indiana and grew up a little bit in terre haute
i had asked them before
i asked them
i'm sorry hobbies
takes a lot of time
i like most sports
little bit of embroidery work once in a while
i try to do some painting although i'm not very good at it
i'm sure you probably are
i inherited the genes that make me think i'm creative
i always try
i do some sewing mostly out of necessity
i'm making drapes for my house just because i'm
boy that's hard sewing
it isn't and it is
it is
it depends on how elaborate you get it
usually have to do the pleats by hand
that at least i can do watching t v or whatever
i've gone and put the needle through my thumb a few times
that's not really my favorite thing to do or anything but i need to do it
let's see i have a dog and a lot of fish
they're probably easier than keeping dogs though aren't they
yes and no
you probably have to clean out the tank too
you don't have to do as much as i thought
they always died immediately
what i think now is the reason is i kept the tank too clean you have
you're kidding they need to have a little bit of the
it keeps all the chemicals in balance
i would just take everything out and just wash it with scalding hot water it would kill all the bacteria
that would screw up all the chemical cycles again
you'd have to start all over to build that up probably
now i only clean things to make things look more aesthetically pleasing i don't try and sterilize things
they kind of need a little bit of that
you've had fish for a long time
i've had them
i guess it's been two years now i've had a tank here
back at home i used to have a small five gallon tank
that never worked well
that's a good size
have you ever had it crack or break or leak
None
i just have what they call community fish guppies and platies and basic things
they're probably harder to take care of
when they die it's more like an investment
do you have problems with the fish eating each other
you get a no
it's a little plastic things that sort of floats you put the mother fish in there
it's got a trough underneath her as the babies come out they fall down in the trough
there's a hole in the middle so they fall into the bottom part of the chamber so the mother can't get to them either
that's
it's also got slots in it so the water can circulate on occasion if you get a real small one
it works i guess
they don't want the mothers to be with the little fish either
they'll eat them
it's funny because the one i have every single month without fail she has babies
i
she's supposed to
i've seen her do it
that just makes you sick almost doesn't it
it's ter-
it makes you understand that things are different
things are different in the animal kingdom
we might decide what's proper and what isn't
that's the way it is for them
if the baby is strong enough it can swim away fast enough and go hide
you think how did they do it out in the real world anyway when these fish are in the tropicals or wherever they are kind of trying to keep up with that
if you're like me you never have enough time for the hobbies
i try
i play a couple of instruments
the cowboys are my favorite team
they had a big win today
did you get to watch it
i have been at my computer all day
i used to be a real big cowboy fan
i'm not a jimmy johnson fan
it's kind of hard not to be a cowboy fan though
they've always been my favorite
i guess i still have a soft spot
now have they
just two years ago they were one and fifteen
they won just one game
pretty fast turnaround
this year they made it to playoffs
today was the first game
they beat the chicago bears
everybody's really going crazy down here
they turned it around
they have a lot of young exciting players now
everybody was real upset when they fired tom landry
now it's like they're doing good so everybody's forgotten
football fans are probably the most fickle people in the world
it's the coach's fault
let's dump him
dallas has always been good ahead heading good players and both running backs and defense
they have a young team
it's a lot different than the teams they used to have where it's the same old players every year and same coach same everything
now it's like a taste of something different
they're all not mister nice guys like they used to be
now it's tough and dirty team
everybody is really excited
it's supposed to be the redskins but we beat them already
we beat them this year in washington
everybody has the feeling like we can go all the way to the super bowl
it's just that we have to play every game away
every-
the competition are teams that they've already beat this year
atlanta they're in it too
we beat them
detroit we play them next week
we should beat them
everything's looking real good
course i think you can't really go by what happened earlier in the season because teams jell together or they've had injuries that heal
it could be almost a totally new team out there than the one we played
the cowboys are on a roll
they've won i think six or seven in a row now
they're supposed to be the hottest team in the league going into the playoffs
since you have an o u drop out
he transferred to u c l a
he really didn't feel like he'd be able to do a lot of passing at o u
they're doing some stomping on
i tell you
they've not had much of a team this year bless their little hearts
they're doing good tonight
yeah they're winning forty-one to seven
good for us
that's right
then he went out to southern cal
u c l a
the cowboys did good today
i was proud
i thought they would get beat today because they're so young
my wife and i have a dog that soon be eight years old
we have a cat which is i guess about five years old
my goodness
two bi-
enjoy them
have a ball with them
in order to have the birds not stuffed i have to keep them in their cages
this is like a cruelty joke
i apologize if you're a bird lover
we had a parakeet
we had that happen once
the first one that we had was his bird
i had a ceiling fan put up
the bird got away from him one afternoon
that sucker hit that fan and went flying up against the wall
i thought so much for the bird
it killed ours
it threw him up against the wall
he slid
speaking of pets i'll tell you my kids are older now
both of them are either in or out of college
my son had a burmese boa constrictor
that thing grew to be seven and a half feet in length
finally my wife bless her heart got rid of it because i didn't really like it
i hate them
one year down in florida on a vacation for father's day my kids years ago maybe ten years ago bought me a skunk from a exotic pet shop
my goodness
it'd been deactivated as far as smell and everything
we had that darn pet skunk for about five years
my son left went to school
my son needed some money
we sold it for about two hundred and fifty dollars
when the guy came over he was infatuated by that skunk
i made him a deal
he said i'll sell that snake to you for two fifty
he took the skunk too
the skunk was a decent pet
does his little jobbies in the litter box
is
that's pretty good
it was sort of a neat
they just stink too much
that was sort of fun
you're kidding
this snake honestly would be stretched across the top of her body with his head right on her neck the skunk would be sitting at her feet
the cat would be on the back of the sofa
a dog would be running around crazy
my gosh
i don't
in fact my brother has a exotic pet shop out in california
he keeps threatening to send a snake through the mail
my son bought this snake
it was just a small thing then
it got to be pretty big
you feed him small mice to big rats and things like that it's just too much
my gosh
i says your friend's going to get our cat one of these days
me neither
i just can't do those and the lizards and all those things
that's the way it should be
customer of mine has a parrot
gosh sticks in my mind he paid eighteen hundred dollars for a parrot
that was just mind boggling
my son was just dying for a bird
i'm really allergic to them
i try to stay away from them except i've gotten real attached to this one
we went down to canton one time gosh two or three years ago now
he'd saved up his allowance and picked him out a bird in a bird cage
that stinking bird when i brought it home tried to take it out of the little box that they give you clamped onto my finger and would not
i had to literally shake him off to get him in the cage
he has tried to bite me for two years
all of a sudden this bird and i have become wonderful friends
he talks now it's just hysterical
i'm a substitute teacher
one of my fifth graders last year came up to me and said my mom's making me get rid of the bird
now we have two parakeets
you enjoy camping
like you i haven't done any in quite some time except for what i call living now
i camped in the boy scouts
my dad and i went out sometimes
even my first eight or nine years of working i camped almost all of the time because i was in construction
it is cheaper to pitch a tent and cook your meals out by the fire than it is to rent an apartment add to stress
when you have to have it you have got to have it
in those those kinds of situations room rent which is outrageous
my buddy and i we just camped
we figured what the hell
we loved it
when i was in high school
he graduated and went off to college
during the summer we would camp out at the lake
it wasn't very much like camping because we had a refrigerator and a stove
i had a little boat house and floated it out on lake grapevine
it was fantastic
we would get up in the morning go skiing
in the afternoon it is still four o'clock
it was great
now all my life is more like camping than not camping really
actually as a matter of fact they just ran the phone three years ago
we are third from the end on the electric string
we are at the end of the mail route
i guess so
right now what we did my wife and i is we got a mobile home
and swapped them a cadillac for it and put it out here on the land figuring i would build a house some day
i just had this place to shower up while i was you know out here putting up fence and building a driveway and drilling a well and all that stuff you have to do before you can even put a house in
i came home from work one friday afternoon
our truck was back
my wife said we're moving
i said where
she said out to the trailer
i said oh
i said okay
we have been roughing it out here for about three years
it is not bad
we have color t v microwave it is not horrible
it's a lot like camping
i grew up in california in central california right in the valley
it is a forty-five minute drive to the mountains
my dad loved fishing and camping
we would go up
first we went up with a toyota pick up truck and laid out our sleeping bags under the stars and cooked our hot dogs by the fire or whatever
then later my mom and dad got a camper
we have kind of moved up
my mom goes camping
she takes her motor home
she's got one of these huge winnebago's with a refrigerator and air-conditioning color t v microwave oven
she has a lot of fun
mostly it is just a way to
she goes to dog shows
she shows dogs
you can sneak a dog into a motel you can't sneak ten dogs into a motel
she takes the motor home
she made a deal with my dad that she would take all the dogs with her when she went dog showing
he did
as far as camping my wife and i have plans to not really camp per se but to drive up the highway one there in california as soon as we get this house finished
None
what kind of vacations do you like to take
we've been fortunate enough to take a couple of trips over to europe
i guess those are the types i like
we've gone to germany switzerland austria ireland and england
i guess my favorite is probably switzerland and ireland
i've been over there too
let's see
how neat
i was able
once when i had a chance in france to go on vacation instead of travelling around france i went to germany i've got relatives there
that's neat
i just like it there
austria i found really pretty and switzerland
i lived in the alps in france
how neat
anything in the mountains over there i just love
then i finally made it to england too on my way home
on my way home from there
my goodness
unless you fly from nairobi you have to fly through europe on your way home
i went to england
i really liked it there too
it's
it's so darn expensive to go over
now you can get some really good deals flying over
it's once you're there you still have to spend money
i know
unless you know people
there's a lot of places in the states that we haven't even gone
i'd like to go to hawaii some time
we made it
we've at least gone to the grand canyon and niagara falls
i've
most of my vacationing in the u s has been on the west coast this summer i went to colorado i'd love to go to the east coast during the fall
the
it looks gorgeous
we made a trip up the east coast
it was in the summer it really is pretty
both coasts are really pretty i love the carolinas
i haven't been anywhere on the east coast
you'll just have to plan a vacation some time and go over there
there's a lot to see here i just love going over to europe because their way of life is just so different than ours
we're so fast paced here
over there every time we'd go and eat dinner or lunch or whatever we'd always have to ask for the check
the type of vacation you'd like
would you go over and spend a lot of time in one place or travel to whole bunch of different places in one week
usually a bunch of different places
probably because you want to see everything
i liked it
i was working in cameroon africa
they're not used to having tourists there
i liked it
the people there are just very friendly
i was working with an organization that does bible translation
i was doing linguistic work actually travelling around finding out about languages and what they call survey work
i travelled a lot around the country and met a lot of people
i've talked to people who have been to africa
of course when that movie out of africa came out
i've always thought it would be neat to go on a safari over there
she came to cameroon
she went over to nairobi and took a safari around close to nairobi in kenya
how neat
she'd always dreamed of doing that too
is there any place you would try to talk me into going to
i don't know
especially in this election year i think that there ought to be at least some conversation about what we are supposed to do about this
it kind of seems to me that everyone's offering their token little tax cut program when it's just such a bad time for it
as you said mostly they are token cuts
especially what for instance george bush is offering
that's really not going to do a lot of good it doesn't seem to me to your average middle income person
mostly it's not actually a cut
it's just a cut in the amount withheld
i haven't really heard much of what the other candidates have said that have made a lot of sense to me either
especially the democratic candidates don't seem to be coming up with much that really sparks my interest as far as maybe that could do something to affect our budget at this point
in retrospect was it mondale or dukakis that said i'll tell you right now i'm going to raise taxes
i believe it was dukakis i can't
that's better than george bush who came out and said no
ten months later he said sorry i i can't follow through on this
it seems to me that the budget is so out of hand
especially now that they say okay the cold war is over
we're supposed to be getting a peace dividend of x number of billion trillion dollars a year
i'd really like to know where that money is actually going to go
in my opinion i don't think i'm ever going to see any of this so-called peace dividend
if they could actually put something together and make
with this peace dividend it seems like you could set up some kind of public works projects like they had in the thirties or whatever
i think that would be a great idea like the conservation corps where
it would help unemployment greatly
exactly in that way we could really focus on building the infra structure of the country
infra structure is in
we have hurt ourselves incredibly last fifty years in the cold war
there's no way that we can ever really recover from the state that we're in right now at least i feel unless we focus on the infra structure
i surely don't hear anybody saying that right now
i agree totally
it just seems so ridiculous that it was allowed to happen
i'm in college right now
i u
i go to georgia tech
i had the required political science class a couple of years ago
one of the things we discussed was how the budget situation just got so out of hand
essentially what happened was
i think it was like in the tax year of eighty-one
ronald reagan basically said i'm going to give this much of a tax cut to the tax payers and created this ludicrous budget that he knew that the congress would not in their right mind pass the democratic congress realized that they were going to lose a propaganda war further cut the taxes and created the huge deficit that year which moved us into the trillion dollar deficit
you just
you just have to wonder what they're thinking in washington
it's just like they're playing chicken with a loaded gun
it's more than a loaded
they've got trillions of dollars to spend every year
they in my opinion don't do a very responsible job of spending that money
what really bothers me is it just seems like if anyone were to say i'm going to raise taxes and cut the budget and we're going to have to do some unpopular things he wouldn't have a chance of getting elected
it's kind of like rome and the bread and circuses thing where people just want to have whatever will make them feel good right now
for the moment
that's what really is getting me about what george bush's stand on the budget is right now is that he is saying i am going to give you this ludicrous little tax cut so that you'll be happy come november and you'll elect me again i'm going to go on and just forget everything that i said it doesn't seem that it's going to make much of a difference
i don't know
actually i live in the city i guess it is a concern of mine for my own safety
do you find crime in atlanta really
that's right
i think it is bad in certain areas
however i think the area that i live in the crime level is not as high as it is in other areas of the city
i think it seems that there's certain areas where the crime is focused
what do you think can be done about the crime in the city
i think what's been happening over the last several years it seems they've been beefing up the police patrols trying to put more guys more cops higher visibility
they've had some impact but not a tremendous amount
probably they need to try to increase community involvement that sort of thing i think
particularly in some of the housing projects that tends to be where a lot of that crime is focused they've got to do more than just having cops there
do you think atlanta's as bad as most other cities
i've been to
i'd say it's probably in the top ten in terms of crime
it's nowhere near as bad as new york city for example
probably not as bad as detroit
i don't think we have as much of the gang problem as a lot of the other cities have
if you've ever been to new york city
as you walk through the street on a given evening you can see crimes being committed
i came to the conclusion also that if you are walking in a downtown area where there's a lot of crime a lot of that's going to just keeping your senses about you and trying not to look like a victim
None
don't be looking around like you've never been there before and you have no idea where you are
don't walk down an alley
don't get just try to keep yourself out of a bad situation yeah
there are times when you can't avoid all that you're kind of on your own
have you ever been mugged in atlanta
the only thing i've ever had was i've had my wallet lifted that was in a more of a setting where there was a number of people around
i kind of got
i was much younger at the time kind of a couple of people they just took it from me without me knowing really and kind of passed it off so i didn't know who had it
that's about it
i think i've only actually seen one actual robbery with a gun that's been about the only potentially violent crime that i've seen in atlanta
i've had my
that was just a guy running out of a store that he just robbed
maybe that counts
where was that
that was up near cumberland mall area
it is atlanta there's a lot of car thefts in that area
i've known some people that have had their cars stolen
about half the time the a p d seems to recover them in various states of disrepair
when he got it back his dashboard was sitting in the front seat
it had been wrecked and some superficial type damage
they didn't strip it i got it back
you're probably luckier than
does insurance pay for the body damage
was that all there was body
you crack the steering column
you pull the
there's a pin in there that you can pull on these g m cars you can start it up basically pretty easily
how do you know this much about stealing cars
how you like new jersey
it's pretty good
you get closer to the coast here
you do get a good bit of smog and stuff especially from all the fuel cracking towers and chemical plants
i guess it's fairly industrial
when you get further east towards new york city it gets very industrial i'm about thirty miles west of there
you have actually green trees and such that you don't notice that other part of new jersey exists
you go even a few miles out and you got farms and everything
i don't know about you
i've always considered automobiles to be probably the prime contributor
there's a lot of contributors
it seems that automobiles would probably do more than their fair share of that
definitely
it's there are a large number of them on the road
they're all going
a lot of them are in relatively poor repair
that's a big issue is
a lot of states don't have a inspection law
you get a lot of people out there without e t r emission control systems on their cars and things like that
even where you do have the inspections the inspection is once a year
it's like
muffler falls off or something guy keeps driving along for long period of time after that
i guess from what i hear though next year ford is coming out with their electric cars
i think also some of the car companies are coming out with gas powered fleets so you
natural gas powered rather than gasoline
i'm hoping that comes along quick
i was reading an article in time the other day about the ozone layer and how fast that's going
i guess it's really disappearing a lot quicker than people realize
i know it's not due to gasoline or to carbon monoxide so much as the c f c
it is coming from cars though
i think that's a contributor definitely
the car air conditioners is one of the major leaking sources of the freon
which is one of the major fluorocarbons
i guess right now what they're primarily worried about is third world countries because i guess united states and russia have kind of taken the lead in terms of eliminating c f c production
it
it's the type of thing there that
they want to become industrial they're on the different part of the cycle of the u s
the u s used all the air pollution stuff and air polluting technologies to get where it is today
that's one of the arguments that the third world countries have been using is that basically they don't want to have to pay for our mistakes
in terms of
they want the right to make the same mistakes themselves to bootstrap them up to where we got to
those are joining arguments
i don't know
that's kind of an interesting situation there
those third world countries what they don't realize is how quickly the ozone is depleting
it's increasing even as near the equator as florida and cuba and those places
it's kind of an interesting situation
you also have the very close related thing of the rain forest destruction which is the main source of what's clearing out the atmosphere and replacing some of the pollutants
you don't get that source of cleansing anymore
have you been in big cities a long time
i've mostly been in the east coast
that's going between atlanta d c area
you've got
not as hard as some places out west because you don't get the major pollution sources as you do out in denver with the inversion and los angeles and rest of california which is just terrible it sounds
denver's that real good example of sitting in a valley kind of like mexico city does i guess
mexico city is historically been one of the worst in the world for that
i've been pretty lucky
i've lived in cities that really haven't had that much of a problem although i'm really kind of based in orlando florida
there you can tell that it's getting worse
definitely it's not at a level comparable to los angeles or denver
you can
there it's almost all automobiles because there's not that much in the way of heavy industry that would be causing it
there's not that much in terms of public transportation down there
it's
what's your
god no
that's all right
now that randall's coming back next season i hope they'll do a little bit better
i hope they can do better
i don't know
i kind of go back and forth depending on whose really hot and whose not
i guess if i have my druthers
they're not my favorite totally
i do like them
he
to be honest with you i probably watch college a little bit more than i do pro
that's kind of strange
it's too much running for me in college football
i like the pros
they do
more players are apt to act a little bit different when it's a job and not just when you're getting paid millions to do it i think they take it to another level
i can see it's more grunted out run the ball type
whose that
that's boring for me
i'll take the passing teams any day
i can see definitely how you get into that
to be honest with you i find that too much running gets pretty boring as well
it's four yards three yards eight yards tackle
it gets kind of monotonous
after awhile i prefer a nice forty yard flea flicker every now and then just to juice it up a little bit
i think they're starting to realize that
a lot of the big eight teams that used to run so much i think they're starting to realize that they just can't compete anymore
it's all money now
what's d-
that's getting ready to start up right
not really
i don't think anything will ever take over the n f l
i think it's an institution
i just
it can take over part of it
it's never going to be the next
nothing really
it's not going to be wide spread super bowl and every sunday afternoon or anything
it's never going to reach that standard
it's kind of interesting to see their claim of world football
when in reality it's really americans playing somewhere else
it's kind of strange
i guess we're the only ones
actually i kind of like soccer
i like the idea
it's an interesting game to watch
that's worse than football as far as violence i think
there's definitely an element of stupidity in there somewhere
that's why it's a big college thing
it's something a bunch of fraternity guys can get together and get a good beer buzz going and do
it's fun to play
i don't think rugby will ever be professional
no i doubt it
it's
at least not in this country anyway
i don't know
the seahawks are an up and down
it's kind of odd my roommate that i live with here he's lived in pennock minnesota
it's a small town
it's in central minnesota
it's a couple of hours west of minneapolis
i'm up here for a year on an internship
i actually live in florida
None
i still like
i mean who the heck is going to root for tampa bay right
i guess i could go for miami
i don't know
i don't have a real love for miami
i don't know
i guess i get into pretty much
i can't be terribly authoritative on what life was like thirty years ago
go ahead
obviously you look at the technological aspect of social change
you didn't have video games
you try to
you go into a business today
you try to imagine the whole thing except running off of carbon paper
it's almost inconceivable now because the xerox machines and everything have become such a part of the way we live
a business associate of mine was talking about how it used to be where you would send things through the mail
you had to do something
if they had business to do they had to finish it three days in advance so they could get it through the mail
now it's the kind of thing where you can work up until the last minute
because you can get it there
in a matter of minutes through a fax machine
because of that these quote unquote convenience type items have made work that much more intense and that much harder
you're expected to work on stuff up until the last minute
i recently read an article on just this that said stress today is so much worse
our grandmothers had to bake brownies
we can throw them in a microwave for
the more conveniences we have the more that's expected of us we have no down time
we don't stop and wait for things to happen because we don't have to
we keep moving
we have no
that's good
i just think our family lives have changed
i think that's ju-
our kids where would they be without nintendo and their t v shows
we have all single families
a lot of working
there's a whole big effect on our kids
not very many of my daughter's friends really are on their original mother and father
i'm wondering what this is going to do in ten and twenty years
there's that
there's the fact that nowadays fewer and fewer couples are deciding to have kids which generally tends to happen
the u s would be actually declining in population slightly if it weren't for the fact that we
i'm an o b nurse
that's never really occurred to me but that's interesting
i saw the numbers on that awhile back
i was uh-huh
in terms of the long term effect on america in terms of the culture and everything i don't know
an extremely large part of the next generation is going to be second generation from immigrant parents
they're going to be really struggling
i don't think that america is currently the type of environment where struggling up from the bottom is necessarily considered to be good
it's no longer the accomplishment that it once was
not that many people are really trying i don't think
that's true
it's just very different
i guess every ten years it's just been very different
i don't know what's going to happen
i know what i'm seeing here at my job
they've got their homes
they've got
okay randall
do you have any special interest in space flight
ever since i was a young and used to watch the old apollo missions going off in classroom t v
i suspect a lot of people got turned on by watching those go off
very exciting
the
i've always wanted very much to be somehow involved in all that
to meet and to see it actually happen
that seems rather unlikely at this point unfortunately
computer programmer
to bad
made the wrong career choice to get up into space
the
i used to think when i was younger that by this time we'd have lots more stuff in space than we do now
frustrating at times
i'm kind of young
None
there's a lot that's happened in my lifetime as far as with the space shuttle and all although plans to go to other planets have somewhat been thwarted in comparison to the sixties
although i have a
i kind of wonder
it would be great if we could find some way to use that to boost the economy
the
i've always felt that one of the long-term solutions that at least a few of our problems would be to have some sort of solar power satellites up
that's a singularly renewable resource that doesn't require any particularly nasty environment impact
you can just get as much power as you need up there
of course the side effects of this is that you have to have lunar mining bases and space stations and easy transport into space and no things that i think we should be doing
the side effects of doing that which i think would be good very very good for everyone in the long run is some of the other things i'd like to see happen would happen also
it seems like there's
you're talking about positive side effects then
the only problem is of course that that requires significant commitment from people to actually decide they want to put things like that up there
they're all
the only commitments that they're interested in making or even talking about are ones for flash value like the trip to mars
which would produce some useful scientific research and so forth
the same money could probably be far better spent on lunar bases and solar power satellite research and so forth
it would be being done for the glitz and show factor to get politician votes instead of for
we should eventually send people to mars but not just because it's glitzy to do so
we should do it for the return we get for it
unfortunately that's not what i thinks happened
i would settle for the glitz if the side effects were useful like the
the downside of that is after you do one of those people say we did it
now we're done
no need to play around with this space stuff anymore
i'd give almost anything to get into space
i'd
was it john denver that tried to buy his way on to the space shuttle
the only thing that annoys me is when people call and you have solicitation calls
i would
there's a lot of times though you get those calls when you're sitting at home wanting to relax or whatnot
next thing you know someone calls and wants to sell you this or that
it's real hard to tell them that you're not interested
you do tell them you're not interested
they still keep asking you and keep badgering you about it
that aggravates me
i don't know that you could call that invading my privacy
that doesn't work
a lot of times they dial sequentially
they get your name from if you enter any type of contest or anything
you enter a sweepstake in the local department store for a shopping spree or something
you
the newspapers they just dial randomly and stuff
the newspapers here even call people who already subscribe
while i was subscribing to the paper i got so upset at them that they you call me one more time i'm going to stop subscribing
the local papers ask them to remove your number from their list
yeah
you call up during regular hours
they have a special department
the orlando paper they refused to take it off of the lists
they call every month
when you have more than one phone number you get a call on each number you have
let me ask you about this
here's something that has been kind of concerning me lately
my fiance received a bill from a lord and taylor company
they're a department store
she received a bill from them that she had visited some sto-
i think it was there in florida
that she had visited a store there
they had this bill that she had bought such and such amount of merchandise over two hundred dollars worth of merchandise
the date that she supposedly made this purchase she was in denver with me for thanksgiving
apparently what had happened is someone used her social security number
i've heard recently that this is a common occurrence where people are using s-
they use joe blow's social security number and can potentially ruin someone's credit
if you know a person's social security number and their mailing address and their mother's maiden name
you can basically become that person
if the purchase was made mail order they should have a record of where it was shipped to since it wasn't shipped to her address she could prove that it wasn't her
if it was some coming into the store and stuff then whoever made the purchase would have had find some kind of document wh-
the signature
if they can't provide a signature they'll have to eat the charge
if the pers- has her social security number i'd be real concerned that she's not blacklist on what is it it's telecredit or something
she won't be able to cash checks because most places verify through there
she probably won't be able to open a checking account or anything without a lot of hassle
we got it cleared up eventually
what happened
their either offering a service
they're introducing some new product in the area
normally when they call you're either in the shower
you're in the middle of cooking something
you have to stop everything to run to the phone
is that one that you're talking about
invariably just about the time i'm going to sleep the phone tears off the wall
you are trying to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone
as soon as you say hello you hear the click of the recording coming on
you hear somebody all ready starting reading off a list of stuff that they've read probably a thousand times that day already
or the ones that are generated by a computer
they're voice activated
you've got to say hello twice before they'll do anything
sometimes i get them on my answering machine at home
i hate that when i've got a whole bunch of messages
i go through them
most of them aren't from anybody at all
i think a law should be passed to where any of these people
i think it's great that freedom of speech in this country and everything
if they're going to offer these services or these recorded message everything they ought to be stuck working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them
i have an unlisted telephone number
i still get all of those calls
some of them are speaking in a foreign language that i don't even understand
i really feel that's an invasion of my privacy
i would have called for their salesman to come out
living in an apartment complex though you can't really stop those people from coming around even though they put up signs out front that says no solicitations
they still come up to the front door and walk around
usually what i do is i'll call the apartment manager and tell them hey there's people coming around
they're trying to sell something
they're from a religious organization
i really hate that
gosh it was about nine o'clock at night too
it wasn't even what i would consider family hours
time to start going to bed
it was somebody from oh what was it the jesus christ of latter day saints
i've read a lot about that particular sect
i don't particularly care for it
i especially don't like for them to come up to my door and try and talk to me
i agree with their right to
i think they should also respect the sanctity of the american home whether it be in a house or in an apartment
i agree with you there
if they want to choose that particular religion that's fine with me too as long as they don't try and pull me in and drag me in
i don't like the way that they do it either
it's their mission that they do it
they go out into the public
they actually have the teenagers serving two years you would say like in an army and two years in going around and doing missionary type work
i don't know
i just don't particularly care for that at all
that's one thing that i feel really strongly about though is people coming up to my door and especially religious organizations and wanting to try and get me to join or become interested in their religion
i have my own
the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that says no soliciting
i've put in
i guess i should make another one that says religious or otherwise cause i still get
i didn't go that far
yeah
i probably could do the same thing
i'm sure i could rig up something
i don't think that that would stop people
it's like they see that word
it says go
reverse it
that would be technically illegal
i consider an invasion of my privacy
that's true
what else
i remember you talked about something
let me think
i thought yeah
that kind of touched a nerve right there
we got to talking about the people coming to you at the front door
pretty close to it
i've enjoyed talking with you
it was nice talking to you too jim
take it easy now
we've got to talk about music
do you like classic rock or modern rock or which kind
i guess the stuff
that's really when i grew up
that's really what i like better
more like rock like led zepplin type
they can get the doors and led zepplin
how about the rolling stones
that's when they toured
how about pink floyd
then we got some same things
i just didn't know that much about music
i wasn't sure what kind of music
in the whole spectrum i'd rather listen
what kind of heavy metal are we talking about
we're talking about what they call hard rock
give me some examples
for example let's see bad company
bad company's not bad
they're like for example a c d c
stuff like that
that's not really hard rock
i think when you say heavy metal i'm thinking about like cinderella
cinderella is hard rock heavy metal
i don't really care for cinderella
i like a c d c's okay
for example they have what
other bands consider it really hard rock
it's like brash metal which all they do is they have this guitar and they just bang at the guitar
the guitar is set really low
what happens is everybody gets totally into the music
they start dancing around
they just bump into each other
they hit each other with their shoulders
you knock people down
what you do is you also try to get up on stage and jump down on top of all these other people
that's what they do
that's what some people call really heavy metal
the difference i guess between hard rock and heavy metal is the lyrics also
really heavy metal is considered the words heavy metal
you always thought about suicide and killing people and stuff like that
just hard rock has
they don't talk about that
they just talk about life in general
you're talking queen
okay
you got to queen also
queen was real popular when i was growing up
especially god what is it a night at the opera
let's see the one that they have the whole opera singing in the background
bohemian rhapsody
that was great
i pumped it up
i just love that song
that was a real good one
they had
that whole record was pretty good
they started going downhill like everybody else
that's true
they're still around
they've got a new c d out
i wouldn't buy it
what happens is the old whe-
i like the old rolling stones
the new stuff's kind of more like today's rock and roll which i
for example i used to like old phil collins
what happened was that phil collins said hey i can make money a lot of money doing this
he came out with for example his record no jacket required
it was on his way of going downhill
he said i can make a lot of money just singing alone
he came out with the invisible touch with genesis
that really
now i hate phil collins
i look at him
i say you were singing at this time and with these people
you were great
now you're singing all this stuff that doesn't matter what you sing or what you record
that's what gets me mad
did you go see that new doors movie
i guess i've been kind of considering it
it's like i was watching siskel and ebert
those guys that criticize movies
they both loved the movie right
one of them said everything is great
i'm going to give it thumbs down
they go
the end is really depressing
the movie is so well made
the music that goes with it just picks you up
i was born in nineteen hundred sixty-nine
for me
you didn't really grow up with that kind of music then
you learn to
it's just that the sixties music's got a lot to say
i never found out what a lot of the seventies music had too
i was like
seventies music disco i don't like disco
i bet you were out there with your bell bottomed pants
i was more in the late seven-
i shou-
mid to late seventies between seventy-five and seventy-nine was more my era
did you go to college
that's cool
no
i graduated high school in seventy-eight
in seventy-eight rock was starting to get really heavy
real
that's what i mean
they always say that the seventies was the lowest point in progression ever in history
it's like nothing happened during the seventies
the seventies i don't know what they're called
it's like
the eighties are called the progressive years or the technology years
the seventies got nothing
nobody cared to name it
from now on we're going to go from nineteen sixty-nine when they took the first step on the moon to nineteen eighties
you're not missing anything
except for vietnam
that's why i guess everybody
they just don't name it
i guess it was pretty bad times
that's very true
let's see
i'm going to leave you alone
what are you doing
i was kind of in the middle of supper
it's not a big deal
i'm sorry
i didn't
i didn't have my number yet
it's okay
i told them i'd be available during this time
then have fun doing this
what kind of hobbies do you have
i do a lot of cross-stitching and painting when i do have spare time
i love it
there's just no time
several years
he likes to help me design projects that are
he looks at the pattern
he says how do you get that from there to the material
it's not
once you get started on it i love it
in fact i did one bill the cat from glenn county that was a real good one to do
yeah
is this mainly cross-stitching
i do mostly that
now i don't know
i think i have what was it two hundred
i got to thinking the money that i've got invested in this
it can add up quick
i just keep an inventory of what i currently have
then when i start a new project i go through and see if i
now can i improvise with adding and using another color instead what comes close
the colors
you don't have much spare time either
not lately
that does take some time
if we're trying to get acclimated with having a baby
just into everything
there's not a spare moment
i wouldn't trade it for the world
and work on his christmas stocking
hopefully this year he'll have one
last year he was a little bit young for having one
that's neat that you like cross-stitching also
that's kind of strange
i'm sorry
i just started about five years ago i think
it is peaceful
it is relaxing to do once you find the time to do it
i got one done
i think the child is going to be in high school before i get finished
i bought the cloth and the pattern for it
i didn't buy a kit
i've seen the afghans in the stores that are designed for cross-stitching
it's cloth i think
it has the borders and everything already
the lady said she couldn't believe that they know that i had done it in the colors that they had decorated the nursery
i didn't even know it
that's a
she said how did you know those are the colors we used
that
lilly she said it's for your daughter to use
my grandmother made us a couple of quilts for the baby
i was like i don't want to mess those up
there just too nice
you don't get many hand made quilts anymore
i've enjoyed this
keep up the good
none of them are recent right
i like gordon lightfoot
i like to listen to piano music a whole lot
willie nelson
you like a variety
not all country
i like some of his songs though
they're not so sad country all the time
they're not the typical country where they're just my wife left me my dog left me
my house just burned down
there's a guy
he plays wonderfully
do you play the piano
you just like it
vowed that someone in the family was going to learn
we all had to take lessons
i was the one that did the least poorly
she gave it to me
it's sitting here mostly taking up space
sometimes it makes you feel good to sit down and play it
if you can play tunes that people can sing along to it'd be kind of fun i think
not many things you can play people will sit there and sing along to
you can't sing along either
i like a lot
when i don't play
so do i
i like a lot
i like is it the new age music with the
you know how you put the headphones on and listen to it i heard a piece
it was just so wonderful
even my eleven year old boy loves to listen to it
it's nice when you have a piece that is so peaceful
that everybody likes
it has pieces that are uplifting
it's mostly relaxing
because it doesn't have words you don't feel like there's anything you have to remember as far as singing a song or something like that or interpreting what they mean
None
you can just sit
you know those little booklets that come along with it you can just see the things that they're trying to show with music
my little boy has gotten so into it that
he's identified the people that have written certain songs
on it
i see what you're saying
i don't even know who did which ones
he does
i can't identify them either
i know which ones come next
i don't even know their names
i can identify them
i like that
course i like classical music
yeah i was in chamber music groups and stuff
i'm used to pieces
i played classical flute
i didn't play jazz flute or anything like that
i can relate to it i suppose
i'm like you
i like chicago
i like hebert
hebert laws a flute player
i like chuck mangione
trying to think of all
i like mostly the older groups i think
we do have
i like breeze
i think just because they sound a lot like simply red
if i'm going to listen to that kind of music nowadays it's easy listening
what type simply red
it's got people singing
it's got people singing
it's got a whole bunch of people singing
i don't remember how many people
it's got men and women
it's nice
i mean it's pleasant music
it's not where it hurts your ears to hear it
it's not like chicago where it's got that much instrument to it
it doesn't have all the brass and everything
my husband is telling me we have to hit the road
you must live in this area
we're in garland
they're having a lot of recruiting this week in all the different areas
they're not c-
their fall semester
they've been doing a lot of that in the area
no more
what do you do
right now i'm just a homemaker
i'm going to school for legal assistant
that's what i know
just nothing basically
i'm really interested in the legal environment
i don't want to be a lawyer
i said i think i'll go back to school and see about being a legal assistant
it was for a murder trial
this guy had supposedly strangled this woman and stuffed cotton toweling down her throat and up her nose
they had us fill out a long questionnaire
they're going to call the ones that they're interested in from the questionnaire two to three at a time
the trial won't take place until june
they say it's going to last about two to three weeks
this guy in front of me said i can't believe i was summonsed
i was tailing the woman that was killed
then i have a friend at school that has a boyfriend that's a lawyer
he said that
the one that's accused was the one that actually did it
she has since taken off with another lawyer who had been getting cocaine from his client and then selling it
he had skipped bail
they finally extradited him
he's going to testify for the state against her so he'll have his sentence reduced
this is the man that was in front of you
well they'll
the investigator
he got off right away
i wrote that down on my questionnaire that he'd told me that
i figure that that will make me biased
i won't be chosen
there's probably something else that might make you
you could know about the crime but not necessarily be taken off the jury not be accepted for the jury
pretty much a lot of people would know about it and know some of the different things about it
they might weed you out some other way
if you don't believe in death penalty you're not going to be picked at all
i said that i could believe in it in certain instances but i'd find it hard to levy that against somebody
there they would have a doubt about you
that
if that's what the punishment is in that instance then you're always going to say not gui-
you're not going to want to have him have that punishment
when you're picked
i was picked for another murder trial before gosh it's so hard because everybody is wanting to go on and get the sentence done
if you're trying to hold out there's so much pressure on you
you've got to come up with a decision
especially with something where you have to find it beyond a reasonable doubt
it's like do you really feel that sure about
personally i don't have any children
i'm doing my master's at n c state children wouldn't be very convenient for me right now
how do you spend the time with your children
both of mine are boys
they're eight and eleven they're into sports as a matter of fact that's what we're doing tonight
what are you doing
does the eight year old play baseball
yes
we start here at five
in his league do they have a pitcher
do they have a standing ball or a machine or what
he's going to be with regular pitching my eleven year old of course is pitching
i used to play soccer when i was that age up in new york
it seems like soon as that over with we get into basketball
there's always something
how about on the weekends
do you go out
do you go for long vacations like a week or something when they have school off
where do you go
have you been out of the country
first they always say get to know your country first before you leave
i lived in places
when i lived in washington d c i never went to the washington memorial
when i went back to visit i went to the washington memorial
i've heard we have a couple of friends that goes to washington quite often
that must be the thing
they went to the memorial
it's a beautiful city
i bet it is too
the problem is first time i went out of here they took me to las vegas that was the most boring place on earth
now my husband and i we go different places
when we go with our children we usually kind of stay close
did you go to disneyland
i don't know
let's see
that was fun that was
then after that i
when i was like fourteen fifteen i went to turkey
this christmas i went to turkey
basically it's a
since my parents are
my parents live down there
all the traveling i do is alone
we were never much of
a very family thing made go skiing in vermont or something
that was a lot of fun
what happens is we used to fight a lot
there's never much of a
one of those hell family vacations
i try
my husband also we're involved in everything our kids does my dad died when i was less than a year old i always just had a mother
i always thought when i have kids i really want to be involved with them
my dad all he wanted to do was get money for us
he could buy us material things
to me it's now i'm twenty-two
i still feel
it's we never threw a football or something the way i was brought up
he wants me now
he wants to be best friends now it's very hard for me
it's like you grow up to be twenty years old
it's always the same man suddenly he sees that he's getting old
he wants to be best friends it's like i can only express myself so much
everything that my family taught me which is very hard to change that all of a sudden from one year to the next and say i'm sorry
it's i love you
let's go out and do things together when i don't feel like it that's that whole thing that he'll say when
i've seen my uncle and his family does everything together
his kids are
when his little girl was five years old and everything they would go to the beach
she could go to sleep at two in the morning i was brought up the same way
just so long as you can get up to go to class the next morning you can stay up
what he does is when he gets home he separates his work from his house
you have to you honestly do
they have children
their children does anything
we have to take them and to do it
that really gets kind of aggravating after a while
you're saying i work full time too
it's just something that
my theory is when you have kids and all you want to do
what i'll do is
you might have problems
it's not your kids' problems
you got to try to be with them as much as you can
to
thing is that if they would ever happen to have a drug problem suppose that they could feel comfortable coming to me and saying i got a problem
that would make any parent feel good and bad at the same time
let's see how we can get rid of the problem
that's very hard to do
once you're best friends with your parents then i think everything go a lot better
we knew time wise and money wise too it would not have been a good idea to had them then
my father was raising three kids before he had me
it was
you're trying to support four kids
it's pretty hard
i told him listen you could have had a lot of money if you would have only had two kids
i wouldn't have you
you would have a lot of money
you can't take this money with us though that's how i keep looking at it
four children is expensive especially for me which i'm paying out of state tuition
i'm paying three thousand
people say it's expensive to think it's college
if everybody would be a little bit responsible
what does it cost
they live at home
it costs two hundred dollars for books
seven hundred dollars a semester
if you can
a lot of people can spare that if they planned ahead it's like if you plan a year ahead you can probably save up seven hundred dollars one thousand four hundred dollars to send your child to college
excuse me
what are you wanting to do after you get out of college
i'm doing computer engineering
my husband's into computers
now i'm looking for a job before they have to send me back home since i'm an international student they want to send me back to argentina
my dad wants me to go back
you don't want to
if you go back there then you can never get out
you don't have any money to get out
i was thinking oh my god i go back there
i get married there
now i have kids there
i'll never leave the place
that's what happened to my brother
when he went down there
he was just so bad off from not being able to stay up here that his life just went down the drain
maybe something will open up for you
at least for a year and a half i can work
i've enjoyed talking to you
on this subject i really hadn't had to deal with putting someone in there yet
my mother's always been administrator of a nursing home i've always been involved in one
how do you feel about them since you've kind of been close to that
nursing homes to me
i would personally be the last resort if i had to put someone in there
i've had a touch of experience
my dad had emphysema and got to the point where mother couldn't take care of him
she put him in
he wasn't there very long before he died i guess the one time that i saw him there as far as the surroundings that seemed okay
we kind of thought that maybe they just wanted to give him some medication to sort of keep him real out of it all the time that's always kind of bothered me
i kind of think that's true too i guess because it's so under staffed
i've never actually been there i know that she's the kind of person who wouldn't allow a lot of the horror things to take place that you hear about
still i'm sure there are aspects to it that aren't really desirable
my sister's involved in one also
i really think they really do a wonderful job
still there's those little things that happens there really is which
i think it's a wonderful place if it comes to that if you just can't take care of them any more
sometimes you don't have any other alternative family's tied up with their own lives and things and usually working
it's hard to
yeah i think when the time comes i hope to have the time to really look around and pick one that i really think my mother would be happy at
outside's awful deceiving sometimes
in order to get in you have to be able to walk in on your own
in other words you can't be in too bad a shape to start out with
if you deteriorate they have a separate section for those who need care all the time
it's always
they have a long waiting list too
there's always this feeling of golly gee you've got to be able to walk in the door
you can't wait until you're too bad off you don't want to go do that when you don't have to because you have to give up your automobile or whatever
everything you worked so hard for all your life yeah
yeah if you're still capable of driving and doing those things then you feel like gee i'm isolating myself here for no reason at the moment
that's a hard one
it is a very nice nursing home
there's also some private ones of course i would never be able to afford to put my parents in something like that
another thing i hate to see is when someone has a small amount of money and they go into one of these places and they just eat it all up immediately
those who don't have money can go in and get the same care
i don't like that aspect
None
they could put it in one of their children's names or something
still a lot of them doesn't feel comfortable doing that
it's their money
that's how i feel about it anyway
i said i want you to have control of your own business
what if
naturally she's retired
she's still on her own
my mother's seventy-five and still has her own home and everything
on the other hand i've seen some people go into the nursing home and just so happy
some of those places have wonderful activities and things lots of stuff going on
they'll take them places i don't know
it's not all bad i guess once you get ill then you really have some problems if you can't get around and do things
i really don't know what the other solution would be
when the time comes hopefully we'll really look around before i decide on one for my parents really do
i have been raised in one
there's lot of things i know to look for
i don't think they'd want to go where they used to work either
that might be kind of tough
like i said my sister's still in it
i really don't think my mother'd want to be there either
it's been nice talking to you
you too
i guess we'd better get back to work
in a normal route of way we do things how about the ladies go first
i have a four year old who will just be entering public school next year
i'm really just starting to get involved in what's out there and how they do things
as far as the system as a whole i really don't see a problem with it
i do see a problem with graduating people that can't read and are not productive in society or productive to themselves
i think that's the main problem at this point
i live in plano texas
today we're not even suppose to be in school because the way the taxation and all that crap is there really legally isn't any funding for the school systems in texas today
when you take professionals and put them in situations they have to make decisions based on money to fund public education
they can't get their finger out of their ear long enough to get that major subject in line
i think here in texas mainly that they're not serious
they're more serious about what the salary should be for senators than they are for how the level of education should be for children
i'm more opinionated about the observations than the true facts
it's just a shame to me that our firemen our policemen and school teachers are the three least paid utilities that have the biggest impact to our well-being
i have a real issue with that
i think that if from every year when they pull in the test that the last three years ten eleven twelve graders take
you see that their education is below the norm throughout of all fifty states
i have a real concern about that
verses having her go down here and not learn anything
i think there's a big concern
hopefully the new secretary of education will do something to fix the problem
i don't know
they've got to quit worrying about the religious overtones in our textbooks and get on with teaching the product
i think they get bogged down in a lot of small issues that special interest groups can blow up
not really get down to teaching what's important
teaching these kids really the basics is what it comes down to
i was astonished to find out that across the united states in all public schools it is not mandatory for them to take phys ed
the kids nowadays don't even know what the president's fitness education program is all about
i talked to a thirteen year old last night who goes to one of the plano high schools or junior highs i guess
she said that she had a choice
she choice to take weight lifting
give me a break
the kids sit there
they drink cokes and eat popcorn for lunch
i have a real problem with the whole system
they need to put some sternness back into the teachers and let them be able to get the old whip out and get some discipline
then it comes down to what you said before though about them being some of the lowest paid public service
yet they're so important
i used to date a girl who taught english at ninth grade level
i was absolutely flabbergasted at what she was paid
she was young
still it's the principle
it's hard though because then you start talking taxes
taxes lord forbid taxes
goodness gracious if we would plan our expressways a little better that ten dollars for the bridges and the roads we'd cut that in half and get some teachers we might have us a problem
maybe i should run for office
run on that then no income taxes in texas
that's about all i have here
me too
i think we both agree there's some problems there
do you have any hobbies
right at the present time nothing real special
i'm kind of into camping and vacationing that sort of thing
i'm an avid gardener
i consider that a hobby
they were suggesting handcraft things which
i guess that's a really true hobby
i think anything that you enjoy
it doesn't really have to matter
it could be working on cars could be your hobby really
i guess if you make money at it it becomes a vocation
i don't know
it always seems it goes wrong when you try to do something
right now we start our seeds inside
we usually start them right in the house
a wind storm come and knock it down
she's had really good luck
ca-
actually if you start it in a couple weeks and you can get your plants outside pretty much the end of may
you might put them in the ground just the first week of june we can put potatoes in the ground in the middle of may
i've lived in texas and new mexico most of my life
i did once
i remember that it was on into may before it really started warming up
we live really close to lake champlain which is in the champlain valley
we're about two weeks ahead of everyone else out on the outskirts
that kind of moderates the weather a little bit
he gets frost
you're right across the lake from what plattsburgh
i had a cousin that was stationed there plattsburgh for a while
he remembers lots of snow
it's depressed economically
really
when you go across the lake
they've had layoffs recently
when we got hired here no no never any layoffs never never
now we're looking at serious
i'm a technician
i'm working for t i texas instruments down here
i interviewed with them
i didn't want to go to texas
even though my mother's people are from georgia
i guess we have to get back to hobbies since
interesting thing that i do is with gardening
you can make dried flower arrangements
you can get real handy with the hot glue gun
we made some really nice christmas wreaths with dried red flowers and dried white flowers and eucalyptus
what eucalyptus is
it's sold in the hobby stores and nurseries
at first i'm why do people like this
it is kind of a nice smell after a while
i'd wonder what is that
one day i realized that it was eucalyptus
it's like a fad thing
i don't know
i've never heard of it
it looks really potent stuff
i think it's the greatest stuff in the world though
i make all kinds of things with it
i almost want to start a business doing it
i'm so timid when it comes to starting a business
that's a big step
especially with being in on the creative aspect and the crafty end
after a while you make some stuff
go boy this is kind of ugly
i know someone who does a lot of woodworking for a hobby
he does it believe it or not to get out of the house away from his wife
he's a seasonal worker
up here it's almost a pattern
you see your fathers do it
this guy was going nuts
his son built him a garage and got him some i don't know what the equipment's called but planers and things and set him up
he makes
all kinds of furniture for his kids
he makes little kids' furniture
there was a program on t v down here on the educational channel here a while back about a lot of little companies of one and two guys up there
this particular one i think was in maine and new hampshire just kind of out in these little towns they'd be in
they've got twelve weeks to do something
they're making furniture and just things like that during the winter
they go off and do other things during the summer
it's a really
it's keeping his marriage
he's getting on in his years now
he's not that old
he's getting to the point where he needed an extra boost
to do something like that
it's hard work
i couldn't imagine taking raw lumber and trying to make something out of it
that would be really t-
the
he dowels everything
it's all got to line up
i don't think he goofs too much
i don't see too much scrap around
that's something
now our temperatures down here we're starting to get pretty consistently in the seventies and eighties as far as planting outdoor stuff matter of fact tonight i was planting some trees out back tonight
it's really nice
almost hated to come
is it going to be really dry
are you
these were
the cold weather can kill them i guess
trees that wintered
i don't know where they came from
they come down here
they'll sit in the nurseries here
they'll go ahead and leaf out
what i'm planting or actually transplanting is trees that are already leafed out
that's good
i guess they say you can plant them in the spring or the fall all
let them winter through the fall
down here it's done both ways
it just kind of depends on what you're planting
all the shrubs and
my sister does flower gardens
i guess a lot of people do do that
she's got just a small patch of lawn and just flowers and mulch tree bark all over her lawn
during the summer down here the normal kind of flowers there's very few of them that will really do well
everything does real well here in the spring until about first part of june
the heat sets in
june july august are
most of those kind of plants are just barely staying alive let alone make flowers
is it
we're in a relatively new area
we're kind of out of the natural tree area
you don't have a lot of tree coverage
we're kind of up on a slope
we don't have
going to make
this was pasture land
down the hill here a little ways there are parks that look like jungles
where aunts are they have these huge pecan trees
they just shade everything
it's in georgia
it's right outside of macon
it's just a
i like the way that idea of the south is
when i think of texas i think of nothing but no trees and just grass
i tell you what
east texas
the two cities are very identical
if you were familiar with atlanta
it's that dry heat
no
it's not dry at all
it's humid
where is it
wasn't it houston's humid
houston is awful
ironically enough i'm sitting here with a cast on my leg because i resumed an aerobics class the night before last
that's what the nurses kept saying as they laughed all the way down the hallway
off and on
i've been going over to the fitness center
my husband's a t i in the unit here
i try to go over there at least three times a week
i try to walk at least five times a week
if this is getting to
i'm just curious
when you go over there does it bother you in terms of how things are arranged either at the dallas location or the spring creek in terms of it's so much of a weight orientation weight lifting et cetera
i've been going to spring creek
i haven't been to the dallas one now in a couple of years
i don't really
it's not that great
i go to the spring creek one on and off
my husband's working over there
he just goes to the dallas one
i just don't
it's just so much weight lifting
is that what your into
i've used the nautilus equipment
the pool when it gets warmer
the pool
what i did was i went to a jazzercise class in a new location in richardson near where we live in north dallas
long story short i hadn't
they have like the gymnasium flooring
they had about three feet of linoleum around the perimeter in the back where i usually stand in any class like that i go to
instead of having that level they had a chrome strip that wasn't level
it was about four inches deep and then about oh a seventy degree angle
my goodness
as we were jumping around or doing something i just jumped up and came right down on it
the orthopedist called it a basketball injury where the ankle just rolls under you and it snapped
we went to whatever in plano
the emergency room was like a bad comedy show
the doctor said you didn't do anything
wednesday night the radiologist called me at work
i was on crutches
he said i think you better call an orthopedist
we went to one
he just put a big old cast on it
i like aerobics
i'm not so sure that
not that much though
i was pretty much in shape walking
this is one of those things
like this orthopedist said he said you'd be surprised how many people come in here with things like that because they are active
i was real embarrassed
i felt kind of stupid
i guess i'm glad that nobody really noticed
i got up and started jumping on it again
i do it because i like it
i like the music and that kind of stuff
i've been unable to do that because i hurt my foot about five years ago
actually i was up on a ladder and fell off
when i came down i hit with my full weight on my foot but on concrete
they had to go in and do surgery
the impact would not be good
as i permanently damaged the cushion under my heel the normal cushion that you have there
that makes sense
are you in terms of other things like not running but playing a little bit of tennis can you not do stuff like that at all
i haven't tried that
i bet it's been thirty years since i played tennis
i notice in aerobics a lot of the women that don't look like they shouldn't be doing certain things i'm always afraid they're going to fall over and have a coronary
there was my ego when i went ahead
i went i can do that
half the time though i don't jump half as much as
i'm real tall
i'm not heavy
when you go easy a hundred seventy at my height you need just take it easy
when i see some wo-
i just don't think it's healthy
really it's not really good for your knees
i don't know
i wasn't familiar with the
the floor was uneven
it was completely
it literally
the two dissimilar floor coverings were not level
at first after it happened i thought maybe that's a handicap access
i said no
my husband being a t i engineer
one thing that i like swimming you like that a lot
i liked it because i want to
it's real funny because if you
it's the other way around
i need all the help i can get
he said you're at thirty something
you're on the upper side
he says even if you weren't doing anything that would start to happen to you
i said i'm not that heavy
i'm not heavy
i said why do i feel like i need to start pushing myself more
he goes human nature
you see these little girls in these little bitty things
they're all like twenty-one years of age
luckily at there's a little more diverse clientele
sometime when i ask i just feel like boy am i stupid or what
that's one thing i like about the spring creek place
at least one of the fellows that's there at night and on weekends is real helpful
his name is b j
i think i've
i've been there maybe a dozen times
i actually like that site better than the other one just because of the type people that go to
sometimes i feel like i'm in a singles bar
i haven't noticed that up at spring creek
i just
i'm glad they did that
you're not missing anything at the dallas renovated site
if you don't live near there that's not worth
it's about half way between the spring creek and the dallas site
it's all the same to me
as we were doing it too everybody noticed that there were all these big guys of assorted nationalities
great i have purple tights on
they're going yes
in general i like dance a lot
aerobics is something i'd hate to give up
he kind of said something to me about probably not as bad as your foot
he just said to me maybe you ought to try bicycling
not anything
that's just
i just
i couldn't adjust that
more about this stuff than i do obviously then
you're walking okay now obviously
you can
it matches one if i have one on the other side
anything else about exercise we can talk about
other than i need to go
i don't know
my husband and i haven't done a whole lot of camping
we bought a van last year
we were hoping to do some camping in the van
we did go camping in oklahoma
last year we camped in a tent
there were two other couples with us
there was state park
it was really nice
up here some of the state parks are really nice
some of them aren't
they just have outhouses
they don't have a shower room or anything
some of them are really nice
i don't know
i've been camping a couple times
i'm not a real avid camper
i don't
i don't like really camping in the rough
i like the little necessities like having electricity available and running water and showers and things like that
we went once to a lean-to
it
there wasn't any electricity on the camp site
it was all right
i wouldn't want to go for a week
that would be much
especially there was a little store close by
it was pretty nice
there's a lot of boating out there
we went up there to hopefully be able to get on the water a little bit
it was still too cold
it was pretty early in the year
up here you got to wait until august until the water warms up
it's not that bad
it's still pretty chilly
i don't know
i have a tent
i fluff out in it in the backyard and stuff
this thing about camping that bothers me is you've got to pack everything
another thing is the thing seems to get
you can't keep the dirt out of the tent
stay out
we have a dog
that's just about as bad as a kid
and use it as a play
i don't know how you can really keep the inside of a tent clean
other than taking your shoes off right before you walk in or something and sweeping it out everyday it's really hard to keep the sand and dirt out of it
what we're just going to sleep in the tent and hang out at night so no going in and out or what he wants to do
you get it all wet
did you have another a big tent looks like a sitting area type like a two room type
i was just thinking of getting one those for the yard because they are really nice
up here we have quite a few mosquitoes at nighttime
we don't really have a problem with that in these areas
even when in oklahoma when we camped i really didn't notice a problem with bugs
i noticed that
i've lived back east before they
there's this one campsite that it
there is one that's out in this big lake
it's mosquitoes are terrible
there's this other one that's more up in the mountains
it surrounds a man-made reservoir
there's no bugs
that's the whole thing that everyone told me
i was going to go to little river state park
we were having a really big problem up here in certain areas
we were really affected bad by it but really got it
almost destroyed the tourism in one town because of the mosquitoes
it's a really nice area
i couldn't imagine living just sixty miles north of them
they were plagued with mosquitoes
you can go outside in the daytime all right
the minute the sun sets the mosquitoes come out
just the very second
they must work on that
it gets cooler when the sun sets
they all come out
have you ever taken any of those what do they call this lights
because that wasn't really
i really didn't get to use them like there's mosquitoes let's turn them
we weren't bothered that much by mosquitoes
we didn't really contribute it to that
i think in an area that's really thick with mosquitoes
i can't see all this little smoke buckets i call them
they're suppose to work really well
i'm in my paperwork here
i don't know if i'm going to go
i could really talk about like gardening or something
i do want to go again
we just moved into a house
i don't think camping
i don't see going on a camping trip probably until next summer
i'd like to go camping cross-country
we don't have any children yet
it's easy for you to go
easy to pick up and go and s-
we can just throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back of it
god
it's not really i guess camping the way most people picture camping in the tent
that sounds that my kind of camping it really does
okay
that is to have a nice vehicle where you can have everything in it plus your tent
get
he just tows it behind his truck
he's got three kids
his kids will sleep in the truck in the back of the bed
they sleep in the pop-up
they're kind of nice
they're also flimsy when you really look at them
when you get inside they're really nice
then when you look underneath them it's just got these little wheels and this little axle
it's like my
a big windstorm it would pick you up
he did have a problem when he went camping last year in beavers bend oklahoma
a storm came in
it started raining really heavy
everybody was trying to flee the campsite
what do you do when you get a really violent storm like a tornado
i wouldn't stay in the
theirs was so bad
they were so close to the water that the water was coming up
they had to get out of there
then were they successful
they were
it took them a little while
did they get stuck
they ended up helping several other people though that were stuck
they evacuated it
the whole campsite was evacuated
i think some people that had fairly sturdy vehicles or whatever if they had like a winnebago or something and they were farther in away from the water i think they stayed
everybody that was real close to the water ended up
i know i like to get right on the water
like i say they're just kind of more sturdy than anything
they're lean-tos
they're pretty nice
it's like a little house except the whole face is open
the one time that we went we got one
it was a big embankment
it was neat sitting there watching it
it was raining
when we called home everybody said we were worried about you in that storm
i have a lot of different teams that i like to keep in touch with
you can't live in dallas without
i originally came from saint louis
the saint louis cardinals are one
i have a tendency to adopt teams when i go to a town
it's helpful
i lived in kansas city for a couple years
i adopted the royals
i adopted the houston astros
i've got quite a few
do you keep up with the statistical stuff
i don't get into that too much
every once in a while i will keep in touch with maybe who's in the top five of hitting or something like that
i don't get into how many errors somebody has or things like that
there's a guy that was on show that i listen to going to work in the morning who does
it's essentially trivial statistics they've got a st-
apparently the rangers last year won a lot of one run games
i didn't know that
that's supposed to be a real good statistic
it is
it's a reverse indicator
that's true
they don't have the offense to get out or to have the more runs
what the argument is
it's one of these statistical
they find that there's a connection between that and how they do in spring training the following year
strangely enough it's almost like the law of averages catches you on the following year
which means that if you have a good year winning one run games that the following year you'll have a bad year
they've looked at i think twenty-three teams
the statistics are something like twenty-one out of twenty-three
it's
what do you think of incaviglia's loss
i kind think it was necessary
i'm not a big pure power hitter anyway
i don't like these guys that get up there and swing for the downs every time
i think that a player ought to hit a home run if he's got the pitch to do it
when you get two strikes on you you should shorten your swing a little bit
the strike outs were a big problem for him
supposedly what i heard he was not much of a team player anyway
it's an interesting concept though when you look at of how apparently
the point of i guess
i don't understand the strategy of how baseball works
it seems that they can sign him tomorrow
he could go in the team the next day
they put him in the lineup
he hits a home run
all of a sudden he becomes a hero
that's true
all he has to do is hit the ball
you're not a-
all he has to do is one hit it once
he can swing a couple times
it's an interesting concept of how they do it
i agree with you
i think that's part of what baseball needs more of
i guess what bothers me is that when you go you wait and wait and wait
finally a guy gets up there and blasts a home run
that's all the game is
there's another point to that too
they said that he was horrible at batting with men on base
having somebody get up and hit a solo home run gives you run obviously
if you can't do it with men on base there's something definitely wrong
you've got to be able to get the two and three run home runs to be able to score enough runs to be able to win in this day and age
they have several pitchers that had badly years last year
they're these cycle pitchers
they pitch one year bad one year good one beer bad one year good
saberhagen has won supposedly the cy
i think he won cy two out of three years
he's very much due for a good year
are they going to beat oakland
that's a good question
i don't know how oakland's going to react to being swept in the world series last year
they could very easily take that as a challenge which is the way most teams naturally do
and just go out and not give anybody a chance to beat them
i go to saint louis from time to time
i watch their sports up there
they're certainly intense about the cardinals they
baseball is there life up there like football is down here i think
did you actually live in saint louis
everybody does right
i had a friend from college that lives in
it's i should say on the west side
everything's on the west side
out that way
i went and visited him
anyway it is interesting
how are the cardinals
i definitely do
what i hear from everybody up there they're not going to have a good year because they let too many people go
i've been following spring training
they're one of the best teams in spring training so far
is that a good indicator
it can be
it really kind of depends on what they were looking for
in other words if in spring training they were looking at all their kids like a lot of them do then it really doesn't give you any indication
if they were playing the people that they're going to play then that might be pretty good indication
it's not a great indication because there have been teams that have just come out and just won all kinds of games in spring training and then gone on a fourteen game losing streak in the first of the season
what i think is remarkable is
it seems that what you really need to do to win though is to have a team that has reasonable talent and has some people that have real breakthrough years
the question is how do you forecast that
if you had to bet on who would be in the world series it would be really tough
i think the best thing that you can do is go with the players that have the talent to do the best years and that they hadn't had these gigantic career years yet and just kind of assume that one of them is going to break through eventually
i think they said the reds
they may be even better this year
when are the rangers going to come through th-
that's a good question
the rangers have a pitching problem
whether or not they can fix that or not is going to be an interesting question
they're doing the right thing though
they're letting their farm system build up and stuff like that
is there enough money
i don't know if you read skip bayless
a local commentary
his argument is that the ownership is not inclined to lose big money long enough to bring in the big dollars
that's probably true
would you agree with that
considering what i've seen in the last two seasons i'm beginning to agree with that
you don't have to spend the big money as far as i'm concerned to win
i think that's really what's been hurting the rangers
they spent more money
didn't kansas city put up quite a bit of money for their pitching staff
last year than any other team in the league
they were toward the bottom of the league
it's like i said spending money doesn't guarantee you winning a pennant
i think that's maybe part of it that the
it
the question of losing big money that what did steinbrenner actually make money on the
you got me
i think that there's coming to a point real soon when ticket prices are going to be to the point where the average fan can't go
once you do that you lose everything
it's a little bit like any other sport
when it starts costing you fifty or a hundred dollars to go to a game i guess as we get older you're probably going
if you compare to go to a sport a
you go to a rock concert
or even a performance an opera or the symphony or something
if i-
how often do you do that
i would think baseball probably feeds on a number of people that can go out there several times a
that's the whole point
there are so many games in a year that they've got to have repeat customers
that's one of the things that i think saint louis has done
their ticket prices are i guess as high as anybody else's
somehow or another they attract so many people from
it's a small market
yet they attract as many if not more than most other cities
don't you think there are older fans there
i don't mean older
the fact that it's a better established and that the city is more of a
i'm only a little bit familiar with the red sox because i lived up in boston for a while
that's
come on
i understand a little bit about the texas rangers
that
i heard a joke on the radio yesterday in regard that he didn't design the patriot missile system
the radio's kind of cruel
think this chain that must have been on president bush to bounce the first pitch off the ground
how humiliating for a man to do that any man
at the same time i don't know it's pretty far to throw that far
he's a man
i never
a major owner of the team here
i thought he was the owner
it turns out my mom said that he's part owner
he must own the biggest chunk
that's all you hear about is if about neal bush i think is his name
i even know his name because he's on the news a lot
i never had to watch the news not like some people hour and a half a day or anything
i've been watching
if i've been watching the french news
speaking of bush that had a story where he went to visit some little elementary school students and stuff
i saw that
did you see that where the guy asked him for proof of who he was
see a credit card
i don't
he said
i didn't see it
that's about baseball
i can tell you
my brother was supposed to go to the opening game
i couldn't tell you who pitched
they won
somebody else lost
i don't even know if they're still new york yankees
it
then they can have them play against each other
i think it's still the new york yankees
the texas rangers they lost i think
i know that last year
we got free tickets because one of the deacons at church parks cars at the mansion at turtle creek which is one of the places and stuff
he's their head chauffeur
i was shocked
anyway someone gave an iranian a tip of four rangers tickets last year
the iranian couldn't
he gave them to alan
alan and his dad had plans that night
they gave them to us
he decided that some wealthy man tipped this iranian
we ended up with them right
we were
i looked at my husband
i said what a tip
we ended up on first base right down there on the floor
they called us at five
the game started at seven
we just threw everything together ran over and got the tickets and walked
we took two kids with us
nobody brings two children in these seats because
you just sit down
all the girls were all dressed up
i just was there
i'm here
it was just kind of funny
we got to sit by first base
if they did hit a ball i would have been afraid it would have knocked my face in
we went last year
my brother is impossible
when he does football leagues and baseball leagues and all kinds of stuff
if there's a game on he's watching it
that's all there is to it
he's glued at the t v
i'm glad my husband's not like that either
he goes to a lot of games
he tries to go
my brother's wife and my husband and i went
being a non-american you want to see what a baseball game is like
he describes it as you sit there in a crowd
you sit there in a crowd
you're waiting and waiting and waiting
you eat the hot dogs
we made him try a hot dog
you sit there
you wait for the longest time really bored
all of a sudden something happens
you happen to look the other way during the time
basically you sit there and wait for something exciting to happen
when it happened he missed it
he grew up in
i had a friend in college from strasbourg
my cousin lives in paris
she's lived there off and on for twenty years
is she still there
that's one of the entrances to the periphery to get in and out of the city
it sits right at the limit
we met in paris
they have twelve children
my god the poor woman
she just liked having kids
she's thin
None
i'm not kidding you
they're all eight and under
they're not condemning you
we only have one child
they don't put on bad or anything which is good because it would be easy i'm sure for them to do that
you think everyone should have it
i'm real proud of them because they don't do that at all
there's ten tooth brushes in there
i always give her a hard time who's toothbrush did you really use this morning
how do they afford to even have the kids
they tithe
they
i think that's the key in his sales last year
last year he made
it was the biggest thing that any one in this company had ever done
he got to do it
god just really blesses him in ways like that
we think of blessings as nice furniture and things like that
kids are just as much of a blessing inside these material things
it's a different kind
a lot times people think i'm not blessed
you've got five kids
he's
the kids at bible talk about anything
training is different than anything else
in psychology doesn't address it
the good stuff that's in psychology it just comes out of the bible
they don't quote you the proverb out of it
the things that work in psychology other the years that they've proven to work they just come out of the bible
so this book it just really all these things and how to train the child
they're not going to be a curse to you when they're thirteen
how to train them so they're going to be a blessing
they do that
they just live lean pretty much
she doesn't shop at foley's and stuff like that
a lot women die or shop at foley's
i don't know what foley's is
everything's pretty expensive
you just can't do that
you don't go to baseball games as much
you get pictures like we did
what i mean
you do these fun things in other kinds of ways
i know manhattan's real expensive
it's kind of a different situation because you're probably living in an apartment right
that makes a really big difference
still it's just as hard as having that
your cousin could have a baseball team with twelve kids
right now we don't have a girls' league because i'm the one that's supposed to start one
i just haven't gotten around to doing it
everybody wants to do it
god's sitting on my heart
i just hadn't gotten around to doing it
they could really only have four members on the team
you didn't believe me about her kids
they are so good
she does work with them
it's a commitment
that's what they're called to do
i admire someone that can do that
most of my friends have three or four kids
they feel like that's really why god
some of the people in our church use birth control
some of them don't
this is a good subject isn't it
i don't know what we're going to do about it
it's certainly something that has a lot of things to talk about
when they say the middle east
there's so many different problems there
what do you want to concentrate on
i'll tell you something
i have a sister-in-law from israel
they're really quite arrogant about it all
they believe that they belong there
they've belonged there forever
the palestinians and the arabs are more or less
they consider them second class
they're really quite arrogant about it
i don't know if that contributes to the problem
how did they feel about the united states intervening
did they
i'm sure this is the one time that the israelis are really happy to have their big brothers the americans
i didn't really talk about that with her
my sister-in-law now lives in switzerland
when they were living in israel it was the palestinians they come in an
they're nothing but really servants for them
they really treat them like second class citizens
they don't really want them around
they like them around because they do all the menial labor and such
they really do
i don't know being
i live in vermont
being up here we pretty much treat everybody as someone that has merit even if they're poor or if they're hispanic or if they're black
we give everybody pretty much the benefit of a doubt because we don't see all the crime and all the hurt in the big cities
if i lived in washington d c i think i'd have a different attitude about black people
i've heard that they're terrible
here all my black friends are professionals
they don't go out and abuse drugs
they send their kids to school
they really encourage them to go to college and stuff
it's just a different world
i live in san antonio
fifty percent of the population is minority
i talked to someone about san antonio
they said that you have quite the problem with the ghettos
i don't think it's any different of a problem than any other major city
i heard that like a city like san diego it just has a really bad problem
as far as gang violence and things i don't think it's any worse here than in houston
like houston
me not even knowing anything about houston i would think that it's a pretty calm city
my
we're so protected up here
it's really strange
our red light district you could go walking around down there and pretty much not fear for your life
we're just so protected
over in the mid east especially israel it's just like israelis have a totalitarian system when it comes to the palestinians
the israelis can do anything they want
when it comes to palestinians if they're out in the street at night it's really looked on as odd
usually they're bussed in to the jewish neighborhoods and the jewish cities
then at night they're bussed out to the occupied territories
they don't have that
what do you think about the mess we've created in iraq
i think it's unfortunate as far as the kurds are concerned
you don't want to get so directly involved that you're occupying the country
we can't get involved in their civil war unfortunately
we've kind of driven these people out
you see president bush is telling them rebel uprise
that's what they did
now they're asking him for help
he's like no we can't get involved
he agreed with the general schwartzkopf
he said bush should have let him finish his job
he should have let them corner the republican guards
i think the war ended too soon
everyone i talk to they says
we didn't damage enough of their arsenal
we should have made sure we got everything
i don't think the higher ups were thinking about what this guy's going to do with the rest of his war machine
they're going it's not going to hurt us
we're just going to let them go
really we didn't think about the people that he was going tr-
he's just
unfortunately though the original goal of the mission was to drive them out of kuwait
once that was accomplished
they stuck right to their goals
the american people when this first started they were even reluctant to let them do that
they were playing it very safe
it what do they say an ounce of hind sight is worth whatever
schwartzkopf knew what had to be done
it's too bad that he just didn't have the ability just to do it the go ahead to do it
he had the fu-
i didn't realize that
i feel really sorry for these people
you knew this
if you were in your house they were going to take you and beat you
of course you're just going pick everything up that you can carry
you're going to run
it's just too bad that we couldn't see that
i just have a feeling that the military involvement isn't over yet that i still feel like there's more to come
you know what i was hoping
i was hoping iran was going to take a very dramatic stand and invade
iran's the big bad guy
really if they were going to save people's lives
i almost swear i'm kind of disappointed with the iranians
i don't know if the kurdish
i don't know
i think they have a bond with the kurds
i think they should have just done more
maybe if the world could have given them some type of aid
it's just so complicated
i was real surprised that israel stayed out of it as much as they did
knowing them they're very
i'm going to protect my family
i was amazed too
i was really proud of them though that they stayed out of it
from what i can tell if they had gotten into it it would have started a whole new war
i
that the egyptians would pull out
i just saw atomic bomb
i have i guess a lot of thoughts about the vietnam war
i guess i feel like i was pretty young while it was going on
there's probably a lot of things i remember and a lot of things that i really didn't have a clue as to what was happening
looking back maybe some of the things that i know now i'm not sure i do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives
we never went to war
i feel like it went on and on
i guess i see such a contrast like as opposed to the middle east war we just had where president bush went out and got worldwide support for what was happening
i just feel like maybe we went in to be policeman
i'm not sure that's our role
i agree with that
i was fairly young at the time too
i really don't have very many memories about it at all in fact
my husband is a vietnam veteran
in looking at the persian gulf war that just went on he
it frustrates him because of the support that they have and the support that the vietnam vets did not have from the people or the administration either one
i do think that it's been too long in coming
i feel like maybe the american people and the government are aware of the things that we did wrong that we didn't support
those guys were there doing their duty
they weren't there by choice
i think that we learned from that
i think it's one of those things that you learn the hard way
the way that they have been treated over the years i believe that's just now turning around just now trying to be rectified
i'm not sure you can undo the damage that was done emotionally
i agree with you that i think that the time difference between the two wars has allowed a lot of people to see the mistakes that were made in every aspect of it
i agree with you also that i feel like it was not worth the money spent or the lives lost to fight that war
they're still not settled over there
i have a feeling that the persian gulf crisis is going to be the same way
i think we're going to end up back there in a few years if not sooner
i appreciate the fa-
i feel president bush is in a hard spot
he has backed out
i realize they're still saying here you're encouraging us to get rid of saddam hussein
why aren't you helping us
i think him going in and doing that would be putting us in another vietnam situation
i don't think the u s will stand for it
i think we learned too much of the effects
whether it was justified or not i know that they probably felt like we were going in for a good cause
i feel like maybe they felt like we were doing the right thing to try and help maintain the democracy over there and beat the communism
i think somewhere that got lost
in the long term effects of the war
you have to give bush a lot of credit for he said that's what we were going there to do
he did what he said
he did pull out before it got any further than that where it would have turned into more of a police action or more of a political action i guess you getting into their governmental affairs which you really can't do as another country
my biggest problem with all of these wars is we spend all of that money on all these other countries
we have so many problems here at home that we don't address
that's what frustrates me more than anything
i believe that we have to have a military
i believe that we have to have a defense to keep anybody else from walking in and doing it to us
i also believe that we need to turn so much of that inward
they don't if they could just cut out all the fat and get it lean and start addressing some of the other issues
who just end up using things against us later on anyway
i do think that in the middle east war
i think that maybe a lot of the arab countries that were so hateful towards the united states have come away with kind of a different attitude
i think that maybe we're not their big bad enemy any more
i think that's good
i guess in ironic way a lot of good came from the vietnam war toward this war
like we said earlier a lot of eyes were opened after years and years of that war
perhaps the reason that good came out of the mid east war is because we had the experience of vietnam
i do think that we've learned from it
i wish there weren't war
i do think we learned
i just hate the emotional price a lot of the vietnam people paid
for nothing
they still don't know what they were there for
what did we do
what were we trying to do
i think you're right
i think you're right there
i do remember when it was over
i remember the feeling back then
right now i feel like this country has been behind this war
i believe that the way that it was done and the way that was handled were right
it's sad
we shouldn't be fighting a war
there was no let's support them
when this war broke out it frustrated me all the antiwar people and
all the demonstrations that were going on
None
nobody says because you're supporting the troops that you're supporting the war
you have to support the people that are there
for some reason those people don't see that
they're just real shallow people
i agree
i recall when president bush said that
i'm sorry that you're opposed to the war
you're not helping the people that are over there by what you're doing
i remember a lot of it kind of stopped after that
they're not helping anybody
that's the whole point
i don't even know what they're doing for themselves
i'm glad we've learned
i'm especially sorry for the people that have spent all these years trying to deal with it emotionally
until the past four or five years nobody ever really worried about that
i think that's where we as american people really failed them
i don't know
do you have anything else you want to say on this
this is something to me that's sad
have a good day
i appreciate the conversation
the general topic is hobbies
let's see
i guess it's more not so much a hobby but things i enjoy doing
i enjoy playing basketball and basically all kinds of sports
not really
i around with my hands and things like that
i think i'm in handicraft
i hate to think about it
i'm getting rather good at reading want ads
what kind of time frame is it looking for the different shifts up there
is it
of
i'm sure the numbers somewhere classified
some of the internal news and the news services
it's approximately six fifty
ten percent of six fifty is sixty-five
twenty percent would be one thirty
that's unfortunate
is it many other corporations in the area
i saw seven eleven that was hiring
i think it went to lockheed didn't it
i hear they're hiring all over the place for that
that has some opportunities
None
m c i coming if telemarketing is your bag
you in the computer operations or in the actual manufacturing
i'm a defense worker
i took a leave of t i back in november
it was purely by my own choice
there was no incentive for myself to leave
it was just an opportunity arose
decided to take it
you didn't even get the severance package
i should have taken the option when that was there
it was just i missed it by a couple months
what can one do
are you happy with what you are doing now
as you get to know more of the people that work there and more of what's going on with the system
i was in the computer operations
it all starts to become similar
there's benefits
there's things that weren't as good
as an overall package i'd say i'm pretty happy so far with the way it's turned out
it hasn't been a long time t i
i'm significantly shaken by the situation
the one thing i guess at least in your favor is the fact that that is more in the support of the manufacturing
there's lots and lots of companies that have maybe not in the defense area but manufacturing in general
to tell you the truth i'm not really worried
i seem rather happy about it most of the time
just to know what's possibilities are
what might happen
still in all
i know a number of people who are surplused
they're just
despite the fact that i should be tying flies or fly fishing or going for walks in the mountains
i'm sure it's just with
i doubt i'll be here in six months
would you like to be there
even somewhere better
god this is much better than west texas
just take the day
they tell me hell is much better than west texas
my little brother lives in austin right now
that's a beautiful place
once you pick that spot out pick out what you want to do
now i feel lost
it takes a bit of a shift doesn't it
i had job offers
the best thing about it is that you can try something
had you been with t i long when you changed
there's a noticeable difference there
i can imagine the longer and longer it goes
yeah
momentum is driving force in our lives
i'm looking as a opportunity
that's good
i'm looking at it as a change
i'm looking at it as an adventure
maybe i'll wet a fly line this year and do some camping if i don't get laid off between now and then
how about we end this
what's the
None
they just started it again too just late or within the past few years
for quite some time just about every one of the states had given up the death penalty
now it's coming back into favor
they find it is more deterrent
my sociology class at s m u's taught us that it was not a deterrent
that's just what they said
i don't know maybe if i went back and took a sociology class now they'd say it is a deterrent
if you
compare the figures i think that's where they're coming from
that was back in the seventies
they are
that was before they adopted the death law again
i myself am in favor of it particularly for crimes murders related with drugs or killing a policemen
i think it ought to be expanded to include children
i think they're working on something in austin now
i'm not sure what it is
i just remember seeing a kind of a synopsis of it
why stop at children
i'm personally very in favor of it
why should we let them set in prison and work on their college degrees after they've mowed down a class yard full of kids or tried to or given their best effort at doing that
i don't care to support them
i don't either
there is something to be said about
just for the sake of argument i'm taking a con
i'm against it
yourself how many times have you heard where a citizen was wrongfully arrested
and served time at a penitentiary
just recently this black man served nine years was it
there was the black woman that robbed and shot the furrier
she was set free too just in two examples in texas recently
then they decided it was a case of mistaken identity or something
None
i know what you're
that's not one of those things that you can turn the wheel back and reverse everything
right now our laws are so liberal that even with the death penalty in effect i don't think that
give them all a shot get rid of them
why should they be sitting in prison getting their college degree
i guess though where i would have a problem with it if i were on the jury that handed down the death sentence because it was my judgement the person's guilty
everyone agree that the death penalty's the way to go
to be the actual one of the ones that decide that would be tougher for me
i agree with you there
we could never say what we would do if we're not in the circumstance
that's a real easy thing to say that sure i would
i don't know
i myself wouldn't want to be on the jury like that
that's an awful lot to expect of a person to kill somebody is what it amounts to
that's what they did
they did it because they have a warped mind for some reason
rather than have a warped mind it was just the only way to get whatever they wanted
they wanted something more than they respect the human life
anyhow i guess we both agree that it should be in effect
also i agree there should be a lot of care in the enforcement
i guess i would say i want it to be in effect
i want
i have a problem with this too
that's true
just believe in just about any state in the union a death verdict is an automatic appeal
yes
there's some
maybe
not just for dealing in drugs
what's the ru-
i don't remember what they are
they're on the distribution end
they are in effect killing people
yes
i believe it's any capital crime related to drugs
i
is it proposed
is it passed
i wouldn't swear to it myself
i thought it was in effect
i have to agree with that
i think it certainly should be one of the options
i've been fortunate with my children and grandchildren so far that i know
you never know
to the best of my knowledge we haven't had a major problem yet
it just touches so many young people
it does
i have four sons myself
the youngest is twenty-eight
they are all pretty well grown up
they all went through it going through high school and everything
knock wood that they have not
i won't say they didn't try it
they
i doubt very much that they're using it now
my children are about in the same age bracket
the youngest is probably twenty-seven twenty-eight
it's the same age bracket
there's four two girls and two boys
i think one of each experimented very slightly with pot
i think that was the extent of it to the best of my knowledge
it's just try it out with their peers
none of them even smoke
they don't
strangely enough their mother and i both smoked when they were growing up
now my ex-wife she quit
she never started up again
i just quit about fourteen months and two weeks ago
it seems to be getting tougher as time goes by
he knows he has to
he knows he should
he knows
he knows
he hasn't
he's very conscious of passive smoking
he's concerned about it but
when i was still smoking i felt that way
if i was in a public restaurant seated at table with non smokers i would try to pick my seat where the smoke would blow away from them
i'd hold the cigarette under the table
now the shoe's on the other foot
i'm aware of other people smoking now
charles will not smoke in anyone else's house except our own
he'll go outside
he's
when we're invited to people's house he will not smoke in their house which i think is good because there's a lot of people that are very
he tries his best
the actual quitting he hasn't done
he will not smoke in a comfortable position
how neat
every time i wanted one i have to go outside and just take one one at a time
that gets to be a deterrent
i can very clearly remember ten years ago i was just beginning to explore computerizing my office and trying to find out what kinds of computers might be useful
we did end up with i b m p c which i now would not have chosen
that was before the macintosh
twenty years ago i was in graduate school pecking out a dissertation on a manual typewriter
i know it
i would say that's one of the largest changes at least in my life
i've seen that just in the last even five years how much they've increased in use probably eight years
when i was a freshman in college my degree was in computer technology originally
it seemed like it would
they were just getting out with the disks and all that getting away with the cards
doing away with the programming cards
thirty years ago i had a college job working as a programmer
we had to write code in binary
and have it punched in on those little cardboard cards
i think t v has a lot to do with the changes too don't you in people's attitudes
very possibly
i'm not sure in the last ten years it's been very different from before
certainly in the last thirty i would say there have been significant changes even the change from black and white to color television
i sure didn't have access to one
twenty years ago practically everybody had a color t v
now i think they're almost as many
it's close to getting one t v per person they say
now everybody has v c r and two or three v c r and that kind of thing
certainly ten years ago v c r were just coming on the market
that's made a significant difference in the way i watch television for instance
now i almost never watch a t v program when it's on
that way i don't have to worry about being interrupted
you can flip through the commercials
you don't have to watch the commercials
that's always convenient
what was our question about decline in socio-
i think they just said the social changes in the united states
i can't really remember back that far
car phones is a good point and cellular phones of all types and beepers
i had to carry a beeper around
they were kind of bulky
all they did was just make a beep noise
you had to go find a telephone and call in to find out what they wanted you for and who you were supposed to call
they fit in your shirt pocket
they have a little display screen that shows you a message and either tells you a person or a phone number to respond to
they have the kind that just vibrates so you can shut them off
you can still get your messages
let's see social changes
where do you think it's going to go in twenty years
i was just thinking though about a huge social change in the last ten years is aids
i know that because i was writing a paper about it
i was writing a journal article
they still didn't even know what caused it or anything
there was a suspicion
nobody had identified it
they were really just going on epidemiological
guesswork because the way it was transmitted made it look an awful lot like hepatitis
from the spread pattern of hepatitis they could work backwards to the transmission by blood and semen
i
i'm curious what was your graduate study in
i was in english as a matter of fact and medieval studies
i went to work as an editor and writer
ten years ago i was working in the medical center publishing a journal and writing about medical topics
let's see twenty years ago i guess we were just beginning to get into what they were calling the sex revolution after the pill
freed people up from worries about illegitimate pregnancy
i guess in the seventies is the time when that was supposed to have exploded
you think that's caused a lot of pressure on younger kids today
i have
i know that the expectation for them was to have sex and much earlier
they certainly didn't expect everybody to
it was really only acceptable if you were engaged and planning to get married in the relatively near future
i certainly know from talking to my stepdaughter that girls in high school were under a whole lot more pressure nowadays
it's kind of scary when i think of what will happen in twenty years when i have kids and they're grown and
i guess the answer
is stay flexible because nobody can predict what's going to happen in twenty years
i certainly wouldn't have been able to twenty years ago tell you what my kids were likely to be like
course one of them was just a brand new baby twenty years ago
some of the other ones weren't born
sounds like america's going to become even more communication society with faxes and cellular phones and worldwide communication
that's made a difference in the way i do my job because it's so much easier to get hold of people and get quick answers to things
even
it was used as kind of an extreme emergency nowadays people use fed ex all the time
sure do
i was almost thirty before i got off this continent
both my kids had been abroad when they were still in high school
i know that's what my family was talking when i picked up and moved to texas from indiana
they were like thirty years ago we wouldn't have done that
especially come home every couple months
None
what do you think are some current trends in the way families spend time together based on what you've seen
i think that it's getting to where they're not spending time together
i think like in my situation today on a weekend when couples are supposed to spend time together my husband's been off doing his thing all day today
i've been off doing my thing all day
i haven't seen him since eight o'clock this morning
two years
same situation here i've been married about ten months
i know what you mean
it's really hard to find time to spend together when you both work full time and you both have hobbies that are different
if you have hobbies that are the same then you can enjoy your hobby together
my husband and i have different hobbies
he was off today looking at records
i was off doing household type things
laundry
did some shopping and stuff
from the people i've talked to i don't know if i should bring this into it
a lot of the dads said that they would probably choose careers where they could manage their own schedule
they could spend more time with their kids
they look back
they're all kind of regretful i think
i think that would be the ideal situation
like in my case i do shift work
i don't have that choice
i have to be at work at a certain hour
it's not flexible
it would be nice to be able to have flexible hours
maybe after we decide to have kids i might find a job that has flexible hours
i hope so anyway
i don't know
some of the people that i work with when i worked on second shift their kids go to school during the day
they wouldn't see them at night
because they would be at work and the kids are all ready in bed
so it was kind of like they see their kids for fifteen minutes and the same with their spouses
this relative may work even a weirder shift like weekends or something
it was really sad that a lot of families have to have dual income
then the kids kind of suffer
it would be nice to be able to just have back in the old days
back when i grew up
the mom stayed home and raised the kids
she was there pretty much all my formative years
that was nice
i liked that
i would hope that i would be able to give that to my kids
i think with the way the future is economy wise
do you think the parents spend quality time with their kids
do you think it's more watching t v and stuff like that not really
i think very few spend quality time
i think most of the time the kids are usually off watching cartoons or playing video games or stuff like that
i think that most kids that i see they don't really value quality time
until they're older
they look back
it's true
what are some other questions they have
they spent a lot of time outside with us and stuff
my dad had his own business
it was easier for them to do that
i don't know
i guess i didn't realize what a luxury it was at the time
i think kids now a days are raised on t v
t v a surrogate parent
not a very good one at that
if you had kids what kind of things do you hope to do
i hope to of course be able to teach them right from wrong
i hope to be able to spend their growing up years being in the home not having to work
being able to do
i know a lot of people who
they do a lot of volunteer work
they're real active in the community
they do a lot of things with their kids that they wouldn't ordinarily be able to do if they were working
i'd like to be able to do that
i think that's for the few and far between
i think that probably ninety percent of the parents out there are probably working parents
i don't really see that trend changing much
there's going to be fewer and fewer single income families
what's sad about that is day cares end up instilling values in your kids
i don't even know what day care is really all about because i never went to a day care center
i never had that kind of experience
i don't even think we had
it seems like that's a big trend in the last ten years
day cares have popped up and become a lot bigger part of the kids' lives
sure is
i think this is a good closing point
it was really nice talking to you
that's me
you haven't
now i really
i get so angry about what goes on
i feel like i can't really complain too much unless
the problem is that i am very liberal politically
i hardly ever have anybody that wins that i vote for
what do you mean by liberal
i'm pretty left wing democrat
i don't know anything about politics
you don't
what's the main difference between republicans and democrats
democrats on a lot of issues are more liberal than republicans
None
i think back in the times when my political opinions were being formed during the vietnam war and stuff
the republicans were more what they called hawks which is more aggressive in war and more pro war
the democrats were the doves
i'm not sure how much that holds true anymore
i think the issues are
you vote for the democrats
democrats usually are more supportive of public assistance programs
programs to
the big republican thing is that they vote for less government
they're less apt to vote in more aid to people
they're less apt to vote in programs that involve the government running things
have you ever voted at all
i know i
i don't know that much about it
i don't feel like i have enough knowledge on it
that's what they need
they said something to improve voting
to me i didn't know what would have been wrong with
i think it was that woman
was that reagan
that's what i mean
i didn't know what the difference between dukakis and bush was
i didn't know anything about bush or dukakis
what do you think about what you see on t v about them like in the news or on the ads
they're all saying that they're going to do whatever is best for their campaign anyway
know in school they didn't teach you about the government
before they used to have a lot of
it seems like the stuff that they put out now it doesn't just seem like it
i know for a fact that any kind of stuff that if you wrote and asked for material
what do you believe in
they kind of say what do you want me to believe
they word it so that it's really hard to tell where they're standing on certain issues
i'm not sure they're
like with the abortion issues and stuff
that's kind of how i judge
let me see
i try to look at
newspaper articles can show how they voted in the past
you get
like i said most of the politicians i'm
everybody's got stuff they don't want known
i didn't have much knowledge
that's okay
do you think
what would it take
god this is really good actually for to talk to somebody who hasn't voted
what kind of
what kind of stuff would you like them to do so that you would know more about it
i'm sure they've got it at the library
if i get to the library
do you
i don't know
do you feel like it's not really going to make that much difference if you don't vote
i know if enough people think like that it would make a difference
a lot of people they'll vote the way their family votes
since you're what democrat
then your kids or whatever will follow you and just vote democrat
not in my family
None
a lot of families do that
that kind of keeps from getting a lot of issues resolved
i lie
like i said if i voted for bush
like when gary hart was running
i didn't think that was right because he may have been a good president or whatever
it
it just threw him out of the whole running
a lot of people go by their personal life when they vote
i
i think that doesn't really have that much to do with unless they've done something really horrible
criminal or something like that's different
what effect does that have on him running for president
we really don't see the true person anyway
i think that's having a big effect on how poorly that the country is being run is that the people that want to get elected are turning it into a popularity contest by advertising the things
see they're trying to find an excuse not to deal with the issues that people really want to know about because on those issues you have to say yes or no
if they don't say yes or no then
they just try and make it a personal thing
if you remember any of the t v commercials from the last presidential campaign they all had pictures of bush walking around with his grandchildren
even from reagan it looks like a mcdonald's commercial
what did you think of reagan as a president
they just kind of sat him up there like a puppet
the people that were
i think there's a lot of the economic problems that the country was having at the time and the recession and stuff
he actually
that was
i just couldn't get over the fact that reagan beat him
that i just couldn't believe that he got voted out
i think i wasn't
let's see
i was only fifteen or sixteen
i remember carter
i liked him
he is really active still politically
do you use credit cards
not very often
i usually
the ones we use is visa
we always try to pay it back at the end of the month
i have
so it doesn't get the credit
otherwise you end up paying so much more for your merchandise that it's not a very good idea
i have a lot of them
i don't use them very much though
the other thing i think if you do get overextended a little bit you need to be sure and pay it off more than one at a time because i think you could run forever paying what they require
i think a lot of people go in debt because they think i can just charge it
really if they don't have the money then they aren't going to have it in a month
they make the mistake of
when it's very useful
like emergency trip
sometimes when you
it's not immediately handy
i think they're very helpful plus the fact that it's helpful not to have to carry a lot of money sometimes
you really do need to be very responsible about it
you end up in deep trouble
that's kind of like
after that i decided i'm not going to use them at all and just try to pay cash for everything
that worked for a while
we got married
we decided if we used them we would pay them off as we go
the other thing about them is too you really need to get some and use them because if you have never used them and haven't developed a credit thing it stops you from doing a lot of things
if you pay for everything by cash there is a lot of things that a lot of people who will not give you credit when you need something like a house or
they have become a very vital part of our monetary system
it's true
you have to be very careful or you end up going in the deep end
an awful lot of people are in trouble
we have a boy living with us who works for a credit card company that
he makes calls to people who have problems credit problems
it's a really big problem i think and takes mature people to treat it
so that it's a real advantage to you instead of a disadvantage
i think the way the tax system was they encouraged people to use credit cards with a big write off at the end of the year
now it's punch money because
even before it probably wasn't though because you didn't get to claim anywhere near what you ended up paying
i'm not
do you exercise regularly
i ride a bicycle quite a bit and work out with free weights
i try to ride about ten to twenty miles a day
that's good
i haven't been doing so well this year
last year i went an was exercising on a bike for a while
when i'd gotten back i had gotten some sun that day
that's weird
i don't exercise now
i exercised real good for a couple of years
it was running three nights a week
what's your motivation
what's my motivation
she would push
she wouldn't take no for an answer
i just wanted to look good
i'm not big or anything
i'm not in great shape
when i worked out i got in pretty good shape
what was the other question
do you enjoy working out
i think i enjoy it sometimes
there's other times when i just get tired of it
i feel like i'm obligated to do it because i've been doing it
i should keep up
there's some days it's the hardest thing in the world to get started
how old are you
i'm twenty-seven
you're still young
if you keep working out when you're young though when you get older your body's not going to look as bad
she looked so good
she was standing just as straight and tall
she had a small waist
she didn't have
she didn't have that at all
her lips were a little bit wide
a lot of
back in her time they liked women with big hips anyway she may be keeping that on purpose
i notice if you stay in shape you don't age as bad
i go to school too at night
last semester i had stopped working out 'cause i hurt myself and started smoking a lot
you just
smoking ages you quick
you can't
it just kind of feeds itself
you don't work out because you
i smoke a pack a day
i finally quit because all i was doing was going down hill fast
i was telling a friend of mine that i'd be almost as bad as being an alcoholic
as soon as i had them right back to it
it was like
i don't want to quit smoking
did you ever go to one of those health clubs or anything
now i work out at home because my schedule with school and work i don't have time to get down to one
i actually prefer to work out alone
i need competition is what i need
i don't want to do anything
i wouldn't mind working out with a friend and stuff
when you get into some of health clubs where you just stand around and wait
i like to start get it done and get out of there
get your girlfriend to work out with you
he works as a laborer on the railroad
he's building his muscles up all day
he don't gain it like i do
especially having a kid i guess tends to just gain weight because you have to to
you can gain too much weight
i looked
i got about fifty pounds overweight with him
i didn't loose it until two years ago
i got pregnant and ruined that
like i say it ain't as bad this time because i was in shape when i got pregnant
i wasn't overweight when i got pregnant with him
i just wasn't in shape
i
working out and fitness
i like to work out to look good and stay in shape
i know it's good for me
people that live for it and eat a bunch of different pills and
that's what my friend did
she was with the wheat germ and all the vitamins and everything else
really we was
even with her taking all those expensive vitamins and stuff
developing and everything
you can take those
i was trying to say hemorrhoids
i was trying to say hormones
i stay from that crap
None
as soon as he stopped working out he just ballooned out
he just
just that's how it affected him
he i don't know just
i've been wanting to get me a bike
i like to move a little faster and cover more ground
i would think it would be hard on your legs and your joints and stuff
it's hard on women
it just makes stuff move down
i like jogging
i can't
i love to run in the rain
just be careful not to slide
you can't ride your bike at all in the rain can you
when i did ride my friends bike that one time i don't know what i was trying to do
i never could make a u turn in a bike
i tried to do it on that ten speed and wrecked
i told her a dog was chasing me
i wrecked it into the curb
i scratched it on the
None
it's been nice talking to you
good luck with the new kid
she's good
have fun exercising
we've got quite a few
we've actually had some warnings in raleigh on air pollution
you mean for smog and stuff
we have a belt line around raleigh where we're trying to divert traffic
it's just surrounding the city
you can actually see it
there's a couple of tall buildings in raleigh
you can actually
what it is is the pollution
what do you think of the greenhouse effect that's going on
i guess that's the fluorocarbons and
we're even feeling the effects of the weather from the shift in the jet stream
it is scary though isn't it
the last two years our winters have been absolutely nothing
maybe one snow
all right
north carolina is all the way on the east coast
it's right below virginia
kentucky's next to virginia i'm pretty sure
i'm from kentucky
kentucky we use to have just real cold cold winters we'd have three and four feet of snow
amarillo
that's close to here
i've been out of texas about ten years
how old are you
twenty seven
we're the same age
that's okay
i think it's just something that goes with the territory
to me texas and kentucky we had to have ice on the ground for them to close school
in texas if it gets cold and it looks like it's going to rain i swear they close everything down
i do
they get
traffic slows down to nothing
they've been doing the same thing here
it's kind of funny
i guess northerners are different
even north carolinians they don't know how to handle cold weather
no northe-
that's why i said in kentucky we
of course the people down in south they're not used to cold weather and stuff
every time they have snow
you can have snow on the ground and not be slick on the road
not to see it
of course t i is here oscar mayer there is a few factories
i don't see much pollution going on
what irks me is these cars that are driving down the road
you have that black smoke coming from their tail pipe
see they have a test or something like that they call it
i'll tell you what
even these buses lord it real bad these buses in raleigh
school buses are notorious
they're burning that diesel fuel is what it is
it gets bad
you know what they've started doing is instead of the tail pipes being at the bottom of those buses they've started putting them up at the top
that's a good idea
that way it gets above other cars on the road it really does make a difference although it settles
if you're going to be jogging on the side of the road that's even more miserable
i'd have to go out to the country to jog
the pregnant women aren't supposed to walk along a highway because of that smoke fumes
i was walking back and forth toc-
not back and forth
i was walking home from the college i was going to in kentucky
i was having to walk along the highway
it was in
i have no sense of smell
i couldn't smell this
it would make me sick
i'd be real tired anyway just from walking along the highway
golly that's bad
all the exhaust
that was four years ago too
i'm sure
you can really feel it in your breathing even normal people
if you're older you can really deplete your oxygen
it'll pass out
it's killed several people
do you smoke
i just smoke one in the evening if that
i'm a very very light smoker
they were doing some ozone testing the e p a
they were just screening some candidates
i don't think i'd ever do that
they asked me if i was a smoker
i didn't fit into the smoker's category
i didn't fit into the nonsmoker's category
i was just one of those yeah
that kind of threw them off
they're doing a lot of research here the e p a
for ozone and all that
they're real big into it
they're just doing a lot of stuff
course texas we don't have a bunch of pollution
too we've got that air coming in off the coast
it'd blow it up north
maybe that's part of the reason it's not so bad down here
it would seem like it would be the same way on the california coastline wouldn't it
gosh i think i would hate to live in california the smog there
i can't believe they have warnings here which it's mainly just when it gets real real hot
they usually have that everywhere because of the humidity especially
that's kind of good to know
lord i thought i lived in a halfway decent area
especially it's usually for the young children and older old people
you ought to come to north carolina
here they've got the mountains the beach the trees
they've got streams rivers ponds
this is pretty wooded area down here
in a lot of parts
down by the denison dam there's a lot of
you go where
down by lake texoma there's a bunch of wooded area
kentucky's beautiful
trees are supposed to purify
i'm going to have to get some
my husband bought it for me when my daughter was born four months ago
did you smoke when you were pregnant
i can understand that
i've got one vice
smoking is it
i don't drink
i try not to cuss
i do very little
and smoking i got in the habit of it when i was about thirteen
one thing i miss is the people from texas are
i wasn't saved until i got down here
people down here are just
it's so different from kentucky
i worked at t i for a while
then my brother-in-law works there
he got me into it
i see
i was taking a voice i o class and actually doing some research
they told me about this project
it's fun
a couple of times i've been interrupted by my little girl
i enjoy it
i talked to people from what carolina now up in boston and new york
boston is new york isn't it
i've talked to people in new york
i've talked to a lot of people in texas
i guess it's because t i down here
i had one call actually from charlotte north carolina and virginia and
i love the boston accent
we went from kentucky to louisiana down here to texas
his family's down here
i bet you're glad
he got out of his unit right after panama
he went to panama when noriega was doing all that
he
it seems to me that
i do not know whether the jury system
i should not say i do not know
i do not feel very stronger that the jury system should be changed
it seems to have worked time immemorial
when difficult decisions are made they generally prove out to be right by things that occur later on
i know in some cases now in some states depending on the criminal code a unanimous verdict is not required
indeed some juries are no longer twelve people
they are down to as small as six people
i think that the judges should be left to do most of the sentencing simply because there is always a jury that might be
on the other hand justices are more apt to understand the prison crowding problems and things like that
is that a reflection then of what is really happening in the real world
if they keep giving everybody hundred year sentences and the people in various states it does not seem that people want to be taxed to build more prisons or even for that matter repair the lack of judges and other
i think the judges are trying to save the people from having to
that might be it
they certainly
None
the people cannot afford it
i don't know how it is in virginia
in florida now someone was just sentenced to eighteen years without any specific recommendation for waving the normal procedures
the eighteen years will translate into something like four point seven if the prisoner is a model prisoner
indeed the present overcrowding conditions prevail
i guess there was some credit for time this guy had already spent in jail waiting for trial
yeah
i do not know
it just seems to me that only about ten percent of the cases come for trial anyway
only about four or five percent of
in the very end
less than half the cases that go to trial end up with the jury actually making the verdict
that most of it is plea bargained half way through
most of the cases are plea bargained anyway
how do you feel about the jury system itself
do you think that should be changed
do you know in virginia if they have smaller juries
i do not know exactly what the size of the juries
i know one of my friends was brought up for jury duty
he only heard very piddly type cases
most of it was robberies or things like that
apparently even for the smallest crimes they give the person any felony anyways
i guess we
they give the person the option for a jury
i guess we always focus on criminal trials with the jury
i know you have a right to ask for a jury in any sort of a case that even where damages are the result of some sort of an action that you are bringing against someone else you can ask for that to be heard before a jury
i do not know
i should imagine virginia from what i read is like every other state
it is faced with enormous costs to maintain the jury system and the prison system and the entire trial system
i guess
there is no budget for them i guess
and the courthouse that goes with them and the bailiffs and the
it seems
i do not think i would change it
the more i verbalize it i do not think i would want to change the system
i do not think i would either
it does seem like the purpose of getting people in jail so that the
the deterrent
for people to not to commit the crime is sort of gone away
people that
yet there are so many people in prison
the prison population as far as i
my impression of it is that it has doubled in the last ten years and tripled in the last twenty
i guess our population has grown some too
there definitely is to me one of the worst things that could ever happen from what i read and see and understand
i do no think i could handle prison
it would be very difficult
i would be interested in finding out what the percentage of drug related type things are
there must be
there again i do not know if the jury system itself comes in to play there
of course it is a constitutional right that the press must have here is the interviewing of jurors after the trial
it seems to me that when a jury makes a decision they should not be asked before television cameras and newspaper reporters how they reached that decision
i do not
i imagine there is a certain right of the press to have the ability to ask that
i would think if i did anything i would protect the juror from any sort of an inquisition after
i know
on the other hand though when after the barry trial
up here the big local trial as well as national
i was there during the trial actually
the opposite was true of me
after the case was over i was like somebody get ahold of these people and find out why in the world did they vote the way they did
it was like a picture is not good enough
just because you feel like he was being kicked on which he certainly was
i
i felt that way
i felt
it does not matter
i always balanced in the situation
i remember the jurors
i thought to myself how did
one count
i think they only found him guilty on one count which was a class something felony which was not even punishable
to the degree that they thought it
i do not know
maybe when you are there in the courtroom yourself and you are sitting there and you have got to make a judgment on somebody
i am not making excuses for
it has been nice talking to you
the topic today was gardening
we are about to hit it in few minutes
that is all we have been doing all weekend
we bought a large house that was completely unlandscaped
we hired a professional landscaper to do it
i have since then probably ripped out half of what he has done because it has always been incorrectly planted
the plants do not make the winter time
i am kind of at this point getting a little bit broke and deciding that what we are going to do is we are just going to struggle through the rest of this year
probably through the fall too and
rip out all the rest of these junipers or anything that requires more care than i am willing to give the kids and replace it with hollies
how many kids do you have
they are just eighteen months apart so it seems like a lot more
how old are they
i have got a four year old and a four month old and an eight year old stepdaughter
i have a twenty six year old stepson
i do not know if that counts
you do not have to tend to him
i did for many years
you did
back to gardening
are you one of these howard garrett organic enthusiasts or a
it is like i will get out there and pull my weeds
i do have half of it is a flower bed
the porch is pretty big
just pulling all the weeds out of that just drives me nuts
i just went out this weekend
i just plowed through the whole nine yards
when the blooms died the leaves were just horrible looking
i just broke all them off
they are
the leaves i do not like them
once
are you sure they are hyacinths
that is a bulb
you should of just ripped the whole thing out
because i like the plant in the spring
i just cut the leaves off and transplant and put some other plants down because i want them to come back up next year
let me tell you they do not come back very well at all
maybe they will up further north
you are not that much further north
of everything
i have done hyacinths
i have just learned from doing hyacinths that if you really like them what you do is you dig the bulbs up and then you throw them away after they are done blooming because they do not take the heat here
if they do come back next year they are going to look real puny
they will
about the only bulb that repeats well in my area is the daffodil and some of the narcissus bulb
i have got some daffodils
everybody down here calls these flags the irises i guess
they get just one bloom on the plant
i am not sure what they are called
i do not much
when does it bloom
i think they are stopped blooming now in the spring
what color
they come in all different colors
you only get one of them
per bulb
i do not know what i have called them
when i come down here everybody told me they are flags
what i bet you they are
i am a pretty good gardener
i have killed a lot of things here
and i have planted a lot of them
i work on a landscape committee for our neighborhood
our neighborhood is a planned development with i think it is seven hundred and fifty-five families
we have about sixty acres that we have to plant
i will get
what color is yours blooming
i have got some in the backyard that bloomed blue which i would have liked those in the front because they match my porch and stuff better and then some on the side of the house with the dusty purple color with little purple spots that it will fade into a solid purple
what does the foliage look like
it looks almost like a hyacinth only a lot higher
it is a bulb
i bet you what those things are is a dutch iris
on the flower does it have a beard on it at all any kind of fuzzies
i really do not know
None
i was just going to correct myself
they would have bloomed pretty early
i took and just mowed over them last year
we have been
i do not much care for them
to me it just looks like a bunch of leaves
i took them out of my front yard
i just threw them on the side intending to transplant them or throw them away or something
i went out there this spring
they had took root right where they were on top of each other
they told me that they are the hardest things
they are real easy to grow
then it is not a dutch iris then
i am not sure what it is
they call them flags down here
i am not so sure that texans know what they have got
i am just getting into gardening this year
we moved here a year ago
we moved in this house may of last year
it was really too late to do much
who
i have probably got a big circular driveway
the whole perimeter bordering the house is all in texas wildflower beds
i am into that
it looks quite formal
it really does
that is
it has been about three or four years of playing around with flowers to decide which ones actually grow here
what kind of blue
i want blue and purple and just different shades of that my house is gray
blue looks so pretty against it
blue is hard
i would like to have one that would bloom next year too
now the plant itself will grow about eighteen inches tall
it will send out a flower spike
you can get them in the nursery
that is where i went this year
i waited too late to really plant stuff
i did not know that these hyacinths
i did not know the hyacinths were going to die
the nursery men will sell you things here
they are kind of in a labor of love
the other thing to do if you really like the hyacinths is that before you plant those bulbs stick them in the refrigerator for five weeks or so to cool them
i had bought these
they will not grow down here
that will bloom all summer long
it insists on full sun
i guess i just went and bought me just about nineteen dollars worth of little buds already grown
it looks pretty good out there
it is kind of a purply blue red
it's not
it will take the heat down here
its proper name is gomphrena
is sold as purple buddy or sometimes sold as straw flower
they make about a foot high plant
they send out this spike that has this purple ball on the top of it
that purple ball
wayne i feel very strongly about parents doing things with their children and making time available even sometimes when time isn't available
i've two kids right now one is two and a half
one's nine months
that age of course everything you do they're trying to learn to do
it's important for you to spend time doing the things that you want them to learn that they need to learn at the age reading and playing nice with others and that sort of thing
i've always tried to do things with them like when you're at the little league helping out even though i'm not a good athlete myself
i was able to help the coach in just controlling the kids if nothing else
we've always tried to take our children and now at this age our grandchildren to see and do things that otherwise they might not be able to
it's
we have lived several places around the u s
where we've lived we've taken them to see and do things of interest and of historical significance in the area
when we lived in tennessee we took them to washington d c to see all the capitol and things like that when they were small
it's helps i think the children when they're learning in school to say i've been there and i've seen that
that's the type
it certainly does because the things in the books seem so dead to the kids unless they've actually been there or whatever
i remember our family we went everywhere
seeing new england and being on plymouth rock and stuff like that really made the whole thing more visual
we could read the things in the history books and understand what they said when it was like we need to raise food quickly because this place gets very cold very soon
i made a special effort with my children to do things like that
even now with my grandchildren i feel it's a very important thing to be done
because if kids don't look up to you or can't feel they can spend time with you they're going to find someone else nowadays there's a lot of people out there that you don't want your kid emulating or whatever
i can remember one of the things i'm most proud of is when my son was
they had to write a little brief autobiography of themselves and about what they had done and what they wanted to do
i was very proud when my son wrote that he wanted to have a family and be able to help coach little league and do things like his dad had done with him
it sounds like we both have colds
it's ten o'clock here in falls church virginia
that the only reason i'm home is because i'm home with a cold
we're
the wife says you need something to do
i'm sitting here on the ninth floor of an office building on the north side of dallas texas
we're kind of far apart here
this is a very interesting program i heard about here on this
when i signed up for it it looked like it could make a real contribution in participating
i'm an electrical engineer by trade here in virginia
likewise we do some projects every now and then
we like to get support from other companies as well
trying to work myself out of a job
it's been an interesting roughly nine months here
this is our home area
it's
we've lived up north for a while in chicago and over in tennessee
wound up back about two hundred miles away from where we started out
that's about all i can think to talk about right now
you live in dallas
i understand that the real estate market out there has really gone crazy up and down up and down
i think right now it's kind of bad
are you in a house
i guess the best i can do is compare apartments
with the one that i had the last time the one that i have now has a lot more amenities than the one that i moved out of
this one gave us free cable and ceiling fans
it was practically new when i moved in here
the carpet was new
it's just a two story building
there are a lot of buildings
it's just two stories
on the second floor they don't have a patio
they have a sunroom instead of the patio
on the first floor where i am there's a patio
you have one floor all to yourself
let's see i have two bedrooms
that's nice
i have a washer and dryer area
i did buy the washer and dryer
they didn't provide it
the one that i moved from didn't have a place to put them
that's one of the reasons that i did move
tell me ab-
i've always been pretty lucky
the prices came down last year
we had sort of like a dallas syndrome
the past year and a half prices have gone down which is totally new for northern virginia
it's a real good
it's really surprising everybody
we actually have our house on the market because we have two kids have a three bedroom house
it's pretty much filled up right now
you want a bigger one
right now it's just a single level rambler
one thing about the houses in dallas they don't utilize basements the way they did in new york
my parents in new york had a three family house
two family house where the downstairs and the second floor they had
they rented the third floor with the whole apartment
they had a basement
they finished the basement
they were able to rent that out also
in dallas i just haven't seen basements in houses
i've looked at a lot of them
that's what he said was that it just wasn't something that people had down there
but no basements
i have yet to see a basement in a house
i don't see that kind of sand here
there are some areas though where they have a problem with the houses kind of sinking a little bit to the
the foundation is sinking or something just a little bit some more than others
you have to know the right spot
to pick where that doesn't happen
out here we live in what used to be a prairie or whatever a natural grasslands
they
fourteen inches you get to sandstone
any place where they put a basement in they had to blast
anywhere near virginia beach
my folks used to live there
different areas in dallas have different kind
in texas i'll say
down in east texas there's a lot of red clay
in the dallas fort worth city areas you don't see that
texas is a big state
i imagine the type of houses and things like that are truly different from area to area
for example we live fifteen miles from the beltway that surrounds washington anything instead the highway the real estate's forty thousand dollars more expensive
i could never afford a house inside the beltway
this is called the country with only maybe twenty miles total from d c twenty-five from the city
it's considered the country since it's that far out
yeah
it's still pretty rural
not too much of northern virginia is like that anymore
is your house in an area by itself
there's another one a quarter acre away rather
they're not connected are they
you have to stay in one single family home
my folks had an apartment for a while when we were kids
for the most part they always had
pennsylvania always had a single family home
as soon as we could we got a single family home
that's all i ever knew growing up
i stayed in a townhouse for two years and then saved up enough money to get a
i'm in richardson texas
i'm in plano
here we go
i guess we're going to have a lot of parades this weekend in honor of these guys that did some stuff over in the gulf
did you push one
i think it's
i don't know too much about it
i just wanted to see if you had an opinion about this
None
if that's okay with you then i'll just press one
good morning
if i start this i just wanted to say that one of the things that i don't think we really understood about the middle eastern situation is that they're a totally different type of people than we are
they think differently
their idea of what is justice is totally different from ours
right now i think that that's been proven in the fact that they have just
i just think that the united states policy over there
i really do in a major way because that whole region over there i think needs to settle it's own differences within itself
that's the course that they should go
we can maybe help them a little bit prompt them
i don't think this intervention at such high levels should be going on
the thing with israel and palestine i believe that should be settled between them
also the other thing is our idea of democracy has nothing to do with them
i'm talking about the whole middle ea-
maybe this is too general
i just believe that they do not look at democracy the same way we do
trying to put a square peg in a round hole is just
i don't think that that's the way to go in this
that's a couple thoughts on it
i guess i'd like you to maybe express something here
i think overall that's right
i-
i think that
true we do have completely different ways of looking at a lot of things
at the same time i think there is a lot of good that the united states and other countries can do as far as example
None
i guess we could be a catalyst for their change
i don't think we'd be talking about this unless there had been a war
that was one thing
i don't judge any war as good or bad
i don't see any winners or losers
i'm sorry
i just think you're right
i think maybe it's at a whole different level of them trying to cooperate and get along
it's not going to be that we're going to sort of tell them to go to their room
that's going to solve the whole problem
that's the type of thing they understand
None
at that you have to work at their level
that's true too
they wouldn't have understood anything than what we did in the war
yeah
they understand violence
they love violent leaders to
look at the leader they had
they just adored him
for a while there he had them be-
it has a lot to do with their religion
that over there
i know this only because from personal experience that i'm speaking of this
i've traveled around town with different cab drivers in a situation where i've done that
one of the kindest people i've ever met in my whole life is from that area of the country
he is abounding in kindness let's say
his wife is so godly every thought
when you add the commercialization of the western world it sort of screws everything up for them
they have very basic life
it's just a very basic life
they just really believe in allah or god or whatever
everything is to the glory of allah
it's almost like
using that
they abuse that
it's always been military
it's always been
that's always been the way of the world don't you think
which i think that that's not the way the majority of the people over there really are
it's really hard when you see the leaders compared to the people
i think in a way all the involvement over there too though has shown that there are a lot of people that don't follow what those few are doing
there are a lot of people who are good people
there's
i think we may not have ever have seen that without some of these newspeople being in there in the broadcasts and the soldiers leaving surrendering and
the
it just really comes down to people are people
doesn't matter where the boundaries are
those are man made boundaries
for heaven sakes that's something that's been going on for ages
i think so much of it is what you're taught
they teach their children in such a way that
i guess i'll just start by saying that we entertain with a gourmet club here which means that we have eight people four couples
most of the husbands
the wives during the day get i guess so burned out on cooking whatever they have to cook every day
they don't really care about gourmet stuff
it was the guys that got together and did all this
that's nice
my husband just he really really likes to cook in terms of barbecue
all guys i think like to barbecue
he really does cook
it's a good thing because you can't knock that
all these other guys do too
we've gotten together
we just do these really elaborate gourmet meals
it's really really kind of a neat thing to do
we try
everybody is so active with their kids and all that
it's like if we can do it once every six months we're doing well
we originally started out when we were younger
then we tried to do it every other month
lately it's just been once every six months
that's much more reasonable
i was involved in a club where we tried to really do gourmet meals
we were a little bit too frequent i think
it was difficult
by the time we went around it was four couples
by the time we got around to each of us and it was time again we were almost tired
partly because gourmet cooking is not particularly conducive for regular dining
it is absolutely
we found that while we enjoyed the evening we regretted it the next day
we kind of
one of the couples moved
we sort of didn't continue it
i must admit that as you say when your children start taking up your time then you don't have as much time for regular entertaining
when we entertain i usually try to find something that will be
that sometimes means you can't do gourmet
we have a gourmet friend that can't stand fish
he can get within
one of my friends doesn't eat any cheese at all
that's a real problem because so many dishes require cheese
i take that back
she can't eat some cream cheese
that really limits
it makes you keep looking for recipes every time you have an eye out
we try to keep all that in mind
otherwise i guess entertaining
i guess i have recipes
that's basically what we do is the gourmet
they would be pretty elaborate
it's fun
it took us four days to cook a stock and three days to make this stuff
you get all prepared
you're right
i'm glad
it's quite a treat
you like food
i just love the community of food
i do too
i just love sharing meals and whatever you can do to do that
i don't think you have to be more than hamburgers and hot dogs out
in the backyard and the coleslaw and potato salad
my
we're having
a few people in sunday afternoon
i did a cop out on to it
i have to
i have to make hors d'oeuvres
i have to make dessert
i'm buying the little tiny rolls and so on
i can't do it working full-time
it's just too much
we're all not built like what
martha stewart
we all aren't martha stewart and have our coordinated glasses and tablecloths and time to t-
it's really kind of a neat thing
i really do
i love to make things from scratch
people really pretty much appreciate it
they do
it's very difficult to purchase
i think so
in spite of
if you do buy it it's extremely expensive
in fact i just got back from a shopping trip to purchase the cold cuts
i bought turkey and pastrami and barbecued ham at an amish market near here
i've never been there before
and found that there's individual vendors
the foods are wonderful
one of the
it's like thirteen fifty for a whole strawberry cheesecake which is really not such a bad price
i decided i just couldn't quite make myself buy it because i do make cheesecake
somehow i didn't want to do that because it
i was very tempted because it looked wonderful
they had black forest cherry cake and all those things
those are homemade
they are not commercial bakery made
in that they are made in their homes
it's kind of interesting
it is
we have bakeries around here that you just gain weight going by the door
just like that
i don't know
i guess some of the best things i've ever had some of them were just hors d'oeuvres
doing little hors d'oeuvre things that i have a kick making that
gee we have so much going on here because
chips and picante sauce and anything hot
you can always make it hotter
and lots of stuff like that
that's a really good party time
they just love it down here
it just
i'm not
how i got
of virginia
do you have a favorite hors d'oeuvre recipe that's easy
is it always complicat-
in fact it just came to mind
what was one of the latest ones that you've seen
i think we rented pretty woman a couple months ago
become available to come and go more often
i said hey it's worth it
i can see what i please
i went about two or three weeks ago and saw f x two
that is a really good movie if you like special effects
kind of gory and lots of action
he was
the one that played in it that i liked best was the one who was in
i don't know what his name is
i think i know who you are talking about though
that one was just a very poignant story
it had people
None
None
it was like steel magnolias
there was humor involved
the story was a very dramatic story
i enjoyed it very much
i'm trying to think
then when it started i just couldn't read
the second time you see it you understand more subtleties in it
there's quite a few movies out now that i would like to go see
i guess more than anything that is why we don't go
by the time you get a baby-sitter and then pay to go to the movies it just gets pretty expensive
you are going to have to find a mother's day out and have him call in sick one day
the price is as reasonable as renting a video
that's the way i do it
i go quite frequently
i was warlock too which is supposed to be the story of a witch hunt that is magically shot into the present time
the first five minutes or ten minutes of the movie i was very well persuaded to walk out very well persuaded
as the movie settles down to a comfortable action i can't really that it would have gotten more than a star and a half from me either
the action was comfortable
of course i enjoyed those good guy bad guy type conflicts things
i enjoyed that movie after the first few minutes of gore
there were some others
they were done a little more tastefully
in the first scene the warlock chopped off a guy's finger because he wanted the ring and then bit his tongue out and spit it off in the omelet
i could not handle that
then i saw awakening
i
he has done a really good job of characterizing the disabled person
of course robin williams always just has an air about him that you can't help but enjoy what he is doing
even when he's sad you great faith that he will get happy again
let's see there's a couple or three that i would like to go see before they go into videos
they will be videos
they say if you really want some suspense that's the one to see
i understand that's a sequel to an earlier movie that showed about two weeks ago on television
i think i read about that too
i'm going to try to get in dances with wolves
you haven't
it's just that they are both very long movies
the matinee starts before i can get away from work
after that i get involved in other things and don't want to go back
we rented the other one
i was trying to think of the other one that we had rented lately was presumed innocent with
i thought that was really good
i saw that
None
not defense
there was a murder of one of the women that was in the d a office
he ended up being accused of it
that's right
it really kind of had a turn at the end when you found out who it was
i've had a hard time enjoying harrison ford in anything since the indiana jones movies
i don't want to see him in other things
i tell you sean connery in the hunt for red october
i never did care for him in the james bond movies
he was always slick and greasy and seemed to be conceited and had more women than he needed
he has really developed into a marvelous character actor as he has come older
there's a
i don't know
he has that merry look about his eyes that looks like he stays in mischief all time
i enjoy those
i enjoy some of the michael j fox movies
the last
back to the future then was the last one
it was called
actually i am reading a couple of different books
one is a story
it is not a story
it is a collection of memos supposedly written by howard hughes
that was
i have just now gotten around to reading it
jus-
i do not remember the man's name
he used to be a reporter for i think the new york times or the washington post one of the two
he supposedly was contacted by this guy who had these memos he wanted to sell
they were ones that had supposedly been stolen from the corporate headquarters in los angeles
i guess they still do
had a big warehouse kind of thing which had offices
it was sort of nondescript for the size of the company which inside was basically a store house of a bunch of stuff he collected
he was a great collector of everything
he did not throw anything away
supposedly this guy had been breaking there for awhi-
he was a burglar had been breaking there awhile
they broke in one night and found a bunch of memos that were supposedly from hughes to his main assistant back in the fifties and i guess in the sixties
that is interesting
it's pretty interesting work
it's a little hard
it does not have a real story or any plot
they have not made a movie of the week of it yet
it is real interesting
i also reading thi-
it's another old book that i happen to have
it's a book about the bermuda triangle
it's a real good book that a guy wrote who was a research librarian
he wrote sort of
he was thinking
the reason i picked it back up was in light of when they found the airplanes in the atlantic thinking they were flight nineteen
i don't know if you are familiar with that at all
it's
flight nineteen
None
in the book even
even then
he goes through and brings out points from the navy's findings and so forth
it's probably real close to what everyone is thinking now that
on that same topic have you ever read anything about the amelia earhart story whatever happened with her
i think that would be
i am sure there is something out there
i would like to too
it's a lot of things coming up here lately about her possibilities of where she
whatever this is one aspect of it
of course it is so weird
no one will ever really know
tha-
it's entertaining
it makes you think about things
that is pretty much for right now
i like to read a novel every now and then
i am trying to get away from just reading novels all the time
i guess i just have not read anyth-
usually if i find a good book i will sit for two days until it is finished if it's that good
i think the last one i read like that was scott thurow's
that was presumed innocent
i just really really liked the way he writes
i got it right
my
he was an assistant district attorney in chicago while he was writing the book
my sister-in-law lives in chicago
before it actually got big she sent me this book saying you might like this
this guy is
i read it and really liked it
about
i
the other book i am trying to think was in the last year
i think i did read tom wolfe and vanity
the movie was a joke
tom wolfe is so perceptive
when it comes to pinpointing society's ills and
it was a much more intense book than the sort of flimflam that they cast off in the movie
we are not talking about that
gee i like to read gardening books and things like that just to tell me what
i have a lot of computer books that
i do computer work
i have a lot of those
i spend a lot of time looking through those not necessarily reading them but
i'm interested in a lot of that
i have got a lot of books that i intend to read
i have not been able to yet for one reason or another
what is a book on your list
i have a list too
i have never gotten to it
i just have all the books out
i have them all out
usually when i am through with one i will go in
i have one now that i got is
the sister-in-law in chicago usually sends me for my birthday or christmas or something will send me another good book
i can not remember the name of it
that was detroit
it wasn't really
it was to see an old relative
it was just to
you probably wouldn't recommend that as a big tourist spot
the only thing that i visited that is quite a tourist spot is cancun mexico
that would be nice
that was real nice
that would be nice
that would be enjoyable
usually when we go we go to colorado to estes park area
and stay in the mountains up there do a little hiking and resting get away from the texas heat that kind of thing
that's always refreshing to get away from
it's a lot of fun
i guess it was kind of like a vacation the
that's nice
i got to
that's probably my favorite place when i have to go somewhere on a vacation
my middle daughter and her husband have just taken up a new activity
that's canoeing
they've been to the guadalupe river
they also have been to i guess colorado
they've really enjoyed it
that's the best place that i've ever canoed
they had
he would give a little talk about
i think he wasn't a real mountain man
we were pretty convinced he was a full
we'd
he'd make sassafras tea out of sassafras roots that he'd found
that's neat
the river was really nice because it wasn't too frightening
it wasn't
too easy either
you learn a lot of skills too
i think you're more receptive when you're younger than when you're older to learn new skills
i think
you have kind of a relaxed mode of learning
you're more receptive
that's good
we let's see
the only other place i've ever vacationed we'd go on camping trips up to texoma and things like that
that's exciting
i went to england a few years ago
student there and spent a semester studying abroad in london
that was a great time because that's such a neat place
there's not a language barrier
you don't
None
a lot of people have trouble wrestling with their accents
i really enjoyed that
i had a friend that visited england i think it's been probably two years now
that's her next goal is go back to england
she really has a great desire to do that
the love that she has for it now after visiting it
it's really nice
i would spend all my time in london
i don't get much into really urban areas a lot it's sort of a weird little anonymous feeling where no one knows who you are
you can spend a whole day without talking to anyone which i thought i would just hate
it ended up being kind of nice
you could just
i had a great time doing that
i haven't been anywhere else outside the united states
i lived across the street almost from canada
that's a nice place
then i'd love to go somewhere in asia
i'd have to have a
that's why england was nice
that was even nice because there wasn't the
most the places we went to germany and switzerland and
you've been quite a few places there
we whirlwinded through
you slept on the train at night
that's great
there wasn't a
everyone in switzerland
no one knew english in there
we
it was
i had fondue
that was
we were able to have that pretty effortlessly
it was a pleasant time
i'd love to go back there
i guess that's why we need to plan for retirement so when we do have the free time we'll have the means to pursue our dreams
it was nice talking with you too craig
have a good afternoon
do you keep a family budget
do you have some
i probably rebelled against it
we sort of started doing it years and years ago
my husband started graduate school when we were first married
i sort of just got in the habit i guess and never have gotten out of it
it's more just a fairly accurate recording of what i spend
i have recently
i will probably start keeping a little better
i just spent whatever came in and never knew what came in and what went out
but about like the government runs
i think it is probably better to have some sort of at least a record
my dad was so precise
that if it said to spend eleven percent on something that's what it was spent
that was put over there
of course he is from the depression
so it's his life
i think it would be smart if somebody would keep some sort of a plan that works for them
i think you are right
it must have been sort of interesting to us
it's because since i have pretty much kept my record books for the last fifteen years i guess i can go back and look
it's real fun to just see how things have changed over the years
my father had kept them i think since nineteen twenty-seven
he burned the ones from twenty-seven to fi-
i took the ones from fifty-two on to the present
to have looked back into the twenties thirties and forties it would have been fantastic
as a matter of fact my mother was going through some things not long ago
she came upon a budget book that she had back in the thirties
it was the late
i guess it must have been in the forties because they had been married probably fifteen years at the time
it was just almost laughable in some instances that
never the less it was fun to see those figures next to
for a pair of shoes was five dollars
even in nineteen sixty-three
i found a record that i had and what i had paid for hotels
a similar hotel in paris is two hundred dollars a night now
i paid between four and five dollars
isn't that
that's really crazy
that's about thirty years ago
that is really something
of course it's just what the market will bear
that's right
that's just good old economics working
our two children are just as unlike as night and day
our daughter watches her pennies so closely
she has everything planned so closely
then you never know how they will
get to be older
she may marry somebody
of course it would be good because you marry somebody a little loose then she will have that stability of watching
you should have one in the house
i think
i think my husband was not quite as good at saving and so on before we got married
None
i was putting money aside before i was married when i was working out of college
that really paid off
because when time came for him to go back to graduate school we were in fairly good shape financially as far as not having any major debts
what does you husband do now
he is an engineer
he is
an electrical engineer and in fact went through many years of graduate school got his p h d
had a lot of years of budgeting
None
it
i have got
i'm working on my masters degree now
in fact this last year we had three
our daughter graduated this year
i'm just about ready to finish my masters degree
we have had once again a real lean year for us
i know
that was four
we were both in the same
you know exactly what it's like then
it's
i guess you figure that that is an investment that is really invaluable
it's one that you can live through
think that that's the way that we looked at it in our beginnings when my husband was in graduate school that there was a light at the end of that tunnel
that it was worth it to save and to not have something and in return know that something better was going to be at the end of it
it really makes it easier
i wish i could hear more about your historian part of your life because that sounds really fascinating to me
if i had your address i would send you
i can take some real great tours to europe
my husband
we did not take a tour
we were in england and went to ireland and scotland and just rented cars and
i
i'm jerry hammond
i'm out at brookhaven college
you could just holler at me there
you are kidding
i'm going to be teaching at brookhaven in the fall
i will be
in the communications department teaching english one oh one to
i know zack miller real well
it's been a good type conversation
how do you view this whole subject
are you one who feels like you have benefited from the change in roles in women
what do you think
are you someone who works outside your home
have you
have there been significant changes do you think in the employment place especially
has anything in particular changed that you have noticed
i guess there's more women in what would be classified as a man's job
what kind of work do you do
we have got more women in it now
in years past i know in fact even the word drafter has changed
it used to be they were draftsman
we have some engineers that still on their
i want to scratch it out and
i thought i am
maybe not
when i was in college
i was a math major which was a real rarity
i was in a lot of classes where i was either the only girl or one of just a very
that was a change
even i did not use my math in my work
i became a technical writer
even so there were very very few women in technical writing
that has changed a lot
in recent years it has just really changed a lot
i think that the one thing that i have seen is that more and more women are getting into management
i think they have got a long way to go
there was something on t v the other day that said that fewer than one or two percent of the chair persons
i thought that that's a pretty significantly small number
there are some strides to be made there
i do not know
i think we have come a long way
when i think about when things were like even just when i was in high school
that women were not able to succeed
do you have children
in fact i have a daughter who just graduated in civil engineering from college
although there were some other women in her class
she was one of the minorities
females in the class
she definitely entering into a male profession
for instance there is the organization the society of women engineers
that is recognized
as a place where women should be
you see it in church where more and more women are becoming ministers
in protestant congregations
it will be interesting to see if roman catholicism ever recognizes women in the role of priest
i do not know if you are roman catholic or
what you know about that
that is one area
what in particular would you think other than the work place where women still are being found wanting or not as highly regarded as men would be
i know something
tell me what you think about this
i know that now there they want the armed forces to recognize that women can serve in combat roles
the only branch in the armed services that seems willing to do that is the air force
i spoke because women were flying missions in the persian gulf war
i know some of the other services do not think that women are capable of doing the job
i was listening to some of the comments on television the other day
about it
i do not know if he was a general or what his rank was very high
i can not tell you why i feel this way
but i just would rather have a man doing some of these jobs than a woman
i thought at least he was honest
that does not sit very well with a lot of folks i am sure
neil as far as i am concerned the only one area where a woman could not do it is if she just physically did not have the strength
mentally and emotionally i think women can handle a job and
i do too
it's still
if she wanted to go to combat
i am sure that there are women who would relish that
kind of job
i guess that should be taken into consideration
this is an interesting topic
i have
having a daughter who has gone into engineering
that's progress i guess
same here
have you talked with a lot of people in this project
at home the recorder gets my calls
i probably talked to seven or eight people
i guess i placed all but one or two of my calls
and only because i going to make some money
see our choir is doing this as a money raising project
we got the connection through a t i
we are doing it to raise money for a large project at church
i feel like this is one way i can contribute that's
i thought i will just get on the stick and do it
i will say good-bye to you
i have enjoyed the conversation
thanks for calling
one of the interesting things that i have considered about the role change for women is that women of my generation were trained and taught and brought up to be the leave it to beaver housewives
we are not living in that world
it makes you really concerned
let the world train them what to do
characteristically the women are trained or have been in the past trained in the home
i really would be at a loss to raise and train a girl
even raising boys today is different though because
used to be they would just go off to work and come home
everything was done
it's a different world
some good some bad
i have chosen to stay at home
i have a ten year old and a twelve year old
i was a single parent for awhile and worked
that was great
i was able to provide for my children
None
i thank god everyday now
i volunteer a whole lot
that's my job right now
i love it
that will come
i am looking forward to that too
that's a different phase in my life
i am glad that i am able to do what i want to do right now
there's a lot of things that have happened
it's like oil on top of water
it's never different in a lot of ways
then as times changed as it is today we do not do a lot of physical labor
even in housekeeping
you are not
in that respect we have to make ourselves become involved in physical exertion
we really do develop some health problems
in that respect i am not so sure that the hard work of years past was not better for us than we are willing to admit
don't you think it's that way with men too
men are sitting behind desks a whole lot more
absolutely true
that's true with society
specifically the woman's role
medical reports tell us that women are developing diseases now that used to be predominately male diseases
i think that that's a symptom of our society
it's a symptom that there's a general illness that needs to be healed
i am not god
i do know that in raising my boys i really did meet a lot of pressures saying you need to get them into music lessons
i fought all of those things
they will say mom this is important to me
it's funny
that's the way it is with a woman too
i was really looking forward to summer thinking we are going to have some time off
it's been real busy
today is really as far as i am concerned the first day of summer
you are right
that's how society has changed
None
we find ourselves doing things that
i do not remember
it's different
it's just very different
i just am very much a believer in quiet personal time
i guarded my children's rights for that
i think that that's one of the things that women are sacrificing that they should not do
is not that difficult to do when you are working full time and have to come home and prepare a meal and
i think
where do you find the time
in the first place it's not your homework
i was always very careful to be there only when they came to me and asked me for help
that's all
that is accepting responsibility for things that really are other people's responsibilities
that way we have not changed in
i do not know
that's never changed
that's very true
as a matter of fact i was talking to a friend yesterday who said she has a new policy in her home
when her family comes to her and says fix this
another member of the family
i say no
you work it out for yourself
it's amazing she said
they suck me into these arguments and
i am supposed to be
she said i am not doing it anymore
i just
i think that's one of the things that we have today that is very useful
i think every woman ought to deal with it or ought to at least be exposed to it
that is mediation training
we are not talking about strikes or things
boss and employee those kinds of things interpersonal mediation
the mediator is an unbiased bystander who
i've been raised around prisons all my life
i believe if you don't have a punishment befitting the crime there's not any deterrent
so many of those kind of people they have a better life in prison than they have on the street anyway
unless they really make it rough on them going to prison for a little while is not much of a deterrent i don't think
i don't know what oklahoma's laws are
texas's i don't know are
it's no ones f-
it's not the judges fault i don't think
man our prisons are so crowded that they can commit some pretty serious crimes and be set free within a year to two
the states prisons were under a mandate to
the federal came in and said hey you have either got to build more prisons or let people go
that's what ours did same thing
finally our governor at the time who is not in office now came in and said okay where we draw the line is no sex offenders will be let loose
under early bail or early get out
we have
there have been w-
i
maybe it should be given i won't say sparingly
i do believe it should be befitting the crime
the way the courts are set up they've got so many chances for appeal
i think it needs to be expedited
if they've been convicted and given an appeal and they're still convicted of a crime that's deserving of a lethal injection let's do it and not waste so many years to do it
of course they're entitled to a speedy trial
then they're also entitled to drag it through the courts for years and years and years on appeals
somehow it doesn't really balance out too much
it seems even though that they got
i'm tired of fighting it
at that point i really think there needs to be maybe a shorter appeal process
i don't see why it couldn't be shortened considerably
None
part of that is the overcrowding of the court system
it is overcrowded because there's so much problem with the people on drugs
that ha-
with the drugs they're robbing and killing
that's why it's filled the prisons up so much i think
it doesn't help them any at all of course your court system when you get into the appeals
the whole judicial system is backed up with a lot of junk that shouldn't be in there
we've gotten into a very litigious type of life
anyway i'm glad to hear that you agree with me on the
i just
i'm very muchly for it
if you don't have the punishment you double your crime
that is just personal feeling
it's supported with facts though
tell me some about your camping experiences carolyn
i have gone to girls camp a few times as a chaperon or a leader whatever i enjoy camping
we have a tent
we've gone even with our family a few times out camping and have a camp stove
i guess my biggest memory is when we froze to death
where do you go camping at around here
we went camping at lake bonham which is pretty close here
it got really cold at night
of course we were close enough that we could go back and get some more blankets and things in the morning
what activities do you do when you're camping
we take little nature hikes
we take along games that we can play with the kids and just that kind of stuff
usually try to have occasionally a camp fire at night and roast the marshmallows and what all
that sounds like fun
i grew up in south dakota up in the black hills we used to go camping
there was four of us kids
he'd take us
we'd all go camping my dad and my mom and the kids
it was always fun
what i always remember is my dad would let us pick our camp spot
he'd always tell us okay look for a nice flat little area where we can pitch our tents
it always had to be somewhere near a river so we could go fishing
hopefully we'd catch our supper
we never did it was always fun
she'd bring along something because
we always had
then we'd roast marshmallows
it was always an enjoyable experience
about nineteen eighty-two i moved from rapid city in the black hills
i crossed the state to aberdeen
there's no hills
i was in high school
couple of my high school friends and i we'd go camping out by a river of course and go fishing
by then of course i was able to catch some things
it was always fun
it was a different experience camping in the hills versus camping just by a river in the hills we would do like you folks did would take the nature hikes and look for animals
we always
we used to live in utah of course there's lots of mountains around there to camp in and streams and stuff
that's a great place to go camping
the hiking is just really great
hike up those mountains is just really fantastic
are there any mountains or big rocks a person could hike around this area
i'm not acquainted with any
there's woods and things out in east texas tyler area
there's a tyler state park that's really a nice camping area
it's just a lot of trees
i don't know of any place in texas that has really big what i call mountains
the rocky mountains are so much
bigger than anything that they've got down here that
the one in tyler has it been pretty commercialized i suppose
it's not too bad
they have screened in areas
i guess they could call them that but they're more just a screened in camping area whatever
they're not bad
helps keep the pests out i suppose
that sounds
it sure beats driving a thousand miles
i take it you haven't done a whole lot of camping in this area
we just moved down in june
i see
you're just trying to get over the culture shock still
if i can get on central from anywhere i'm happy
really the ideal times to camp in this area are early spring and in the fall
there's a lot
i don't like it when people listen to my phone conversations like if they're outside my door while i'm talking in my room
or when people look through my things in my bedroom
i find it very annoying when i've worked all day to come in and my phone to ring constantly the solicitors and the carpet cleaning companies and
i am trying to get a few things done
i can't do anything but answer the telephone
i wish i could put a stop to it
i don't know what to do to stop it
even we used to have a sign on our door that said no soliciting
they would still come to our door and knock and
do you live at home with your parents
your privacy is invaded probably by other members of the family
what can you do to stop that
i don't know
i am used to it now
maybe they will respect yours
i don't know
they don't live at home
they nearly drove me crazy listening to telephone conversations
i used to do that though
they would go get on the other extension i could hear them
i couldn't get them to hang up
i stopped doing that a long time ago
they still do it to me
s-
she'll just sit there and listen
she just started
she is nice
None
occasionally we'll have a person here or there but not as many as the phone calls
i guess that's really the thing that really bugs me the most
they've all gotten grown up now we live in a neighborhood where there is not any little kids to bother me
what else would be an annoyance
i guess traffic could be an annoyance
it can get busy
you would like to
i've been through dallas texas
when i first moved here i probably did consider that an invasion of privacy
at first you'd hear a lot of noise especially at night when you go to bed
every time a fire truck or anything went down the road i would wake up
i guess i have gotten used to it because i don't even hear it anymore
i just close it out i guess because i don't remember waking up in several years at night when i'd hear a fire truck go by
that probably wouldn't bother me
did you have has name all over them
it was a letter from a girlfriend of mine
i was upset because those were mine
i thought he
that was upsetting
i was going to say my college is northern state university in aberdeen south dakota
our head football coach dennis muir used to be an assistant coach at b y u
i thought that was kind of an interesting coincidence
you went to what college
northern state university in aberdeen south dakota
what did you graduate in
i'm going into nursing
that sounds interesting
it's probably going to take me longer because i didn't decide to major in that until
i read a study once
it said that like thirty-four percent of college students actually graduate in four years from a four year program
it took me five years
you get started
you change your mind
you want to pick up a second major
if you're management you thought i'll take that marketing
it's just only was three more classes
just doesn't happen that you get out in four years
what is your advice to picking a college
my advice is look at the student to faculty ratio
that's great
which is
it's interesting
it's
what i thought was nice is there was always time to talk to professor
they knew you
you weren't just in their class
you could go talk to them in their office almost at any time
if you ran into them in the student union or whatever you could sit down talk to them about a problem
i put that against my high school where we had a biology class of three hundred and fifty students
yeah it was a biology lecture class it just wasn't the same
you're taking notes
you got a computerized test scores multiple choice because there's no way they could correct a three hundred fifty person short answer test
it just wasn't the same
you'd pass the teacher in high school
even in high school you could say high to your teachers unless you're in that biology class
they'd look at you like do i know you
it's hard to get individual help
do you get a lot of tutoring
very little
my
for example i'm in a chemistry class right now there's tons of students in it
there's one t a for the whole class
he only has certain office hours
there's only certain times you can talk to him
you could get there
he could have a nine to eleven in the morning office hours and have forty-two people waiting to talk to him
you still didn't get to talk to him anyway
what would be your advice to a parent of a child thinking of attending college
man i think your advice is good
let's see my advice would be to pick a major before you get into college
i took tons of classes that i didn't need to
i don't know
i just feel like it's going to take me a lot longer than
not that's always bad
it does get it
you get to the point where i'm never going to get done
i was taking summer classes
let me get out of here
no
even if you don't have your major decided on have an idea what you think you might want
you don't want management
you think you want business
i haven't talked to anybody outside the metroplex
i didn't even think of saying arlington texas
i've been trying to get people at five thirty and six thirty in the evening
i thought i'm not having any luck
i'm happy we got through
do you have any opinion on the subject
i'm especially interested with what's happening in the soviet union
the ukraine's vote basically to secede and set itself up independently is quite a remarkable counts
is that reported in the texas papers
we hear a little of the news
how big is the ukraine the area
as an area it's not
i'm afraid i don't have the statistics in front of me
if i was looking at a u s map i would say it sort of reminds me of a
it's more significant in the sense of it's a great agricultural region
i see
i didn't really know that
i know a lot of their countries that they had overtaken or wanted to be independent or several of them right
what about astonia
the three baltic republics got out as quickly as they could
the ukraine is especially significant because of the agriculture
it's very important for the economics of the soviet union
there were probably really fight to keep it in if they could
it's done democratically
bush has already given his
not that may matter
i fear for the russians from what i read
sounds to me like they'll start rioting soon not that that would do any good
i guess people do that when they're desperate
that's true hasn't happened here for a while
it
that's true
i guess when the veterans went to washington and the war riots of course
i hear you have some problems
we do
we have lots and lots of layoffs here lot of companies folding lot of layoffs
it's pretty scary
do you blame the government in washington for this
i don't understand economics that well
i know that we have a terrible situation with foreign trade and that other countries put a lot of restrictions that we don't i assume that that has a great effect
they said during the way reagan-bush years the rich got richer
i guess
then you think it's reagan and bush have done this
is it just coincidence it was during this period
i really don't know
i think maybe they contributed to it
maybe they should pay more attention to the more equalization of the trade
of course if somebody in china can make something for ten cents and we have to make it for ten dollars because we have unions i don't know what's going to happen then
the chinese use slave labor too
that's one of the ways they get away with it
i don't know
i don't think there's any one simple answer to the whole thing
that's very complicated
they say too that having a democratic congress and republican president is not good
i've read that is a theory
which one are we going to throw out
i'm tending to go straight back into my original democratic party
texas used to be a democratic state didn't it
i know
you don't want too many democrats anymore
for a while i kind of deserted the party
now it's looking better to me
do you
i'm glad to hear that
i think so too
i just admire her a lot
i really hope she does well
she's probably more popular out of the state than she is here although she did manage to win
look who she was running against
i know some of the people
we're going to compare notes
i often desire to exercise often believe i should and rarely do
i tell you i firmly believe in exercising
what sort of regiment do you have
i just got back from biking twelve and a half miles
this time of year you can't get much biking in
every morning i use this president's council of physical fitness
it's worth doing
you can do it anywhere
i travel quite a bit in my business
you can do it wherever you're at
if you do it
i do it every morning usually after breakfast before i take a shower and get dressed to go to work
what i do
i've done this for fifteen years
you don't start at this kind of regiment
what i'm telling you isn't something you go out and do
you'll hurt yourself
every
i do twenty-five where you have your arms above your head and your body twisters touch left and right toe
i do ten right and left trunk twisters
i do about sixty bicycle leg thrust type things
i do twenty leg lifters on each side when you're laying on the floor
i do fifty push-ups and do a hundred sit ups
then i do about
thirty
if you did football the old grass drills where you're on your stomach and you prone type things where you're kind of rocking on your stomach type thing
that takes maybe about thirteen minutes in the morning
what keeps you doing that
i sometimes start much more modest efforts
i give up
years ago i used to referee football to stay in condition i did that just as a normal basis
i tell you just by doing it
example this summer i was about fifteen pounds heavier than i wanted to be
i increased
i do three hundred sit ups a day now but not in the morning
i do about a hundred before supper and about a hundred before i go to bed
i lost fifteen pounds just by doing that because you tighten your stomach muscles you can eat anything you want drink anything you want
you don't
within reason you can lose weight or maintain your weight and your physical being i just
i think it's really important
whenever i do it i feel good that i have done good because it seems right and good because it has good effects
it's this maintaining a regular habit that i just can't seem to do
that's why chuck i think if you did it on a daily basis and you didn't need elaborate things where you can make excuses like
i like biking
during the summer i'll do at least seventy-five miles a week and when i really was doing it maybe a hundred and fifty
you can't
there's excuses weather you don't have time or something like that
if you do some basic exercises and you say every morning just like brushing your teeth you're going to spend fifteen minutes or a half hour
and you get up a half hour earlier once you start getting into that you just feel good you look a whole lot better
does your wife participate in any of this
there's no way i can get her to
it's something you either just really want to do it
if you don't like to exercise it isn't going to happen
i sure wish she would
she's unfortunately overweight
she's a wonderful woman
no sense getting in arguments with anybody about it
i keep saying if somebody else would do it with me little bit of peer pressure would help considerably
you seemed to have solved that problem without any external help
if you get one of these mats
go to a store they normally have these exercise things these a b c of physical fitness on them
what's this mat
it's just an exercise mat that rolls up
you can put it up just in the corner
it doesn't
it's that kind of like half inch of foam or something
it's just about six feet long rolls up i don't take it on trips with me
you could
i don't mind
if i do sit ups i'll throw a towel down or something
you don't have the abrasive
what do you think about the self insurance business
i watched something on t v a couple of months ago by ex surgeon general koop
he talked about canada's system
it appears to work fine for the normal colds and things like that
the expensive stuff heart operations and things they have a managed scarcity
they said that in canada there were as many heart trauma centers as there is in san francisco
in one city in america there's as many hospitals that are equipped to do heart operations as in the entire area of canada
that's kind of spooky
i understand what you're saying
there's probably some truth to that
i think that generally i don't welcome added government responsibilities
however when anybody can't police their own profession it eventually leads to that
i think the costs and the way the medical profession has every year
i being in my own business
i think eventually the number of people that can afford health insurance as it is now getting squeezed and squeezed tighter
i think they're asking for it
i think the medical profession is just pushing until there's no option but the government take it over
do you think that it's just medical guys
what about how expensive new equipment and technology is
i think a lot of it is
i don't disagree totally with that
my wife this last summer when we were on vacation tore up her knee
it was ligaments in her knee
as it turned out
she came back that
she got home
the leading orthopedic man who has handled football people for years and is as good as they come
he knows knee problems okay
if anyone does this guy knows it
she goes in
he says i think this is what it is
you better go to the hospital and have one of these m r i things
a thousand dollars for this magnetic resonance imaging type thing
my wife said do i need that
he says it'll help me diagnose this
i suggest you go have this thing
thousand dollars for thirty-five minutes
doctors routinely send people in for anything
for years they didn't have this
they solved these problems
None
i said to her look if you feel you got to go go
i think a thousand dollars
even if they cost a hundred two hundred five hundred thousand dollars at roughly a thousand dollars every half hour that's ridiculous
i don't care what anyone says
the costs are not
it shouldn't cost more than thirty-five bucks for something like that reasonableness
they aren't reasonable
there's another problem
that's how litigious our society is
i think that's another problem
that's part of our legalese problem
that the government eventually will address too
i agree with you
i was on a jury
i didn't make the jury
there was a
it was three days after it was born
he was the one that delivered it
they got four attorneys
he says anyone have trouble awarding five million dollars
i says yeah
as sorrowful as it is if the doctor is wrong he should be pulled from his license
five million dollars and away he goes because insurance pays for it
it doesn't make logical sense to me
aids is a nasty terrible disease
you die from it
i think that they need to look into it
it's kind of like cancer
i don't
how about yourself
i'm certainly in favor of aids research
i think probably the government could spend a bit more money on it than it does
besides the fact that it's a deadly disease that it's a contagious disease so that it's
yeah
in the country america
yeah they have millions
sometimes you hear things on the radio that could be true or couldn't be
do you feel like this is
i guess they're spending a billion or so a year on this aids research
i think they should although perhaps not an incredible amount more than what they're doing
i don't necessarily think that they should fund aids research and in the process neglect cancer research or whatever
i am sorry that he has the virus
i don't know
i think it's very strange that the media hasn't questioned him more strongly about gay sex or intravenous drugs or anything like that as they probably would for a lot of other people
do you think he's the hero that he's being called by a bunch of the media
not really though i think he's probably doing the right thing for a man in his position
i don't think it's anything exceptional that he's doing
i took advantage of the opportunity when he came out
i talked to my kids about it it's something that i hadn't done before
that's good
i'm glad that mister johnson's changed his tune on safe sex to abstinence
i was glad he did that for young kids because a lot of kids would have ended up dying because of what he was promoting
let's see
you don't
i guess you might not
he's actually
he is now in full-blown aids really not doing very well and has a brain tumor or that sort of thing
it's a very nasty thing
that's basically it that the immune system can at first slow down
the white blood cell count goes down
that's aids related complex
then when things get completely out of control and it basically hits bottom that's aids in that case people are prone to getting any kind of weird cancer that only animals got before
all right
i had a hatchback a nineteen seventy-eight version before this one
i'll be honest with you
i have never found any automobile that has been more conscientiously constructed and put together
it does its job
i did have to put two new front tires on at fifty thousand miles
that car just purrs like the day it was built
i get forty-two miles per gallon on the highway and twenty-eight to thirty driving around in town
i can carry more in that trunk area in my little honda than i can in the big cars
i have a large pontiac
i have a sixty-nine cougar which i'm saving because it's old
it's in beautiful shape
i can carry as much in my honda or more than i can in those other bigger cars
that's very interesting
i've had exactly the same experience with the one that i've got
surprisingly it's also an eighty-four
what
it's
big roomy trunk and very happy with it
i must admit it's
if
my only consideration were buying another car just to tool around town in and make brief trips and things like that
i would very seriously consider buying one
my real concern with why i'm not sure i want to buy a honda is because i have to make a kind of a steady trip down the road about once a month because i'm divorced
i have a daughter that lives down in north carolina i drive
it's just an absolutely wild highway
there's no doubt about that i run over to crystal city used to
i'm retiring the end of this month i'm very much aware of the crazy driving that goes on over there
you've got it
having precious cargo in the car with me
in fact quite frankly i've owned a volvo in the past
i've
course i'm a mechanically inclined kind of person
i always wind up getting under the hood and finding out all the things that need to be taken care of and so forth
i guess that's one thing that recommends the honda to a lot of people is there's just very little that you have to do under the hood
it just sits there and purrs
all you got to do is the main major thing of changing that oil and that filter
i know
yeah
i've been looking at the prices of these cars and so forth
i think that it's very surprising some of these very expensive volvos can be gotten for a lot less money than you would think if you're willing to buy ones that are about
the vintage of the cars that you and i currently own
a brand new volvo costs what thirty thousand dollars
certainly some of the top end ones
you can still get even the low end wagons for less than twenty thousand dollars we get
in the washington area of course being as affluent as it is there are lots and lots of volvo dealerships down here there're lots and lots of them available in the paper at any week
i sort of scan the paper and look at them and so forth
None
i've tended to buy cars that are two or three and sometimes even four and five or six years old
in fact it had an extraordinarily low amount of mileage on it
it's an eighty-four
my eighty-four just has seventy-seven on it i've made many trips to washington and down to virginia beach virginia where my mother lives and things like that
i drive it
you ready for this
guess what
the weather this time of year has actually been kind of unusual
i haven't expected it to be colder until
i've
you do you probably go everywhere and have all sorts of weather
it was around here last night
i understand it's supposed to rain until saturday night
i went through phoenix twice on wednesday morning approaches to low minimum both times phoenix never gets that kind of weather
i have a brother that's a pilot also with american
is that right
i imagine with all this kind of weather it makes it kind of dangerous for you
i wouldn't call it danger
this really isn't bad stuff to fly around in
i guess so
the air systems are reasonably calm
we don't have the turbulence have a little bit of chop
it's not like it is in the spring time
we moved down here from another location
it's spectacular the thunderstorms and rain storms you get in the spring time the torrents of rain
lights up the whole sky and even on a
i've seen it where there's not a cloud in the sky
the rain isn't falling
you can see the lightening going horizontally across the sky and back and forth and what a light show
it's fabulous
yeah cloud to cloud it can be really sensational here
i'm from northern utah
that's a very arid climate from salt lake city area there's always a lot of snow
in fact where i grew up we were about an hour's drive from seven to twelve different major ski resorts
there was an awful lot of snow
because it was an arid climate the snow was always a crisp powder light snow which made it fantastic for skiing and sleigh riding and everything
we had a great time
were you near the park cities area
in snowbird and solitude and brighton and
i imagine have you skied before
we've skied
we skied california a bunch when we lived out there
of course we grew up in minnesota
we do lot of cross country skiing there
do you think the weather is typical for this time of the year
not really
i
minnesota's gotten just hammered with snow
the
we've gotten a fair amount of rain for this time of year already i think i've been surprised that we haven't seen more of the temperatures that we've got today that moved in last night
it's been cold
there was a time though in the middle part of november that got really cool really really unseasonably cool it warmed right back up
i thought great
she said yeah
it was real cold
that was very unseasonable for us down here
i've really enjoyed the weather down here too
two years ago we were the day after christmas able to go out in shorts and play tennis in the nice sunny weather
it's not as severe i should say as the weather that i've experienced up in northern utah
that's real true
it's
in fact i've played golf on new year's day one year
it is
they say boy six months out of the year it's bitter cold and the wind and the blowing snow and everything
they've had
they're up over sixty-five or sixty-
i guess tonight's subject is woodworking
do you
kind of mainly the woodworking i've done lately is made for example a little nativity scene
not the whole figurines and so forth but mainly the stable put some shelves in and some odd stuff around the house
i enjoy doing a little bit of woodworking
i do it out of hobby more than something i have to do
i like to think of it as a hobby but i guess also partly out of necessity just repairing things around the house
a few years ago they needed some book shelves
i kind of drew up some simple plans to make some book shelves
it actually worked pretty well
over the years i've refined those plans
i'm very good at making book shelves
it's also a way of relieving stress
i'll have to come and see them
i
that is right
lot of the things we can't be able to afford
also i sometimes think that i enjoy doing that
i like to get out and to work with my hands
sounds like you got some real nice tools too
yeah
little by little i started out
gotten a good belt sander
the router helps a lot because you can make better joints with a router
the latest project that i've been working on is a cabinet to put a t v in
a entertainment type center
it works well because you can design it to suit whatever equipment you have
i designed a space just the right size for the t v and then the v c r and shelves on the side for my stereo equipment
that's worked pretty well
with the router you can make nice
it's
also with a router you can make ornamental facings too better than a just straight wood edge
and casings and so forth that are real nice
that's good
what i need next is a good table saw
i debate whether it's better to get just a straight table saw or to get one of these rotary arm saws
it seems to me the radial arm saw is better
it takes up less room
you set the wood down
you move the saw
whereas if you're ripping wood you're probably better off with a table saw
with a radial arm saw if you do have a big piece of wood that you need to rip like you say or cut you wouldn't be able to do that
yeah
a table saw does take a lot of space and is a pretty big investment
that's partly my problem now
i
where we lived before up north basements were common
not so here in texas
i'm from up north also
no
there's no basements down here
it's kind of hard to get shop space unless you have a dedicated shop or a dedicated room for that
lot of the equipment too that i've used in the past i've used in school
i would
i'd kind of like to look at equipment like a lathe or like you say a table saw and some of those things that would make some pretty nice pieces of wood for different things for tables for chairs for decks and so forth
i just enjoy woodworking
i think the main thing is like you say it's a good out
it's a great stress reliever
in school i have
i've made different things tables for chairs
i've made bowls
None
are you settled in a place
i've been in it for thirteen years since nineteen seventy-eight
it's in richardson texas which is right
north dallas
we've lived in two houses in richardson
we left here in seventy-six
we were here for a few years
then we have come back just this summer
right now we're looking for housing somewhere down in the duncanville and cedar hill area
they've enjoyed the school
we're kind of trying to stay here
the problem we got is that we've got five children
everybody says how many houses are on the market and all that kind of thing
we look at the paper
we talk to our realtor
you can cut the listings in about a third when you go from three to four bedrooms or five
we're
my youngest is getting married this year graduating college
i can board up their rooms
we're looking forward to retiring in about three years and maybe relocating to florida or somewhere
closer to our families
are you from florida originally
my wife's parents are from the new york new jersey area everyone has seem to relocated down that area
the oldest is ninth grade
the youngest is second grade
i think they're going to be with us forever
it's sure we're not anywhere near looking to cut down in size
i understand
we're trying to find
it's tough to find a five and six bedroom house isn't it
i don't think it's possible unless you multimillionaire something like that
i know
that's an awful lot
we're having
if we find something for i'd say less than a hundred and twenty thousand we'll be doing all right
i think the thing's out there
it's just a matter of finding the right place
lot of people in your situation will buy a four bedroom house and convert maybe the garage or something or do something
there were seven kids in her family
they converted the dining room and
they always seemed to get along fine
until then it's a little stressful just looking all the time and that sort of thing
i know
there's nothing harder than that
i always just sort of assign my wife that chore
at least she's got more opinions
seems like there's more constraints more things that she thinks about openness the size of the kitchen and all this kind of stuff that i would probably gloss over and
maybe even ignore
i'm in the sporting goods business
who are you with
we're with an organization called wycliff bible translators
it's a missions organization and doing translation linguistics that sort of thing
it's got an office down here near duncanville
we just moved down to be on staff down here
how was the
you say you lived in the denver area before
how did that compare with this area as far as housing prices
we were really surprised to find that they're higher here
when we moved from louisiana to denver it was astounding to find that prices were i guess almost two or three times as high as we'd expected
to come down here we thought things would be lower
they're not
i guess really prices for housing are just
i can begin this
basically i work for honeywell in minneapolis the benefit program we have here is really quite good
i'm pretty pleased with it
they cover just about everything vision dental medical you name it
for me this is the first job i've had where they've covered that much
i'm pretty satisfied myself
what's your situation
our benefits package isn't quite as good in some ways
we do have the health care and the the dental
i'm on the professional administrative and technical staff
effectively i run the telephone switch at the university of new hampshire
i see
the benefits
probably the main thing i like about the benefits is the very generous vacation time and sick time
no doubt
right from the day one when you start work you get twenty-four days a year time off
that's good
that's one of the things i guess i would change about honeywell is
being a government organization you got quite a few holidays off
here you don't get that
it's really
unless you have some vacation time or some sick leave or whatever you kind of have to finagle your way around to get that time
that's kind of a drawback i think
i don't know
what do you consider most important you think in terms of the different benefits
i think the health care of course is an important and has to be the single most important benefit the rates that we keep paying seem to keep increasing
i'm a little disturbed about that
i think that's a national trend
i don't know what the solution is to it
they basically reviewed the oregon plan toward nationalizing health care and that kind of thing
they've essentially made up a list of all the different medical maladies that you can have and then basically made a cutoff
about six hundred and eighty-seven and below will not be covered by subsidized health care
the ones above would
it's kind of like drawing this line
if you have it great
if you don't you're kind of out of luck it was kind of an interesting show
i think health care is probably the pressing one
i'll tell you i don't mind having dental
sometimes dental costs can be just about as expensive if not more
i know historically a lot of companies i think carried dental as a rider along with the medical i'm not sure that's widely followed any more
how does university of new hampshire handle it
we have two different plans that we can subscribe to under dental depending
the cost between them is very little
i think it costs me something like five dollars a month for the dental plan
it pays a substantial amount
the examinations and checkups every six months are free it covers the bulk of the dental expenses
is that the same for both professors and also staff and administration
the benefits plan is different for what we call operating staff which are considered to be clerical personnel accountants things like that as opposed to what they call the p a t staff which i belong to the main
i think the health and all that and the dental is the same for everybody and the retirement plan
the main difference is in the way sick time is accrued and vacation time is accrued
for the operating staff it's it's based on how long they've worked there
that determines how much vacation time they get
i'm kind of interested because that's the route i'd like to take when i finally get my degree is to teach in a university
i'm a doctoral student in florida right now
that's interesting
that's one of the things i'd like to think about is in what kind of benefits they would cover and things like that
college programs belong to this t i a a c r e f retirement fund
is that right
in the case of the university of new hampshire
even if they give it a shot it's still going to be black market all over the place
gun control is probably frowned on quite a bit down there i would think
None
you're just live down there
i've lived down here a couple years
yeah there's a lot of hunters here
i know how you feel
i grew up in nebraska
we always use to go out and hunt all the time
man
i think it's ridiculous
i don't know anymore
i keep a thirty-eight in my truck
i live in minneapolis
i live in florida
i am staying
both areas are pretty crime ridden right now it's just you never know who is out there
it's just for self protection purposes
of course there's the hunting issue
i'm in program control for a company up here
i'm researcher of honeywell up here
i haven't had a chance to do any hunting since i've been down here
i'd like to go bird hunting
that's something i miss quite a bit
when i was in colorado we went deer and elk hunting quite a bit
my brother was a guide for bear and elk hunts out in idaho for a while
i don't know
i guess that what the scale now is it's zero for a complete
one for a total ban and
i agree with you there
if they can anyway get it keep criminals from having guns which they can't i'm not for it
if there's a way to limited it to people i don't know
i guess they passed a couple of laws here while back
they actually
that's a week they check you out and make sure you don't have a record and things like that
that's
then again you can always get around that
you always be able to get around
i don't know
i guess some forms of guns should probably be controlled just like i'm not real sure why anybody would need a full automatic weapon
i think those have been pretty much banned altogether anyway
even a semiautomatic i guess that's
it's like what can you do with that that you can't do in a self protection situation with like a seven or a twenty shot twelve
you might do the same thing
it's like i don't know it does
i like bows
i have done some bow hunting
i get into it
i think it's more of a challenge
i don't know
i don't know
that's about where i stand
have you eaten yet or whatever
it's not too good
it's kind of rainy
around this time of year you expect it up here to get down to about i don't know ten or twenty degrees it's been up around forty
people are whining about the rain and stuff but not too bad about the temperature
it's kind of shocking
and any kind of long term financial planning or anything like that
do you have a monthly budget or a long term budget that you stick to
wendy i guess we get to talk about budgets tonight or lack of budgets if that may be the case uh-huh
i'm on work study my budget comes from my dad's help
i get paid monthly
that's kind of hard to have a budget
my mother doesn't get paid much money
her budget is just planning for i r a's
i went through that too when i was in school
i was working to get through college and trying to make it through that
i'm married and have a couple of children
we have to pretty much stick to a budget
i don't get any overtime or anything like that
we have to make sure that every dollar we have is spent accordingly
what we try and do to stick to our monthly budget is we pretty much have the house payment
we have the insurance premiums utilities and so forth
we do sit down at the beginning of every month or the end of every month and write down how much we know we're going to spend and set that money aside
we also try and set aside money for savings set aside money for the kids' college education the future and set aside money for bonds
we also set aside an emergency fund
None
we find out that no matter what kind of budget you stick on there's always going to be an unexpected car repair or something happen with the house that you have to have money for and not enough to go and to take a loan out but you have to have money for
then we have
whatever's left over is discretionary income
it's worked out very well
that's good
it's helped us so that we haven't been too long on the month and too short on the money and try and stick with that
nice thing about it my wife is excellent in that we both work together
we stick to it there's no surprises in that
i have four kids
i guess i should have specified
my goodness
i have four little boys
my goodne-
my parents divorced three years ago my sister had gotten through college
i was still in high school
my mother paid for a lot of my sister's college while my parents were together before the divorce she had saved for my college
when we had the divorce she just didn't get much money out of it and had to spend it all on getting another house
now my dad's paying for all of my college of
i have auditions coming up
what year are you in in college
you have a few more years
i'll probably have about two and a half years left
good for you
i imagine it is a little difficult to stick with a budget during that during school and so it forth
it sure is
i know how much my dad is going to give me every two weeks i don't spend over that
sometimes that's a little hard with books and music and sheet music and stuff you've got to work on too
there's always music books to buy
you're not a starving artist yet are you
there's enough of those in the world
who's not very well educated
there's enough out there that if you're educated enough then you can make money
that's why i'm
you know plenty about planning a budget
once again
i hope she's turned it in
i ju-
after five minutes when the voice comes on we can talk all night if we want
i'm afraid i'm probably in the minority
i actually don't think that we pay too much in this country particularly in this part of the country w-
i guess i do have a bone to pick with the way taxes are distributed
i just finished fuming at the fact that we pay an eight and a half percent sales tax and no income tax when the income tax could have been deducted from the federal form
it's kind of dumb
on the other hand i don't mind that it's only on things that aren't like
nobody taxes groceries
we have a pretty low tax rate here
i think the sales tax they just got to do something about it
that's the politicalness of trying to not create any new taxes
i guess when i see the comparison between the united states and any other western country their rates are forty-one forty-two and ours are thirty-six thirty-seven
there's no other country that is taxed as low as we are
i still think that having lived in europe for awhile
i'm not sure i understand what you mean
i think
i was in germany for several years
probably less so now than it was ten years ago or whatever
i look for example
you're not quite in the same situation
school taxes for me biggest bargain in the world
that's probably a little tougher on you
it's not quite the bargain that
i think it's a dumb decision on our part because countries like canada and england and germany do perfectly well with a two tract system in which religious schools coexist with secular schools with the same tax money
that's the way americans want to interpret it
if i were
i will not mind paying what it takes to keep the schools good
i think in places like california people are beginning to find that in areas that are fairly well off if you add the people of various sexual persuasions and those who never intend to marry and those who are retired and those are just looking for fun people with families turn out to be such a small minority that they can't get a tax bill passed no matter what happens
that seems like a cultural lapse
people always used to be willing to ante up for the schools
people would rather increase the fire department and cut down the schools
i think it's sad selfish and shortsighted
i have a wide variety of hobbies
therefore my reading pleasures are quite wide
i get a charge out of texas highway
which is very colorful and not being a native of texas but being here eleven years have a tendency to find out about the different areas of the state by reading it
my mother always gave me hers
i really enjoyed all the little things that you find out about texas
absolutely it's great the way that it's broken out and you can set up little trips and day trips and things
it's pretty neat
i like photography magazines
things
being an engineer in facilities i do read a lot of building magazines and plant engineering magazines and read up on different ways to do things and energy management type of magazines
kind of strange because it's not unusual to see an engineering manual or something laying around the house
i'll sit up and read just to refresh to keep active on it
i have an interest in art
i frequently purchase and read books mainly on water color because that's my big interest at the moment
that's great
i guess i like a variety of things lots of fiction type books
right now i'm occasionally reading on a book about the mardi gras in new orleans and its history
that's self improvement
that's kind of a hobby
it is self improvement from the standpoint of probably relaxing
i hate to
we have these classes we attend management classes
they give you books
the last book matter of fact i read was at america's service by carl albrecht
it talks about who the customer is and being customer oriented which falls in line with the t i culture here at texas instruments
one of it's great slogans is if you're not serving the customer you better be serving someone who is
that's all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer is
as you probably well know all of us are our own customer
every now and then i'm loaned a tape i can stick in the car cassette set on the way home to make the drive more enjoyable talking about better outlooks on things and the philosophy of pat hagerty and these kind of mind stimulating philosophy type
which all betters yourself
maybe i am into some things occasionally that i don't think of in terms of self improvement
they are
i don't label it as such
i don't know
i have attended some seminars that had some tapes that went with them but i guess not so much books although they sometimes have manuals and things
they would be things on how to be successful and sort of talking to yourself getting yourself in gear to sort of pull yourself up by your boot straps and do what you really want to do
how about items like the one minute manager which used to be a big
those are self improvements
our supervisor subtly bought all of us a book called what every supervisor should know
by a man named doctor bittel b i t t e l
it's a very layman's approach towards managing different types of people
the very last chapter is how to manage engineers
it's interesting
here again it's casual reading
it's not eaten up with a lot of mechanical stuff
it's really excellent fast reading
as you say sometimes it's difficult to know if it's
if he casually just walked into it and put down a stephen king book and i picked up one of them i might be a little more interested
that's a little heavy for me
they're hard to set down because it's so interesting
of course they're all just a little spookier than the movies
they're always challenging to get through one of them
i guess i also have been reading a lot of things on quality improvement and that type of thing because that's what i'm involved in a lot at work
in quality especially now days that's almost everything that comes across the airways
exactly right
yeah i think we name drop it a little too much and don't fully understand what it is we're saying
all that kind of rolls in together there
that's just kind of part of it
any other comments
not that i can think of
i think i'm under my quota a little bit
we just started
this is true
you too
good-bye
where i am we have an extremely lax dress policy at work
it varies every day from jeans one day to business suits the next
it's true
they tend to try to be real lax
supposedly the policy is we hire these wonderful creative people
we don't want to smush their creativity
you really will see people in jeans one day and business suits the next
i'm kind of that way too
where we are now what we're doing is some very big lawsuits that happen to have a heck of a lot of boxes of documents
i get to toting around boxes of documents several times a day
i can't see getting dressed up and wearing heels and stuff when you have to carry boxes of documents around
if i'm just going to be there working in the litigation center and doing odds and ends and stuff with the boxes of documents i dress down
if we're going to have a meeting where we're having the attorneys come in or other party's attorneys and stuff then i normally dress up
i'll wear a dress and hose and stuff
we're kind of that way too
i know where i am we work a lot with the customers
we have a lot of government folks come in all the time
if i know that they're going to be there i try to really watch it and like you say really dress up
if i know they're not
i've been doing a lot of reorganization the last couple of months the same way you are
it's just impossible to crawl down on the floor and dig through boxes in a dress
when i was at t i the first year or so we were sent out to our record retention facility to look through two thousand boxes
at that point the warehouse was over across the road
it wasn't air conditioned
we were there like in the middle of the summer
it was dusty and dirty
there was a fan at the very end of the row
that was it
we didn't really know we weren't supposed to
the supervisor from another area came up to us
this area where record retention is there's only a few people that work there
he knew who worked there
he came up to us
he just said who's your supervisor
he called our supervisor and our supervisor's supervisor
it went up all the way to the head of facilities
he didn't at least say to us did you know you're not supposed to do that
how awful
just yesterday though i saw a girl in the spine out here at lewisville that had on a pair of shorts
i don't care
you can call them culottes all you want
these were shorts
i don't care what else you call them
if they're above the knee they turn into shorts
these weren't even really full ones
they had a problem out here with it last summer wearing these shorts that were the real wide full ones
these weren't even those
these were pretty short black
they were very dressy
she had on black hose and black heels
she looked very very nice
you don't wear shorts to work
as far as i'm considered she was in violation
nobody says anything to them
if they just
the management doesn't ever seem to want to take an cut off that no
this is shorts
nobody will ever kind of take control and do that
it always gets annoying because the rest of us are going god we have a pair of those at home too
it sure would be cool and comfortable to wear
i've seen some people try to just come in over the weekend because they want to use the texteller machine
they have said no
during the week you see these women in the
just because you put on a pair of hose with them doesn't make them not shorts anymore
i've never seen them do it without hose
they always have hose on
still they're shorts
i think t i's dress code is pretty lax considering everything anyway
i didn't know that e d s has a very strict dress code
do they really
they spell it out
for men it's particular suits the pin stripe and the particular colors of shirts and wing tipped shoes
my god
it is definitely lined out
i couldn't afford to work there
and a particular kind of shoe high heel
it is spelled out
when i was looking at her materials when she first started she had her benefits package and all that kind of stuff
it told about the dress code
it said these are the color pastel shirts you may wear or white shirts with this kind of stripe in it for the men and this kind of shoe and hair just this way
e d s is very particular about this hair cuts
it was like you can't have such and such facial hair no beards and just really detailed
i see
i am more
a lot of bosses may say i'm nuts
i am more productive when i'm in pants
i am
i get things done faster than when i'm in a dress and heels
it's weird
i can get so much more done if i'm dressed comfortable
the time we were there at the warehouse we felt really bad because we had another person coming from washington our outside counsel
she was told that we were going to be in a warehouse
she really didn't get the idea that we were in the warehouse part of the warehouse not the office to the warehouse but the warehouse
she came with skirts just like she'd be going into the office
we'd try to say didn't you bring any pants or anything
we're out here in the warehouse
you got your skid of that wooden pallet of boxes
you're going to have unload you skid look at the documents in the boxes and then repack your skid
she was so she was so hot and miserable in the skirt
she finally tried to go buy a pair of pants
it was just completely miserable for her
i don't know
i just figure yeah
sometimes i worry about if i go in in pants
i never ever ever ever go in in a pair of jeans
i'll go in in pants
today i had on a pair of navy blue dress slacks and like a peach colored top and not cruddy but not a dress either
sometimes i wonder if stuff like that will hold you back if you don't dress in your dress for success business suits everyday if upper management doesn't notice that and remember that later on
i don't know if they do or not
i see a lot of the managers
they're in jeans
None
we have assistants to the general counsel
it's funny
there's one that always wears a suit
there's another one who's a little younger and a little more yuppish
he's always kind of in the khaki pants and a shirt
sometimes he wears the jacket to it
some of the patent attorneys have been real casual in their clothes
other ones tend to always wear a suit with a very starched cotton shirt
that's just
we've kind of had a variety there
i think a lot of times it's mainly who they're going to meet with
they're meeting with people that they know is going to be dressed that way then that's how they are
if there just going to be meeting with t i like to talk about a patent kind of thing and they're engineers that they're talking too they dress kind of like how the engineers are dressed
they're usually casual
that's the smart way to do it
it really is because your making
when they're meeting with the engineers who they know are going to be dressed down if they come in in a six hundred dollar three piece suit it's going to make the people they're meeting with feel very uncomfortable
it would me
it was good to talk to you
this is kind of a fun project
we've never got to talk to another person
this is a little different
it's kind of enjoyable
thanks a lot
i'm presently living in a house
first time
this is our fifth year in it i guess
it was a real excitement to go out and select the house and have one made and built
like you wanted it we were the fourth to build out of three hundred and forty houses
as we did with probably ninety-five percent of the people here in dallas-fort worth we bought a fox and jacobs home
they're good for about five years or four years
after that they start falling apart
i would not recommend f and j house for my dog to live in because they're overpriced
they're a cheap house
if you can't afford something good
you can call it a home because it's a place to go home and keep the rain off your head
as far as the costs for what your getting the longevity of the house is not worth it
in my case my husband is not a carpenter
in fact he's in electronics
he knew the only way we'd ever have a new home is if he would build it
it took him about two and a half years
he built us a house
it's a brick house
price-wise it was great because he did it all himself
that way we could kind of
we live in kind of a small town
it's nothing fancy
it's a house
it's real pretty
we're all comfortable in it
that's great
i have another gentleman friend of mine who had a house built
the city's a little upset with him
i understand you save a lot of money off by doing that
you can because that way your not having to pay the middle men and everybody else
i'll vouch for that
of course my husband did everything except
he came in and did the inside for us
that helped
we had to hire of course the plumbing and the brick and everything else nothing
that's great
have you been in it long
have you any plans to maybe expand or move onward
our kids are kind of still small now
we had thought before maybe a lot older we don't need such a large house that we'll sell it
he will not build a second one himself
we're having an architect friend of mine design a house for us
that can basically be put in any state
that's kind of
he's charging us about a buck a square foot to design it
he's certified and registered
least we know it's not going to fall in or something if it's built
i have heard that your approach is right
you can actually go out and sub it even if you don't want to get hands on
that's kind of the plan i have
everyone i talk to i file in my little book and do other things with it
like i said otherwise the expense
we could not have one as large as we have if we hadn't did it ourselves
it's not an eldorado house or anything like that
it's ours
you only have to satisfy yourself and no one else
apparently the appraisers likes it because our taxes sure is high
that's an encouraging sign if you ever want to resell i guess
i'm always shocked at about what they have it appraised at
that's great
it was nice talking to you
real problem the last few days one of their young hopeless stars has apparently ruined his knee for this season
they really don't have an excess of catchers
it's really kind of late to start be trying to trade for somebody especially with the salary cap that the rangers have
i would gladly take the salary of most of the guys i'll tell you
i used to go take my son
i'll have to admit i kind of went more to see the other team a lot of times than i did the rangers
i think they're doing better
i do to
i have boys eight and eleven
we go quite often
i do too
i think what caught so many of our attentions last year was that nolan ryan
of course
he just pitched his first exhibition game a day or so ago
he pitched five full innings
that was almost unheard of for a pitcher to start out that strong
no big deal
he really is an
last year i just figured they was under a lot of pressure because of all the publicity and everything
they've got i guess all
all their players are signed now
there's no hold outs
that should help
in a way i really do
of course there's a few more i think are good ball teams also
you haven't
i have a few times
they're a good ball team
wouldn't it be something to have a world series between the rangers and the astros
wouldn't it though
my goodness
we might actually get to go to a world series
there are a lot of ranger fans around
there sure is
they really are
now incavalia i don't know how familiar you are with him
last year i was kind of thinking he sure did get in a slump
they're saying this year their predictions is that he's really going to come out of it and
they're not sure they're going to be able to sign him again
that may or may not happen
you never know
if you offer them money i'm sure they'll do a little bit of everything
None
i really haven't
those cowboys have increased their prices again this year
i didn't know
i don't think i've heard anything on the rangers
i don't remember it if i have
i hadn't either
we hadn't
we try to go so often
if you have young children they get a kick out of it
they do
i've enjoyed talking to you
you too lori
hopefully we'll get to talk again
what is
it says what you would have for a dinner party
this is strange because i pressed one and i thought it said begin
maybe we're all set
that's wonderful
if i can find it
i have this new fondue pot
i was going to do basic cheese fondue
i have two different kinds of breads and some ham
i was going to try something weird which
i was going to make some fish chunks and dip it in the fondue
some people like swiss
i'll mix
i won't have a sharp cheddar because for fondue i think it should be a little calmer than real sharp
i was going to make other things like potato skins
that sounds good
see you don't necessarily have to dip this stuff
i was going to have broccoli and cauliflower for a vegetable
i think they like to have healthy stuff too
it's
i think better even than other kinds of food
my girlfriend's do catering
always about every party they do is they have a vegetable tray
what i've been doing when i get invited someplace and bring something i make food kabobs
pineapple and strawberry
even have you ever seen where they'll take a watermelon and just cut the top out of it and then hollow that out
they made a couple of those
they made one for my bridal shower
i was pretty pleased
they look easy enough to make
i think it would be a lot of work
it's
you have to cut each thing or use the melon baller and stuff
i think they're really neat
i think they're worth the time because they
you get probably pretty sticky after you get done
then you've got to drain the water out of the watermelon because when you scrape it it makes the water
something i do is a fruit
i'll make chocolate sauce and dip strawberries and bananas in them
they go melt some chocolate chips
is that good
i've seen that so many times strawberries dipped in chocolate
i've never tried it
if you get a sweet strawberry they're much better
if you get a sour strawberry
i bet it doesn't mix well does it
the strawberries are coming in season now from
they're coming up from florida of course
they're really reasonably priced
that's good
i know they've been really expensive lately
of course they had to be grown in greenhouses and stuff and in
actually i think they get some of them from south america
is that right
a lot of a winter produce comes from south america
do you want to discuss the recipe
it filled
i make my own homemade pudding just because i don't like box pudding
it if you
i put it in a two quart saucepan
you put it on a really low heat
you want to use one of your good sauce pans that dissipate the heat because it ends up burning
no matter how careful you are you still might get a film on the bottom of the pot
i get the milk lukewarm
i pour about a half a cup of cornstarch in it
i have this thing
it makes a whip topping out of milk if you get the milk cold enough
it's i don't know
is it a hand held
they used to whip skim milk into a dessert
i didn't get that one
it's real handy because it doesn't have a cord
you beat this cornstarch right into the milk
it does an excellent job
just hand beat it
i don't think it gets it good enough
before the milk gets too hot i add two beaten eggs and i really mix them in good and then about a half a cup of sugar
i let it pretty much
i beat it every minute for about ten seconds
it starts thickening
it gets little globs of this rubbery cornstarch
you just keep beating it in
it's the
the trick is to have this blender
if you were
someone who's just going to make it first time it's
you can add cocoa powder to it to make chocolate
after it's thickened i cook it for a good
once it starts boiling i cook it for a good seven to ten minutes
you can make chocolate
you can take it off and let it cool
you put really good vanilla favoring in it and some butter
that makes french vanilla custard
are you saying to use for chocolate unsweetened
that cocoa the unsweetened
i have some
i used to make the regular pudding the chocolate and put it in the pie shell
if it would sit in the refrigerator for a day where you cut the pie it would soak into the pie shell
it was red
i'm
how did you get a recipe for pudding on your own
actually i found it in one of my mother's homemade cookbooks
i think you couldn't make it with a hand whisk or a regular beater
i still think a beater would do it good enough
right in the lukewarm milk
i would put it in the sink
i'll take my lukewarm milk and put it in the cornstarch and beat it good
it seems to be better than putting the cornstarch into the liquid
once it hits the top of the liquid it seems to make little balls and stuff on the top
you put the milk in the cornstarch
i'll do this
sometimes i'll put my after i pour that back into my saucepan
put that back in the saucepan
if you can put your cocoa in with your cornstarch if you wanted to the cocoa even seems to thicken it even more
by the vanilla doesn't seem to thicken as well as the
my husband really likes it thick
i'm always worrying it won't firm up because when you take it out of the saucepan it's like boy i hope this thickens a little more because it's not like real package thick
it's a little less
i put it in a nice glass bowl
some people don't like that film on the pudding
you can put saran wrap over the top
once the pudding starts cooling it makes little balls of water on the saran wrap
when you pull the saran wrap back you sort of should be a little careful pull it back and shake the water off the saran wrap
i might put it back on
do you put it in the refrigerator then
when it starts steaming a lot i definitely put it in the refrigerator
i
i don't know
that's my great hard recipe
you haven't
if you were what do you think about the whole concept of a trial by your peers
i think it's a good idea
i'm not sure what needs to be done to fix it
i think they've got a lot of problems
i don't know if that's just a pure volumes number or what
sometimes i think the jury is ignorant in the facts of law and how things should be determined
they're too easily swayed by their emotion
would you prefer all trials by a judge
i think there are certain things that the jury can determine as far as guilty or not guilty
as far as the affixing of punishment and fines and things of that nature
two point two million dollar kind of settlement versus a judge knowing it's true that this may be sad and all that thing
the jury i think is best in most cases suited for determination of guilt and innocence but not the award of penalties and fines and punishment
i think they sometimes get carried away by the circumstances and make huge settlements thinking it's only going to cost the insurance company
i do like the idea of the jury being the people who decide in the matter of if it's a jail term versus life and death the death penalty and such
when it comes to sentencing phase i guess they tell them if the person has a previous record and stuff
sometimes it seems like during the trial part the jury's misses some of the best evidence because they make them leave
the judge decides whether or not they should hear it
it's kind of difficult
i guess the whole system is set up to rather let some guilty people go free than to put an innocent person in jail although you still hear about those occasionally
i don't know
i heard a very interesting
maybe it's just the t v show or movie i was watching
i think it was on one of the documentary t v shows where they ask for the verdict by the jury they went by each one saying guilty or innocent guilty or innocent
they took it more as just a majority
i
some of them said one way and some the other
they took whatever the majority was
i didn't know if that was just something for drama or that's truly the way it is
rather interesting
i thought that they all had to agree
else it was a hung jury
i did also
i don't know how i feel about that
i think maybe majority might be sufficient
i guess the problem with that is there's no true authority in any kind of international verdicts like the old day with the rack
they're going to say okay you're guilty and you have to pay kuwait four million dollars
whose going to really make them
i think it would be kind of interesting to incorporate that concept of people from different countries in as international law also
i don't know what it would take to come up with a true perfect system if one exists
is that the crime
it's already some chart and determine the punishment
if you're convicted of a certain crime you automatically get so many years
i think there should be a core minimum that they get i guess there should be some flexibility because every situation may be unique that the judge can either increase that or keep it just at its minimum things of that nature
that serves a kind of if they're i guess
i guess you're eligible after twenty-seven for parole even though you're in for life
sometimes those people are young enough they can still get out and cause a lot of trouble
although i guess it's you want them to rehabilitate and become better rather than sitting in there and being a drain all the time
inside the jail i don't think there's no real rehabilitation
who knows
i think maybe they ought to just be punished with some kind of real punishment like hard labor for a shorter length of time
actually make them do something that's not pleasant and do it and get it over with and get back in the world and not spend so much time sitting around letting the bad influences of the other ones rub off on them
cleaning up or picking up dirt or weeds or who knows what something for the state
since the state is paying for them they should get some kind of work out of them
i think that covers it
how many credit cards do you have
i've got about four maybe
i try to limit them because i don't use them too much
i use my visa just for about everything
i pay it all off
i try not to
my wife was carrying a different one
since the slips all look alike you commingle them
you get the statement
you try to sort them out
None
when a t and t came along and offered a free one i accepted that
we've been using that one
the interesting thing is the amount of money you can run up on them
do you know any people that run up big bills
i'm in the age group you get out of college
i think a lot of these people have them maxed out
were you able to get one while you're in college
i don't think i ever tried
he's heading off with any kind of luck
there has been
i've had a couple of ads to provide a card for a college student
what do you think about the idea of providing one for somebody like that
i
it's feasible
i know a lot of college kids who had them but just depends
i guess from the card issuer that
since the parent gets it for them that really the parent becomes the one that's responsible
basically if you want to take the risk
do you trust your son
to go run up a big bill
the thing is there some advantages if he got off some place and stranded
i'm leaning towards doing it for a convenience
i'd say have one with at least a thousand dollar credit limit or something
the idea that if he got in trouble there's some ways of getting out and that he doesn't have to carry cash
i like the idea of credit cards that i don't carry cash around and i don't even carry checks around
she writes the checks
i record them
it's interesting that the amounts of money you can run up on credit cards
i had recently had some dealings with a fellow that
he was making considered a modest salary for an engineer
he had run up more than a years salary in various debts to
he wound up declaring bankruptcy
it's hard to believe that you'd run up twenty thirty thousand dollars of
it was a combination of things he had
there were several credit cards
there were several other businesses
i guess what's interesting have you seen the ads where they're offering to extend payments from things like the credit union's offering be more than 1 slash unit
the extended loan payment for your car
the interesting thing about that is that they're encouraging you to incur more debt
it's business
they're making money off that
they make more money if you extend your loan
it's business
you notice that they're only going to do it to cars that are one or two years old
they've already shifted the risk
they'll recover the loan
they know that people own a car that new unless absolutely die of service can't be right transcription
the interesting thing about it is that in economics
i think it's poor economics to carry all that consumer debt at least from a tax standpoint
it's interesting that the american public is encouraged to incur all that debt and then next year none of it will be deductible
this year it's ten percent or so
it's interesting that they encourage us to do things
what's ten percent we can deduct
of your consumer credit
if you had a thousand dollars that means there's another hundred dollar deduction i've given you
any thing on
it's on yeah
a mortgage i know you can
on the
there's a place for consumer debt
you take ten percent of it
i've never itemized yet
maybe that's
it's on
schedule a under
it's the same place you put interest
see that's what makes texas squirrelly laws that you can't take out a second mortgage like some states where you can take out the mortgage and declare that
it's fully deductible
it basically comes down to
anyway
i just try to stay out of debt
i use my visa for as much as i can
i pay it all off
sounds like you're very financially responsible
he's got just enormous debts
what do you say it's shucks
he's had two kids in college and this kind of thing
that i think that the whole credit card issue i think they certainly encourage people to run up the debts
i agree with you i my debts
i did buy a new house last summer
i'll never do that again
it's remarkable how many people as soon as they get out of college buy a new car
apparently that's been going on for a really long time
i bought a second hand car when i was the middle of my senior year
you think you're starting out well until you start paying all those bills
apartment rent
it's amazing what you learn
anything else good to say about credit cards
they're convenient
it's certainly accepted the places
i was used to using my credit card at skaggs alpha beta in dallas and stuff now i'm out here in phoenix
they don't do tha-
now i have to carry cash when i go to the grocery store which is new to me
that was interesting cause i always
they've started towards a little bit of the debit card
i think that's where
the banks will line up with
so many of the grocery stores don't do that because of the time frame which they get paid in general
i've seen checks cleared my account the next day
almost
i guess it's the day after
they took that check and scurried it to the bank
the bank scurried it back to my account
you thought there'd be just a little bit of float
apparently that's why the grocery stores are reluctant to do that because their volume that is quite high
they have
it's good talking to you
maybe we'll cross paths again
now it's all over with
it is over
i don't think we're out of there by any means
i wonder are we going to set up peace keeping type forces for long term
is that something we should do or shouldn't do
i guess they're anti u s in that region
now they're
syria and egypt had some pressure against the u s
now they wouldn't allow us to have a base in that region
now i think they are rethinking that
the other thing that i think is good for american businesses are to be involved is the reports that i hear back
of course on the news i try to listen and also read between the lines
they said that because the americans took such a proactive stance involvement in the war that
so much of the business and the rebuilding in kuwait and things like that will go to american businesses where as before they may be dealt with japanese firms or other people
they said even though the japanese were involved monetarily they still
the first priority ought to go to american businesses which will be good for our economy
i
we don't seem to slow down even when there is a crisis
a few people i guess will make a few people pretty wealthy in construction and so forth
what good is that
if i can't have it you can't have it
that sounds like something a little kid would do
look at their war
you're right
it's like you see two little pre-school kids fighting over a toy
i am a little concerned about
i know they are putting president bush right now in an awkward position concerning the treaty over there right now
the deal with the supporting the kurds
supporting the kurds
the cease-fire
i'm trying to say another
because he wants them to uphold their end of the deal as far as the cease-fire
at the same time he's not wanting to go in and say okay i'm going to fight your war for you which i think is right
if it's an internal thing i don't think we can walk in and say gee i think you're right and you're wrong
i know that that's causing him a little bit of unpopularity with the people over there because they feel like gee you told us
i think he's in a pretty awkward position now
i think we ought to help
i don't think we ought to be over there fighting it for them
i think he's done good on that stance
i think bush has handled this whole situation quite well
he stood up to the bully and
saddam hussein miscalculated all along
thinking that he wouldn't commit u s lives and forces and monies just to liberate a little country
then he underestimated his ability to wage a war with us
one thing when we all came over there and said okay here we are get out he said no i can win a war with you guys
that was a horrible miscalculation
they'd advertised and said in the news and said he had the fifth largest army
he may have
not any more
you have to have loyalty
i know they tried to turn it into a holy war because to them that is what's honorable
i think they are smart enough
he uses it
i think the people were smart enough to realize that
i think they're afraid of him is what they are
i don't think he's going to be there too much longer
i hope that's true
someone is going to assassinate him
i would think that
i guess in the back of my mind i think maybe the israeli massad probably has ideas of going in and
i thought they showed a tremendous restraint in their reactions towards everything
i don't believe for a minute that that means that they don't have ideas and plans of their own
i do agree with you
i think president bush handled it all politically very smart giving the support of the other arabs and other nations in the world
i think that's how you have to go into something like that
i've heard reports that president bush was staking his future on this war and that setting a precedent saying that this league of nations will always combine against bullies and to stop this kind of stuff in the world
any would be bully would think twice if he knew that
don't you feel
you just can't do it and get away with it hoping that
the nations will combine against you
you can't just do this
don't you think that long term that's been a big boost for the united nations
the united nations been there for years but all of a sudden
had no teeth
the fact that when they have sanctions and we support things like this it means something
i think that's good for the strength of the united nations
i guess i feel sorry for just the average iraqi
rebuild from nothing
living conditions must be terrible
it's not getting any better
except for a few medical supplies they are allowing through now and then powdered milk i guess for babies and things
until they
i guess yesterday they came out with these rules i guess or whatever
for a permanent cease-fire
the kuwaitis said we don't want to have to repay israel for all the bombing that we did that was in there you
that's only fair
i think they should have to
we don't want a kuwait there just has no power at all
that
that's true
we don't want to be stabilized to the point where iran will say now is our chance to go in and wipe them out
i don't think iran is under the same type of madman type leadership
there's always the possibility i guess
i think the person who really may be at this time has a hard road to tow is jordan's king hussein because he really tried to kind of straddle the fence
he wasn't necessarily for iraq
at the same time he didn't feel everybody ought to be going against iraq
yet so many of the citizens are the lebanese
and trying to connect with israel all that time
there really was no connection at all
boy those lebanese in jordan they were saying this whole war is israel's fault because israel told the united states to attack iran
it was israel controls our government
one thing i did learn was how deep the hatred runs toward israel by a lot of countries
anyway they can see to connect into something and hate it more
they just
actually purchased it and then moved in and started a country
you are also getting back to the ages old problem of arab-israeli conflict
theirs tie so much to their religion
they both have holy sanctions
very different things than what we face
what do you is think is the main change in
i'm thirty years old
we're both children of the very early sixties
i've seen some change
i know when i was young most mothers pretty much were housewives
stayed at home with the kids
to me it seems its almost the opposite now where the woman is working and they take the children to child care
maybe they work part-time or something
that seems to be a pretty big change
i
it's funny
it's both of us then were really just adolescents when
it seems to me that the early seventies was a period of the most change
if i had to somewhat abstract about it it seems to be the major change has been that woman have acquired more choice
that's true
that's sort of the meta change as it were where that woman really have more of a choice now about what they do
course they find that the choice creates its own hardships in a way because life is not quite as simple even if it is for your
it does seem
an awful lot of my adult women friends are anguishing over some of these choices
i know the choice to either work or to be a mother is probably pretty difficult because i think women just naturally tend to have those instincts that you protected the children
yet there's so many material things to be had out there that a lot of people think if we both work we can get a really big house
it's kind of almost expected of you anyway
people kind of look down on the role of a woman as a housewife
it's kind of like she didn't go to college
i only know
of my friends who have children
i have a lot of respect for her because she made it as a real choice
she decided that was what she wanted to do in her life
she wanted that role
i say all power to her because she's an example to me of someone who really does have the choice
i feel that a lot of women don't
they don't necessarily feel that they do because they no longer feel like if they were just to be a parent rather than a sort of super woman success in the business world as well
it's not a choice anymore
frankly it's the way that men are
men don't have this choice
in most subcultures in america that i've been exposed to if the man were to say no i've decided not to work i want to stay home and do the child rearing my wife has a good job and i want her to keep that
and i'm going to be the primary caretaker and then take care of the children because we don't want to put them in day care and this and that i think most americans would feel funny about that
it's
i think i've seen it once
there's a t v show where the man is the one raising the kids
there is a t v show out there
i know there are cases of where that happens
i knew people who did that years ago
they were very apologetic about it
you could tell they were used to people saying what are you doing that for
in fact it seems it's kind of like anything goes now
when the husband's the one at home raising the children
i've seen more and more companies that have parental leave not just maternity leave
one of the area supervisors in my area as a matter of fact took off for a couple of weeks when his wife had their baby
instead of having a nurse or someone come in or something like that mid-wife or whatever they call it that they have for the first couple of weeks
i don't know if he took that out of his vacation or if they really do have a paternity
it might have just been him describing the fact that he was taking vacation days to go be a father for a little while
i'm not real sure how that goes
the other big change i see in woman's lives is
they are having children much later in life
my friends who are having children are having them at age thirty
if i'd been a couple of generations ago they would have had kids running around by then
people they in general are just getting married a lot later
i'm sure i'll be one of those women in her thirties when i get around to ever getting married and having kids
i think that's getting a little more common too
i actually think that i'm somewhat encouraged by that trend because after all people live longer lives now
so it's not you're going to pass away before your child is an adult
barring unforeseen circumstances
i think most people make better parents when they are a little bit more mature
it gives her a little more option if she wants to stay home with the children while they're young
once they've gotten to school age maybe she could go back to work
she's kind of got that option
if they wait till later they've saved up some money
it's not as difficult for her to stay at home with the kids and live off one income or something
i guess i'm pretty encouraged
then i'm a product of my generation
it sure seems nice to me
i have other things to complain about
in terms of woman's roles
things really seem a lot more flexible
i seem to see more women in leadership type roles and management positions
it's still a small minority
it's an improvement
the mayor of dallas is a woman
i'm sure that twenty years ago that never would have happened
i think she's in her second term now
she's
i think she's
we do and we have several council women that are women
in fact the governor of texas is a woman too
what's her name
you're starting to see more of that
i know when i was younger it was all the presidents and still all the presidents are men
i'm sure that one of these days
i guess one of these days we'll eventually have
that's right although during the presidential debates there was some really nasty patronizing
i thought she was treated badly for being a woman
by
who really i thought had a demeaning attitude towards her
it was acceptable to say certain types of things to her that she couldn't say back
that kind of thing which i found myself getting quite enraged about
really that's a previous generation
i think we've gotten our five minutes
they've gotten their five minutes worth of us
what's your views on it
i think it's a good idea
i grew up
graduating high school in sixty-eight i remember when the peace corps movement first came about
i thought it was a very good idea at the time
i was one of those kennedy children if you know what i mean
right now i see a lot of kids who get out of school have no idea what they want to do
there's a lot of things out there that we could do for our own country
i think that we've got the people power to do it
it's just
we need to channel it and focus it on some things that need some fixing up
some examples are some of the things like jimmy carter's been involved in a little program to fix up housing for people
there's a lot of housing
i know in the area that i live in that's run down and beat up
it could be fixed up and used
it's just sitting there wasting away
i'm same generation
i think
i think it ought to be mandatory for kids to either do military service or public service one of the two
a lot of reasons for that not just because i'm a hard ass or anything
either the military or public service organization can give them a lot of focus
i think that it might stop us some problems later on
these kids will get their heads on straight and figure out what they want to do instead of hanging around street corners selling drugs or something
i think it would be good for them
i think a lot of people grow up with preconceived notions what the world's about
there's a heck of a lot of difference between the intake that you get from t v and movies and what you hear in school and then what reality is
i remember i've worked since i was
i started delivering papers when i was ten
i had a real job when i was thirteen
i've worked most of my life
i remember when i got out of high school all through high school was
i wanted to go to college
i had the grades to go to college
i got accepted to college
when i got out of high school i kind of said what am i going to do now
it's
when i actually started working full time i got married shortly after getting out of high school
i thought i was smart ran away and got married
i remember there was a time within the first year of marriage i said boy wouldn't i give to be back in school
and just have to do homework and go work my part time job
most of them aren't
you look at the number of marriages that are occurring right even in high school
you wonder where are the parents in all of this
why isn't somebody stepping in and putting a stop to this
they have no idea what the world is like
i was in the same boat when i left high school
my parents wanted me to go straight to college
i didn't
i was ready
i joined the air force and ended up staying there for thirteen years
i had lived in my own little bubble up until that time
after traveling around the world a few times i realized that things ain't the way they seem
i did a lot of growing up there
i think once kids get out and see how other people really live
if you're willing to work for it
it's just like you say there's so much stuff that needs to be done here in this country
if you could have a thought of something like a peace corps sort of organization this would be so useful for instance just helping old folks
they need help
it would be nice to have somebody come over and cut their yard or paint their house or do minor repairs or something like that
i
my parents are in their late sixties now
many of the people that live around them are unable to do those things for themselves anymore
it's really hard on them
the thought that i see the mall rats walking around the mall nothing better to do than just walk around the mall all day long when they could be doing something to help someone
there's a nice warm feeling
i was a boy scout
the whole bit and
it got to the point where me and my brother both were gone and she couldn't maintain the house without large expenditures of money
it finally got to a point where she just had to sell it and move into an apartment
i'm not saying that that wouldn't have happened anyway
it would have been nice if there had been somebody to come around and take care of the little things like the yard work and little repairs and painting and stuff like that
i think there'd be a economic benefit for everyone concerned
those doing the work and those receiving the services
the kids who would be giving the service are going to get a lot more out of it than just money
that
i remember when i was a kid i used to do little things for the old folks around the neighborhood
i know how it made me feel
people just don't help people anymore
they're out for themselves
i think president bush covered that in his state of the union address this year when he said that it's time for the individuals to start thinking about what they can do to help each other out instead of counting on government to do everything
that's the point we've gotten to
the government's going to be limited
where are they going to get the money
we can do it a lot more efficiently than the government
the thing that carter works on habitats for humanity i was involved in that in montgomery before i came up to north carolina
it was a pretty neat little program
everybody else would donate their time
the materials were at cost
we'd put up houses
that was kind of neat
in a way i think it's a little bit inefficient
it's better than nothing
at least i had the opportunity of seeing two families move into decent housing
course on the other hand i can start complaining very loudly about people on public assistance who are quite capable of doing something for themselves but just won't
because it's far more advantageous for them to sit there and just draw welfare money than it is to work
we did a cost comparison in one of my courses
we took all the benefits that a married couple with two kids would get under welfare what they would be making at minimum wage
they came out four thousand dollars better a year by taking welfare
there's no incentive for them to do anything
one of the things they tried to push through in maryland weren't very successful was that if you were an able-bodied person on welfare
that was tried in alabama too
it got shot down
i don't understand the reasoning for it
it seems perfectly logical that if somebody's going to take public money then they should return something to the public
if nothing else go out along an interstate and pick up garbage
what do they do in maryland
do they use prisoners
that's the way they did it in alabama too
usually you'd see these big chain gangs out there
they have another program in maryland that's called adopt a highway
good afternoon to you mary
let me ask you what's the weather like up there to begin with
today when i got up it was twenty-nine degrees
it managed to get up to about fifty this afternoon
it's been cloudy overcast and threatening rain all day
i bet that's that storm we had last night
we had a frog strangler go sweeping through here yesterday and last night
we're expecting another one tonight
it was raining so hard you could swim down the street
no rain at all yesterday and no rain today
it's probably on its way up there
couldn't you send us some nice weather
it was nice today
was it
in between the thunder showers
what they say about the weather here in texas
if you don't like it five minutes it'll change
that's about the way our weather is here also
i grew up in saint louis
saint louis was much the same
tell me is it normally that cold up there in the spring
this is about ten degrees cooler than usual
about a week ago we were up to eighty and eighty-five degrees
it fluctuates from one extreme to the other it seems
are you sure you didn't leave your refrigerator door open
no it really was extremely warm
all of a sudden a cold front came down and temperatures dropped thirty degrees in a very short length of time
it has gone down gradually each day
mother macree
it really wasn't too pleasant
i sincerely hope that you don't have that terrible storm we had
i hope
they are predicting rain and thunderstorms
i wouldn't be a bit surprised by what we would not be getting the same weather you had
if it's the same as what we had at least it'll be warmer
of course by the time it gets up here it may run into a cold front coming down from canada
whew that would be tear disastrous if you
a week ago they had golf ball size hail coming down in one part of the city of dayton itself
then we just had about an inch and a half or two inches of rain in less than an hour
it wasn't conditions to being out in it
i had just gotten home
i had gotten home shortly before that the rain started
i felt a little more secure that i was at home rather than having to be out driving in it
i heard on the news this morning that one of our local schools lost the roof of their gymnasium
they suspected may have been a tornado
thank god for small favors the
what do they call them the marching band or something
had just quit rehearsal about a half hour before
that was very fortunate for them because that could have really been disastrous
how
of course this is tornado season
in to
now we're in the southwestern part of ohio
northern indiana has many tornadoes come roaring across
we get the backlash off of it if not the part of the tornado itself
we get a lot of bad weather in this area
of course you're supposed to be the sun belt
i do know that you get some freezing weather down there on occasion
during the winter
we've had
of course people down here they just don't know how to handle themselves
i was going to say that it does make a difference when you're not accustomed to
we're don't have the equipment to handle it either
all you can do with freezing rain of course is spread sand on the ice
we don't even have vehicles that will do that
they have to get a truck of sand and four or five laborers up there just spreading it by hand
here what they do and i contend that it's certainly not the right thing to do they spread salt
of course the salt does melt the ice
then what melts immediately freezes and becomes a perpetual problem
to make matters worse it destroys your vehicles too
it sure does do that
they do that down here too
sand and
i have learned to do is to carry bags of salt in the trunk of my car
not only in case i need it for that for traction but for additional weight
of course kitty litter is also excellent for that i don't know whether you've ever thought in terms of
the dogs don't use litter
kitty litter is excellent for getting under the wheels of cars
it works out really quite well
course i have a dog also
my son brought me a little lhasa apso for my birthday last thanksgiving
wasn't that nice of him
he just thought i had been without a dog for three years
he had
i have a chowperd myself
a what
that one i'm not familiar with
she's part chow and part shepherd
she's the best of both breeds
i've always had big dogs before never had a little dog before
she is scared to death of thunder storms
i had a german shorthair that was frightened of storms
i had to push him down when he was fourteen
two months later i had to put my yellow lab down
that must be nice
it was great
then i didn't need all that anymore so i finally sold that
i'm in a fair size condo
i have a nice size patio
this little dog has plenty of room to run
he is a cutie
i've never had a dog i had to keep taking to the groomer's to have groomed either
it sounds you ought to be in a condo down in miami beach somewhere
better yet down around saint petersburg florida
is that right
i was there once way back in nineteen-sixty i think for just a week's vacation
that's about the only time i've been to florida except passing through on the way to someplace else
i lived there in the seventies
i love it
most of my friends do spend a lot of time down in florida
that's just not been my thing
now that i'm alone i prefer to travel overseas if i'm going anywhere
course there too you never know what the weather's going to be
that's
why i was suggesting that saint petersburg got to be the finest weather in the world
is that right
i loved it down there
course you could always tell which were the natives-
is that right
i think our experience of camping is
i am the passive member
my husband is a good camper
they
they do the work
i have fun
you said your family was all grown up now
did you take them camping
i thinks it's a marvelous activity for younger families because
it seems like i would go through a period of time where i just was really overworked
getting out into nature and relaxing
and having the family do a good share of the work
the part that i did was more fun than labor because they did the running and toting chores and i just helped cook and kind of organize
even cooking over an open fire is a little more fun isn't it
have you done the big pot cooking
it was really my ex who did the cooking back when we first started
we found that what was one great handy things was this hamburger helper
it was enough for all six of us
that's interesting
interesting enough the food part was kind of important thing in our camping
when my oldest son
the neat breakthrough was when my oldest son mark took his cooking merit badge in
mark was the kind of camper who ate beef stroganoff
he did it up really good
after he took that merit badge he did all the shopping and getting ready for it
that's great
it was a marvelous experience because after that then all i had to do was follow the instructions and do
we did a lot of interesting kinds of things
i would take corn bread and cook a pan inside of a pan over a camp stove
it works real good
just put a thing on it
really just commune with nature
we started out
we were living in florida at the time
early in life we discovered that six people all going on vacation gets to be very very expensive
my ex decided we're going to try camping
she went out one day on the spur of the moment and bought a tent
that's how we got started
we did it for years and years
in florida are there times of the year when it's very comfortable to camp or is it always kind of hot
ye-
in the winter time yes
it can get chilly
there's really no time of the year that you can't go
is that true
we're in texas now
you're in texas
we have not camped a great deal here because a good share of the time in the summer time it's too hot really to be very comfortable camping
it just depends on where you go
we camped mostly
when the kids were little we were in new jersey and
where abouts
in allendale and waldwick
we'd go up to the adirondacks and camp
it was so pick your own blueberries and make blueberry pancakes for breakfast
i come from up in that area
are you
yeah
that's a neat area
that is a particularly neat area for camping because
that i wouldn't know
there's a lot of trees lot of mountains and lot of hiking sort of things
we had little clipper sail boat
we would sail and did a lot of camping that way
i outgrew sleeping bags and tents
i now have a motor home
do you
it's fun too i think
i live in mine
you kind of an everyday camper
yes
are you living alone now
just me and my dog
you and your dog
we don't camp quite as much as we used to
i still think it's a great way to spend a time with your family
and enjoy nature and kind of wipe out the stress of everyday life
i'd always come home just relaxed and comfortable and ready to go at it again
it was a neat activity
are you from dallas too beth
we're in plano
we've been here about eighteen years
that's where i am
are you
we're all lots of people from t i up this way
dear that's a hard one
that's really hard for me because i have a son that's sixteen
i think eventually he'll be of drafting age
i think gosh do i want him to go
yet i'm proud to be an american
i know that we have a country that people would give anything to live in a lot of people anyway because we have so many wonderful things that they don't have
yet i don't know whether i'd be willing to give his life for this country
yet i know that
when i was in school it was always the tired excuse that we went to war to save us against communism
i'm not sure that that's the reason anymore not sure that communism is as strong as it once was
i'm not sure that that's the reason why we were in vietnam supposedly so
with the
you realize why we were in the middle east why we invaded iraq why we were in saudi why we attacked kuwait and why we are still fighting iraq
it's because of oil isn't it
saddam is a madman
he's a bad person very definitely
if
i can see that he was in kuwait kuwait was the nonaggressor the saudis are our allies
they've been our through thick and thin
at what cost
that's the thing it came out wonderfully supposedly
everything is we won
that's wonderful
what if that wasn't the case
would it have been too much of a price to pay for that
i think there are a lot of things that we don't know
there's a lot
i think there's a lot that the public doesn't need to know
i think there's some things we shouldn't know just for national security sake
i think if we did know i think there would be a lot more chaos than there is because i don't think people could handle it
i think there are things that the masses shouldn't know
i also agree that there are a lot of crooks and liars too
it's
one of the guys that was on the jury they were asking him if you could believe a lawyer or if a
one guy being selected snickered and couldn't keep his head up
the guy said can you share it with us what you find so funny
he says i already told you my sons a lawyer
he told him dad how to tell when a lawyers lying to you
my gosh
ninety percent of all politicians
by definition all lawyers and politicians are liars
what's it going to cost us in the long run there in saudi
i don't know i can't tell the future that's what scares me so much about it
i thought the war was going to go on and on
we hit them with more in one month than we used in the last three years of vietnam
whenever you strike on open terrain with that sheer volume there's nothing they can do about it
it's not like we
honestly if there was a well perceived war world wide this was it
what i can't understand is then many of the kuwaiti youth wouldn't fight
it's not their job to fight for their own land
None
yet see that's another thing that's difficult for americans
their culture is so much different than ours
i've heard from many people that we could not even begin to understand how they feel about things because their values and their perceptions are so much different than ours
they just don't think the same way we do
really from all indications the iraqi beliefs if you will are more similar to our own
the kuwaitis aren't even helping rebuild their own country
i didn't realize that
my word
the u s army is doing it all
that's another question you have to ask is this our job
should we still be there even
i think it's
i'm not sure they really are one hundred percent sure
they talked to one kuwaiti woman yesterday
her biggest concern in life was that she couldn't get a housekeeper
do you have a housekeeper
don't plan on having one either ever
i wouldn't mind having one
i'd love to have one
None
i'd like to make sure that i have a job tomorrow first
it astound
i wasn't aware of that
for doing nothing
that ought to give their programming trouble shouldn't it
they do nothing
they're part of
we support our schools here with property taxes
the land owners or home owners are the ones that pay the school tax
if you're renting a house or doing anything else you're not actually contributing to the education of your children
i think that's wrong
as it turns out we don't really have a tremendous education system because they don't have the money they need to run it
i spent a couple years down in plano texas
i was one of the home owners down there that got taxed to death
for the plano school system
i know that texas doesn't have a state tax
all the things come out of the property taxes
i was really shocked at the amount of taxes i ended up paying
i was better off paying a state tax back in maryland where
than i was paying the property tax down there
what they did in maryland to get around that is they developed a renters tax solely for the purpose of paying for the services
that the renters were getting including the educational services
the tax was administered by the rental company that actually was managing the apartments
long long time ago when i used to live in apartments i would pay a rent payment every month and a tax payment every month
the tax payment went to pay for the services that i was getting as a resident of that particular county
that's the way it worked
here in maryland a certain portion of your property taxes goes to education
also a portion of the state tax that you pay goes back into the county that you live in to pay for the educational system
None
it works out nice
it makes it so that the whole county now
i know the concept of counties in texas is quite a bit different than it is here in maryland
like collin county would only equal about maybe an eighth the size of baltimore county here in maryland
the counties are much larger
in the whole state of maryland i believe there's only like fifteen counties
each county has their own school system it works out real nice
the flip side to this is are we getting what we're paying for
i don't believe so
i heard a report because of the emphasis that the president was putting on education
him running as our education president and then finally a couple of years later getting around to doing something
they said since they imposed the federal regulations on education
at the end of school year they would be tested
they go into the fourth grade
everybody in the fourth grade's basically taught the same thing
when they came up with this nationwide system of public schools they gave some figures out
since it's inception they've the prices paid by the federal government per student has been thirty-three percent
they're actually spending thirty-three percent
that's real dollars
adjusting it back to the days when it started probably seventy years ago
what they've said is that we haven't had a thirty-three percent improvement in education
they say that texas schools are some of the lowest in the nation
our school system down here is no where near perfect
they keep complaining they don't have the money to do it
they've been having some problems even here in baltimore city which is a good sized city
they've been putting a lot of stress on it
of course speaking of stress the teachers are all getting stressed out from trying to do everything they're supposed to do
of course they've been cutting the teachers salaries
all the services are costing more money and everything
a lot of emphas- now is being put on when children used to be taught like each child is individual
they're not all the same
some students do horrible until eighth grade
some do horrible until they get to tenth grade
all of a sudden everything clicks in
there are some students that read well at five years old
and seem to excel
one of the things i heard proposed on one of the public radio stations up here was that we should go back to teaching children at their own speed some ki-
each child has to learn at his own rate
None
they can't keep force feeding things to each other or at the kids
on top of that they make the child feel inferior
that's ridiculous
it's not that he can't do it
i have five children total
i've got two out of the house already
i have two that are in eighth grade this year
prior to their
when they were in elementary school they were identified as being slow
they put them into special programs
we actually held them back in fourth grade
it wasn't until the last two years
last year my
they're a set of twins
a boy and a girl
last year the boy twin started doing real well
everything started to click in for him
he knew what he needed to do
this year it happened for the daughter
all right
she has the right attitude towards school and everything
i think it's just a matter of everybody has to find their own path
i remember when i was in school i did horrible up until about the seventh eighth grade
i started to come around and realize
basically i got interested in math
never really did well in english
once you got interested in something and things started to click in place then after that you take off
when i was a kid growing up and going to high school if i wanted to take a little electronics course i had a electronics course i could take
we lived out in the country
we didn't have all that fancy stuff to worry about
we had just about every thing that we needed
they don't have it anymore
our oldest boy goes to lubbock high down here
they go to school four and half days a week
it is
my children had a real culture shock when we lived in plano
they really stress academics there
god if your child is not an honor student then
that's kind of the way they are there
when we moved back to maryland i moved to a baltimore county which is a northern county in maryland
it's basically a rural county once you get above about the half way point
we lived in the northern part of the county
we went from a middle school in texas that served fifty-five square blocks to a middle school in maryland that served fifty-five square miles
it was just a complete culture shock
because i they're riding on the bus in the morning with other kids that are a sleep because they got up at three o'clock and were doing chores
they had ag
they had an ag course
i forget what it was called
it goes along the lines of industrial arts
it's agricultural
where they had to raise a small animal
like four h then
they actually had to take a driving test on the tractor
they just couldn't believe this
it was great
they really enjoyed the courses
it made school fun for them again because prior to that school was just a big pain a drain
it was
it was kind of the way we feel about going to work
up here they seem to have made it a lot of fun for them
they seem to really enjoy it
all right
i have these
i don't know if they consider themselves animals anymore
they actually sort of take over the place
we're kind of their pets
naturally these are cats
i remember one time i used to get a chuckle out of pogo
he used to say pets can be most as much trouble as kids if they work at it a little bit and even more when they work at it a little bit
i think that's true
i think that
my husband and i are in such a situation that i'm kind of not able to do a lot
i'm kind of in a wheelchair
i kind of am
i don't what i'd do without them
th- just good company that's neat
it's funny how pets get to be so
you really do mourn them after when things happen
we have had some
i
we had a little dog
it was a little
i got it so it wouldn't shed
i used to come down stairs in the morning to feed him
i'd let him up out of the basement where he was sleeping
he would just dance around the floor
i just got
we only had him about three or four weeks before he was hit by a car
i cannot believe he just got in to us so quickly
i have to tell you about our most interesting pet though
by choice
about two and a half years i guess
it was about three feet long
my son dan went to hawaii for the summer
when he came home he didn't bring the iguana with him
for some reason or other he had a thing for them
i think there was one in the school zoology department
or biology department one or the other anyway
anyway he went and found this guy in dallas somewhere who had picked up one in mexico
anyway he brought this home
i looked at him
i said you've got to be kidding
you know i visualize that animal racing about
you think of lizards doing but they don't do that
they're very much
the thing about them is that they hold so still you don't notice that they're there
they move and about scares you to death sometimes
he was really a neat pet
though i
it was a long time before i could really pet him
i fed him
he knew how to get me to feed him
you don't argue with an iguana do you
he'd lay in dan's lap
just when he'd pet him he'd just stretch
you could see him just enjoying it like a cat does
he did a lot of interesting things
dan carried him around
he liked to ride on the back up on his head with his tail wrapped around his arm so he wouldn't fall off and scare everybody to death
my goodness
he tolerated them
he didn't like them too at first
he got tame
people could go in there
dan was a drummer
the only thing he didn't like very well was the drumming
when dan would drum he'd sit there and scrunch up
he was trying to
he'd leave the room
isn't that funny the way we put human characteristics on an animal like that
it's
they're interesting
they take on human characteristics like
our other animal
the next year our son ken went to hawaii
while dan was in hawaii ken decided he wanted a dog
he looked around a long while
he found a norwegian elkhound
he just brought this norwegian elkhound an
he was so funny
for a while they built a run for him out to the side of the house
they put the run out there
he didn't like this run because there were no people that came by
sometimes he would just make a racket until you came and got him
one night we'd forgotten to put water out for him
hal and i were in bed
all of a sudden there was all this noise out to the side the house
he'd pick up his dish and throw it in the air
and then bark and march around
he'd pick up his dish again and throw it in the air until we came out and gave him some water
they eat greens
we fed him the outside leaves of lettuce
he'd eat the outside leaves
in the summertime you could put him out
he'd eat outside except you had to keep him away from the garden because he liked to eat the little peas as fast as they came up
None
can we ask you whatever happened to clyde
when dan went up to college up at ricksun idaho he took him with him
everybody was used to him
they just loved him and what not
his roommate put him out one day
dan didn't know it
it got dark
he didn't get him in again
they searched and searched and searched for him
it got too cold up there
he died in a tree
they found him the next day in a tree
my
you have to be pretty tender with them
he had his own heat lamp and hot pad he laid on
it burned up one time
boy that was funny too watching him kind of burned up
we got him a new one
when we got him a new one it was brown
he wouldn't lay on it until we changed the covers
because that was what he was used to
they really pick up things
he was a clean animal
he went to the bathroom in the bathroom
we put some papers on the floor
he went there to go to the bathroom
you had to be sure you left the doors open
he'd scratch and do all kinds of things to get you to open the door if you happened to close it on him or something
even when he had an accident or something
if you just let it dry it dries kind of like
you could just vacuum it up
my goodness
in the winter time there was no odor at all to it
in the summertime when he was outside and eating outside the smell was a little bit like a cat
that's incredible
he was a really interesting animal
we just really
to this day i still miss him
that's been years ago
i guess it's because you lived with him overcame some fears to get used to him
it was interesting
what do your cats do besides sitting and purring and letting you pet them
my goodness these guys actually they're my husband's pets
you just kind of took them over
actually it's he's the cat person
i was always kind of nondescript in that category because i always liked dogs
they've kind of taken over
None
i think
i'm glad we have two of them otherwise i think they get neurotic if there just one of them
that could be
there brother and sister from the same litter
they are siamese cats
pretty ones
one is
they're both registered
newhart is the
he just wants his belly scratched
that's it
he's just the warmest thing in the wintertime
he just sits on your lap
they're like seven ye-
i haven't been doing a whole lot of reading for enjoyment lately
i read one book a friend recommended to me
it was so frightening
it had so much violence in it
she thought it was riveting
i couldn't deal with that
mostly i read things to do with raising kids
now i have two little kids
or co-dependency or fifty thousand things like john bradshaw's books on the family and homecoming and inner child and so
right now i'm reading
in my spare time with a two and a half and a three and a half year old
i read
gosh it's getting pathetic now
well my kids are up
i will encourage you that
you can
i read for a living
how interesting
i'm at the
therefore
i read psychology sociology anthropology political science philosophy linguistics history
you name it
that sounds like a fascinating job
it's a great place to be
the
you probably
i seem to remember that little byline
is that
normally we don't publish things under our own
i also get of course lots
i was just thinking when they
a book called
my goodness
there is
nursing
now it's practically all women
that
the scribes who did the old documents for churches and
that's interesting
i have one novel that's called first light
that's about archaeology the british novel
are you reading these in the form of just like printed manuscripts
those are
they're just things
that pertain to various things i'm working on or were mentioned prominently and attracted my curiosity
i got them out of the library and decided i'd read
i read a lot of history and a few novels occasional mystery stories just
my husband reads a lot of the
he did before we had kids
he's got quite a collection of those
my stuff revolves around one thou- let's see
i think the boom to parents and the shoelace department was those little velcro tabs
there's a surprising number that are still around
that's an alternate means of dealing with
since i'm a therapist and all i've done recently a lot of research into some of the twelve step groups
i've got all the different alcoholics what they call the blue book the big book
i'm trying to get more familiarized with that because i refer clients and different groups
let's see
he did healing the shame that binds you
third one that he came out with is now called homecoming
there's a subtitle to it
it's something like a journey in your inner
his literary agent in houston when she was just convincing him to write all this down
now he's had the first one and the third one put into a ten session p b s series
i saw one of those episodes on p b s
people can just tape them i guess
there's an author
she's got some fabulous workbooks out and a whole series of tapes and
that's been
i really have enjoyed exploring children's literature because there's so much more new things out that
i'd pull out the classics once in a while for my kids
there's such cute things
there's some
i know
i just go to the library because they're expensive
it
they go through them so fast
i really have been going to the library and getting my ten books out
they just love to sit and read
now finally the littlest one is oldest to sit and watch the pictures instead of
that has been fun to do that
which lists all the forthcoming books
there are so many that look like they would just be absolutely wonderful
i was tickled to see that some publisher is reprinting the
wonderful o and the thirteen clocks that have been out of print for i think about twenty years
i'm going to have to
they really did
they were
they probably were out of print all of already when my kids were small
i don-
what thoughts do you have on the subject
we even lived there for a while when my husband was in the navy
you did
in fact the first year we were married he had been there two years when we got married
we had a one year honeymoon
it was very nice
you probably have a different sense than i have
that's not where i am originally from
it was a cultural shock to me
in terms of what i went through
the high school in fact it was called tulley high school
now it's called roberto clemente
that's exactly about twenty years now
what was it like living there
did you find that people appreciated having the privilege of being
i find it really difficult and frustrated trying to make stereotypes
i can understand the frustration you must have gone through going to the school
i didn't mean that in a totally negative sense
if it's not part of your culture
the firs-
i had gone to a very
when i started teaching school it was in an inner city situation
although it was not puerto rican it was a mexican american and black students
it was very very different
i'll give you and idea that i had
i would say the majority appreciated what they were having in this country
a lot of the ones that didn't even in the minority not in the sense of the cultural word they made it worse for the other kids in school
chicago back then even had bilingual classes
i had geometry
if you can imagine how i even go-
i guess i look at is as an enlightening sense
basically i think they should leave things the way they are right now
i don't really have enough in terms of an argument pro or con in terms of making any type of change
i'm not so much against their making it a state
i would want a very clear majority
if the minority can be so vociferous whether you're talking this group or
any other group that has a stake in something
a few can make it miserable for everybody else
that's exactly
i can remember instances that wasn't as bad
i know what it looks like
that my give you a clue
it's an experience i wouldn't change
my husband grew up in a majority wasp southern ohio
that
when he saw where i saw my later teenage years he was just i hate to say aghast because that sounds so trite
he was
yet how did i turn out the way i did turn out
i said that's really irrelevant
what you find is that if you can talk to
i learned a lot about the island of puerto rico from talking to these kids
i'm sure
you lived there
you know that parts of it are beautiful and parts of it are squalor
same as any other part of the world
here
i don't think it's really to their best interests
to attain statehood as it is right now
they have representation
they don't have to pay all the taxes and so forth that we do
being that it's an island economy
yes the cost of living is super high
they're protected in so many ways without having to pay for the rights and privileges
i would just as soon
if they voted for independence i would back them a hundred percent
that's i guess because i'm not into territorialism or whatever that we have been in the past
i probably would say the something if i knew intellectually that it was good
emotionally that the people there wanted it
it's just
right now they have the privilege of voting with the united states don't they
they count as a principle
i've also been down there
you always pass through san juan in going to places like or
it's i think what they do need is an infusion of some of the united states privileges some of our resources the educational the teachers the
academic opportunity
i don't think we do enough of a resource transfer if there is such a thing
part of that though has been i think selected by them
in that whereas they want the benefits of what the continentals can offer
they want to maintain that culture of theirs
which i understand
often when you bring in the advantages the resources and so forth there is a trade
most of the people that i know about who really would favor statehood
have pretty much assimilated into the continental states already
they have family here and this way they can go back and forth
it's not that much of a strain
they're kind of lackadaisical about it
that's the way the pendulum seems to be swinging right now
it sounds you probably know qui-
to this day are you still in touch with any native puerto ricans that you have made friends with
i really don't have any personal or professional or familial ties down there
i don't know the people that i went to high school with i think the majority are in probably the generation yours and mine
the one right after us their parents did not want to acclimate to the united states
in terms of retaining
my background's european heritage
their background it would be i guess i would say the latino heritage
not speaking in english having the children drive them everywhere these were not old people
these were in their early forties
that always bothered me
there were some children that i noticed as soon as all the kids were out of high school they went back to puerto rico to live
they had made enough money here
th-
on the other hand i guess it's all about choice
was it
how were they toward
that's interesting the term you used continentals which i'm sure is the proper term
were they glad
there really were three major camps
there were those who were very friendly very open any anything we can do for you
either way was great
there were those at the other end of the spectrum and those that ho hum whatever
it was interesting
there was always some on sunday afternoons going through the little neighborhoods with
blow horns
None
and with banners and a parade of vehicles with their colors of a particular party
they were very very passionate
it kind of broke down that you couldn't really see
i couldn't see that there was a clear majority that stayed
it seemed to shift as
i don't predict
what
i see
i have enjoyed it
thank you for your time
i guess medical insurance is probably what i consider the second most important
it seems pa-
compared to what our salary is versus what our health care is our health care keeps increasing increasing increasing
no matter what you do about that unless you're a senior v p or something which i am not
when you interview for a job or something sometimes people expect the benefits to take the place of a certain salary level
say maybe we'll pay you x amount annually
then ten percent to fifteen percent more are your benefits
if you're
my husband works
i do
i don't take some of
he has other things he takes
in that kind of situation it's really almost redundant
that some of the benefits i would rather have money
more money actually
or flex time or something that was a little more personal
we don't use any of t i benefits other than i buy bonds
you don't use the medical insurance
you use your company's
he works for bramalea company
they pay one hundred percent
you're kidding
they own a lot of buildings and lease buildings
see that's probably cause canada has the government run health care systems social medicine
you don't pay them if you live there
our prescriptions and everything our visits to the doctor our hospitalization
the only thing we pay for is
that's nothing
t i was getting for the both of us it was seventy-five dollars a month
my goodness
deducted for an h m o
it's like
we take his medical
the medical i think it's terrible
then they're getting ready to change it again for aetna
i don't know
i just don't think companies they want you to feel responsible and don't abuse the medical system
None
t i just did the thing where with the smoking premiums
do you know about the smoking premiums
a lady in my office said she said her husband works for t i too
she said what about the people that are walking around
i hope
you don't sound you're in this category but for extremely obese people or something*[[needs slash unit note punctuation
the kind of people that can't sit in the airplane chair
who's going to croak first the people that smoke or
i'm not all for smoking at all
None
i don't know
what other type of benefits do they have that canadian based companies
they have to be a little bit different than the american
they are as far as their pension plans
they're vested after their first year
totally vested
my goodness
they have the four one k and the usual benefits like that
that's a pretty standard thing anymore
husband's company probably matches more than t i though
they do
they match four percent which is the same
fifty percent or four percent particularly nonsensical
that's still pretty good though the fact that your vested that quickly in the pension
i know
i think e d s has seven to eight years
it's like t i in that respect
i'm working for a company that's making money
not e d s t i
i don't know
if i were to rank them i guess i would say next to income it's really just health benefits
for most people i know it would be day care
t i has
i know that's a big issue
i belong to a women's forum group
some of the questions we're getting are on site day care and things like that
i can't tell you anybody right now at t i that's considering that
i don't
they really should because they're big enough
the other thing i think is really good is that e d s is much better than t i at i think right now than that we have day care the health program like t i has texans
None
if you ever walked into e d s health corner court health clubs on site and you walk into spring creek spring creek's better than the one on dallas parkway
e d s is better than spring creek
it's really nice
instead of six treadmills you've got twenty
i guess it's just where e d s reimburses you for adoption
i see
t i doesn't have anything like that
i guess i wish the companies like t i and a lot of others were more progressive in that respect
that's a fortunate benefit that they're so active for their employees
they have some strange things
they have very strange dress codes
None
you can't wear slacks at the corporate site and that kind of thing unless you're in a y-
there aren't manufacturing environments because of the type of company it is
i guess i also wish that companies would look more at cost of living increases instead of just merit reviews
with utilities and homes that are
price of homes have went up drastically
an average house is now a hundred and thirty thousand
that is unreal
then we've got these million dollar homes
where do you find a happy medium
how does your salary deal
None
i don't know how you and your husband are too
we have friends that laugh at us
we i clip coupons
i said hey i'll probably do this even if i'm a millionaire which i won't
it's
you just can't
it seems like every time you try to get ahead and take a vacation or something the car insurance is due
kind of nice to talk to somebody in dallas
i think dallas as far as economic uncertainty is better than what most of the country is
somehow we're better off than a lot of them
that doesn't definitely make it any better
just something you have to keep telling yourself that that's what i want that
people are lucky to have any kind of benefits
when you see people that don't have anything but h m o or really can't even afford to get in a job that costs
we had a guy fixing our air conditioner
he said he didn't even make ten dollars an hour
he has three kids
i went
benefits
that's a good word for it
very well
at least they're making the effort to put it out there and make it available and cultural change within the management first
now it's kind of filtering down to the peon level
it's that mind-set
e d s they're better
they're a little bit too stiff collared in terms of what you want to do
they're pretty much if that's where the widget goes stick it in the hole
you can't really argue with them because they've always been successful
what can you tell them
i guess that's what i know about benefits
good talking to you
keep cool
i don't know exactly how we're going to cover many of these people because i'm sure that some of them don't have the wherewithal to do it themselves
i have a feeling since i have just about as good a health care coverage that anybody can get that this then becomes an obligation of the government
it's going to become an obligation of either state local or federal government anyway
when people can't pay they end up going to clinics or to public hospitals and that kind of thing
None
it seems to me that i'm paying anyway because when i pay something the bills seem inordinately high
the reason that they're inordinately high is because that has
it would seem to spread it out a little better if the employers who employ these people and pay them subminimum wages or whatever
were asked to share their fair burden of this too just as my employer is
who else is going to do this then
it's worked successfully in europe
i travel extensively and spend maybe half a year in europe every year
i find that the health care programs there are administered with a great deal of integrity
people don't seem to be reluctant to use them to any degree
as a matter of fact if i'm injured or have an emergency when i'm say in germany or france that i'm automatically taken care of
i don't even have to pay
i think part of the tremendous benefit of that is that there's so many people who wait now because they don't have the money until they have no preventative measures
people just go on and on and on
so many people don't even get prenatal care
it just extends what would be a minor problem to deal with if they had help available early on
becomes just this horrendous burden on the taxpayers
they're saying now that one out of every ten child born in public hospitals is addicted to crack
None
i know it
i have a solution
my solution
even though i'm rapidly approaching the age when i'll qualify for medicare and medicaid i
my mother and father both
my father's not living but my mother is
they are of an advanced years
when i see the money that's poured down the drain on medicare and medicaid
the
the extraordinary amounts
those people vote
they're the ones who get out and vote
that's what's robbing a poor mother of the prenatal care
we're spending on these many times useless and inordinately complex unnecessary tests in hospitals for older people
it's unbelievable how much you go through
when i just had a problem with my neck and they ended up doing a seven hundred dollar cat scan a chiropractor got it in one time
it does
seem like we're th-
now i noticed just the other day in the paper that payments will be based not just on cost but on cost effectiveness
i gue-
that should help
i don't know
we'll see what happens
i see
listen i think i've exhausted my self on
i know that
i have only two or three favorite television shows
i think one of my favorite then is from the guy stephen is it brochco who does l a law uh-huh
he also did hillstreet blues
i don't get to watch a whole lot of t v
we're usually outside
it's usually the nine o'clock shows that if we get them in bed we usually watch that
l a law is one of my favorites
i think they're different than a lot of other shows of which they have the re runs in the middle of the season towards the end when everybody else is showing reruns they start showing some of their newer stuff
you must watch a lot of disney or cartoons then
we have on sesame street and mister rogers that kind of stuff
i think those programs are really good for children
it's kind of nice to know that they're just going to be seeing not a lot of violence and that kind of stuff they usually show a lot of things that really teach them different things about the world
my older son he's going to be five
he's more into watching the cartoons and that kind of stuff now
that's true
i noticed that my kids are older now
they're getting close to the teenage years
they did
even some of your cartoons can be very violent they talk about death
we were watching gosh bugs bunny just last night i think it was on i have to remember which channel
anyway we were watching that
it was talking about opera
they showed what they thought an opera would be
one of the things was to kill the rabbit
i thought how violent to kill the rabbit
he ended up killing the rabbit in the end
then of course the rabbit comes back to life and says see this is how an opera is supposed to be
i thought gee whiz if a little kid was watching this that would be pretty violent even for a small child
especially boys they're always talking about shooting and killing and all that kind of stuff i don't think that they really realize that death is forever
showing them something like that really doesn't teach them that it is
i don't think cartoons portray that
to get them to feel like that that's just pretend i think is the hardest part
a cat has nine lives they don't
we've gotten
thursday nights usually had pretty good and as far as very good comedy
i used to watch dallas
i don't know where you're at
we're in dallas
somewhere in the middle i got bored
in fact i didn't even watch the finale
that's about how disinterested i had become
after a while there's no new stuff they can do
they've done everything dirty in the book
you were just talking about
everything you could think of had a hard time
i think maybe with dallas as far as they lost a lot of characters that had been around at the first
i think they've had a lot of their characters stay around
if you notice on dallas they lost all the women
the men mainly stayed
the women were the ones who left
i thought that was very interesting and kind of wondered about that
anyway that's a whole new issue
anyway i don't know if our five minutes are over yet
we also have the paid television channels
the only thing i don't like about it especially with teenagers is all the violence the sex the nudity and the curse words know
i know they didn't pick up these curse words from me
they had to have picked them up from the t v
one nice thing though about the cable company we use they have that little parental key
i have that at home
i keep the keys with me
that's about the only way that i can do it
their natural curiosity to go towards that way and want yeah
i don't know the way the generations are growing up now
i just think they watch so much more t v
they aren't sitting in the house watching t v all day because i think it's good for them have physical activity and that kind of stuff too
especially in the summer time we aren't in the house very much in the evenings
here lately it hasn't been that cool anyway with the humidity being so high
it was nice talking to you too
is this something that concerns you
personally i don't live in a real bad section of town
just because of the general area i live in the insurance rates are real high on your car
there's a lot of within a few miles of me
i live outside of dallas
it's kind of in a little suburb
i feel pretty safe out here
i know the murder rate is going up every year in dallas
that worries me
when i was looking for a job there was a lot of openings right in the worst areas of town
my husband was
what his concerns were
not that i think you'll get involved in anything but it just be an innocent bystander just to be in that location
i thought how sad it was
a lot of kids are caught that way
there's a little boy just got shot and killed last weekend down in what they call the projects which is sort of a bad area
he was just out riding his big wheel
a couple of drug people got into a fight with a gun
he got hit and killed by a stray bullet
that exactly what happened down here
it must be frustrating for the parents who can't get out of a situation like that
it doesn't seem anything is working
i think the laws have gotten so lenient
on the other hand they have to be because the jails are full
at least in this area they don't have any room to put anybody
a lot of people just get out back on the streets because they can't keep that many people in the buildings they have
i say they commit crimes let them be overcrowded
they have all sorts of rights that are questionable
the other thing that worries about it is kids that are doing such bad crimes so young eleven and twelve and thirteen year olds that just go out and kill people
that worries me
exactly
they get involved in things so young that they don't really
some people prey on that
they'll take kids who don't really realize the seriousness even at fifteen
i don't know
i was watching a movie on t v
one guy got all sorts of kids under eighteen to do it by telling them you won't have a record because you're under eighteen
i guess if they had
the courts are so backlogged right now it takes forever just to go to trial
seems like if they had more immediate consequences to their actions it would sink in faster
it seems now even in the country you hear about bad things happening
everybody thinks of them only in l a and new york
they spread out to cover more area
i don't know if gangs occur much down in texas do they
they've had some drive-by shootings outside of the schools
i never met anybody that i knew had anything to do
that's a scary thing too
seemed like in the fifties when gangs were big
now they're so much into selling drugs and weapons and all that
my god the weapons that people have are
some people seemed to be armed better than the military or the same as the military
that's the other thing
especially if you're an inner city you can't really feel you're putting much of a dent in what's going on
you're putting your life on on the line everyday
they were saying in dallas that they can't hire anymore policemen
that
they keep leaving
i just read an article yesterday where this what used to be a nice town in this area they had a lot of budget cutbacks
a lot of the towns are declaring bankruptcy
the crime wave rate went up almost instantly because it was so well publicized that everybody in the area knew that town wouldn't be patrolled as well
they figure what a heyday
there's someone at the door
i guess i'll have to
it was nice talking to you
that's where we go home too
we live up lake in the broadmoor area that's where my in-laws are
we've been there
it was twenty-seven below
we had to cancel our ski lessons
just this year
it doesn't pay
that wouldn't be a good spot to go on a vacation now if you were a skier
i don't know
it might not be too bad if you want to go skiing somewhere else
you can't ski up there any more
i'd like to go on vacation
my husband and i want to go to florida to go to disney world
we have two little ones that are under two right now
we want to wait until they're a little bit older to do that
we went on a family cruise last year on the premier family cruise line
we went to disney
on the cruise ship they had mickey and minnie and chip and dale and goofy and donald duck
it was really oriented toward little kids
how fun
the kids could eat with chip and dale
it was just a lot of fun
i bet
then we were on the cruise for days in the bahamas
landed at cape canaveral and then drove over to orlando and spent four days at disney
that sounds pretty good
it was all a big package deal where you just pay one price and get everything
kids are really cheaper too
they said we could either cancel reschedule or take whatever was available
we took whatever was available
we left a day early
they put us up at the cocoa beach hilton
the ship that was available the only rooms that hadn't been booked were the suites
we got the suites at the same price as a regular cabin
what a deal
then our cruise was actually extended a day
our disney was extended a day
we turned a seven day trip into ten they paid for everything
that's great
that was a wonderful vacation
what kind of things do you like
we like to ski of course
we spend so much time with our families and seeing our friends
because we moved to texas about two years ago so when we go back we are just jam packed full of people to see and things to do we don't get a lot of time to just vacation
we did last year though go to san antonio for memorial day which was fun just to get to kind of walk around and see the sights down there and do that kind of thing
with the santa claus on the cover
we will probably be going up at thanksgiving this year
where do you
you're in texas
that's not too far
i guess they get people from all over
it was when we left last year
we left on the eighteenth right before that big snow storm hit colorado we pulled in just as it hit
how do you go
wait a minute
that's on route two eighty-seven or something like that
we go straight up through trinidad and straight up i twenty-five from there
we went a different way when we went last christmas because of bad weather and because we were pulling a little u haul trailer
we went all interstate
we went up through oklahoma city and then up through kansas and then turned left and went in on i seventy it wound up only taking us about an extra hour
it was a little more mile wise because you could go sixty-five miles an hour on the
it's more concentrated so they know where you are
anyway i know here in plano some of the things that we do are kroger
some of the other stores too have said if you bring your bags back to the store to recycle then they'll pay you a certain amount of money
that's one thing that started in the community
brookshires up in allen you bring the plastic bags back or the paper bags you put them in the receptacles there
i didn't realize some people are actually paying you for that
i think albertson's does it sometimes
yet i know that some of the stores will actually help the community not pay you the money back but will pay the community like through the schools or things like that
that's always helpful
i know that we have different can banks around the city that you can go to and do that
one of the ways
i don't know if this would be helpful
it said on the computer what do i think would be helpful
i don't know if it would be helpful or not
i know on monday the garbage men pick up just any limbs or any extra trash that you might have
that might be an extra day to put out things that might be recycled if we had a certain colored can to put them in or something in the city to put either glass or newspapers or whatever
it's a little bit more difficult because people have to remember okay today's glass okay tomorrow's plastic and all that i think that's the way we need to go
it's pretty bad
especially in this country all the plastic and the paper and everything we just used to throw out
i know getting a newspaper everyday i know i could just do that because i have to pick it up
it just goes out with our trash
i guess i'm not as recycling minded as i should be
that goes out with the trash
it really could be recycled
what i do is
you'll be amazed if you ever start doing it
it'll start stacking up
take your glass pickle jars or whatever liquid jars
put them all in a place
and plastics
don't you have to take labels off of those jars
from what i understand you can leave the labels on although i rip them off
i don't scrub them or anything
put all the glass in one place and plastics like milk jugs orange juice jugs things like that
and then of course cans coke cans whatever
i haven't been down to the recycling center yet to find out exactly what they need or what they take and all that
i'm keeping these big piles of it right now
you'd be amazed how quickly it all stacks up
i know with our family that we could really be helpful if we could find a way to just get it into different categories like that
i don't know what it would take to get my children to start working on it
i have two older ones that probably would go along with if i had it arranged so that it wasn't a big project
it's not a big deal
let me tell you one interesting thing when i went back to the store and i said hey i understand you all are taking these bags back what do you do with them
they told me they look through them all and throw out the ones that don't belong there and then go and recycle the rest
i said what do you mean the ones that don't belong there
they said people come in and put anything in the receptacles
what i found out is if you look at the bottom of those bags kroger or whatever the plastic ones they've got numbers on them
if it's got the little recycle symbol inside it it's got a number like bags from drug emporium have a
my name's gail
i guess we have to
if you're ready then
i'm not
i just find it so easy to charge something when i don't have the money to pay for it
i'm really trying to get out of that habit
i think they're kind of dangerous
unfortunately we don't use them all the time
we use them like at christmas time
it seems like it takes all year to pay them off when you use them like that
i would love to just take some scissors and cut them in half
i think sometimes when you look at the interest that you're paying on them that's what gets to be the really scary part if you think when it comes around to income tax time and you look at how much money you paid out just in interest all year
seems just like our society pushes so hard for you can have it and then no interest no payments for a year and stuff this
we have a sears one
we always get a maintenance agreement every year it's just easier to say just put that on my credit card
that's probably four or five hundred dollars that goes on at that point it seems like takes forever to pay that off
i think like half the amount that they cost in the first place
it's just you never get it out
now that's real irritating
one time we just took a personal loan and paid off all our credit cards
the interest on the loan was cheaper than it was to just have that
we did
one time we wanted to buy a used truck
we went down to the bank
they said sure we'll give you a personal loan
they said sure that's no problem but why don't we consolidate your bills
at the time we thought that would be great we could
it's going to be a lower payment than it was for all of them
you never miss one or whatever we did that
we didn't realize at the time until several months later that we were real
this was three years ago
we were just kind of
i guess that means these credit cards are closed
we didn't
we charged them all up again
then we were not only paying those bills regular like we were before but also adding the lower payment for all of them
we were paying
we didn't ever make that mistake again luckily
we're definitely working on not doing that credit thing
as a matter of fact it's real interesting the subjects i get
we just discussed this last night at church talking about debt and things like that
it's so alluring and so easy to get
if you could stick to that we'd get rid of a lot of indigestion
i just picked up my daughter
she was eating a cupcake and now her crumbs all over
i don't know if i just feel kind of
i just thought if we ever had something go wrong with our refrigerator or something and we had to buy one then we would really need that
he said okay we'll keep it
then we weren't smart enough to not use it
one thing you might do with in a situation like that though it's just keep
you're into microwave cooking
it's so easy nowadays
it's especially when people are working just to come home and pop something into the microwave
it be ready in just a few minutes
that's what we all are looking for isn't it
we've done that too
he sometimes makes a huge pot of spaghetti we're eating it for a week and a half
i kind of get sick of it after he
it's just my husband and i too i try not to make so much that it lasts more than that week
i have a great recipe for sour cream chicken enchiladas it's really good
i got it from a friend of mine that i used to work with every time i've served it everybody just loves it
that's one of my favorite things to make
i end up with an old stand-by that we call russian chicken because it's so easy it go-
that's about it
what do you put in it
you just take your boneless chicken breasts
you take and make a dressing out of russian dressing one bottle of that and a package of lipton onion soup mix and three ounces of apricot preserves you mix it up
you just put it on the top of the chicken
i cover the pan with foil and put it in the oven for about an hour i take the foil off and let it brown takes about another twenty minutes it's delicious it's so simple because i can pop it in when i come in the door and then go about my business
by the time i've got everything else ready the chicken's done
that's a real easy thing for me
i've got a great recipe for cheese cake
they have one
every recipe i've tried out of that has been a really good one every month they've got all different kinds of recipes
it's just a regular cheese cake
you can put raspberry topping on it inside the cheese cake recipe you put lemon peel and orange peel it's just enough to taste it when you're eating the cheese cake
it is wonderful
my goodness
it takes a long time because you have to cook it for forty-five minutes and then you turn the oven off and you leave it in the oven for another forty-five minutes and then you open up the oven door and leave it in for another
it's very good
i love cheese cake
i have not done that well with
i like a baked cheese cake
i have had a recipe that someone has given me that it's kind of like you just mix cream cheese and stuff and refrigerate it
that's not the same as a new york style cheese cake
the recipes that i've used
everybody will say this is real simple
i make it
it's really not very good yours sounds good
it is really good
that sounds interesting
there's your good dessert for your dinner party
i'm not a wine connoisseur by any means
i've been to some wine tastings up in napa valley i learned a little bit about them then
what would be fun they have some of those classes you can take yeah
there's places
there's places here that offer
i think it's once a month
you can go to a particular restaurant or whatever
you can kind of take a cooking class you get to eat everything afterwards
how neat
they also go into the wines to serve with different types of meals and that kind of thing
it sounds like it's a lot of fun
have some friends done that
they've really enjoyed it
i didn't even know they were offering that
this place is called medina's or messina's kitchen or something like that
i bet that would be a fun thing to do
it sounds like it
my kids are both in college
i played a fairly active part in helping them decide where to go
what kind of experience did you have
i
one girl went in state and has graduated
that was her choice pretty much where she wanted to go i have two out of state both in missouri
i teach in a college
they had heard me talk about it and for years that i didn't think it really made too much difference where they went for their undergraduate
so that was pretty much
maybe i'm wrong
if they're content there
i think it makes a big difference in terms of finding a school that is sort of right for the child in terms of his or her happiness and the appropriate support environment and things like that
as far as the education as far as looking at the degree at the end very little difference is paid to it where you get that bachelor's
if it's a halfway decent school they should be happy naturally
if they can get two out of
let's see my son got a full total scholarships there's plenty of scholarships out there
people should be advised to look for those
did you play a strong role in helping them pick schools
did you just sort of say listen to your guidance counselors
they
we went around
my son was a graduated from a jesuit high school he was pretty much looking for a jesuit university
there
he's in saint louis u
i guess i played a role in that
i just sort of let them
they'd all been pretty efficient as far as studies
i didn't have that much to do
they just knew they wanted to go to college
i helped them get there as far as traveling with them to look at different places
i would suggest a person always goes and looks at the school before they sign up
that
they get there and hate it or whatever
if it's possible
it seemed expensive at the time you're doing it compared to the total decision it's nothing
in the long run it's very reasonable if the person
my daughter has been in missouri for a second year
that's strictly up to her
she'll finish this year down here and then decide what she's going to do next year
it'll save me a lot of money because i'm not going to have to pay out of state tuition again that's her decision i have so many students in my classes that have dropped out and come back
they're much better students at twenty-five twenty-six may twenty-eight
i never have pushed them
i just say that education is important you should do it
they have to do the work
back to this visiting thing
i think so
i found that my kids had no conception what college was really like that the process of going around to a few schools with them really helped them understand being able to go with them to at least some of them gave me a chance to explain things to them in reference to what we had seen
also i'm opposed to the size
my daughter first looked at a place that was forty thousand
that was twenty-five hundred when i went there
it's southwest missouri state university it was twenty-five hundred when i went there forty years ago
my son's in a school about seven thousand
that's not bad i teach in a school about eight thousand
that's even a little large it's much better than twenty-one thousand
they do have to visit if the parent can point out all the different places to look for scholarships
those rating
probably fine just to compare
if they need to
None
that's the same with me
it's course country
western even i've gotten a little bit used to because it's not like it used to be
clint black he's pretty good
who's the other big guy
in oklahoma we say garth brooks
that's the other guy i was thinking of was garth brooks
kenny rogers he's kind of country verge on the verge of country western
of course garth brooks lives about
his home town is about fifteen minutes away he's a home boy
then of course you like him
i have teen age children
i'm hear the rock music not the hard rock but the michael bolton type stuff
my son is twenty-eight
he's real unusual in that
that's good
he likes jazz and blues and course the rock i can't say he's real crazy about elevator music as he calls it
actually we don't listen to any elevator music at my house
i've got teenagers
my teenagers are all gone
actually when i'm home alone which isn't too often our public radio station has wonderful classical music
it's just very wonderful soothing and lot of symphonies
i love that
i teach we can have music in the classroom
it can't be the rock or anything like that i find that the classical music is very good for the kids too it doesn't disturb them yet it stimulates them
None
it's nine through twelve
it's business technology
i was just sitting here while she was trying to find another caller
my husband and i are taking a computer class at our junior college
boy
we're learning a lot
we have a home computer
it's very interesting
i guess we'd better get back to music though
i play piano
right now my nine year old is taking piano
i just got a whole mess of music
volunteer to play the piano at the children's christmas program for the whole grade school which is k through six five hundred kids
i just sub at the school
i just sub at the school
that's kind of my volunteer thing
it's really neat
my older daughter plays the saxophone
my third son just started baritone this year
my little girl will start french horn next year
my son played the sax and drums my daughter the piano organ and french horn
i'm pushing that on my daughter because i want to play in our city band not the symphony with just the city band once we get the the french horn
i get a little bit more time
i love it
we have a marvelous band instructor
he's wonderful
we have couple of hundred kids in the band
that's a
he has a jazz band that my older daughter was in
my son will be in next year
they play college level music in junior high
the kids just love him
that's wonderful
it's really good
do you
i have totally a tin ear i love music
i i love to listen to it love to sing and my kids when i was little and they were little
i was singing to them
i guess this is a topic near and dear to my heart
since i am a healthy eater
there really isn't any kind of particular food that i don't like really
i like a good italian restaurant or a good
especially like good prime rib it's nice to get out and find a good restaurant like that
i live here in rome new york
there are a lot of good restaurants around here
you're in new york
it's called lawry's like lawry's seasoning salt it is absolutely wonderful
we were there a few months ago
it's kind of pricey
from new york it probably doesn't matter
it's actually very inexpensive
is it okay
there's a place half a mile from me here that has fantastic prime rib for eleven dollars for a whole meal a potato and salad and soup and the whole nine yards
i think the cheapest there probably starts at eighteen
it includes salad and rolls and some other stuff
it is absolutely wonderful
i was going to this place up the street from me is the best i've ever had
i'll have to go there when i get to dallas
lots of people down here like mexican food that's
i think italian and mexican food are probably my favorites
i'm not into sushi or any of that kind of stuff
i'm don't do the raw fish like that
i do a raw bar oysters and things like that they
i'm an officer in the air force and travel quite a bit on business i find myself down in melbourne florida about once every two months or so and go and hit the oyster bars down there quite a bit i love that
yeah fresh seafood down there
maryland's great
you get the crabs it's like i can't go anywhere
seafood seems to be a little bit more expensive than other types of food
it sure is good
it's supposed to be good for you
it's really strange that seafood is so expensive because in reality i say that the oceans have the greatest resource of food on the planet
yet we as human beings haven't figured out a way to harvest it economically
but not seafood
i make a wicked chili
around here the big spicy thing is buffalo wings they
those are really hot and the hotter the better
we like spicy food down here especially the hot sauce picante sauce or salsa whatever you all call it we sure go through a lot of that
i like it hot
i don't like it real hot because then my nose starts running
my scalp will start
i don't know
there isn't too much in the way of restaurants that i don't like
things that are kind of oddball like thai cuisine
that'll literally blow your head off
i can handle just about any kind of food without
that stuff goes one notch beyond
although i guess on this topic are to talk about the service in a restaurant is always nice though too that's one thing
the price
i find that lately that so many people are working waitressing jobs waiter
i haven't given this a lot of thought
i'm pleased with the practice that is they
i don't
you would favor invasions of privacy on the other hand that's arguable but that people who's jobs are critical to public safety should have to meet special standards
i haven't given this matter enough thought
all right
see we have the testing already here
we've had it for about five years
now it's for all employees
they randomly select employee numbers
the day that they select you is when you have to go and be tested
how do people feel about it
we're familiar with it
we have a lot of people upset about it at the beginning some not all
what was happening at t i is that they found certain parts of the company there was a lot of drug abuse
what they ended up doing is kind of doing a little bit of an undercover agent to watch what was happening
we had people using on the premises and actually selling and dealing on the premises
that's a very different issue
it was combination of both activities and using too
they developed this drug policy to eliminate
there's some parts of the company that we do government contracts
i think some of those require the drug testing
now t i thought we'll just do it for all employees not just because of safety issues but because we want a totally drug free safe environment for all people to work in
that we shouldn't have people on drugs within our offices and such
i don't have a problem with it
does the testing cover alcohol as well as illegal drugs
one thing that to me was going on stretching it a little too far was that they also check if you are taking somebody else's prescription drug
it happens a lot of times
they give it to everybody else in the family and don't always go back to the doctor and get another prescription
according to what they do at t i if you take a prescription drug it has to be in your name
it can't be in your spouse's name
the testing will look for i guess any kind of drugs
you have to tell them what they are taking a prescription for
they ask you to declare beforehand what prescription drugs you are taking
when you get tested you are supposed to tell them everything that might be there
then if they ever question you or something you may have to show proof that you do have a prescription in your name
it's i guess that in fact they don't routinely test for very many prescription drugs
they don't say in advance
what they be testing for are the ones that would have barbiturates or codeine things like that in them
i guess that's what they wouldn't be looking for penicillin and antibiotics and stuff
they would be looking for the controlled things barbiturates amphetamines
what they are asking you to tell them is all the prescription drugs you are taking which are controlled substances
you pretty much put down what you remember even if it was just contact or something like that
afterwards maybe if you had a controlled substance
you probably put down you had drixoral or contact if you would remember that you did it
just saying you probably put down on the sheet anything you have taken
if they had a controlled substance maybe they would ask you then to show that you had that prescription in your name
they test them too even if you are not a real t i
he had taken some kind of
he took his mother's
i was just trying to think
i love watching some of the new shows basically
we subscribe to c n n
we took that
we started watching a lot of those especially during the war or during anything kind of thing like the earthquake
i have gotten stuck on a lot of this
the new shows and the stuff that comes on it
at night the discussion talk shows and things
we really haven't gotten a lot into the sitcoms that are current especially with the kids here because we have to kind of filter it before they get here
we do let them watch nine one one
we think that's kind of informative to teach them
not a lot of
i'll watch maybe a little while when i first get home in the evening
i usually watch the news
i'll watch that hard copy or or that kind of thing
i like the nine one one
that's the kind i like really more than
my husband is really crazy about evening shade that comes on monday evening
i've got to where every monday i rush around so i could sit and watch that with him because it's really funny
also i meant to be trying to pick up on murphy brown
his favorite night is monday night
we've got to where we will sit
that
i say i'm not
the one with the sergeant that married the woman with the kids sergeant mcgillis
i don't even know
sergeant major dad
that comes on right after the evening shade and then murphy brown
he watches that
i watch the first one then kind of sit in on the others
on friday nights especially we like to watch twenty twenty
we used to like knots landing a lot
excuse me just a minute
you can't hardly watch knots landing with the little kids around though
i know
they are
we have just gotten any more that where we just keep it off
i was to say on saturdays there is absolutely nothing
that's the day my husband
do you know
that's sisters
i saw that advertised today
it sounds like it's not fluff
it's really pretty good
it's kind of like soap opera i guess
it's a
so far i've watched it about three times now
it's really held my attention
another one now that it's getting darker
you are wanting to cocoon more
i haven't
they said that one and i'll fly away are really quality
i think what i need to do is kind of read to see what is on these days because by the time we get the kids in bed at eight o'clock and then i get my bath it's almost too late to start
i'm tired
i sit and watch for a few minutes
i have to get up and do dinner
we've gotten to where we rent videos for weekend nights
we do too
there are some good shows on
i really probably should watch more of them than i do
i like
i'm always in to making things
i don't just spend all my time
there's a lot more to do with your time when you get into it
my husband now he sits and watches t v constantly
my sister and her husband do on weekends
they just turn it on when they walk in
they are used to that too
i could be around here for hours myself and never have it on
there are some really good new shows that i have enjoyed
i'll have to watch that i'll fly away this week
of course in the afternoons if i get in from work in time i watch oprah some of those
talk shows
it's nice talking to you
it's nice talking with you
it's nice talking with you
i guess it's
watching the t v today there had a lot of stuff on crime
in our state right now recently they've had a lot of the rapists murder type killers going around
i
they're in there
wasn't it your state that had the guy that committed all those murders
there was that
wisconsin and milwaukee area
i live right on the border of minnesota and wisconsin
i kind of get both news
i know in minnesota they had the one that just got out and went after a college student and raped
they are not too happy about that now i guess
i can imagine
i don't know
it seems like maybe you just hear a lot more about them on the news
that's hard to say for sure
sometimes i wonder if these people don't it just for the publicity
they get their names in the paper
they become big celebrities
i wish there was some way that we could change the news media so they didn't feature these way out stories
i know one thin- i think texas has the death penalty right
see i no- i-
it's not going to prevent any people from doing it
there are a lot of repeaters
i guess that's another thing that to me is a real problem
i know we have got so many people in our system now at least here in texas they are really in a crisis
a lot of them they put out on parole
some of the ones that they put out early do repeat offenses
some i'm just wondering a lot of times they will put people lesser crimes in with people that did more severe crimes
than maybe they just tend to learn from these people
when they get back out they just go into worse crimes
maybe they should try and separate them a little bit more
i think the whole parole thing if somebody is convicted of second-degree murder or something gets fifteen years they are out in six or seven outbound on the streets again
to me that's really scary
some of these crimes that they commit seems like the punishment is not really equal to the crime
i don't know with my limited
if you want to stop the crime i think you've got to get the people when they are kids
a lot of this probably just starts from the homes also from the media the t v
all these gory movies on there becomes just a natural fact of life
i
a lot of the european countries they tend to sensor
they probably won't sensor so much the sexual stuff as much as the violent
they have a lot less crime
some of those european countries are you can leave your doors open and be safe
even i think new zealand is one of the places that
have you established what kind of requirements you are looking for your next vehicle
i guess i look at getting the best deal
that's my main objectives normally whoever is willing to deal and give me a good price
i tend to be more methodical i guess
i determine first of all what i'm going to use the vehicle for whether it's going to be primarily as a family mover or as a personal mover where it's going to be driven what types of driving i'm going to be doing on it primarily highway or local mileage more often
hanging in the back of my mind is always the knowledge that i tend to drive cars for about ten years and a hundred fifty to two hundred thousand miles
i'm real picky
if you are going to keep something that long
i don't know i've had pretty good luck
even if you take any car and you care for it well enough you are going to get some good life out of it
my oldsmobile right now that i have is getting near eighty thousand
it's still in pretty good shape
there was a flaw in there where a head gasket bolt broke
it cost me some bucks to fix that
that was something that was unforeseen
i still think i'm going to get probably a hundred fifty thousand or more out of it
it sounds like you tend to drive your cars quite a ways also then
i drive like the song says the little old lady but not from pasadena
i baby them as much as i possibly can
it's a pretty big expense nowadays
i guess i like to take care of it
i don't have to buy one too often
do you have more than one vehicle in your fleet
do you have a family fleet
i got an old seventy-six grand fury that doesn't want to die on me
i just keep running the thing don't want to sell it or get rid of it until it quits
it just doesn't seem to want to
i'll probably have three four hundred thousand before it wants to die
that may be
chrysler made some really good old engines back then
the three eighteen was particularly an exceptionally good engine
i've got the big three sixty in there gas guzzler
it runs good
at the moment i've got cadillac cimarron which is approaching its tenth year of age and a reasonably new plymouth voyager
it's only a couple of years old
that's the second one of those that we've had
that's the family travel vehicle
not only does it do all the carpooling around during the week
it's also the vacation vehicle that we all drive in
i think that what i'm getting ready to get next is probably a suburban unless they drastically change the vehicle a lot
i'm just getting tired of when i do get hung up in traffic not being able to determine what the problem is and come to some resolution of whether it's better to sit in the traffic light and wait or get off at the next exit and that kind of stuff
just because i can't see
my cimarron is just so small and so low to the ground that i can't see past any vehicle
i'm considering probably some kind of a pickup truck myself for the next vehicle
i just have so many hauling projects a lot of times
i'd like to just start doing some carpentry type work around
what have you seen lately that you think is worthwhile
the last movie i saw was regarding henry
i saw the previews
it's
does it have a happy ending
really good ending it's one of the best movies i've seen in a long time
i saw that one
then before that one i saw naked gun two and a half
that was funny wasn't it
have you seen that one
the regular naked gun and airport and
it was silly
now these are for two very different movies
one absolutely slapstick comedy and one clearly serious subject
i guess i have similarly broad tastes
my most recent movie that i liked a lot not my most recent movie was henry the fifth
i only rented it maybe a month ago it's been out for a couple of years
have you seen that
it's an adaptation of the shakespeare play
it's beautifully done
i believe that all the language is as shakespeare wrote it except it's been shortened a little bit
there might be a word or two changed
it's a glorious movie i like as you know these silly movies
i also like just some strange movies
the one that comes immediately to mind is the the cook the thief his wife her lover
there are also these various david lynch movies
i got hooked on twin peaks
i don't especially recommend
you have to just sort of like this thing
if you weren't drawn to watch that maybe you wouldn't be drawn to these movies either
they're just strange
but a little bit strange and esoteric
in the case of twin peak there's some elements of the supernatural in it too
there's also a producer of movies in baltimore called john walters who puts on even weirder movies
his most recent ones have actually been fairly mainstream like hair spray
back in his early days he had things
what are the titles
i can't remember the titles any more some really weird ones with quite a random crew of characters
it would have made these fellini movies look normal
do you like movies a lot
i don't do
i do like movies a lot
i don't do that
just recently i've been to a couple
do you rent them
i just go to the dollar movie theater around here generally
i don't know
i usually fall asleep
i get bored pretty easily
that's what my wife does too
she falls asleep
we have to pick just the right kind of movie to appeal
it was good talking to you
what is the topic
what kind of decision do you think about pick that car out and why
my next car to buy probably would be a cadillac
i've had
i'm on my third one
i'm not real sure that i'd be in the market for a car for quite a while
i had two cadillacs
my grandfather worked for ford motor company
he always said why don't you drive a ford or why don't you try a lincoln i finally tried one after fifty years
i've had i guess four cadillacs and one suburban in my last five cars
i bought a lincoln
i like it
my dad has been a
i've always been a g m man
are you
the last cadillac i bought was an allante
i just love it to death
i'm a traveling salesman
i like a little heavier car
that's why i choose to drive a heavier car and more luxury car
i tell you what
there's just something about that cadillac that whether it's a g m c product or whatever
they seem to be put together a little bit better
the buttons on the controls and things like that are a little easier to get to than ford products
i think that's one of the things that makes me shy away from imports is they put so much gadgetry on the dash
the buttons are so small to push
g m doesn't seem to do that
i'm a funny duck
it comes to the simple things like front end alignments i have never had to have a front end alignment on a cadillac
i don't know whether i just seem to drive them better or what
i've never had to have a front end alignment on a cadillac
i had an eldorado was my first one was an eighty i think at about sixty thousand miles i finally had it lined up
i had them do all four wheels
the only thing i miss about a cadillac is
i traded it in on my lincoln
they're just not as large as before
what is big today
you're right
lincoln is still as big as it always has been
the trunk space for me
that's where i put my samples because trunks just aren't big enough
i have the town car
it's a deep trunk but not as broad as the cadillac
the town car i noticed
with the continental i rented one time we could put golf clubs in them
straight across
that's good
we got three full sets in there and still had room for luggage
i sell sporting goods hunting related items
i sell gun cases and things like that i need to
samples need to stretch out and gun cases and things like that
it's not as peppy as a town car it's a v six
it
i drove it from here to memphis
i really enjoyed driving that car
i drove mine a couple weeks ago to one of our big national sales meetings in nashville
it handled real well
my main thing is space
if a continental
they had a lot more trunk space
as a matter of fact they had more trunk space than my sedan de ville had
all three of mine have had leather interiors
i had a eighty eldorado which was leather
then my eighty-six was a touring sedan
it had the gray leather package in it
my allante has i guess saddle colored type thing
i will say one thing about cadillacs versus
my favorite team is about the rangers
i really don't
with that guy from pittsburgh getting all that money twenty-seven or
it's just going to be a shame for our area
i think it's going to have a big effect if they don't on the other hispanic players
i do too
it's just going to effect on the team
we just can't seem to
i haven't been to a baseball game in a couple of years
it's just too disappointing
i liked him
of course i understand baseball decisions are all just
that's the name of the game too
pay these players so much money
it's frightening
you and i should be so lucky to go out and swing a bat and get two thousand dollars every time you swing the bat
they were talking about trading him if they're not able to sign him use the money that it would take to sign the guy to pay for pitchers what else they need
they've got the hitting
they need the pitching
i think they need them all
i understand the big cities like in new york or l a or somewhere because big cities
i know
a pro athlete can go out there in the afternoon and probably make five thousand dollars just by doing a personal appearance at a men's clothing store or something or sporting goods store
i realize the difference
i just don't understand
it's sure aggravating when you go out and bust your butt working your day job and you can work your day job the rest of your life and not bring home as much money as they bring home in one game
i know
one thing i don't understand is why a group headed up by george bush would buy the texas rangers and not really get behind them
i tell you we need a winner in this town
that's going to be a big help to dallas
in the past half a
it's always wondered me why they act as though this area is not a big metropolitan area
you think we'd someday get an owner in here that could afford to buy
i know
i've lived here since i was born and raised here
i've been a ranger fan since about seventy-seven
it's a lot of losers
i know
it's about to get as bad as the cubs or whoever
i've lived here since seventy-four
i've really been a ranger fan for the longest time
i follow them
i follow them like i follow the mavericks and like i follow the cowboys
i want to see them win because damn it the fans deserve it
it
we have pretty great fans put two million people in that stadium
i think this town would go crazy if they ever got even a playoff team
None
i do too
they got that new stadium they are building
at least that will be exciting
where do you think they are heading this year
it's going to be depending on what they do with ruben sierra
i'm getting tired of them going into each year saying bobby witt is the answer and kevin brown is the answer
man that's getting old
it's time to either put out or shut up
they have the later ten game winning streak they give him all kinds of money
he just goes right down the tubes
and valentine and greave they're about to get old
i like this sandy johnson
i hit one and nothing happened
just go ahead and talk
i'm supposed to find out what you do for your lawn what do i do
i cut it occasionally
is that good
i edge it occasionally
that's really good
am i good or what
much beyond that i don't do
i call my lawn man eric whatever his name is
he is going to build you a fence
he's giving me an estimate
for ten dollars a week i don't see any reason for me to be doing it
i thought isn't he the same one
but ten dollars or what does he charge not even that
it's ten because i
if there's five weeks i still pay forty
you ought to get him to pull the weeds
he won't pull weeds
he won't pull them
he won't cut them is what he won't do
because he said with the rocks that it's too dangerous for him to take the trimmer over the rocks
he's right
he just says to keep spraying them so
that was real
you haven't pulled any weeds lately
i haven't bothered as i walk on by
i started to pull the weeds in the rocks out front all of a sudden i came cross this big clump of weeds
goody
there was dog dirt in it i threw the gloves in the trash bag that was out there
i left the whole thing
that was about a month ago
i thought you were going to say there was a snake
god
but
how are your flowers your little things you planted
they're all
they
then i got some nice mums at thanksgiving that i put in the pots out there i thought they were supposed to live through all the cold weather
i don't think any of it comes back
i don't know
i don't know
i know they were still blooming up until about a few weeks ago
that's good
they're like indestructible
they're really pretty
sometimes they're not supposed to come back
lots of times they do
isn't it supposed to be five minutes
that's because we didn't hit one for a long time
boy i hate to think i'd be talking to you without getting paid
we get each other down the street
i talked to someone woman from oklahoma city and some woman from dallas
that was it
i've had one plano and then a lady from brigham utah whose son lives in plano on ranier someplace
and then another state
she told me about the utah jazz
i don't remember what the place was last night
i'm thinking colorado
i'm not sure
mostly they're from the area
there isn't really much to talk about as far as lawn and garden goes
not for me because all i have is rocks and weeds
i don't
what do i do cut it one and edge it
that's about it
i'm all talked out about gardens
we can talk about something else
it's just suggested
how's the baby do you think
let's talk about the baby
we're at the point now
i quit working about six months ago to start this house i'm out of cash
i'm not out of project yet
i'm going to go back and do some consulting work
as far as budget's concerned i'm fairly fortunate
we're
the project's kind of halted until then
as far as budgeting is concerned we have some pretty strict guidelines that we go for
that's a never touch
into savings
we don't ever put it in a high risk
that's pretty good
as far as the rest of it's concerned we don't have any kind of what i would call extravagant expenses
we pretty much live on about eight nine hundred a month just travel to and from work and clothing and food the rest of it we pile into the house
i'm fairly fortunate
our credit cards are out to the max right now because i'm a little behind on that
we're still making the payments on them
in texas you cannot borrow the money to build your own home and do it yourself
yeah it's tough here too
it's easy to find a contractor for a couple of hundred bucks who'll sign it and let you do it where i live that is
where i live it's pretty scary because texas is one of those strange states where if you have a contractor sign on your note like that and you screw up you don't get it finished
bad for him
the homeowner can't be touched
right now if i quit paying any of my bills
they can take your car and your clothes and your anything
as far as you know
that's kind of handy
we're not ones to budget much
we're l d s
we pay ten percent tithing we put i guess it's fifteen to twenty percent into a savings account
that sometimes we use for emergency type things
my wife doesn't work
we're pretty pretty fortunate as far as the budgeting is concerned because we don't have any long term debt
we paid cash for car
we bought the car on time one of them
we since paid it off
that's pretty
we don't have to worry about that
it's fraught with other problems
systems consulting computerization for construction firms
i'm a e d p auditor
really
i'm just brushing up on c plus plus
he had a bunch of computer stuff
i bought it all
some of it wasn't worth anything
a lot of the diskettes were just totally unusable
i did get out of there with vermont views which is a huge
i've had them where i've served up to twelve to sixteen people
i had help with them
part of them i did were a buffet it
i had just different side dishes and appetizers
one of them that i'd remembered was some sausage hors d'oeuvres
anyhow you take a couple of cups of bisquick and sausage like a owens mild
i guess you could use the hot if you wanted to
whatever you like
you put that in
you get some real sharp cheddar cheese and put that in and a little bit of milk and make it all doughy
i just put them in little balls and bake them for about fifteen minutes they are so good
that sounds delicious
i've made little swedish meatballs
they're just made out of the beef
and with spices and things in them
i've used that quite a bit
it seems to work real well
when i've had so many people to feed i try to do a ham and a turkey
that's my parties mostly is at christmas time and thanksgiving time
i had an open house party here once after we moved in here which i had things like that
i always cooked them ahead of time
then i just sliced them
and had macaroni salad with shrimp in it
put some little fresh shrimp
it's in your macaroni salad that you make
i'll bet
i like things that are easy and nutritious
at christmas time we just have a regular sit down dinner
by time you pass everything around
anyhow i
thank god for microwaves
always take your plate and just heat it up
other than that i don't have too many parties
i have maybe just another couple over for dinner
other than that i don't have a whole bunch of people except at christmas
i have my family
i don't anymore
it's been a few years
i don't have over a couple either
i try to have everything all ready
it just makes it a lot nicer where a don't spend all my time in the kitchen
if you have a nice big roast that you can throw in the oven then you can put your potatoes and carrots or whatever else all in there especially if a pork roast
other than that in fact i'm just thinking of what next weekend when the super bowl's on i've asked a couple people to come over
i just had been thinking what to have for that
have you had any good ideas yet
i don't want to have to come away from the t v
i'll think of something just that we can munch on over there
they can just fill their plate up at intermission and then go back over there and sit down
that's the way to do it too
what's i think so nice is
you don't have to spend hours and hours and hours in the kitchen
it makes an awful lot of difference doesn't it
it sure does
when i was brought up we didn't
go ahead
not with some of the things that i hear that our tax money is going for some ludicrous things
they did a thing on the thirty-five billion dollars we waste every year just on storing stuff for the military we don't need
it's staggering
how did this grab you
i'm a lady
i heard this on a christian program
it was about the n e a
that's the national endowment for arts
they funded this act on a stage and did a study on it between two lesbians and two homosexuals and wrote a report about that with our money
there are a lot of things that people i think general
it just frosts me terribly
i think it's interesting to look at where the money goes
it goes a lot of places where it probably ought not go
generally i think what's interesting is that
how it serves us given the extraordinarily large sum of money the government has to operate with
what i think is going to be really interesting is what we do about it
we are going to have to change the people who represent us
i think it's going to be real interesting to see and then force upon them
right i think that's the only thing that's going to change it
our anger is going to have to give rise to more activity on our part
i've said for years that there's full employment for the politically active
in our society there's very little full employment
eighty percent of the public according to bill moyers'
piece for
this special focused on the fact that eighty percent of the people in this country are seeing their real incomes
thus standards of living decline
twenty percent are seeing theirs improve
the government really plays a role in this
they are the people whose strings are pulled and by i guess powerful intere-
it's really interesting to see how that affects people because essentially more and more people in this country are not likely to revolt in the way that people used to think of the voter revolting
people are pretty much getting the picture that some people get taken care of and others don't
they think it's unfair
when they recognize that it's their tax money they're going to do more about it
i'll tell you one thing very interesting
people can call in and say what they think about what's going on in this country
i've thought for years it would make a lot of sense to create an eight hundred number for voters to call and vent their frustration with government
just a number you could call from anywhere anytime
i think once people really start to communicate how they feel things are going to change
until then i think it's going to be really painful
the question is how soon are we going to start to get our money's worth
as you said it's how soon we get involved
i think we need to create mechanisms to allow us to get involved like allowing us to call a toll free number and say hey look do it this way not that way or i like this or i don't like that or this is how i feel about your spending my money on art that i don't think is art
hopefully that the people that are listening to what our comments are take some action on it
that's the good thing about what is happening because i think more and more the news media which takes a heck of a beating and deserves some of it is telling us about the problems
the more we communicate hey look we want a change here because as it turns out we've wasted a tremendous amount of money on our defense spending in this country
None
there's so much of it going on that it would really set us into a deeper depression if we knew the whole picture
you may be right
what i think is really going to be interesting is to see how we as a society deal with it
i think it's a
what do you think about the everyday occurrences that are an invasion of your privacy
the
what i don't like is the constant calls people selling things people telling me i want things
that's what i really
i think that's the only thing i wrote down also
it's terrible today
my wife and i seems like we get home at five thirty and the damn phone starts ringing and rings up until ten eleven o'clock sometimes
the great thing for that is an answering machine
this is one of the best inventions ever
people
it's like your name must be on a list or something because i know at my office i probably average at least a call a day
even in an office
a lot of days i'll get two and three calls from people selling insurance to the small business man according to what i understand dunn and bradstreet puts your name out to people also
california always trying to sell something oil investments or stock investments or whatever
now i'm getting the same calls at the house
they get your name from dunn and bradstreet
credit card companies they sell your name
these people they sell your names
i
i think the whole thing is
they do
i understand they they sell names because it's quite profitable to them
sure it is
that is an invasion of privacy
if you've ever gotten anything in your life your name is somewhere
one magazine and boom they got your name forever
magazine companies from subscriptions do the same thing it's the way they make additional money
i guess it
you have to be a certain income holder to have an american express card
your name is valuable to i guess x amount of solicitors calling
i don't know
where are you from
i'm from texas
we're in plano
that was california
i was thrilled to death because that's the furthest i'd gotten any call from
i've talked to people in utah people in new york a lot of times i'll call eight or nine o'clock in the morning
i'll get people from out of the state
there was another call on saturday that was the one from california
i don't know
originally from new jersey
from saddle river
that's nice over there
we're from sort of towards the shore central new jersey
we're like
that's nice too
that's why i really miss it
i don't really like it here at all
she's been away for quite a while
her mother was from new york
they over there in new jersey
anyway this topic is a good topic as far as invasion of your privacy
that's the biggest one i can think of is just all the solicitors calling
of course they call
before i got the answering machine it was ridiculous i said this is absurd
the minute i get home the phone would be ringing
that's a good suggestion
it's great
in fact i've been missing calls from the t i switchboard
i always have it on
i'll get that message that says to end this call press three
it is because one day i listened and it was
i just got totally disgusted
people asking for money for everything
i
and the policeman's associations
i used to do that
they call you one time to send three kids to the carnival or circus
i'd send three kids to the movies or something
my pat answer now is you just called me the other night
it's nice to talk with you
food is a very intriguing thing
our lives are built around foods that we like and nutritionally good for us
one i guess i'd say is with my wife where i guess we usually enjoy a good seafood restaurant
something nice
the other is with my whole family whom we go somewhere that the kids will enjoy
recently we have been hitting pancho's up
because they have got good prices and everything
it's a chain down he-
we have one called chi chi's in our area
we had a restaurant called la bamba
it closed recently
chi chi's is a national restaurant i think
i think it might be
i think i've seen it around
i love mexican food myself
do you
you go ahead now
we do too
we enjoy mexican food
it's just primarily the price that's satisfying at this point
the kids
let's see
we've just recently discovered a super restaurant down here
it's not part of a chain
the first one we've been to that i don't think there was anything on the menu that any of us had
that was not just really super
boy that is wonderful
i agree with you on that
i was really a seafood addict myself
i love crab meat in particular
i can almost live on seafood and almost live on the crab meat if i
have you ever been to what is it original book binders in philadelphia
i know the name
i haven't been there
that's an old established restaurant
i went to the naval academy
the u s
we used to
go up there for football games sometimes
we would go over there to
pretty sure it was original book binders
we're supposed to be talking about dinning out
i'll just make one comment that i just retired from penn state
all my work has been in research for the navy
did you have any dealings with the underwater sound reference laboratory in orlando florida
i have dealt with nearly all of the research laboratories that the country has
that's where i grew up was down in orlando
you grew up in orlando
that's interesting i was in submarines
that's what i worked on
must have had some interesting assignments for you there
when did you retire
i hate to
i wish i could talk to you about that
i guess we should continue on
we do enjoy that
i don't know if we are particularly adventurous
we find something we like like cashew shrimp or something that's got a good at a particular restaurant
we usually stick by it
do you
i enjoy the szechuan type of chinese food
i do a lot of chinese cooking myself
it's in the sweet and sour porks and things like are just really delicious meals
where did you learn how to do chinese cooking
i enjoyed the food
i bought a lot of good cookbooks
i've been following through on that
that one's a good question
i guess one of the things we've started avoiding is the run of the mill chop suey and things like that
we enjoy trying different kinds of chicken or even shrimp dishes that are fixed in a chinese restaurant
one of this book i have is called chinese cooking made easy
i think it's by someone named chang
thanks for that reference
it certainly is nice talking with you gene
what is your phone at home
what do you think are possible changes in the way trials are conducted these days
do you like the way some people in there for instance really take over and we have no way of knowing whether they are legitimately right or wrong and so forth
as i look at our trial systems
they've taken a lot of the things that were set up to make it be a fair system and used it to their advantage
i think that a jury should listen to the courts to the hearings and to everything
i think they should only weigh fifty percent of the decision
i think the judge should hold maybe even forty-nine
the judge should be able to rule one way or the other
you're saying you think the judge should actually have the final say
i think that there should be more than one judge
i think that it's important to have a jury but i think the way that they go through so much time to get it a fair one
they only would cover forty-nine percent of the decision or fifty percent
the two judges would go ahead and make the final decision
i hadn't thought of it from that point of view before
what bothers me is i was concerned of the ability of some of the people in the jury to adequately understand what was being presented so that they themselves could make a proper and accurate decision
i really think that the jury ought to have more say so in the selection or in the determination of whether they are guilty or not
i also think that the jury should be more carefully selected to make sure that they are entirely intelligent people and that they understand some of the details that are involved so that they can make accurate decisions
they just make a decision based on whether they like the dress she wore that day or whether that guy smiled or growled all the time
what if they used
let's say
we would have fifty percent of them law students
that would give them
it could count as some aspect or hours going into their major
they would learn a lot about being lawyers later in life when they see what it is like to be in the jury side of a trial
that would be a really good thing to do
what happened was her husband was involved in a motorcycle accident where a drunk driver ran the stoplight
he ran into the motorcycle
the actual reason that her husband was killed was because his brakes went out on his motorcycle
his brakes did not work
this expensive big company that owned these motorcycles railroaded this into three years worth of trials for this lady
she had a son that was just only two years old when it happened they were following him home in the car saw the whole thing happen
they saw the husband
they railroaded this whole trial into mistrials this and that the other
she would have to sue him
i just felt like justice wasn't served because they had the money the big lawyers and she didn't
you'd think there would be enough people who saw the accident other than his wife
to also make statements
they have nothing to gain one way or the other
if they say a certain way then why not believe them
i don't know all the details on that
i certainly think that we've come up with a good idea with
i don't think that it would be such a bad idea even if the judge didn't have the final say
we have a dog that we got from the
we call it the s p c a
it's from an animal shelter
he'd come in there as a stray
he's a pomeranian and sheltie cross
he was very well trained when we got him
that's good
we suspect that he got away from somebody traveling through and hurt in an accident because a dog that looks as good as he does and is trained as well is someone that has lost him and not have been able to locate him
if they were local people they would have been able to find him
the only pet that i've had
i'm a doctoral student right now in my earlier days as a student
it was an amazing dog
he had gotten it from the pound
it's a spanish pointer named domino
kind of looks like a dalmatian
we trained it from a pup
basically right now it's fully trained
it can do a lot of things
it will get the newspaper and do all kinds of stuff
None
i think so
she's been a real good dog
just it's kind of a shame that i'm away from it now
i actually live in florida i'm on an internship up here for a year
i go back down
what possessed you to get the dog
i guess in one sense we felt that it's nice to have a dog even though there are complications come with it
with our children
at the time they were grade five and grade eight
it was an age where we thought it be good for them to have the discipline that goes with having a pet
sure learn a little bit of discipline and how to care for it and things like that
that's the idea
it depends on everyone's discipline
from that aspect i'm short on the discipline because i don't enforce that the kids look after the dog
we've had him about four years now
i think it
it's necessary that individuals have the discipline to look after the animal properly
i think do you live in a fairly rural part of the
we live in an area that's probably about two and a half miles from the university
i see
might say we live right in the middle of a residential area
that is not as good
this dog being a small dog it's more more acceptable again
we lived in oviedo which is a small town
it's a suburb of orlando
she was a dog that loved to run
that was the biggest problem i saw
i think that's one of the issues people need to think about before they get a dog is do you have the room for this dog to run around
i guess you can't really say for cats
me and cats don't get along too well
that whole space issue i think is real important
that's one of the biggest concerns
it's
the same time one has to recognize the reality of physical requirements of of the animal the larger they are the more room they need to exercise
that's all part of keeping your part of the relationship
showing the maturity and responsibility to recognize those issues
also the whole thing with noise
my mother she freaks out because she's got neighbors that have dogs that don't train them we had a neighbor in nebraska when we lived there that had brittany spaniels
they're very high strung animals to begin with
then sometimes if i've got time i'll be reading the front page of the newspaper just fall off on the articles that i like
also since my wife likes to watch t v sometimes
i can hardly wait for my morning paper to come
that's the first thing i want is the headlines
it's really funny because my sister grabs the sports and i grab the headlines
when five o'clock comes around i just want to get in the house and turn the t v on to watch the news
i don't stay up late to watch late news because my eyes won't stay up that long
i love to watch the five o'clock news
makes me angry when my paper boy's not there on time where i can read my paper
i do have my radio going most of the day though
about every hour it breaks in and gives me news too
do you get one of the news stations
i just have a channel that has music except for every hour say eight o'clock nine o'clock they come on for just a little bit of the news
as far as the actual news i get that
i was calling from work
that was a call waiting
it sounds like you like the news a lot more than i do
i figure if it's something really important somebody will tell me about it
the thing is if i catch the news all the time it just makes me depressed because they tend to produce a lot of bad news
that's what comes on first
also late at night i don't like watching the news late at night
my wife is usually up then
i can't go to sleep with the t v on
i wish i had more news on things like that i consider long range things like science and medicine i guess i'm more into science and science fiction
there's
i'm more interested in that
things like is nasa ready for another space shot how hot are they on the trail of a cure for such and such cancer a lot of the news isn't that interesting to me
you're right
there is a lot of it that's just garbage as far as i'm concerned
i just like the daily news
just especially the weather
like i say as far as actually listening to the news it's mostly t v five o'clock to six thirty
that seems like a long time for news
that's how long it is
seems like they have the local news and they have the world news
my morning paper i can hardly wait for it to come
i'm i would
i'm not a morning person
i would begrudge the time it takes me in the morning to catch my morning news
at work i have no time to read the news
i've always been a morning person to get up
i can't stay up late at night to watch the late news
anyhow listen i guess that's about it then
he said that he got calls from the same caller sometimes
that hasn't happened to me yet
you never know
it's pretty much a ledger sheet
i just write down all my bills how much i'm going to have to pay
i do it per paycheck for me which is every other week
i include everything from groceries to insurance to car payments to credit card payments everything
it tends to work out pretty well that way
i can anticipate a little better
when the bill actually comes in i go ahead and fill in the actual amount
that works okay for me
my bills i usually know approximately how much they're going to be
each month they are more or less just about the same
very seldom are they any different
for groceries and everything we try to put two hundred and fifty dollars in a little can
we put our receipts in there
usually that's enough
i don't have any small children to have anything extra come up like running to the doctor or something like that with them
None
usually that's not so much that it would throw me off
it's worse than having a kid
i guess the worst thing i've ever had come out is car maintenance kinds of things
i do try to build in a little extra money each month to be able to do that type of thing
i'm not working right now
they went bankrupt
i just went ahead and took my early pension
i only get that once a month
that's tough
that last week's pretty lean generally
i really have to try to budget that i don't go over that amount each month
i for years got paid once a month
in ways i liked it because i could go ahead and pay all my bills at once
for me it worked out that they were the smaller ones i would pay all of them at one sitting
i would know okay you can go spend this much on groceries now and you get this much a week and that is it
it worked okay for me
right now i'm in the mode of trying to dig out of debt i think as everybody is
it's really bad
it's going pretty well
i've got a real good plan mapped out here
i also like long-term christmas club
then naturally christmas comes along
that puts you behind too
this year i have them taking out fifty dollars a month out of my checking account for my christmas club
i figure that's going to help some
most people are spending three or four months at least digging out after christmas
i'm ta-
i was pretty fortunate this christmas
that's good
i'm taking like sewing lessons to try to learn how to sew better than what i can i won't have to go out and buy the ready-made clothes anymore
i even bought myself a surgery
i just love it
i figure that will help me save
my roommate does sew some
she hasn't sewed anything in a long time
i'm sure that she could pick it up again
some people are some aren't
i have three sisters
that's a real good way to save money
i can also do some crafts and sell those at garage sales
which i've been doing
that's a good way to a little extra money
this is another way that i'm making a little extra money
that was nice that i tripped over this opportunity
you're actually my first call
i had not done
have you called
i guess today's my first day that i could even do it
it is
that's nice
i was about to call to see if i could get on with somebody
that was great
i guess that's about all i can talk to about budgets
when i was working i bought a bond a month out of my
they automatically took it out of my payroll
i have some money taken it and put in a four oh one k
what sort of car are you interested in getting next
actually i love the car i have
i would get another one in a minute
unless i could afford what i really like which would be a red ferrari or a little corvette or something like that
that's what would influence my decision to change because i like a really sporty car
i'd love an expensive one
i probably
i understand and can sympathize with that because i also enjoy driving performance automobiles
i currently have an eighty-seven five liter mustang g t that i've done a bunch of modifications to make it handle and perform better
i suspect if i were to be able to get another car where object was
i'm a nurse here
we have a doctor at this hospital that has a beautiful new red ferrari
a three twenty-eight g t s
i couldn't tell you
it's just beautiful
i go out and i love to touch it
i can't even do that because
i just look at it a lot
it sure is a pretty thing
have you had the opportunity to drive a ferrari
they came in and up and out
they did whatever
we went for a test drive in that
i was able to open that up pretty good
that was really fun
i wanted it
i had a choice of that or my house
i thought that i'd continue
there's something about having a place to live
it's just necessary
i thought a tent wouldn't be bad but probably not practical
i find that the corvettes are becoming really nice cars
they're pretty aren't they lately
they've improved
it's not like driving a winnebago or something
i'm not into station wagons and vans and things that people are really buying now
i go um
that
the new type is prettier than what they used to look like
i sure don't think it's attractive
it's not like driving a little sports car
it's very hard to find something practical that's also attractive
i love mine
i bought it because i drove a friend's in hawaii
i just went home
i walked in
i picked it out
he said take it home and bring it back if you want to
i never did
i knew nothing about my car when i got it
it was a completely new experience for you
i'm sure you enjoyed every minute of it
i've had it
i still love it
it took twenty seconds
i figured there was nowhere i was to late to go that i didn't have twenty more seconds
you couldn't get
it's just a button that's it
you won't get
you don't have to get out or anything
twenty seconds you probably won't get caught in anything too substantial
i did actually
i was on a highway going like eighty
i really did
it all dried out didn't take long when the sun came out
the weather was pretty nice too
wasn't it pretty last week with the bluebonnets and everything
it's pretty far from where i live
where do you stand on
i think that people should be allowed to have them
my son goes hunting
he's read books about guns since he was probably eleven or twelve years old
i just think that as far as that's concerned he should be able to have them to go hunting with
as far as just having handguns around to have them i don't believe that you should have handguns around
as far as the ban goes and everything i don't think it's possible to completely ban guns
there's too many sports people out there that do do these things
that's true
the technology's not that hard
you could make a gun from simple
i suppose you could
if you really wanted a gun you could make one
i think if they want one they're going to get one
the bad guys are
there's no way to stop anybody from getting a gun
i agree with you on that because i know
in fact i had bought my son a rifle for a christmas present one time
for a rifle there's no waiting
there wasn't anything for rifles and things like that
i guess it was just handguns that there was some kind of a waiting two weeks while they checked you out or something
most of these people that's got these guns that's going around robbing people and shooting people
i know my friend is really into guns
i went a couple of times with him to gun shows that come through town and everything
they have anything you'd want
anywhere from rifles and semiautomatic weapons and
it's easier than getting a video membership card at a video store
i know they were having a gun show about a month ago
i was just wondering how that did work if somebody wanted to buy a gun at a gun show
you just go and buy the gun
you don't have to wait or nothing then
except for the pistols and th-
i was just curious because i know at the regular gun shop that you do have to wait for pistols like a couple of weeks
they check you out
you go pick it up
i think there is something like that
anyhow out here in california i think there is now
i'm not really sure what the gun laws in pennsylvania are like
like i say my son he's always had a
i think his first little rifle that we got him was he twelve or thirteen years old
he went to the school to learn how to shoot it
the rifle range to shoot them
he likes to go to that shotgun thing where you shoot at those yeah
he likes to do that
i don't know
i think they should try to control it and everything
as far as just banning it completely that's not going to happen
i don't think it can happen either
i don't see
i think hadn't thought about this before
if they would
they would just
all the profits would go to
they can be put in jail and everything whoever owned the gun
when they have kids around you'd think that they would be locking them up
None
that's true
i had a friend who was
she said that he used to always keep his guns locked up and everything like that
you're
people make
they forget or
the way kids are they can
they can get into almost anything anymore
we don't do enough
although lately i've been
it's
she's almost had an impact on me where she doesn't say anything to me when she comes
just unconsciously i've stopped buying a lot of paper plates and paper cups
i don't do that anymore
how is recycling done in your community
there's not a whole lot
they're given three baskets they put them out on a certain day of the week each home does participate
we really don't have anything close in this area that do anything
some of the communities that do the residents are having to pay to participate in it
over here they have several private companies that you can take recycled
if you want to take them all to one place the first saturday of every month they have certain places that you can drop them off
i recycle aluminum glass newspapers
it's nice to have one place that you can take them all to instead of driving the glass to one place
that's nice
it would be really nice if they came to the house to pick it up
they just were talking about a bill in tucson about that
it didn't go through
i heard that most homes that do participate in that are having to pay a monthly fee to do that which
i guess what they were talking about here was reducing the garbage collection in order to make that up or something
i guess that's one option
have you noticed that on the bottom of plastic goods they have this little number now that tells what kind of plastic it is
i didn't know that
now they're marking
they mark on the bottom what kind it is
i guess that makes it easy to recycle
they're trying to make plastic goods that don't have a bunch of different plastics in them that are only made out of one kind of plastic
that that makes it easier i guess
that's good
i'm
unfortunately garland doesn't
i don't know they don't do anything like that
i read those little slips that come in to your utility bills or your garbage collection
they haven't talked about doing something like that
i'm not sure what she does
oh she's very heavy in that
she takes her own bags to the grocery store
i really don't think she has any paper products
just a lot of things i've
she does make a lot of sense
i guess that's how it gets passed on when one person you hear from another person
you pass it on
it seems to be catching on slowly but surely i guess
my little boy watches a program that was really neat
i don't know if you know the little character barney
they had one on that type of thing
how children can do that
and to save water when you brush your teeth in water
it's really caught on
he's really caught on
that's really neat
when you start early i guess
i'm just editing a spreadsheet right now
this is a very appropriate topic for our conversation today because what i'm figuring out is that i'm going to have to put in a lot more money than what i'm making
we've got a pretty good situation my wife and i since our property is already paid for
the main things that i like about
they give you an opportunity to either transfer into an on going project
you work for it t i then
i work for d i s d
i don't know what your talking about when you say health insurance
dallas doesn't pay
it pays most of mine
after you work i think five years they begin to pay most of it
then for the family i put my kids on my policy
it's like two hundred dollars it's gone up quite a bit
they predict of course it's going to keep going up
benefits
it would make women go to work sometime if they knew their kids were being taken care of
that's something i hadn't really thought about because we don't have children
i can see how it would be a real benefit
we keep a shelter also monies that we're going to pay in for child care too
go on and pay a lump sum
as long as you pay that amount you're okay
if you paid in more than you actually used and the same thing for insurance what you predict your going to be paying for insurance as long as you actually pay out that amount of money you're okay
if you pay out less then you lose that money
you don't have to do that option if you don't want to
i could see where that would be important
we got that cafeteria plan
you can
let's see it shelters you're money that you pay for insurance
we call it the cafeteria plan
it's probably what the first guy who did it called it
let's see what else can we do
we could prohibit people from being hired that are historically going to cost the company money do a little bit better research on who gets hired
you mean for health insurance
not only just health insurance for the whole benefit of the company
i look at it this way if the company folds i got to go find a job
if we got somebody in a position to affect the way the company performs just about anybody in the company and they're not doing their job or they're not capable of doing their job then we should find a a place to put them or b boot them out
that's easier done in a company than it is in school teaching
frankly i think school teachers ought to get about ten times what they're getting paid
i'm
it's hard to get rid of a teacher if they're not good
there's two schools of thought on that
i'm looking at trying to get into a university job position as a a professor i got about eight years of education ahead of me before i can do that once you get that job with the university you've got ten years of probation
they can't fire you
in a situation like that i don't know if that's good or bad
i've also had tenured professors that were the best things on two legs
they did away with tenure in teaching along time ago in the public schools
in addition
you knew you weren't going to lose your job unless you really did something horrendous
they really can't fire you without cause
the governments taken care of that
what i'm looking at is there are a lot of teachers that aren't getting paid what they need to be getting paid
there are some teachers
i could see a point protecting someone's position
on the other hand i don't think that someone that teaches say shop for instance should have to have degree at all
they don't
you get specialized education now for instance take computer science
these people can't even get jobs doing anything besides digging ditches because there's no comprehensive test that they can take that would allow them to step into that position without having to go through the rigamarole of college
i went to college late on in life
i realize that hey it's nothing but four years of endurance
you might be teachable
know what i mean
my agree is absolutely worthless agree is probably degree
it's my experience and my knowledge that is beneficial
then like i said i came in backwards
what's your job now
actually i'm selling computer software
the two are mutually exclusive because
i'd like to see flexible hours and teaching
we've already got that
we've got a little bit of it but not much
i'd like to be able to evaluate your boss
it really carry some weight
you get to choose your boss
supervisor evaluations have always been a tough one especially in my line because my supervisor has nothing to with my job except to make sure i get my check
you get to evaluate him though
not really
what's to evaluate about him
my supervisor level is practically zero
when i need something i tell my boss
he gets it for me because he knows that i know what i'm doing
that is something that i think needs to be expanded on specially in the large market place the major corporation because so often you get a guy who's got eight or nine or ten people working for him in separate areas so to speak
it's hard for me to especially since i'm in marketing sales
if i don't make a sale i don't make anything
it's tough
there are requirements and quotas what not for me to make
the bottom line on that kind of thing is we have a lot of people especially in major corporations who aren't doing a damn thing
the work they do could be totally eliminated
not that they aren't worth or not that they aren't trying or anything but it's just that their jobs are useless
take for instance a large construction company i used to work for ed swampers
he's assigned to
i wanted to see it because there was much recommended
it was a genre that i wasn't in the least bit interested in
i usually when i hear about a movie that's supposed to be very good even if it's in a genre i don't like
i figure i should go see it because if this is the best of the genre and i should know about it or something like that i usually come away thinking no i really don't like this show
i feel that way when movies are blown up out of proportion
you always end up with expectations too high or whatever
the problem i had with the movie was the problem i've had with a lot of i guess hollywood movies which is it's a formula movie
and they're making the movie according to certain formula that's a good formula they seem to fall short of being really creative with a lot of things
here's the situation of this kid at home
it's a classic slapstick situation with these bungling burglars trying to get in he did some clever things
given the size of the house and how clever the kid was it seems to me they could have done a lot more basically stepping on things and yelling in pain it seems to me they could have been a lot more creative stuff used
i was very surprised that did do a slapstick movie because that's not really the way comedies are right now all the comedies are more like jokes and gags and stuff like that there's not as much slapstick anymore
i guess it was a very successful movie financially
we may see more slapstick
that's true
it is
i guess you don't have to if you look at
the last movie i saw i guess was the one about the frenchman that leaves and comes back and he's someone different
he's
it's about a man that leaves his home and comes back to his wife
his wife's all excited
the guy that comes back is not her original husband
it was a very famous popular movie
shoot i'm going to hit myself after i hang up
anyway that was a french movie that was the last one i saw downtown
i live in d c falls church virginia outside the city a lot of times they have the international films downtown this french i guess are into the slapsti-
they have a
yes they like your lewis much to the chagrin of sophisticated american everywhere
they have this one guy who does slapstick comedy
there's something about it that's so innovative
there's something about it it isn't just slapstick
there's something about the human character in it that's what i find lacking in a lot of like home alone
there was a lot of human character there
when it was the real slapstick moments him versus the criminals kind of thing it just sort of lost the human element and became purely a caricature does that make since to you
there's less character development just the funniness of the gag
rather than how it fits with the character right
we went without the kids
it's was a night away from the children
i would have liked to have a kid with me i think preferably someone seven or eight just to get a sense for how it affected them
i would have gotten in trouble the next day
that's true
i was thinking about that too
i saw that
that's why i watched another silly movie with my cousin was the one about the turtles
teenage mutant ninja turtles
your cousin's a kid
i saw that with my cousin just to see what what the kids are into that is
that was just excessively violent
it was all bloodless the good guys can get hit all day long they have to shake it off they don't get epileptics that sort of thing from getting hit on their head it's a little disturbing the violence in these films
the aftermath is usually not there
you see people who are severely injured very very badly lose control of body functions they thrash around
they scream
they never present that
even the movies that want to show violence as real they don't really show you what happens with that real violence i'm not really sure how i feel about that
on the one hand i'd like it to be a warning
they know what they're doing
they make the movies good enough to be successful they could make them better
as far as i was concerned teenage mutant ninja turtles could have been a classic of world theater it could have been
it was innovative a completely new approach to making a movie in a lot of ways
yet it ended up not being anything particularly memorable because the story was stupid and then things like that
they built up
i remember feeling annoyed that they had this whole thing about the master and the passing of wisdom from older to younger generation
it was a classic greek a sort of european mess going back three thousand years that they're playing with he had to
he told them remember you were united you can succeed individually you will fail there was a big climactic fight scene
they didn't remember that
they failed individually
then that was it
then they had to have the master beat him according to the classic myth the sort of joseph campbell type myth the master should have died at the end because the lesson was passed to the young generation
the older generation is not needed
is reborn to the younger generation
all this wonderful mess it still would have been every bit as accessible a movie for the kids if they had included all this stuff that i as an intellectual adult would appreciate
it would have make it broadened the audience that it could have been targeted for i thought i'm truly an intellectual snob
i realize that to go to these movies and expect them to be other than just good entertainment kind of thing
there's not too many that are good just that you wouldn't want to change something
there's always something that
i'm very critical
i'm actually originally from hollywood
then
my father works in films
i tend to be hypercritical of these things
perhaps it's unfair because i must admit i enjoy these movies that's what they're for
i don't remember them
i can think of movies i have less fun during
after the movie's over i remember it so terribly well because it had some meaning to me or something
there are several movies that hit home like that
of course the ones i always remember are the older ones i always like the musicals and
they leave some songs with you
i don't know what it is it just
i don't know if this is old fart talking here or something because i'm not that old
those old movies seemed to have had something that was memorable somehow
i guess i got to get going
thanks for hearing me rap i guess
thank you very much
i'm from the
what has your experience lead you to advise if my child were thinking of going to the air force academy
i'd encourage it
it's a good general education for a bachelor's degree
obviously it's where they don't have any post graduate program there
you get an excellent wide basis of topics
you get a good broad education out of it
they don't graduate the best engineers or the best english majors but maybe a graduate pretty good overall students out of there
how does that
how do you feel that is for someone at that phase in their life
other people
it's suffocating
you kind of choke on it it depends on the individual
the one factor i think more than anything else in this day and age that's got to be a big factor in your decision's just the cost how much you're going to pay no matter where you go to school
if you've been in for twelve years
you've got your share of student loans that you're probably going to be paying off or have been
i sort of
one of the reasons it's taken so long is i've been working
sort of half working and source of income and stuff
i'm actually managing to do this with zero debt
that's good
you couldn't do it otherwise
i know people that i went to high school with that went to civilian colleges
they've got twenty thirty thousand dollar debts
you could have
i think if there's any major piece of advice is to find a way of getting an education that doesn't incur that kind of debt
i remember seeing an article one time about if the average person who spent that much money going to college just took the same amount of money and put it in an investment fund they'd be considerably wealthier than they would be from the
it's really kind of crazy
it's staggering when you think that just here in central new york is
hamilton college is just maybe about twenty miles to the south from where i am they're looking for twenty-two thousand dollars for tuition and room and board now
it is a select
i was thinking of trying to get a job there
you're talking incredible tuitions now
i get
it's more money that i make in a year
it
for new york state
i'm a second lieutenant in the air force now
even as a somebody making twice what i was making how could you put half of that to your child's education
just when they make it to the college years it's
my real feeling about the purpose of undergraduate education is it's really the time
you eventually forget most of it
what you don't forget is the growing up
people who don't go to college become adults in other ways
i think that the best way to choose a college is to decide what kind of environment you want to be fostered in as you gain new social skills as you become more of a functioning member of society
maybe the air force academy is a perfect
as you said for someone who needs to learn self-discipline and so forth would be appropriate for them
it's also a good environment
want to develop that
i agree with that because i see people that i know again from high school
they do the same old things they did in high school and
same socializing same exact crowd that they hang with
it's frozen time
i find it kind of sad
it really is that they haven't found anything better that
their experiences haven't been broadened at all
to
it's a tremendous thing when you sit in a college environment and discuss some issues and really sit there with people with disagreeing opinions
you hear all these different sides of the story that you never thought of that's another big thing i think people get out of college is the appreciation for differing points of view
or different opinions
the one thing i think that's no good for anyone is these monster institutions
these institutions of thirty thousand students and such
i see some freshmen wandering around in there
when i was undergraduate i went to a relatively small school for my first two years
i transferred to a very large school
that worked out pretty well
i went from a second rate institution to a higher rate institution
the first couple of years it doesn't matter to me what the quality of the education was
there were things like that that mattered a lot more
i needed really simple education that you can get pretty much anywhere for the first couple of years
your education's a lot what you make of it too
if you're alienated
i see people at supposedly really good universities who are just having psychological problems
i've seen more graduates from m i t
i work an air force laboratory
we've got a lot of m i t graduates that are in there
they are the biggest collection of screwed up people that
even more so military academy grads are a strange lot too
i have to confess to that
it's sort of a rare select environment
they have their own quirks and tolerances and
certain things that don't bother us at all
certain things that
things we do
these m i t grads are off in their absolute own world
it's a
i have a lot of respect for m i t master's and doctorate
now i
they're undergrads are like
i'm amazed at that's a lot of them even graduated
i don't know
i had known a lot of undergraduates who pick schools because they want the best reputation for a school
not realizing that the reputation for m i t is because of the doctorate research
you're not going to see the professors
they think what the best is is
reputation for research
that's a one standard
it's not relevant
i didn't think about that before when you were talking
the service academies have all the faculty for the most part is military with a few exchange
professors from other
having the military faculty is really beneficial because they see it as doing their job and spending time with the cadets there is investing in the air force
the military itself it's the future officer corps
i hear horror stories from friends of mine that they could never see their instructors
for me any time i needed extra help any time of the day i had all my instructors home phone numbers could call them
i had some instructors that would invite me over to their house for extended study things on weekends
you won't get that at m i t virtually or anything like that
you can't blame the professors either
you'd s-
that's appropriate if the university is trying to do serious research because it's hard to be a researcher and a teacher at the same time
i'd say go to a college that has teachers
None
there's a lot of factors that people don't ever consider in their selection of a college
i don't know
maybe i wonder if they enter these conversations that people have been having
normally i like to go out fishing in a boat rather than bank fishing just to try and catch anything that's swimming because i've had such problems with trying to catch any type of fish that i just really enjoy doing the boat type fishing
you like fresh water
i've never tried with deep sea water fishing because i get sea sick
i see
i can go out and go deep sea fishing
that would be nice
i was raised on the texas gulf coast
my goodness
during the christmas holidays we'd go down to our house on the coast i thought fish came out of the ocean anything that was fresh water was muddy i didn't learn to fish in a lake until i was into my twenties i had always been a sea fisher type which is a lot of fun
i bet it is
at night you can go walking in the shallows and gig flounder and things like that
it's a lot of fun
i grew up fishing
i haven't done much fishing here in texas because i moved from ohio
i see
we did a lot of fishing when we were up there
down here i have a brother that likes to go over on the east in east texas and do fishing
he was just here this past weekend
i think he mentioned it again
i couldn't remember what it was
i want to call it salt fork or lake fork
i can't remember
he said it's one of the best bass fishing places
i
he said that he has never gone anywhere before
he's fished all over the united states in which they can catch the biggest bass that you've ever seen
i would love to go over there
they were talking about going over there some time in the spring
i was thinking it would be great to go over there to go fishing and catch some bass
they have snakes over there
i'm not too welcome around
i really don't want to share a boat with a snake
i don't see it
i think that i perhaps would let them have the boat or something
i'd make some quick arrangements i've told so many stories about the snakes when they pull in there's a snake instead of a fish
i think it was only three and a half pounds
for me that's big
because it's always been on a lake and
three and a half pounds was
on a lake
None
i'd love to go catch the marlins or whatever in the deep sea fishing
i've seen it
i have no problem going out in a boat
there's just so many other ways live down there
one of my favorite things was we were forever catching crab and steaming them out on the beach and just pitching them out on newspaper and breaking them up and sitting out there and eating them
and then digging a hole and pitching the whole thing in it you know that's it
the other little creatures would take care of what was left
going out on a boat never did appeal to me simply because there was so much else to do
do you live along houston
None
you
that's close to
south padre is on down the bend it's like if you drew a line from austin straight down it would be in that region
i've been to port aransas
it was when i was a child
we would go to port aransas or then on down to corpus or further
i was just wondering we went to galveston this summer even with all the oil spills and everything
it was horrible
i don't think
i hate to hear that
that's true
the water was murky
i would hate to think about catching fish or anything there huh-uh
i have a favorite hotel that extends out over the water what is it the flagship
it most certainly is so that it was certain things that were enjoyable about it
None
it always smelled the entire time we were there
the rest of the time we stayed in the pool because the water was so awful
of course being raised on the water i'd never swim in it
i have no desire to share
huge sharks are down there
some of the young dread naughty boys in my family would fish for them all night it was incredible the size of them
the next morning they would have them strung up across the getties it
just strung up
now i never knew they were that big
it was nice talking to you
it certainly was
almost ever single day from when they started it
i
just over a year ago i bought my own house
this has been the first opportunity i've had to be working on my own lawn and garden
back when i was a kid mom would send me out to weed the garden
i'd hate it
i sort of take pride in the yard and how the place looks
i don't mind doing it so much anymore
do you have a garden
do you just do your landscaping now and your lawn
it's primarily just landscaping a little bit
i've got some bushes around the foundation planning things like that
there's just some little flower beds
my mom grows
she starts her own stuff from seed now
she gets a little over zealous when she is planting these seeds in the wintertime and starting them
she ends up with so many plants that she can't fit them all in her garden
she brings them up here from philadelphia and gives me all her extras
that's pretty good
my sister is very over zealous too
this is my first year in a house where i'm thinking about doing some flower beds and stuff
i've always had crude ones at my father's
this is the first time that i really have to landscape a house
it has nothing
nothing
what i do do and i've always done it is
at my father's house my sister and i have a couple of gardens
we each have a third of an acre we do
that's more than the property i have right here that you've got as a
it's my dad's
he's been there for a long time it just happens they built a shopping center next to it they put up a nice fence
we still have a
we grow a lot of food
i enjoy it
the gardens are kind of old
there's still
we my sister uses probably a fertilizer
i wish this phone would stop screeching
i don't think my phone really does that
every time i have this phone is a little weird
it's been dropped on the floor a hundred times
i don't know
whatever it was there was a second there
i guess we better stick to the subject for the benefit of the people doing this work
that's a heck of a pla-
especially up in vermont there you should have some really nice soil
we grow a lot of the basic corn potatoes
see how many she can grow bas- corn potatoes
acorn squash are good winter keepers
things the way we grow are carrots cabbage that sort of goes to waste we
she starts her own plants
i do a lot of the back work and stuff
she helps me a lot too
they find that tomatoes don't do well if you put them next to something like peas
because of the cross-pollination
it's just something like an onion and a tomato would go together but you're not supposed to put your onions near your beans
i guess it's just what scents it gives off
she reads all kinds of books
i wish i knew more to tell you why
my mom put cantaloupes and cucumbers near each other once
the got cross pollinated by the bees we ended up with these things on the cantaloupe vines that looked like round big huge round cucumbers
that's really weird
these were like some mutant
i'll make an l shape i've put my cantaloupe
they've been pretty close together
i don't think the vines
they don't have to be touching or anything
it's just the bees and insects will do it
this last season it was too wet up here we lost a lot of our root things our squash and our potatoes
we got half our yield
when we moved in there we had a really wet backyard
my mom wanted a vegetable garden
we trucked in
i think it was seven cubic yards
i'm going to have a seven yard truck come in with some top soil
i'm going to
it seems
my problem is i want to use those rail ties to build up a planter i don't know if the creosote in the rail ties is going to do something if i want to grow a tomato or something in there i guess it'd go with my flowers
i've seen a lot of people use them for flower beds
i don't know whether creosote would do anything
i just don't think you
i always thought i'd put a tomato plant in there or something weird i don't think i could really eat the fruit off it without wondering
i don't know if they make landscape ties that aren't treated
you can get pressurized lumber
they put
that's right
there's bad chemicals in those too
i'm not really worried about it
i'm just not going to put that tomato plant in there
my flower gardens are always been on the ground
it just looks so much better when it's up against the house tiered up
you can see it a little better
it stands out
i can tell you there's nothing around it cement foundation all the way around it not a shrub not a bush
the landlord cut it down said yeah that's one thing you have to do is keep that lilac bush cut down so it doesn't rub up against the siding i'm looking at him like jeez
that's all right
rub up against the siding
that's what he's worried about the trees or a bush because lilac bushes they grow fast
some people would really like to have them
the people that do have them they spread and they sprout all over their lawn
they're kind of a pain
people who don't have them think they're great
people who do have them
another thing i have that is weird is a locus tree in the back yard
i can imagine if i had to mow the lawn in the back which we said we'd do if the trees hang down
the locus trees have like three quarters of an inch thorns on it
i don't remember what they look like
when you walk up to them they're covered with thorns
we're going to get a chain saw and limb it extensively so it gets the trees up overhead
it'll give you room to get under it
a tree is always something very nice to have
i don't think i'll have a problem
if that's not the problem
did you vote in the last national election
i haven't missed a one since i've been eligible to vote
that's good
sometimes the local ones aren't as publicized it seems that they should be
there's usually nobody running against the incumbents
you don't know where they stand or anything like that
i feel that a lot of people have gotten lazy about voting
also they're fed up with the system
they say why should i even vote
sometimes they don't like either of the choices for the candidates
they think why vote
the last gubernatorial race it was awful
i don't know
it'll be interesting to see how the next few years go
i think it's definitely a problem
i think it could get worse
we get this lackadaisical attitude
why should we vote
then it could lead to some serious things
it also seems like maybe another candidate that nobody wants could slip in if not enough people are voting
if we get someone in there like that then they could make all sorts of changes that they had enough pull
it's kind of like in louisiana where that guy that's like a ku klux klan member something got elected
who's the other guy larouche that is sort of the socialist not socialist but comm-
he's so off the wall that he's gone in and tried to get into city elections
he's been put away for credit card fraud i believe
people will sit home and assume that guy would never get elected
if you don't go and vote then very good chance that they will because a lot of the people like that they'll strike a chord in some of the people that so will say look this guy's got everything together
i like what he says
he'll be so far off the wall that they'll elect him
i think that's sort of what happened with louisiana because the guy did get elected correct
they can always fool us
i think one thing that maybe would help people vote is if the polls were either open more days or you could mail it in or something like if you have real strict work hours and you can only go like at seven in the morning or after work and you have to stand in line for so long i think that discourages a lot of people
what we do usually is vote absenteeism i know here you don't have to have any reason
you can just go and vote the polls are open what was it a couple of weeks
they're even open on saturdays and a couple of sundays
we've got plenty of time to go because down here in houston the lines are long
they're long here too
None
i did it
it was nice
i recommend it because you just walk right on in and there's usually not anybody in line that vote's just as good as the one on election day
i've been involved with some of the campaigns and the state conventions of the republican party
it's really interesting to see the process as far as what goes through as far as the voting and the not the ballots
my mind has gone blank
it's interesting
a lot of times i'll vote a straight party ticket just because i don't take the time to find out other than the major candidates what they stand for on what issues
i'll just trust well the party kind of goes along these lines so i'll go ahead and vote
there for a while that worked
i know i have
sometimes i'll stick to a certain party depends on the guy
if it gets down between two then i'll vote for the party
they're both just as bad
i'll say i know what this guy stands for as far as for his party
None
that's not the best way
it gets to the point where
you've got to find the time also to read about the guy and be able to find the information about what he stands for
try to determine if what you read was objective or not
what you've heard on t v which i think is just outrageous
i don't agree with how the media handles elections
i'm tired of hearing about the polls
it's just ridiculous
i think it could affect the outcome could make it unfair
then sometimes how the media will blow things out of proportion and will run an issue into the ground which is good and dead
they keep dragging it on
it could hamper the outcome of an election for the guy that should have won
i sometimes think that that should be limited more
boy you try get into that
they i agree with the freedom of the press and all the amendments
sometimes it's for the public's own good that we don't hear things
i don't think they ever care to
i can't think of anything else really about the polls or voting to talk about
i enjoyed talking to you
it was good talking to you
this is kind of ironic because i work in t i legal department
although we don't have any criminal actions here we do have other lawsuits that do go to trial from time to time
when was it
a couple weeks ago i was asked to go to jury duty
i wasn't selected
for some of our cases in particular we have very technical cases from time to time because of our patents and such
it's very difficult for lay people for somebody who might just happen to be selected in our jury to understand what we're talking about
i do think that the cases say something like texaco versus pennzoil
the texaco pennzoil problem
is ridiculous for people just taken off the street to understand and
some i don't
in criminal i guess you always have a jury
in civil cases you have the option of whether you want a jury or not
is that right
in some incidences i think they ought not to have a jury
there should be some way where it could be opted for them not to have a jury
i was only on one jury ever
it really was a pretty trivial case
it seemed to me all the time i was thinking of all these people in the courtroom over the case that involved a couple thousand dollars i think
it was really just terrific waste of everybody's time and money
it finally ended up that even though we had reached a verdict before we were allowed to give it they settled the case
they had settled while we were deliberating
the one thing i did approve of there was that we didn't have to be unanimous because it was a civil case
we were split ten to two
it was a good thing that
i've never fully served
i've been asked twice to go down
i didn't get elected on the panel
i know that for a lot of the civil cases it's rare
if your a lawyer there you could be a lawyer who never actually gets into the courtroom
their kind of law doesn't get them to the courtroom
even in litigation which is doing lawsuits is a lot of times that you never get to the courtroom itself
i think that the trial in a sense is kind of a threat to hold over people to try to get them to reach an agreement out of court
it's a shame that
there's awful lot of money in time and effort spent in preparing for trial only to then finally get scared enough by going to the court
usually it's the scare kind of the jury because you really don't know one way or the other how that jury is going to feel
the jury may or may not see it that way
you get a little anxious there and go
who knows what the jury will say because sometimes the juries come down with a result and you go gee
i was a witness in a criminal case
it was absolutely horrifying to me how that operated because so much evidence was excluded
that the jury was never allowed to hear
they convicted the defendant on as far as i could tell very flimsy evidence and two perjured testimonies
i knew the people involved the people who d and the people who were defendants
i think that was just a horrible miscarriage of justice because of the staying by the absolute strict rules and not allowing things to be presented to the jury that were highly irrelevant to the case and could i thought have established the defendant's innocence
i do
and judges on both sides of the family and uncles and cousins and things like that i really think that we have gotten into much too legalistic of society and that we spend far too much on the fine points of the law and far too little on achieving justice
it seems a lot of times especially in criminals that their rights are so protected
what about the rights of the rest of society
we're protecting this person's rights who has broken the law
we protect him so much
what about the rest of the society
we're kind of forgetting about them
i think sometimes that a criminal should kind of
in a lot of
in criminal cases for instance you can't bring up prior convictions unless they are somehow directly related to the case
it seems to me that a jury can make a much more rational decision if they know somebody had fifteen convictions for a similar crime
it's possible that he didn't commit the
that was one of the things that was not allowed in the trial i went to
though one of the two people who gave the perjured testimony had a long criminal record and had been a real sleaze bag
he came in and was presented to the court as a standing young man who had been in seminary to become a priest
i happen to know his background
i know that he would have sold out his mother for shorter sentence
it's really annoying when the
he said that was barred by the court
we do have some problems
it seems to me that maybe it's time to just scrap all the case law and go back to general principles
where you
i'd even go for trying to get some truth out of the witness stand if they come up with some pretty reliable lie detector tests that we can see right then and there whether they're lying or telling the truth
i witnessed one trial many years ago when i was first studying to be a paralegal
they barred priors on this person
they never then told us i guess because priors had a reason as to why these two people were very much in hatred of each other
they never told us why these two people had such a vendetta against each other
the crime was attempt to commit murder
they never told us why these people were mad at each other
gee
you think that would be relevant
they told us in school that crime has to be an intent has to be not just the act but you have to intend to do it
there could be accidental kind of things
they never told us why these two people hated themselves or if one had done something to really aggravate the other
i had a tough time with that
being a person who saw what the jury didn't plus what the jury did because we were just observing there in the courtroom
i've seen everything presented
they just haven't a real complete case here to my thinking
you'd still
it seems to me that you'd get a lot more information if your questions were heard
if you were allowed to ask the witnesses things or the lawyers things or even the judge
particularly the witnesses
allow them to go back and deliberate after each days proceedings come out with some questions that they want answered like the next day bring those people back
if they would allow them to give broader answers they
it's really kind of choreographed
i can remember friends of daddy
what do you think about taxes
i look at it this way you've got to pay for the privilege of living here
being a rec vehicle owner
in fact i live in a motor home
i'm what they call a full timer
it burns gas like crazy
they call it
anyway a luxury tax
they add it on to tires and gasoline cigarettes liquor
i quit smoking
that doesn't bother me
i don't think it's fair
it's attacking just certain people
gasoline especially in this part of the country we all use it all the time
that's not what i would consider a luxury
fifty years ago the automobile was a luxury
it's a necessity today
as hard as they try to get these public transit things going i have never seen nor heard of one that really got of the ground
or that accomplish what they set out to accomplish
i think that we probably are paying a little too much tax considering what we're getting for it and how it's being managed and so forth
i think there could be better system
we would get more for our money
we can't really do a whole lot about how that money is spent and where it goes
that's so true
they say well you voice your opinion on election day
not really
what happened they turned around and double crossed us
you can't believe what you hear
i think too
one of the things that rubs me the wrong way the most is those programs that are funded by congress and that don't seem to have any validity at all
they're always far out
they're studying some obscure bug
our tax money pays for those things
i think that's wrong
i also think we extend too much help to other countries
i think here lately they've been saying quite often and maybe somebody's coming to realize we're the nation in trouble
i can't wait for
i could just picture what's going to happen here in the not to distant future
we keep hearing well we're going to receive eight billion dollars from japan for the big
many billions of dollars here and there and everything
the next thing you know we'll be turning around just like we did to poland
just forget it
i think that's a mistake
somewhere we have to realize that we can't just keep giving it away
another thing now they keep decontrolling different things
first it was the airlines then it was banks and savings association
the same with the airlines back in the days when they were controlled and transcontinental or interstate trucking
as soon as the federal government gave up control on all that they just went to hell in a hand basket
then in the case of airlines of course they became highly competitive
they cut each others throats until they reach the point where they're cutting their own throat
of course that's getting away from taxes isn't it
that's government controlled
i think another thing too that i've had a little contacted with
in regard to taxes let's say that you have something that the i r s disagrees with or says hey we're not going to allow that
i think they're very unfair in the amount of penalties and interest that they can attach to that because you will not only payback that that you wrote off
you will at least double that amount
to me there's something wrong there
by the time you get through with the penalties
i can see paying the interest and some small penalty
they really stick it to you big time
i agree
i think the i r s is just too powerful
they should be a little more humane
the typical bureaucratic i guess that's one of my pet peeves
i came up with a brilliant idea how we could reduce the budget
give government employees the average number of holidays as the
you think about it now
they get about sixteen holidays a year
i think here at ti we get what is it nine or ten
i haven't counted
i would have guessed eight even
you might be right
i remember
i think it was the last time i did hear that we get about the average
government is ridiculous
they're paying out this money anyway
anyway that would of course eventually come back to taxes
as far as income tax is concerned i can't complain too much about it
i'm single
i have no dependents or anything
they're out worrying about their own income taxes
i have another thing that i thought about too for instance when you try to save money and you earn interest on whatever your investment is
we're not typically talking about big dollars
here you feel like you've done something good
you've earned your interest
then you have to go back and pay taxes on it
the real amount of your savings on that is not much
very true
it's kind of a vicious circle there
they tell you to invest it in is it i r a or something
when you turn sixty-five why then you pay the tax on it
the tax is a lot less
in the mean time you've got your money tide up in a relatively low interest bearing investment
it's not making ten fifteen percent like a business is today
me i'm a firm believer in that if you got it spend it
you can come over to my house and spend it
do you need some help spending yours
that's problem too
i'm trying to figure out from one payday to the next whose going to be the lucky one this month that's going to get paid
i guess we probably talked just about long enough
let me ask you something
everybody i've talked to has received one
i haven't gotten mine
i don't know
anyway ellen it was nice talking to you
until next time
i think that maybe the automation people that are very discrete or not discrete electronic devices
is he the one that got you connected with us
are you going to buy a car soon
it won't be too much longer because my husband and i are both going to retire
when we retire we're going to buy us a new one and get rid of the two that we have right now
what are you going to buy
i don't know
we're going to buy a pick up
we're going to buy a van
we're going to buy an economy car
have you been listening to iacocca's arguments that chrysler products are the only ones
i'm hoping that by
i keep saying lets put it off lets put it off because i'm hoping they'll get so many better features
just like that air bag
i've seen some of the head on collision type things
the people walked away from the wreck
with no scratches nothing a few bruises
did you see the
i don't know if it was twenty-twenty last thursday or friday night on seat belts
i tell you what
i would not buy a car that had the seat belt where it was hooked under the door
i
that a little more than scared me
that irritated me
because it surely didn't come as a surprise that if the door came open
None
you know what the average person
now i-
it's not a
for me it's a real consideration
the
it's probably my main hobby
right you always think
i don't know
that's just like
it was on one of those kind of shows like twenty-twenty these people were like paralyzed
they were hooked at the waist
it did something to their spinal cord then they were like paraplegics
road and track had some articles on
particularly with back seat with some were sitting in the back seat with seat belts on
they were thrown forward into the front seat
there was enough stretching
really if your sitting in the back seat your better off not to have your seat belt on if it's just a seat belt
tell me about your van
we have a van that just has seat belts in the back doesn't have a shoulder harness
it's a mini van
they replace the engine at sixty thousand under extended warranty
the transmission was replaced
they really are nifty
it's a foot or two shorter than a
we had a regular size station wagon it really
the reason that we're thinking about something like that we took a trip in my brother in law and sister in laws to florida like i said we're not that old
my husband works for the state
after a certain amount of years you can retire
when he retires i'm retiring
as soon as i get my quarters in i'm
no more
the
did you go to florida in a van
that was really nice traveling
i like to hear about more people that have things like that
see what they think of them
the different kinds i've only ridden in the one
what kind was it
what was remarkable this van even with the
we went to disney world actually i grew up in alabama
i went to see my mother
went on down to disney world
it got better than i think twenty-two twenty-three miles a gallon
this was with the air conditioner on and four people with luggage
course this
it's been four years ago
it's remarkable that the bigger vans they're
my boss just bought a pick up truck
he only gets seventeen miles a gallon
it has a big engine
it pulls a boat and stuff
it's got the seats
the other thing that is interesting is it has rear air conditioning
that makes a lot of difference in those of us that live in warm climates
this one that we went in
the big vans are all
it was a big one
those are yeah
it has the back seat let down into a queen size bed it had the two swivels in the middle and then the two swivel chairs on the front it was fantastic
it got good gas mileage
i don't
i want something i can drive too
i was scared to drive that big van
the mini that
you'd be surprised if you drive one of the the mini vans
more or less alike the chevrolet
of course oldsmobile has got one
chryslers got one
they drive remarkably like cars
does yours have that this one had it where you would see something coming in the rear view mirror not the rear those little side mirror things it would look like it was further back than it was
the little thing etched in it
say objects are closer than they appear or something
i was wondering if all vans did that
you can install those mirrors
i don't know if you've driven a pick up truck
these mirrors must be six inches across not nearly a foot high
they're really nice
actually they fold so when you get in tight situations you can fold them back
that's the reason we couldn't really make them
they're uh-huh
at first we were going to get a pick up truck with a camper on the back of it
then that gas mileage was just atrocious
it's
it just practically don't get any
they have got some of the newer ones with the aerodynamic features
you can get pretty decent gas mileage
he talked about a van
i said i don't know how the gas is on most of these
another thing was
that's the reason i said there was such a big difference in a little economy car
i said maybe we might have to get us an economy car to pull along when we went somewhere
really and truly the safety features
i wouldn't get one that
ford now announced i think in ninety-two they're going to put air bags in their vans
that would be good
i think i believe safety
i really do believe in this stuff
i think it can go
surprisingly they're
you need a combination of both the air bags
i think so too
i think you need the shoulder thing i think you need the thing around your waist
i think you need that bag to pop out too
because
i think it's fantastic
that wouldn't be fair
no because what they would do is that's what they're going to plan on
these cars will be off the roads or something in ten years if you didn't have a car that had one then your insurance would go up enormously
i've got to go
that's okay
i think we've probably spent a reasonable amount of time
you too
i know our policy
they are missionaries there
they live there
they have to travel by boat forty-five minutes to get to their car and stuff
i know that they helped a lot of those sandanistas refugees coming across the border
they housed them and stuff
they wrote that it's kind of weird
the bats eat the bad spiders
they leave the bats
it's a whole different culture
it's weird down there because there's always lizards and things running around that people live there
they take it for granted
it's like we go down there on vacation
it's like how can these people live with these lizards and bats in their house
i think their policy with them that though is
i don't know
i'm glad that the sandanistas aren't in power anymore because i think that they were
i feel like most of the leaders in latin america are probably
you would be safe to say that they were just very very big into drugs
very very corrupt like the panamanians were very corrupt
a lot of american servicemen are involved
i guess there was a big scam that all these guys up
it's like everybody is into it
i
my girlfriend used to be in the navy
she was based in panama
in honduras very pro-american
there's a lot of men i don't know how many american
there's a lot
they
the american government you can't trust them either because you think you don't know how corrupt they are they keep people in power like the shah of iran and
it's the lesser of two evils
i don't know how corrupt the honduran government is
i think they need the repentance on the leadership of the different nations for all the atrocities that they commit and the drug dealings just in the drug crimes
i feel like a lot of the leadership in those nations are so engrossed in the drug crimes that until they repent or they are moved from power that
i know a lot of those nations there's brazil i know is like forty percent evangelical christian not just go to church but really on fire for god
they are just surpassing latin america by the drugs
it's just incomprehensible
i think that god is going to honor that and that he is going to put in some good leadership
i know the president of i believe costa rica is a christian
no guatemala because he goes to virgo church in guatemala city
he is a former president of guatemala
that god is doing something
he is raising up some leaders
the people want him back as president bad
they have a rule in guatemala that he can't have another term
the people are trying to override that not just the christians but all the people because they see when a righteous man is in authority the people rejoice
that's the thing
it's going have to
it's the
that's the thing that will eventually
it's funny you mention costa rica because they are one of the most successful and peaceful countries
i was reading an article in the national geographic
i don't know
they don't have big tourism
maybe it is their faith that enables them to keep the crime out
i know that costa rica they don't allow anybody to come any what do you call immigrants
they don't allow people to move in like less nations
they don't probably take a lot of refugees from other countries either
i couldn't even go there
even with in inner company transfer or something
i have another friend in costa rica that
aw that was just really sad
a lot of it though is their debt
if we feel like we need to give them money then give it to them
quit loaning all the money out
that's how we got into a problem
we went in the hole by us loaning them all of these billions of dollars
also mexico we will loan the money in
a lot of the higher people
we're suckers
it's like we are partly responsible for their problems by loaning them all that money
you feel like you need to give them something to help them out fine
you don't go making billions of dollars of loans in to people that you can just look at the situation
that puts a bondage on them
it makes pressure on the nation and on the people and on the leadership and makes their inflation go up
it's just a big mess
did you go to mexico city anywhere near when the earthquake hit
i knew people
i knew people
i got a letter from a friend of mine that i had met there who the apartment building was destroyed
they were living in a tent
it's kind of weird
they were just normal people weren't squatters or poor people or anything that
i knew all of my friends there
none of them that i know of got killed in it
they're all christians though
there's been a real revival in mexico city since that earthquake because there's a lot of sin in those nations and a whole lot of witchcraft
i can imagine
there's a lot
they are over there doing witchcraft and stuff and just a whole lot of the generational things too like the mayans and the incas
yet they are revered and honored and almost worshiped by
many people
even now in america we wouldn't know the truth with all of indian groups that were totally removed from the face of the earth because of how wicked they were
i have climbed to the top of the pyramid where they used to take a beating heart out of a young thirteen year old boy
they hold it up to the sun god
that's pretty of heavy duty
is there still blood stains on the altar
has it worn away through the years
it was kind of weird
do you get butterflies in your stomach when you go there
at that time i kind of did
it really impressed me just feeling
i wasn't a christian when i went there
i think that a lot of those generational things
i think that god sees i'm praying
that keeps the christians that are beginning to rise up there to be able to pray because that does affect that things in your background
do you have a family budget
we haven't
why don't you explain to me some good tips about what you've done which you've found useful and workable
i have to say my husband and i are both from financial backgrounds
i'm an accountant
he has an m b a
we were sort of keyed in on expenses and things like that
coming from that background what we pretty much do is in our household as far as living expenses we live on a cash budget
every month my husband goes to the credit union and withdraws x amount of dollars for the month
then that money is used during that month
we've gotten pretty good at it
our budgets are realistic
they are not so stringent to make us feel uncomfortable
i really try to stretch my dollars here and there shopping at warehouses sometimes at sam's and things like that
we live on a cash budget
sometimes it's tight come the end of the month
generally we always make it
the are sometimes several hundred dollars like tires for the car or car repair of some sort
or a dental bill or something that you're not prepared for
most of our medical things we don't have to worry about because of insurance
they're relatively small
we've been lucky
right now we don't
we have a car fund
we put a certain amount of money into that every single month whether we need to or not
None
i can't really remember what it is
do you kind of continue call this a part of savings account or a different savings account
a certain amount goes straight to the savings account
we decide okay let's say it's a hundred dollars
every month fifteen dollars is for car fund
we constantly do that so that there's a buildup of money for those things if something does come up
i know that my washing machine is going to go any day
we have the money set aside
if it does it's not going to kill us
we're pretty disciplined
it makes those surprises not so difficult to get through
then your pay what kind of a percentage do you basically keep out that you think that will cover all of the expenses kind of thing
what percent do you then save or something
we have a lot of different things
right now we save about twenty-five percent of our pay
it goes toward different things
it's for vacations like i said for emergencies for car breaks down something like that
we also put money aside for our kids college
just this last month we paid off my final school loan
do you use a lot of credit cards or your checking account when you go out and buy things
checking account a lot not so much credit cards
now several years back i used to use charge cards all the time kind of thinking it's on sale it must be a good deal
pretty much now we don't use them too much
if we travel or something yeah but
if it is a purchase then it's paid off when the bill comes
it isn't any extended
then when the bill comes we always pay it off then
it's not any build up on the charge cards at all
that hasn't always been the case
i'm kind of
i feel at least better now that i have finally gotten some of those things in the past
i don't have big cumulative amounts due to those charge cards because that interest rate just is a killer
it's not deductible anymore
i've never been in the situation of itemizing anyhow
pretty much when i go to the grocery store or something i just always write checks
we did that for a long time
it got to the point where we had no idea how much we were spending on things
it seemed like we didn't have enough money when things cropped up
we decided to put ourselves on a cash budget
the first time we did it we just took some arbitrary amount that we estimated it would be
then we kept track of everything for a month
how much we spent on food how much we spent on gasoline how much we spent on everything
from that built a cash budget
now i have
some months i may spend three hundred on groceries and a hundred on everything else
some months it may be different
it's not as though we feel like we have to keep ourselves down to the dollar or the penny in certain categories kind of thing
the way we set up the amount that we want to save and the amounts that we have to spend for utilities and the house payment and all that
the cash budget just fits right in there
again it's a set amount every month
on special occasions birthdays and things like that
we still have fun on things
we are in the process of trying to buy a house
did you have a budget to get your down payment going to get a house
not originally because
the kind of loan we got you really didn't have to put down anything
we got into it fairly cheaply
after we sold the first house we were left with enough cash that there was enough to make the down payment on this house
we got out of that one pretty easily
it's really rough to keep yourself on a strict budget for a long long time when your priority is to save for the house
then it's awful hard to really scrimp for a long long time and keep putting all the money into that down payment
jeez they are one and four
my husband he's the real disciplinarian when it comes to that money usually
i know
there are times when i sit there and i think wow we make x amount of money and where is it
you look around
you go
you haven't made big purchases
that's the easier thing to see
if you can see a big purchase and you go okay this is the year that we bought the couch or the t v
all those just monthly payments and stuff that just go out the door
there's big chunks of your money to pay the utilities and the gas and the groceries
that you don't have the perishable kind of things that's used and gone
it's amazing how much we spend on some things
that's all he has
i'd say at least two usually three times a week he takes his lunch
the other times he'll i don't know go out somewhere
he keeps himself on that
he found it's so easy to spend five dollars a day on lunch
that's twelve hundred dollars a year just on lunch
when he can take a sandwich
how about you are you an exercise fanatic
since t i has instituted that walkabout
i have gone out and started walking even more bought me the proper shoes and everything to get started
and park way out there in the boondocks
when we came back they said oh there's a parking space real close and i parked way out in the boonies
i said you can walk off your lunch
it's just a chore
i finally decided one semester i'm in college and i'm taking night classes and i still don't have any of my p e classes
one semester i thought okay that's what i'm going to do
that will get me where i'll have to do it
they were offering a walking class
where you have to walk like for every mile you walk and every so many minutes you get points
you have to go in once a week and log your points
it's not you can do the class anytime you want
at the end of the semester you go back in and your final exam is a three mile walk
if you walk it in this many minutes you get an a
i thought this will be an easy class
i did it for a long time
about the middle of the semester i ended up having to have surgery on my foot
this has been a couple of years ago
i did that
i just ended up having to drop the class
by the time the final came around i wasn't even where i could wear a shoe yet
let alone walk three miles
that was the only time i have ever been able to start an exercise program and really stick to it
because then i had to go every week and log in what i had walked
my teacher looked at it every week
other than that i kind of get in the mood every once in awhile say
okay i'm going to start going to aerobics now
i'll go for two weeks and go this is for the birds
i have noticed too that when i started not the exercise but the walking program that i did tone up like all over
it didn't get the upper part of my body
what i do is i bowl
i used to bowl five times a week
i really loved it
i still bowl at least once a week now on a league on a
i'm bowling on the t i league
i've noticed that what i do is that i have my towel that sits on the floor so that every time i get up to bowl i have to bend over to pick up my towel
that way i get the little extra exercise
i'm always explaining to people i do little things like that like take the stairs instead of the elevator
i do silly things like that versus a regular program that you would have
i was on nutri systems for a while
that is one of the things that they really stressed doing
park at the other end
they stressed things like that too
when you're sitting watching t v at night
None
you'd be surprised at how much just that little bit adds up
just gives you a little more activity
i really did years ago
i was thinking about that not too long ago that i used to walk
i used to watch all those exercise programs on t v
i would tape them
then i would do them two times a day
i don't do any of that kind of stuff anymore
i can't use that as an excuse because i didn't do it before
i'm more into sitting than i am
i have found that with
i have found really though i'm kind of the opposite i'm more active now with him than i was before
because now he'll i want to go outside and i'll go outside with him
we'll walk up and down the street
we'll go to the park
i'll run around with him and stuff like that
i'm getting more exercise that way than i ever did before i had him
None
i think that has helped a little bit
just chasing him around the house
oh yeah
that's enough
mine are older now doing their own things
lucky you
same thing the terrible twos repeat at about thirteen
it absolutely does
i just know you can't
at least since t i has implemented that program i do
that i'm need to do this that and the other
i try to do combinations of things but not like go down to the president's health club like i see all these people do
that walkabout's a good program
it really is
when they first started it i got all the information of course
just like everything else i was real gung ho with a friend of mine
we did do it for a long time
i started school
two nights a week i was going to school
the other two nights a week my husband worked
i had to pick ryan up
there's always an excuse
it gets worse
i'm sure
that's where i actually get my exercise
it was nice talking to you
it was really good to talk to you
do you fish
we go there for the small lake just outside of the dallas fort worth area
we go and we fish
we catch a bunch of junk
it's fun
from a boat or from shore
that's nice
mostly catfish
mostly we catch carp
we go ahead and eat those
we've never caught enough to really have what you'd call a fish fry
what we normally do is just go ahead and clean it up and then put it in a bag and freeze it
somebody takes it home and eats it then when there's just a couple people instead of a whole crowd
there's a pretty good crowd there
we don't ever catch enough to eat
i've caught up to about an eight pound carp on a little pole with twenty pound test line
that's a pretty good fight
that's a lot of fun
that sounds like fun
fish in colorado different than that
in the rivers and stuff
very much there
you mean size wise they're not very big
by and large no
they're big fun
i've been
is that mostly fly fishing when you're doing that
are you using a bobber
i'm a fly fisherman
i cast a ways
it's fun
let me explain fly fishing to you then
what you do is you strip off four five six little rolls coils of line into your hand
you whip the line
you're fishing downstream so it will carry some
you fish upstream
you let it carry it downstream
you reel it in
you do it again
you hope that they think it's a bug and eat it
from what i'm seeing and hearing and all the big pattern that's really looking forward for spring is the grub pattern
it looks like a grub
it's a lure
whenever you
whenever you have something that looks like something else it's a fly you call it a pattern
None
you're going to make one for yourself
are you going to buy it
i've got some
it's just that that just happens to be what the fish like this year
bait tends to work the best just some blood bait
i'm from west texas
are you
i'm from midland
another west texan
you've been out to buffalo gap fishing
i've been up there
it's kind of nice way to get away from everything for the day
there you fish mornings and evenings
in the summer
both times it was really pleasant
in fact it snowed on us in when was that
it was just before july fourth
it was twenty-eight twenty-nine degrees
here it went and it froze
it snowed on us
fishing is not just dragging fish out of the water
it's a total experience getting out in nature and
i probably ought to
it must be a little bit cold
None
do you have any
i always intend to just stand on the bank and just kind of slip it
i see
you know how it is
you get a little more carried away with it
you move a little closer
you're in to it just a little bit
you splash in
got a stepdaughter
at times she enjoys it at times not
the little one of course could care less
the three and a half year old has just gotten to the point
his big thing last year was throwing it in the water and reeling it up
we were at a friend's stock pond we were out at their farm
they had been fishing and let him use the pole while we all walked off a healthy hundred yards or so and let him fish
he started trying to cast it
he was kind of getting there
he's at a dangerous point right now
last year we had just a wonderful trip up to travers lake
it was cold and rain the whole time
we still had a good time out
that's good
colorado is a beautiful place to live
i don't know all of our family is here
you've got to have
t i is up there
what
we're both
i was military
he's division three
the only thing up here
he's in school
they like to fish
they go fishing up there
that would be neat to
fishing is fun up here
it seems like the success rate here is not as good as on some of the better lakes there
the experience is better up here i think
it seems more relaxing there's
there's something about listening to water run that's relaxing to the soul
if you're just sitting on a nice hot lake
we figured we were up a long way off
it rained that night
we thought wonder how far off we are
we got up the next day
that creek that had been fifty or sixty feet from our site of our tent was now about three feet away
it's like maybe we ought to move just a touch
that was kind of funny
it is interesting to watch that water rise all of a sudden
we have gotten out on trips before and just stopped and watched it because there was so much
if you were there
i guess it was late may
it was really your spring almost
even though it was really summer down here
i guess the creek the mountains were really starting to melt
the creek was just wild just running
all the white water and noise the
it gets foamy almost
it's just pure and pristine
they're older now
i found it very difficult to find good child care when i was looking for a place to for stay while i thought school
i wanted when they were babies till they were about two years old i preferred that they had an individual take care of them in a home
that's what i looked for
i was lucky enough to find one right across from my school
that worked
that's good
when they got older i wanted them to be in a school type situation i think they were both three when they started where they could learn to interact with kids and be around kids their own age because i think that would prepare them for school also it's real important
that they do that that they get that preparation for school
i had
i have switched schools several times because i really didn't care for what was going on at that the school
you mean you switched schools for the kids
for the kids
i'm just recently married
i don't have any children
i think that that's probably one of the biggest difficulties
i think i'm lucky though that my wife
that's also
it's nice for me because
so that if my wife does go back to work part time
that's wonderful
it will probably workout real nice for us
i can even teach on saturdays and things
i do know that my brother and his wife have a terrible time finding child care
one of the things they made in
they're number one priority was that they're children didn't have to leave their home
they
my sister-in-law is a clinical speech pathologist
she is als-
i guess her most recent position after she returned back to work she applied for a director's position and got it
i guess she's very well qualified for her field i guess
even though she took off two years for
i guess she took off three years all together
my nephew is almost two
i guess she took off three all together
when she decided to go back to work she was able to find good position and pay for somebody to come into their home
that's wonderful
i think they've lost this woman she will not continue
she won't do it in the summer because her kids are home from school
that's an ideal situation
not many people can afford
i think they they were both professionals unlike me they were married my brother's five years younger then she is
she was probably twenty-seven when they were married
she already had gotten bachelors and masters and established herself
where he then they waited a couple years
he got himself pretty far along i guess they didn't have kids until he was about twenty-six
by that time she was so well established
i think the longer you wait the easier it is
i do to
if you have that professional occupation where you can change
they're are just so many people out there that aren't that
that's true
i'm a single parent
i my ex-husband and i got a divorce when the children were small
i was a teacher
i still am teacher
it was really difficult to find affordable child care that was what i wanted
have piece of mind when i taught school
i knew my kids were being taken
i wanted them to get something out of it
that's so important i guess it's so funny now with schools they don't take kid into kindergarten i guess when they're five
sometimes they flunk kindergarten now
i think that's so funny because
i hope to read with my kids
i don't know if i want my kids to go to school at four
i can see that when you make that point
the thing is
i teach this grade and i can see very readily the kids that didn't never learn socially how to get along with other
they're the ones that are having problems not only getting along with the other kids but academically
because there's to many things in their way
i want my
they did learn to get along with other people
i feel a lot of maladjusted adults
i bet if we trace back to their
early childhood we could see some times they didn't get to play or be with other kids their own age really learn how do get along with
i think that's important
i've seen the same thing
i think you're exactly right because i've gone ou-
None
i bet
they could be traced back to just being moved between day care centers when she was one and two and three years old
and always being a bit snippy and spiteful
because kids have to learn how to get along with other people
if they don't they just don't turn out to be really good adults or
None
it is a big problem
i have lot of friends right now that have young children
they daily have problems with whoever is taking care of the child
they switch a lot which is not good for the child either
you need
it would be ideal like you hope when you have children
i would have given anything if i would have been able
i think i'm very lucky
of having flexible higher education provides a flexible schedule
it's one of things where i'm paid a little bit better then a history or an english professor
i'm also
you can take you can teach two three hours classes on a saturday
that whole week's worth of courses
that lets you be available three days during the week
you be will home with your kids
it's really funny that
because my dad had very nine to five type job
with forty-five minute commute into the city and a forty-five commute home
by the time he got home he was so tired
he was all rung out from the day
i think he missed a lot of our up bringing
my mother
i came from a family that my mother stayed home until we started school
i don't
don't they though that's what i have right now
it is
my goodness if you want them to be able to drive the car the insurance bill
they
right now i'm looking for a little truck for my for my son
that an older
i just look forward to him helping me out because i for years just car
it will be nice just to be able to have him say will you go to the store will you take his sister somewhere
just to save you trips to and from
ball games and athletic events
isn't that something how you think about child care
it lasts along time a long
when you get through with your own you've got grandchildren
you think we've talked a long enough time
normally they come in
they come in this is the first time i've done this
they'll come in in ten minutes normally and stop us
in ten minutes you have to talk that long
you don't have to
they
you go the length
sometimes if it's a very busy time period you'll go about seven minutes
i'm from plano texas which is outside of dallas
most of most of the people i talk to are from texas
that's where t i is
i've discussed
i guess it's
since living in dallas it's always so hot in the summertime i just wear lots of shorts because i don't work during the day
do you work
i work at a manufacturing plant
i wear a lot of blue jeans
occasionally i have to get dressed up and wear panty hose and a dress
i feel really uncomfortable doing that
in the plant it's a problem for me
normally i just wear blue jeans and a t-shirt
buying suits and stuff because just being at home
i work at home
i just wear my shorts and stuff like that
i don't go out and spend lots of money on different suits and stuff
when i
before i got married i was working
None
i have all these suits and blouses and skirts and mix and match and that kind of stuff
now that i work in the manufacturing plant then it's just so much more difficult for me to actually get dressed up to come in to work like that
occasionally i have to because part of my job is teaching
you have to look just a little bit nicer than your normal
i'm like you too i moved from ohio down to here i had mostly polyesters and
of course you have to iron them all the time
i came from wyoming
i had wool suits and wool skirts
i've got all these clothes that i never wear
the seasons are just so much different
when i finally get a chance to go out with my husband it's like a real chore to find something nice to wear
i know i was just now putting away a lot of my winter clothes
i was going through here
i was thinking i haven't worn this in three years
it's a wool skirt
there's just not that many opportunities to wear it
i have five or six wool skirts
i was thinking maybe i need to think about getting rid of them
it's real hard to get rid of some of that stuff i know
i know last year this past winter it wasn't that cold
the previous winter we had more cold weather where i was able to actually wear
your double and triple layerings of clothes like you would when you're up north
i just don't spend
right now my clothes come from target
they're all one hundred percent cotton
they're wadded up in a ball
i have my ironing board sitting out all the time
i'm so glad to meet somebody that their iron board is their permanent fixture in their house
i have very little furniture
my ironing board is part of my decor
i've been looking at these in home depot where you can go and they've got ironing boards that will just flip right down off of the door
you can actually have one where you can put it inside of a wall to have it
that's what i'm thinking i'm going to have to do because
it's just an eyesore i think
it's like i just don't want to do it
and running a line in there for my iron so i could do it in there
i wouldn't have to have that eyesore
i have a big closet
i
if i know i'm having somebody come over to the house there's a possibility they might be going back into my room
i iron our clothes as we go along
None
i'm like you
the night before or that day i will iron whatever it is that we need
that's it
it's too many
with my kids they're always getting into
change their minds i know my oldest is only four
she's still changes her mind two or three times
i know i know
they never put anything back
that would be too simple
that's called smart we don't do that kind of stuff
it's been good talking to you to hear somebody that does the same thing i do because i tell people what i do
they just go how do you do that
it's like it's easy you just do it
that's right you do
i know several of my girlfriends though we all keep our ironing boards out and just an ever present thing in our household
i don't think i'd know what to do if it wasn't there
it was nice talking with you
it was nice talking with you too
it's kind of hard to put my finger on a favorite t v program
one that i've been watching for a number of years is dallas
how funny
i've i've kind of enjoyed watching over the years
i was greatly disappointed when i did move down to plano to find out that the great south fork ranch was really only a one bedroom house
i think i've seen it in the distance
i have not even seen it
i have not seen the program
i know when we went to london it was really funny
people recognized dallas texas by the cowboys and by that program
that's the two things they associate with dallas texas
they asked me
several times they ask me why are there two bridges
i didn't know what they were talking about
they ask me why are there two bridges going into dallas
i was blank looking
it's it's
when you look at the route seventy-five coming down there it's actually a bridge
it's a bridge over top of roadway
there's no water there
there's water in the trinity
i thought it was going to oak cliff over the trinity
there
do they
that's why
i see
it kind of confuses people
i enjoy a lot of different comedies
i think it's mainly for an escape my job is not the most thrilling in the world
i enjoy laughing and some of the shows that are on the air some are just purely brain drainers
there's other ones that deal with in a funny manner socially relevant things
one show that comes to mind is designing women
usually i can handle both at the same time
that's one of the few that i just actually watch
it's funny
it has been very entertaining
also the issues they deal with really tends to open your eyes as well as your mind to some of the problems
i've really enjoyed that one since it came on
i don't like the politics surrounding the program though
other than that there seems to be a little in fighting going on between the producers and one of the actresses
i've kind of gotten hooked on p b s stuff public t v
i like things like nova and some of the special programs they come up with on nature and stuff
the ones that sometimes will hook me to put down my book will be the one there was one recently about the gettysburg address
they wrapped a fictional story around it
i thought that was well done
it it caught my attention
i guess the awards ceremonies and there seems to be dozens of them per year
they could take that whole collection
it would disappear
i'd never miss it for a minute
i particularly take issue with those
i really dislike those
i'm one of those rare guys who i rarely ever sit down and watch a whole sporting event if ever watch one
there's just not that much i'm interested in
for a while i watched some football
i've just got too many more important things in my life now than to sit around and watch a baseball game
my husband used to just be riveted to the dallas cowboys
now we're out running around
if they're playing he'll turn it on while we're in the car to see what the score is
he'll listen
even i've said you're fascinated with this you sit and listen to the cowboys
i'll do some things
i'll come back
you don't have to miss he'll say na na na
he doesn't he doesn't watch it
he just doesn't watch them on t v like he used to
i think it was great when they were world champs and they were doing real well
i
i came from the washington area
i was a big washington redskins fan
those people
when i came down to dallas i found myself rooting for the home team
how neat
in fact i have a baseball hat that was signed by tony dorsett and hershel walker the only year they played together on the dallas cowboys
i actually got to go see them win in the super bowl when they went down to new orleans
i make the trip and did the whole new orleans before the game and everything
that was a lot of fun
i don't know i haven't been as
what is a lot of fun to go attend is this arena football
it doesn't
the field is half the size there's no
i'll have to try to catch that sometime
again i think it may be on cable more than anything else
i couldn't rationalize paying
if i didn't use cable for anything else other than the basic i can get that for free
i really don't need c n n i see enough bad news all the time
i've kind of rationalized that it's probably a lot more economical for us to just go rent the movies we want to see
of course when we were living in texas it was real convenient with tom thumb
having movies back then it was ninety-nine cents
go
you can see them a lot sooner than you can see them on any of the stations like h b o or cinemax
i like to rent tapes because you can put the thing on hold if you get a telephone call or something like that
it becomes snack time for various reasons
you can put
i understand that you'll lose fifty percent of it if you don't
i've been trying to get my wife to go with me to go see it
she doesn't like going to movie theaters because usually they're dirty
she just doesn't like them
she doesn't think that she could sit still for three hours and watch the movie
i've told her everybody i know that has seen it has said that the three hours go really quick
i'm hoping i can get her talked into it soon
my husband smokes
you can't smoke in movie theaters
that has really slowed down the forward progress of going to movies
i haven't really cared up until this point
as far as regular t v shows i've got some shows that i would be afraid to admit to you that i've actually sat down and watched
there's others that i wish i had time to see
i just don't have time to watch it
i think about the only night that i really sit in front of the t v set all night long probably is on monday night
i work so hard over the weekend doing other things with the kids and stuff and going to work on monday
i kind of use it as the time to catch up on correspondence and look over things
i can sit in front of the t v set and look at go through my mail and watch t v at the same time
i tend
i'm in facilities and happen to have weekend duty here
we pull mostly evenings
there's three of us facilities' managers are covering the off shifts just to have somebody here from management to see if they need anything
i'm getting close to twenty
hopefully you have a lot to talk about in this one
i don't really have a lot in this one
i got a good one
when the phone rings and you've got a recording and this always happens around five or six o'clock
it won't go away
any of the type of solicitation where they call all the time
we must get in the neighborhood of anywhere from three to six calls about that time of night
more people call that's where you want to jerk the phone out of the wall your sitting down to eat and the phone rings
the worst one i guess is like you when it's a recording i don't mind so much someone calls
it's a salesperson at least you can chat or whatever and say okay now we want to go
None
and expect you to talk to a computer that's where i draw the lin- i just hang up immediately
shut my other radio off here
that's real irritating to me
i guess they get their name-
i'm amazed the question about that the
i have one too
they say that they can tie up your answering machine and just have a big long if they catch your answering machine
they can erase all your others because if you have
i think that's the way it is mine i guess if it's full it will not take it i'm not sure
they can certainly block your answering machine so someone else calls you and your answering machine is full
your right you're
that's a high irritant for me
it doesn't matter if you have an unlisted number or not because a lot of times these computer things will just make up numbers at random and just call them
it really doesn't make much difference as to whether or not you have a unlisted number or not
they pass around cards that have everybody's name on it
then you'll start getting a bunch of stuff in and a bunch of stuff because they sell their customer list
they sell their catalog list of people
it's annoyance for me in the office with speaker phones
i
this one guy next to me who's not here just so i could talk about him
it carries over
not only would you hear
it seems to me that you you kind of yell into it
he yells into it
you hear the other person too
it's kind of a double annoyance
he actually ruins my privacy you might say because the the t i offices are so open anyway
that i'm amazed that the fact that i'm about ready to say something if he's even thought of that that's a real uncourteous thing an invasion of everyone else's time and concentration to just be loud
i don't know whether that's an invasion of privacy just being loud and annoying
i think it is
have you heard that i'm trying to think of what company it was there was a company that was going to be giving out information about your financial status
that's a good one too yeah
go ahead
i work in the computer science center
we hear a lot about things that computers are capable of doing
this was a software program that a company was developing that was going to have x amount of million peoples financial history and information on it
they were going to sell it to companies who would up in turn solicit you for business et cetera et cetera
they finally stopped production of it because of all the hullabaloo it caused
i wouldn't have been too thrilled about it either
there was a lot of stuff going on about it
i heard something similar to that
i'm a talk show person
there was
when i do my chores up at the rad-
i listened to was it five seventy which has continuous talk on the weekends
and neil sperry and everybody the lawyers and veterinarians and all that
i don't know if it was a lawyer or whatever it was talking about when you make out a financial application all that information on there is really not necessarily
even your social security number
if your just making out a credit card application you don't need to put down
i was curious as to what specific things you did have to put down
he says social security you don't need to put that down there which i thought was surprising
maybe there's something along that same line where in all these financial applications that you make out you don't have to put all that stuff down there
it would be nice to know what was
course they could say i can't give you a card
you could say fine
some things will be private
he said just put n a
he said usually you'll get approved anyway because they just want your money
if you don't feel like putting it down just put n a
that's real interesting
on several things and your credit ap all they ever need you to do is give them permission to pull a credit thing on yourself
there it is
i don't have any friends down at the austin plant
i heard that they were really upset about the drug thing
we seem to up here have just breezed through that
apparently some other companies are having trouble
i don't have any trouble with it
it's kind of unusual here we are in dallas the biggest location and it just breezed through
no one was i guess really too concerned about it yet in austin there were whether it was a class action or how far it got i don't really know because t i only had a few things on t i news i think about it
some people object to that which i don't mind no problem at all
i know that there's several people i've talked to that really have a problem with it
you get kind of used to going through stuff like that
you don't pay any attention to it
i know
i served my time too
i think the people who have been down that route or have had to deal with anything like that have learned it's just one of those things
i do know that there are several sites
i think johnson city was one
did they object too
there's several of the cities that have been having real trouble with the issue
but also on things that i'd heard too from a stockholders meeting was that there were the same places where they had a real bad problem with people fighting it were also places they had a big bad problem with the drug usage too
i'm all for it
it doesn't bother me that whether they do it in high schools or carry it to wherever you want to carry it really
of course that would really be a big thing in a public school
i'm saying certainly at work i have no problem with it
i think it is they found that it's been very low really
i don't really know if they need to publish that really
i don't think it's a necessary thing to publish it they just need to deal with it and on an individual basis
i think that was actually a good thing that happened i never considered it i guess it's an invasion of your privacy
it's something that is for the good of so many people to
have everyone take the test right away
hopefully maybe some people will convince other people that are on drugs that i might as well get off if i want to stay so
i think it's a safety factor too because when people are inebriated whether it's alcohol or drugs or whatever they are very unsafe for their co-workers
it's like my father was a fireman
i can just imagine if
you've got somebody that's supposed to take care of you
they fall out because of the drug issue
you can forgive somebody because all of a sudden they maybe get hurt or whatever that you can understand
the use of drugs or anything like that
will be a problem
this is a tough one i really haven't thought about any of this
i could
i'd probably buy another this is the first american vehicle i've owned
i would probably purchase another one i would be more selective in the dealership that i purchased it from
as far as the quality seems to be there it's quiet it handles well
i believe i'd get that or a porsche one of the two
if i had the money i think i would love to own a a b m w
why would that be
i don't know they're not as nice looking
everyone i've seen is kind of plain
what city are you calling from
that's a
if i had the money that's just
i don't know i like
my actual favorite cars were like the ford thunderbirds of nineteen eighty-five
i don't own one of those either
mercury topaz
cheap taste in cars okay
there nothing wrong with those
i've never had any problem with it
they're nice vehicles nothing wrong with those
it's just everybody has their own taste
the mercedes are expensive
it's nice it's okay
i roped on volvos then
i roped on volvos then
i kind of wish we would have maybe gone for the g l rather than the d l
because it is the safest car on the road
is it
i don't much about them i guess
it's the safest four door if you have a family which we do
we just
it's
i presently
i'm a tall guy
they're hard to get around in traffic to see
you can't see a car ahead of you
they're fast as lightning and all that crap
the explorer you're sitting up on top of everything
you can really see real well
i just
None
i like anything besides japanese
european i don't have any
american cars a lot of people say they don't last long
i've never had any problem with my mercury
my husband has a cougar
he's never had any problem with it either
it was
i don't know i think european cars are great course you've got to have metric wrenches and stuff
they're eas-
some of them are easy to work on
excellent warranty just unbelievable warranty
of course ford isn't too bad
all of it has to do in my opinion with the service
i've written a letter to middlekauff
i've told them that matter of fact i got another letter last night from the quality ford division their still concerned about my attitude
it will never change about that place
anyway that's my own personal comment i guess
they had a problem with they took their camaro in to get it traded and they hadn't signed any papers
they had all ready taken it in to paint it and everything
everything was stolen out of it
the people wouldn't reimburse them for anything
she'd come out like a champ on that one
i've heard some stuff about them
have you been using
i was asking you some questions about the telephone and how many have you been doing
they don't want to hear that
just about a week
i've
i'm twenty some phone calls
that's why i wasn't sure if this was the second time around or what
keep smiling
i'm talking to you from dallas
north dallas
we're in the
then you've been getting quite a bit of rain also
i don't know i haven't lived here we lived out of state in wisconsin
we just c-
when we first lived here we were in garland east richardson
and doesn't seem like it was quite as humid
i don't know then we lived in madison wisconsin for five years for my husband's graduate schooling
it just
it's a lot colder too
what brought you guys down to texas then
his job he came back to start work again for a different company
i don't ever remember of course you only remember the good stuff
i just don't remember the humidity
i'm sure the winters are more mild here
though it was a lot rainier here in the winter we came back last august
it's just a lot rainier than i remember it all through the seasons
i think it's because it's just getting more crowded and more polluted
in wisconsin and minnesota when they get winters the winters are bad but not what you hear about
it's just like down here when people here think it's a hundred and six people up north think it's a hundred and sixty down here
when it's only ninety-five
it's just like up there when you hear it's forty below it's probably really only five below
it's so dry that it's like going to ar-
probably what arizona used to be like
it's not what you think it is
you could talk about that's a strange state for
sure i'm very familiar
there you go okay
i'm quite familiar with how it is up there
if you
kind of interesting the people down here typically don't think it gets above fifty degrees
it's always snow
the summers up there we thought were the most beautiful time of the year
in terms of colorado i know my husband likes to camp and backpack and all the stuff i don't like
i did a lot of business in denver
that's probably one of the stranger things when you see the air inversions
it's snowy
it just was a very mixed bag in terms of colorado
my parents just live thirty miles south of denver
it can be sunny and no problem in denver
they'll be having snow
it's pretty amazing it can be that drastic in just a short distance
things like torn-
it's getting to be more and more of a possibility
it used to be no problem just because it was such a rugged terrain and with trees everywhere
even
i can tell you that they've even had
that's just a part of the country that it's rolling hillside
that was unheard of twenty years ago
i don't know what's happening if it's we are the greenhouse i don't really know
it's just
it's definitely not as
i guess one thing we do miss is that's a smaller town
it was
it just seemed a little bit more pleasant in terms of the atmosphere
it's been good talking to you
i have two children
i do not have a whole lot of spare time right now
one of the things that i have made time for is playing softball
i enjoy all kind of sports
i do not get to do that too often
i really enjoy sewing
i do not get much of a chance to just really sit down and do much sewing
i like sports type things too
we like the water sports too
like you unless you have a pool in your backyard it is kind of hard to get to do that very often
part time
part of my big hobby has been
i have not done that in years
i have kind of enjoyed that
that is
i guess i kind of consider shopping a hobby
i just go out just to enjoy it and not really spend money sometimes
since i have had kids it is kind of funny i never really was much of a garage sale shopper until i had kids
you will probably find after your children get bigger like when they want things like tricycles toys things that cost quite a lot in the store you can find that kind of stuff at garage sales for just a few dollars
we bought some baby clothes last weekend at a garage sale
you can just get all kinds of things and kids especially clothes and toys they just do not use them and wear them for that many years or anything
i am
it is fun
on the weekends i drive around look to see who is selling what
i found my little daughter some tap shoes for her tap class
and just all kinds of things like that that you would probably pay thirty dollars for
i got them for two dollars
it is kind of a hobby that is time consuming too really to find the things that you want sometimes you have to stop
it does take more time
i do not work
that is something i have decided i am going to make sure my kids have a happy growing up years
that is good
i guess hopefully i will have more time for hobbies
at first when you first have a baby seems to take every moment of your time partly because you are not used to juggling your time around like that
eventually you will be doing lots of stuff
i think my husband is real into sports too
by the time he plays two games a week and i play a game a week we go to lots of softball
the kids enjoy going because there's usually a lot of other kids for them to play with
and that is getting outside and doing things they like to do too
that is good
one other thing we are doing this year is we bought wet and wild passes
the kids are always wanting to play in the water
like you said unless you have a pool in your backyard or access to a good place to play it is kind of hard
they have real good kiddie areas at both of the wet and wild's around here
we are planning on going two or three times a week
my oldest daughter is in school
she gets bored real fast when she is home with nothing to do
i think that will be a lot of fun
we are looking forward to that
do you consider yard work a hobby at all
is that just a chore
my husband and i both i think consider it a chore
we have had to start all over trying to plant grass
it has become a chore
we like it once in a while but not as often as we have to do it
i like to put flowers out and
as far as mowing every week and finding time to get all that stuff done
that is how sewing
i wish i had more time to do it
sometimes i will get started on a project and then finishing it is more of a chore than
i like especially
i like to cook for other people
i have a friend that is pregnant
she can't get up and walk around right now
i enjoy cooking things to take over to her house
that is nice
it is fun for me to do that
it is something i enjoy doing
it is kind of like when you are a kid and someone else's house was fun to clean
you did not want to do your own
it is not fun
i think i will like it better
when you are home it makes a difference
do you guys go camping or anything like that
that is something that we are planning to do not this weekend but the next
they invited the kids and my husband and me to go with them
they have been a couple of times and just getting to be outside all the time and sleep in a tent that is really fun to them
that sounds nice
i think that would be a good family thing to start doing more often
my husband loves to fish
my daughter thinks she wants to learn how to fish
i think it will be real good for them
if you can find some place where those little sunfish are right around the shore where they can just pull in a line
they have so much fun doing that
they think they are really great fishermen because they are catching so many
i know
she is really looking forward
that is another thing though when sometimes your hobbies can interfere with each other
my husband is afraid he is going to have a softball tournament that weekend
i am saying no no
you have to decide what you enjoy the most
not really right now
i keep thinking when the kids get bigger and i have a little more time i would love to cross-stitch
i have never done any
i do not think it is as hard as knitting or crochet or something like that
i crocheted when i was younger
i can't even remember how i did it now
i started to knit a sweater
i got off on my rows somehow
what should have been the back all of a sudden was on the front
i tore it out and threw it down
now i can't remember anything about it
i did the same thing
when i was pregnant with my first daughter i was really bored
i bought one of those latch hook rug kits
i thought i could use this as a gift or something
i did not realize how long it took
i got about two-thirds of it done
i just
it was just like i forgot all about it
every once in a while i will be digging through the closet
i will find that thing
i will think maybe i ought to get the rest of that out and finish it
for a while there latch hook rugs were a real big hobby
people do not do that much any more
it was something easy i could do
it has been real good talking to you
i hope you enjoy your camping trip
thank you
thanks for calling
they keep threatening us that maybe there will be a day that they're going to
they keep trying to say we may need a state income tax
i think that we probably will have to have a state income tax because texans don't approve of such things as lotteries i come here from new york
new york had a state lottery
it really raised a lot of money for the state
although we
in new york we had to pay a state and a city tax
it was really a great relief when i got to texas that i didn't have to pay that city income tax though
makes quite a bit of difference in your income level
other states quite a bi- a chunk out for city and state taxes
you're looking at your yearly salary it makes quite a difference
it sure does make a difference
you do
i work at mainly the expressway site is where i work
i do too
you know too that taxes are less if you live in mesquite
some people will go shopping in mesquite at the malls out there
up to collin county somewhere that you're getting out of the dallas county area because
what do we pay eight and a half percent
something like that for the sales tax
which that really is pretty high
is it less in collin county than it is in dallas county
i think so although i really don't go up there too much i normally just kind of go to richardson square mall or valley view mall just kind of for the convenience
maybe i would consider where i was buying it to try to
save a little bit on that sales tax because on a car that really kind of mounts up
once you could deduct at least some of that off your income tax
you can't do that anymore
it really hit me yesterday i had air conditioning service for my car done
i had a little little coupon special that was twenty-two dollars for air conditioning service where they checked it and recharged it and put one pound of freon in
if you needed another pound of freon they ga-
it was seven dollars and something
with the twenty-two dollars and the seven something it all came out to i ended up paying like thirty-four dollars
i couldn't believe it and the tax really hits you
although i wish overall they'd try the lottery again
i've been here for nine years
okay that's about the same time as me i came down in eighty-two
ohio kind of
basically i went to high school and college in ohio and lived there
i did visit michigan i visited kalamazoo once
that's true i tell you what hit me the first year i was here christmas eve in new york there used to be stores open the department stores wouldn't close
i'd say they closed maybe eight or nine o'clock department stores on christmas eve
there were stores that you could go to like discount stores and stores down in the village and just all over the place where you could go to
you could shop until twelve or one o'clock that night
that was really the only night they were open that late
it was christmas eve
when i came to dallas i thought i was going to do that christmas eve
i couldn't find hardly anything open
were you shocked like i'm stuck i need to buy stuff
an i was i really was stuck
i think target was the one that stayed open later than anybody else
i was able to pick up a few things in there
i was really shocked
another shock i had
few places now seem to do it by the slice
there was other things too i think it's taken us yankee's influence down here
to get them to come to the the correct decade here and century
i couldn't believe that you could have open containers of beer alcohol whatever
if a cop stopped you then you would get arrested or what not
people would just drink openly
talking about alcohol and beer look at the taxes on that
and the taxes on a package of cigarettes
i used to smoke that would have been enough to make me give them up
i gave them up a couple years ago because i had some sinus problems
i don't really know what the
they're like two
i believe they're hitting two dollars a pack now
a little bit more in some places
you end up about paying about twelve dollars for a pack and two dollars of that is taxes
i believe it's a little more than twelve dollars for a carton
i remember we went to oklahoma to this bingo place this choctaw bingo a couple weeks ago
somebody that went with me bought a carton for ten dollars and something
they really thought they were getting a big discount
it's the indians i don't think they pay tax
in oklahoma
i got you
it was a indian it's a bingo hall for the benefit of the indians there
there were just bus loads of people that come from everywhere else to play that bingo because it's the stakes are higher and payoffs are bigger and so forth
how did you do
a dollar
you had fun playing right
i had fun a couple on the bus won some money
one guy won t-
i have had a number of them in my lifetime
i had to replace it with something that the kids could carry
they were
i really wanted that retriever's disposition
the ultimate to tolerant trainable disposition
i called
i asked them these are the ages of the kids what do i get
they all said golden retriever
i said okay
the only thing that they could come up with was a bichon frize which is a
they're calm they're not yuppie they're trainable they're very personable in a different way that a golden retriever is
how old is your retriever
she's about four
we got her from the humane society when she was a puppy
she's a little bit smaller
that's the breed standard for females
what you see shown and bred now as golden retrievers this plus eighty to a hundred pound range
they usually run about sixty to sixty-five
the ones that are shown they are inside that weight allowance
you cannot show your retriever if it's a hundred plus pounds
don't say she's small
she's got a brown nose instead of black too
we love her anyway
we're expecting a baby this summer
up until then she's been our substitute kid
she was a lot of fun
they are the ultimate dog to have around kids so long as your kid is not scared of a big dog
fortunately it was just like a retriever
i've had a retriever
it was just gorgeous just gorgeous
they both
both the half breed and the pure breed had what i consider the the perfect disposition
you know what scares me about golden retrievers
which is probably where yours came from people that don't know what they're doing and they breed them for a certain characteristic
in the retrievers it happens to be they like them big for somehow big is perceived as the better
when you start doing that you really tamper with all the years of culling litters
you tamper with what the dog innately is
when i bought my last purebred retriever i looked all over because i wanted one that still looked like a retriever the short to the ground stocky golden trainable tractable quiet animal that could hunt and still be in the house
i ended up getting one that came out of a hunting stock because i wanted one that could still perform like a retriever did
i've seen an awful lot of
i'm i really fear for the breed because i love that breed
i really figure right when it becomes really popular that it's
those dogs have been having seizures
i wonder since both of them are having them if it's some kind of breeding problem
they bred it for companionship and disposition and ability to hunt
they selectively culled those litters for many hundreds of years
since it slept in the castle with its master it had to be of a disposition
they would go through all the litters and destroy the puppies if they were anything other than perfect
now that seems like a cruel thing to do
on the other hand they sure created a wonderful breed
a wonderful breed
i had never really had a golden retriever before
all the other
we looked at some of the shepherd mixes and the puppies weren't very social and stuff
we went to a pen of a little bit bigger dogs
all the others were standing there barking and jumping up and down
one dog would stand there wagging her tail and smiling
i tell you
the german shepherd is the classic case of what i'm talking about because in america that's called a rin tin tin phenomena
i-
the third one is a children's dog
there are distinct breeds in europe
now what happened over here was is that people saw the first which would actually have been a skutzhund which is what rin tin tin was
everybody wanted rin tin tin
it was known as a german shepherd here
they created a breed standard the american kennel club did
that said anything that is a skutzhund a tervurien and alsatian any inner breeding of that can be called a german shepherd here
what happened is is that people wanted this shepherd to shepherd and protect
they bred a dog that it's called an animal's critical span which basically translates to how much shit will it take before it bites you
that german shepherd the american german shepherd here was such an unreliable animal that the american seeing eye institute refused to use them
because they would turn on their handlers
even police corps which started finding other breeds to use because this thing known as a german shepherd here its personality and its dependability and its reliability was just terrible
about fifteen years ago the german shepherd club of america decided amongst themselves that they were going to change this
they went back to europe and brought back some good examples of each of the three breeds and bred to a standard what they wanted an american german shepherd to be which is a very heavily now skutzhund and alsatian
it's the alsatian that's the kid's dog
they're just lovely
you'll see
if you ever start looking in papers now and you start seeing these ads for german shepherds they will say on them bred for disposition a k c conforming which means that their advertising that this is no longer an indiscriminate dog
they had to go through and destroy for a while there about seventy-five percent of their puppies that they bred
they were looking for this disposition
nowadays you'll get a dog trainer to recommend a specific breeder handler
i'll start off being controversial
i still feel that it could be a deterrent to crime particularly with the increase of serious crime that's going on now
i think that those crimes which are punishable by the death sentence need to be reevaluated
i think
any crimes against person
i feel there should be more than a slap on the hand
and being sent to prison and being released in two or three years
i would like to see the system revert a lot back to some of the forms of punishment that exist in middle eastern countries
None
i believe that
it's just an example
i think there's someone that's on trial right now here in the dallas area
they were interviewing the the
a personal trial and the reporter was asking a stupid question of the people outside
how do you feel about this
None
how do they feel about it i'm sure that they want it over with
they want the person punished and punished
i think that there should be no way i realize that innocent people could go to what is it lethal injection now
for every innocent person who would be executed hopefully there would be ten guilty
i feel like the cost of someone who's quoting figures made the cost
at thirty thousand dollars
the problem there is they're not keeping the right ones in prison in many cases
this individual was out on the streets
i don't have solutions to the problems
you have these
this would be nice
there's probably thousands of holes in that theory
i think that if you did something for example to an individual and caused them to lose the ability to earn a living i remember a man drove by randomly shot a woman in the head while she was driving
who has been harmed you
i s-
here again anytime anyone goes out with a gun in their hand and crime on their mind the opportunity exists for someone to get killed
now i'm not in favor of gun control to the degree or anything because there are uses for guns which are noncriminal it seems that the criminal element are the ones that are using them aside from domestic disputes husbands shooting wives or vice versa
these individuals if they have a gun with them i think that the sentence should be even longer than if they don't
i don't agree with the length
here again if a matter of expediency
there should be some
i think that automatic appeal ought to take place within a reasonable length of time say six months
there's got to be a time limit
i think if it is appealed one time and the appeal is turned down or the sentence stands then you might be allowed one more appeal if it is
a legitimate appeal
if they're not arguing that the guy or woman committed the crime
they're arguing over were his civil rights violated because someone didn't file the proper paper at the proper time
one of the sad things is that so many of these never actually come to trial because of the process in which the criminals were apprehended
you know the guy is guilty
you may have stood there and seen it
because he wasn't read his rights whenever he was arrested
he goes free
or some mickey mouse type thing
i realize that that is designed to protect the innocent
i just don't think that
i agree
i really believe that our justice system is the best around
it's not perfect
that doesn't mean that you leave it in tact intact
it's a case that we have a legal system which the criminals have found a way to use and a way to benefit them rather than the public itself
that's how we get caught in this sort of a catch twenty-two
you have to continue to protect the innocent you're giving an open door to the guilty
it
that just
i can just get so
it's going to take smarter people than me to solve the problem
i hope
again one of our problems is that our legislature and the state and our national congress the majority of the members thereof are lawyers
if you had to pick a type of music that you like would you be able to
i could pick country music
are you from texas
okay
i'm from chicago
i would probably go with
it's tough i think i would just stick with the classics only because i like music just for music's sake
i'm part of that whole deal
that was a real interesting time
the music sort of made the whole time very rich with sound
i think i'd stick back with my beethoven and my bach and my mozart
it's just
i don't have to worry about what's current and what's not because i haven't been current with music for a long time
same
as far as country music is i've never really listened to it
that's just
there you go
i understand what you're saying
i think if you would listen to it a little you would discover that it has a lot of roots both from the classics and from some of the rock and roll of the era that we both lived through
it's a different perspective on everything too
i know whenever they talk about country music it seems sad to me
it's always about some guy losing some girl and then playing the guitar and singing about it
there's some joy in it also
mostly it just tells a story about life
i must say though i listen to amy grant
let's see name some people that are country that i should listen to
i like groups like the statler brothers
i must admit they're fantastic
None
i guess i have listened in on some of the stuff and not really realized it that i do like some of that
dolly parton
how about the oak ridge boys
i like them too
i guess i've had a smattering
i just picked
i've picked up a little bit along the way that i probably wouldn't have if i'd stayed up north
i think life is just music
you can hear it wherever you want
i've kind of shied away from some of the new stuff because i just don't understand it
maybe twenty years from now they'll look at it as classic rock and roll which i really like
it's just difficult for me to believe that anybody's ever going to make a record of the rap songs of the eighties
if it stands the test of time we'll see
it'll
if it survives then it'll just probably be one or two songs that sort of listen what we listened to
i think of
i get real tickled when i listen to some of these old beatle music the orchestration of it and that it's so popular still
all these rock stations call it classic soft rock
we used to listen to it full blast
it's kind of funny the way we listened to the stuff
i don't know
you got any more
the big key is that i think you've already stated that all music is rooted in the classics
it has grown from there
i have to run i hate to cut
it was great
we'll
i'll look at some country
i have two children and two stepdaughters
are you running ragged these days
mine are all grown
they are
the topic for me
i can only relate now to my grandchildren
good
my daughter and her husband work saturdays
my daughter is doing a schedule of twenty-four hours on the weekend
she gets paid for forty
dave is in supervisory work
he has to work almost every saturday
she's a little one
she's little
is she your oldest child
that's nice
now do your other grandchildren live in the dallas area
being from plano i know so very few people who have extended family in town
just so that they get to know their grandparents but also for help
we don't have that luxury
we have lots of friends
everybody tends to be in the same boat
we trade off a whole lot with friends and run here and run there
we have three playing baseball
that's marvelous
i know that one of the ladies i know they are very involved with their little girl
i think it's excellent because she's getting qualified quality time for her musical talents her sports abilities i think because she is
that hasn't been possible
she's tried many avenues now it's just that she's kind of resolved herself that this is going to be the only one
she devotes
they're focusing on all of her welfare
our kids
my daughter sings with younger generation i don't know if you've ever heard of them
they're part of the plano children's civic chorus
they're going to washington d c next december
how wonderful
we have been really up to our eye balls in fund raising and trying to get
that's wonderful
she plays softball
my son plays baseball
my stepdaughter plays softball
we tend to do a lot of running
they are
things are very different nowadays than when i grew up i'm sure when your children grew up you didn't
we had more i guess family time alone where we did nothing
now i think everything is doing doing doing out of the house
sometimes i kind of long for the good old days when
on the other hand we just love watching the kids play and getting to know the other parents
we've had a lot of fun with that too
you have to look on that on the positive side of that
my second grandson is in a cappella
i know what you're talking about when he's involved the children are involved in that
he's been
they have won awards
i know where you're coming from it's very nice
i think those type of children that are involved in things like that their goals are going to be set higher than the average child that are not participating in things
i think so
i think they've learned a whole lot about being part of a team whether the team is your singing group your band your sports team you all have to pull together
a team effort
i've been real pleased with that too
i think they've learned some real good life skills being involved in all those things
that's wonderful
that's really is nice to have in your background that then you can be very flexible
there's less friction involved in relationships when you add that skill of teamwork
a lot of people that are adults are having to go back and learn those basics when our children are already learning that
i think it's a a giant step of progress i really do
i
that's good that's real good advice
cathy i think if you look to the word of god and think on the things that are pure and lovely
keep your mind off of negative things
keep your mind on positive things
stress that to your children
even if they're discouraged tell them that that's just a passing moment and to dwell on those things that are
when you employ the word of god there's nothing as powerful as the word of god
i would agree with that
my kids do an awful lot with that
you need to return that back
you owe that back to god because he's given you that ability and that talent
that's real nice
that's that's real neat
if she looks at it as you suggest that she can give her talent back to the lord for his glory and she can look at it that way and that's
do you work outside the home
yes i do
let me take the lead angela
i think what is really important
one of the things that she asked us to discuss was benefits
i'm assuming that you are married and have a husband that supports you
we could talk about that path how important you think his benefits are and how important you think they are and what would you like to see increased in his benefits
the benefit of having eyeglasses for the family and how much coverage it provides and also your hospital coverage and probably dental
i think that job wise benefits are just as important as salary is
of course if you did not have them you would be pulling from your salary of course
they always have surprises for you
it is
we could not do without the benefit package from any company that we worked whether they be a conglomerate or just a small
i think even if your insurance policy is not the greatest
you would not be pulling it out of your account all of the time just by yourself
they are getting a handle on that in fact my oldest daughter is a nurse
she just received her masters degree
she is now into consulting
that's one of the areas that she is working on to have a day care center for the children of the nurses that are staffing the facility
that is true in many many areas of job titles and professions
in may case i have three children
it's just unfeasible for me to try to get a job because all the money that i would
it would be just futile
it would be just
they would not have the quality
besides which it would be easier there's a lot of single mothers out there now from divorces and a lot of
i hear
to go to work you are worried about your child besides which you have to get up earlier to take the child to day care
if they were in the same building then you are going to the same place
you could go for your lunch hour down and visit with your child
and take your breaks with your children or something
do you think that you should fund that if they have that as a benefit if you would fund that somewhat from your salary that you are getting
i think if the company could not provide it all on their own
for the people that would be using it
it would still probably be cheaper
with the company than having to go
if everybody pulled their own weight in it
how do you feel about let's see eye care
we
it would be great the glasses that
it depends on who examines your eyes
if you have an optometrist or an ophthalmologist
there's a vast difference in those two
like my mother she has to go for testing cause she has got
she does not have it
she is on the verge of it or
she has to be tested periodically
those are expensive tests
for something like that that's just as bad as a medical
we have needs in our life that are unique to us
people have needs in their life that unique to us to them
we are all different
now i would like to see better
that's it
she's on vacation
with the three children orthopedic care not orthopedic orthodontic care
because on a lot of the dental insurance they do not cover that well
for the orthodontia stuff
and you have to really get them when they are young in order to have not a decent smile when they are fifteen sixteen years old
they started having extractions at age eight because they just had too many teeth for their size mouth
we footed the bill because there was not any such thing when they were young
my middle child needs to have orthodontic because his his pallet is squared not rounded
it affects his speech a little bit not anything
just enough that his bite is off a little bit
it's like four hundred dollars
my insurance is only going to cover fifty of it
i tell you
it's less painful and less expensive
i know
it's easier on the patient in the long run
i would much rather do that
i think that's a big part of it
i think it maybe started because women wanted outside of the home
i almost think with our society and inflation and the cost of things anymore couples have to work outside the home
i think that's a big change
i've worked all the time up until just about a year ago
i just
i love my job
i have four children
that's real hard
that's been a big deciding factor because i never wanted to be a career woman
as long as i was going to work i was going to do as much as i could
i wanted to stay home when i had kids
i have two
we would like two more
it's like we talked i don't want two more unless i can quit and stay home and take care
even i
of course my kids are a little older
then you give up the money
of course everything you give up something
i just
i do think that's one of the major changes
my mama i remember her being home
she made breakfast in the morning for us
if she worked it was part time
it was work that was done while we were maybe at school
she was there when we got home
None
i've decided now in fact i'm substitute teachers aid which is afar cry from my travel agent career
which i loved
i'm there in the same school as my children my two littler ones
i'm home when they are home
i'm just really hesitating
because i enjoyed the first summer home ever
seventeen years with my kids
i didn't have babies or day care working as a travel agent
it was wonderful
i think
of course their ages they are almost seventeen sixteen fourteen eleven and nine
it's such an important time to be home
my husband was raised
his parents were divorced when he was young so his mom always worked
he's like what's the big deal about being home
as our kids are getting older he sees it more
i said russ you don't understand what it was like to have her home or if you needed
mom at school she was there to help
i want to be able to do those things
i think that it's good
sometimes i'll have the cookies ready when they
a lot of my boys my older boys' junior high friends will come over
it's wonderful
we are just
i'm very happy to be staying home
again i miss
where do you see
that was one of the things
what changes do we see
i'm not sure i see it go anywhere
if we want extra clothes the extra car the extra
there is the gas
there is the lunches and then the day care
i pay four hundred fifty to five hundred fifty
my gosh
i would love
you talked about having the summers off
i thought that would be so wonderful
i love the little preschool they are in
i feel good about them being there
it's still not the same
i don't see things changing really
it's terrible for divorced women who are forced to work who maybe don't have a college education
i could get a real good paying job
if i wanted to in fact i still have offers please come back
we'll pay you this
it's been a real tough decision
i'm very happy to be here with my kids
i've been doing a lot of volunteering at the schools and playing lots of tennis
we're working on it
my kids of course will be in school then
i can work part days in my husband's business so that
that would be great
he can afford for us to do that
i think the other thing that has changed for woman because we are working is we are having less children
that's the state that was famous when they
we still have a death penalty
a gentleman that was one of the hi-fi murderers just had his conviction overturned appealed again
i guess we have the longest running inmates for death row too
we had another guy ronald lafferty that thought god told him to kill his sister-in-law
he just got a new trial because
how do you feel about the death penalty
could go either way
it sort of doesn't much
it wasn't a strong issue i guess it still isn't a strong issue
i must say i find it very silly the way politicians are running around
i'm sure that's
by saying
i kind of agree with terrorism
drug dealing
terrorism definitely and selling out your country
it's not enough just to lock them up forever
we've got these guys in new york that i'm sure you heard about the ones that killed the gentleman that came from utah to watch the tennis people
i guess they got convicted the four of murder
i do find it hard to know where to draw a line
if i had to draw a line i'd say just no capital punishment
i don't see that it accomplishes a whole lot
what about the argument where somebody who is committing one capital crime chooses to commit a more serious capital crime
murder because that one at least you might escape from because his victim his witnesses will be gone
doesn't this encourage
you mean violence
doesn't this encourage murder in order to wipe out the the witnesses
maybe it would
i kind of have a problem with our legal system at the moment as it is
i think that people who infringe on other people's rights and screw up their whole lives with rape child molesting terrorism just
i'm for it for certain reasons
i think that things like rape you can't get over it takes a lifetime
if william kennedy smith had been found guilty you believe he should have been executed
None
we have plenty of convicted guys that go into jail and come back out do the same thing and go back
if they're habitual like three times caught for rape or child molesting then snuff them
the problem is that they've just been let out of jail
we don't seem to keep them long enough
they learn such bad things in jail
that's for sure
let's see
the other question that they wanted was whether the place that we live in compares to how we feel
it seems like an unusual subject this time of the year
it's camping
the last time i went camping was about in the middle of october
we went up to lake bonham and really enjoyed it
i haven't been in probably about three years
the last time we went was in i guess it was hunting season
we went down to a hunting ground and a lake lake sam rayburn which is in east texas
let's see
what do you think what kind of camping are you talking about
is camping for you in a motor home or a trailer
do you actually put up a tent
you have
one of the ones that you pull along is it pop-up
i guess we really rough it
we really enjoy that
one thing i've done all sorts of camping
i've camped in the snow on a glacier
i've camped basically almost anywhere even to the point where we've had to backpack in and everything you carried in was what you had to use to sustain you for that camping trip and had to pack it back out
you're a serious camper
we enjoy it yeah
since i've been married and with a family we have to go where there's restrooms
that makes sense
we really enjoy it
also while i was growing up we did have a trailer
i camped in that trailer and in a tent and in log cabins and so forth too
to answer your questions earlier we do enjoy fishing
i do go fishing
we recently moved from the rocky mountain area up in northern utah down to here because of work and haven't been able to enjoy fishing like i used to up there which is clear water fishing and streams and rivers
when you all went camping is that what you normally
we normally
we did a lot of the fishing
mainly what we did was we did a lot of hiking and exploring and just going out and seeing what there was to see in the area
i guess probably just wherever you live at has a lot to do with what you're going to do when you go
you do actually camp
did you ever travel around to what's that the little k o a camps whenever ever done that
although i've stayed in k o a campgrounds we've never done that just to go around and camp
personally when we were growing up and when we were going camping i thought that was a little too structured of a camp ground
that was mainly for people in motor homes or had trailers and so on and so forth where we really wanted to go camping in a tent k o a is geared for the people that have a hookup
i started out basically camping when i was in boy scouts
we did an awful lot of that as a boy scout group
we camped in the snow and in snow caves
None
you got a lot of that in huh
let's see i just like to go
normally i go with a whole group of friends we just kind of go and hang out and just do fun stuff
or take a deck of cards if we can actually see and play cards and stuff
a lot of people i've talked to have said isn't camping boring
don't you get bored and not have anything to do
i've found out that actually we really enjoy getting away from the television the telephone yes
you
kind of makes you appreciate a lot of the things you take for granted
like i mentioned we've been camping a couple of times this year
the last time was in october
we went up to lake bonham
there was a playground for them
they had swings
i'm calling from garland texas
yesterday i talked to someone upstate i'm not even sure where
my husband talked to the people in utah
anyway let me press one
we don't do this too often
most of my family's in california
my husband's is in san antonio
we did this in san antonio
it was an experience that i won't do again
it wasn't that big of a family
it just got out of hand
many people were coming that we were trying to figure out how much food we were going to need and how much beverages we were going to need and this and that
it just grew and grew and grew
when the time came only about half that
it wasn't
overall we all had a good time
it just kept growing and growing and growing and growing
we're going my gosh
you have
if they come from far away they take it more seriously
we're kind of
i have a brother lives in indianapolis a sister lives in chicago and my folks live back in buffalo new york
i guess we have reunions about once a year or so
my wife's family they're all in
they have regular family reunions every summer
those are nice
i'm sure they're a lot more organized too because they've done it before
it's just something that they plan on doing every summer
every year everyone asks when is it happening and where is it happening they just plan on being here
that's great
they had a family reunion for my mother-in-law at her seventy-fifth birthday
they managed to get just about everybody into town last november including a number of people from out in california
it was good it worked out very well
one interesting thing that they did at the time is they videotaped the whole shebang it made a nice remembrance of the entire party
that works pretty well that way
my grandmother in california is
it seems like most of the family is going all the nieces and all the grandchildren and all that are most of them are going
it's too costly for us
anyway they're going to go on a cruise
it sounds really neat it really does
i can go for that
i guess interesting if you had a very extended family that kind of involved a lot of people cousins and things that you don't really know that you've never met it'd be interesting to meet a lot of those people
i don't know how you would go about getting them together
that would be
a friend of mine she plans her family reunion every year
they go camping
she says they have the greatest time
she says usually everybody shows up in exception to maybe one person
she said they all go camping
they have a really good for the whole weekend
i kind of wonder what kind of tradition we're going to establish for our family
i had hoped that our kids get together at least regularly
i guess one of my favorite ones is cheers
i also like the cosby show
i rather enjoy the cosby show
i've watched that one time
it was really good
now that's on what saturday night
around here at least
what system you're getting it through
i really liked it
i just haven't watched it since
we always enjoyed it
it seems to be kind of halfway between something like all in the family and hill street blues
the episode that i watched i liked him because even though he's a law enforcement officer sometimes the laws are kind of ridiculous and you need to sometimes break them to get your point across and for a good reason
he seems to do that sometimes
i think that's what first drew us to him
i like to watch sixty minutes and twenty twenty
i know we watch commish any chance we get
that's kind of th- th-
it's gotten more and more to where they are so totally against anything spiritual
anyway
i used to be a real big fan of star trek
pretty much yeah
star trek's in a s- or the star wars set one of the first star wars movie
i think i watched it like nineteen times
my goodness
i did at one time
used to read a lot of science fiction work too
no
i don't know if you heard them or not i got a twelve year old twelve week old baby
twelve week i was going to say i hear a baby in the background
we're
i know we won't be watching as much as we do now
we're both full time students
that's the best way you haven't found out yet or anything have you
we had a sonogram
we told him not to tell us
it's going to be a surprise
it's like finding out somewhere in july what you're going to get for christmas
None
i'm sure we'll be watching more children oriented television shows
i'm about half kid at heart anyway
i am too
the
a couple of the ones disney's doing aren't too bad
it seems like a lot of them are a lot more violent than they used to be
i remember the flintstones and the jetsons
those were just kind of good old cartoons
the worst of the violence in the flintstones was when somebody gave fred a poke in the snoot
shoot blowing up galaxies and putting a curse on the whole planet or on everything of this species just all kinds of crud
they wonder why kids turn out the way they do nowadays
everything's mutations and killing
what was it t n turner broadcasting network used to do the saturday morning and sunday morning cartoons the old cartoons they used to put between the first and second feature at the theatre
those old little ten minute jobs where the real ballooned looking art work a-
what would be your favorite meal to cook
got kids
my wife and i and we've got a thirteen week old baby
don't do much cooking for him yet
i guess it's supposed to be dinner party is that what they said
what kind of dishes you might have for it or some sort of thing like that
something light and easy
if it was pretty informal about anything
sometimes we'll have a bunch of people over and cook deer
it is good
either that hamburgers we really don't have dinner parties
we just had deer stew sort of it was deer steak stew
some veggies in it
the times i've been out deer hunting i can go out in the woods unarmed and deer will be tripping over me and vice versa
i get close to the woods with anything resembling a weapon
suddenly there isn't a deer within fifty miles
guy was in a hunting club
the whole group goes out hunting
at the end of the day they split it whoever brought it down gets the lion's share
the rest of it is split with the rest with everybody in the group
that's nice
he wou-
they went out last year and almost everybody got it the limit everybody had deer coming out their ears
they gave us some deer
some of it's still in the freezer
we either crock pot deer
we'll put it out on the grill so that the bulk of the tallow will dribble off of it
we usually have most of it made into hamburger meat though
and cook spaghetti with it
anyway no
i think if i was going to have a dinner party i'd probably have sandwiches or something along those lines and then just something light finger food sort of something or
anyway
we don't do much in the way of entertaining
we had a turkey loaf
which kind of taco turkey loaf
scalloped potatoes
mashed potatoes with cheese melted over the top of them
sounds good
don't you hate that
i got a few pounds to lose myself
i left the fourth grade weighing about a hundred pounds and started the seventh grade grade at two
this is a subject that i'm not real well versed on
let's talk about air pollution
where are you from
i'm from the
i have some small experience in this area
the brown haze that you see if you look down central towards downtown a lot of that is tied up with the oxides or nitrogen although some of the kind of bluish gray stuff we see sometimes is tied up with particulates
one of the major problems that dallas has is oxides and nitrogen
that's because of all the equipment that's being operated but at the same time because we don't burn a lot of coal and solid materials we
power plants since
many of our local power plants are natural gas most of the time the things that come off of those plants are carbon dioxide and n o x
we pick up a little bit of sulphur off some of these products
gasoline of course now the lead's out at least theoretically i guess you could say we're picking up some sulphur because a lot of the fuels does have sulphur
that's course hydrogen sulfide which is when you burn gasoline you also produce some water vapor and that goes back in with your sulphur
under the right condition you get h two s
anyway
you are well versed on the subject i tell you
i don't know
ron a lot of this is caused by the fact that cars sitting in traffic tend to run rich because the way the pollution is
when they run rich they spit out a lot of hydrocarbons
that's another part of the problem
hopefully if we ever get our road system fixed up this will get a lot better
i don't know i've lived here since seventy-four howard
i think they been working on the highways around here since i've been here
i think they'll be working on them long after my wife and i are gone
i guess not trying to top you but i grew up in dallas county and i can remember when they built the north part of north central which was built after the south part of central
i can remember coming over the hill down there long about i don't know little bit north of mockingbird on up over those hills
i said i wonder if they'll ever need this road
course it was designed for most of us to go about forty-five miles an hour because the short on ramps and off ramps
seems like those ramps might kill us yet
you get out on the interstate highways versus
traveling from dallas to austin to san antonio it's the same thing as far as the pollution created by the automobiles in the stalled traffic and the busy highways you're at your best
i guess when you're out on the interstate
i tell you what i don't think i really have
i'm going that way tuesday
i'm going to make it a point to
sometimes it depends on which way the winds blowing i also travel a little bit
i don't know it just seems like there's a certain point down there where you can breathe easier
i know
i know going to
okay great
quite honestly with the exception
i do quite a bit of sailing
our subject is on boating and sailing do you great
i own a sailboat that i keep parked up on the scout lot of my scout troop
we take it out
we do some teaching of sailing with the scouts
that's neat
it's hard for me to get it somewhere
the guy that used to live next to us in richardson before we moved twelve years ago or whatever he had a sailboat used to park it right in the driveway
it seemed
i think it held probably
it does have a little kind of cabin thing that you can store things in you couldn't really sleep in there unless you sort of stuck your body out the hole
i understand
it's
they are
we have a swimming pool at our house
i think of all the time now that my kids are gone and away and married and going to college or whatever that i put in there i just could not imagine a boat because i know it's a lot of maintenance
gosh yeah
power boat then there's always stuff to go wrong with it
you still have to worry with the hull and the condition of the sails and spars and rigging everything that's in it
we used to go out with them and back then they had bought an older chris craft
we were involved every weekend in just
their boat slept about four people plus had a little kitchen
i think that was the last time we were really involved
that was twenty years ago or twenty-five years ago
it's a lot of fun i think just from the standpoint of
when you work hard and you're under pressure and everything all week long a boat can be a lot of relaxation especially with a group of friends and cook out or camp out or whatever or a cabin or something depending on how much you like to rough it
it's
our daughter and he had a place on lake of the ozarks
he had a boat
they go boat
they go
they just go across the boat and tie it up and go in huh
that was sort of neat
that's true that's exactly how they do it
that was sort of a neat setup
i'm envious of people that have the big boats
once i get my son into and through with college he's going to be starting rice next year
he's going off
once i get to that stage where i'm not paying for something else and i don't have to worry about a lot of other scheduling things where i've actually got the time to go out and enjoy it i might do something differently
keep it and maybe consider getting a better one for me
the sailing part of it i like because it's so quiet
if you get a big enough one then you've got a little motor on it also where if it's light wind you can still putt around a little bit and have fun
if the wind dies you're not stuck in the
you're just stranded out there trying to pick up what little gusts you can to work your way back in
i know
that gets hot and wearisome
putt putt
if you're a big enough boat to have the little auxiliary motor on there at least you can kind of drop the sails and putt on back in
that's neat
i own an insurance agency a managing general a wholesaler of insurance out in addison
i'm a scout leader though
i'm out with
you have a son
he's thirty-seven
i don't know if he's ever going to have any or not
i do have some neighbor kids lots of little neighbor kids
i go out and i play ball with them
it's because like this one that lives right next door her mother does some work at home on computers it just seems like she doesn't have any time for her which is kind of sad
the kids are kind of hungry for someone to play with them
i will go out and play catch with them or let the dogs outside
they will roll around on the ground and play with the dogs
i do think that the parents should have a little bit more time to spend with their kids
when your son was at home did you working
were you able to stay at home with him
when my son was at home i did work
he went to a baby sitter that this lady had about five other kids that she baby sat we always had our days off together
we went camping on vacations
we had a lot of time together that way
when my mom
she worked nights and as a nurse
she was always home for us i always really appreciated that having her there when i came home from school and when i worked
now when i look back at it it must have been a really difficult
i am sure it was
i don't know what the families are going to come to now days because there just doesn't seem like they do have time for their kids
most of them the father and mother both work
it's really rough
i have one neighbor the father is a fireman
he works four days on
it seems like he is suppose to come home for three or four days
he can't make enough as a fireman to support his family
he's got a second job
he's not home very often
that's
a family without a father it's a really hard thing
yeah
i don't know
i suppose they are trying to get through to them that daddy is not home because he is out working trying to make some money for we can buy you this bike and that toy and so forth
are you planning on having any children
we are
we just got married december
we are going to wait a year
that's good
we will try
that's what my daughter-in-law told me that they were going to have kids probably after two years of marriage
they will be married nine years
i don't know
she's a nurse
she has brothers and sisters that has got lots of little kids
maybe they just decided that if they wanted to have kids around the house they would just call one of their sisters or brothers up and tell them to send the kids over for the night
we really want to have a family
we feel like that couple you are not giving enough of yourself
you should be sharing your family
and giving your values making something better of the world by raising up good kids
give them an edge
we feel like the first year needs to be devoted to making the family the couple strong and secure in their love for each other
then a family is definitely a high priority
do you plan on staying home after you have your children
do you work or what
i am in a different situation
i am a missionary i am home on furlough
it called
i come home for a year
we go back for four years
my husband and i will do the same job
we will be living in africa
we will be working together
we will share the job of raising the family
as a mother i will have certain responsibilities that he might not necessarily have
still we will share that job
we have
then we have decisions that we have to make that are hard about schooling like do you want to home school your kids on a computer program that kind of thing do you send them away to boarding school
if you do that when do you do it
that's a
i consider myself a hacker
i'm into it
i'm not as good as i'd like to be
it's a
i'd started playing when i was in elementary school actually
i'd go up there with friends after school a couple of times every week
None
i'd started picking it up again a couple of years back
i've really been enjoying it
that's kind of the way i did it too
i played just a tiny bit when i was real young
i got on to a team in high school but wasn't very good still
and then quit for awhile
recently i picked it up like you say about a couple of years ago
i've been playing off and on when i can
up in minneapolis it's not too easy to play in the winter of course i actually live in florida
i'll be going back down there in may and hopefully be picking it up a little more regularly
it's a great game
to play a really nice course you've got to have a really big wallet
that's true all too many times
fortunately down where i live in florida there's some golf courses that are pretty reasonable if you know where to look
one of them is the university of florida golf course which is open to the public
that's pretty good
i attend the indiana university
it's the same way here
can you get a student discount type of thing
a little bit but not a whole lot
you'd think you would
what are green fees run there
they range anywhere from about five bucks for your basic city type course up to fifty sixty dollars for a really really nice course
i can play for free there
it's a pretty nice course
that's super
i guess it's free for me
not me
that's the way to do it though
as far as watching golf i can watch it on t v
it's kind of boring
it's nice to see those guys
they have such good style that
once the guy hits the ball and they got to try to follow the ball
i mean it they do a generally okay job
like you said it's kind of boring
i had a chance
they had the p g a tournament up in indianapolis last year i was able to go and see one of the rounds of that
that was really fun
you knew it i never really thought it would be that much fun to go to a big golf tournament and watch
man it was something else just to follow those guys around and actually watch them play
looking at it on t v you're thinking man
that's wild though
you got it's a lot more exciting than actually watching it on t v
if you pick a group of golfers and follow them around it's just watching them the whole time instead of like on t v you get to see them make a tee shot they go off to some other hole
they come back when they're putting
it's really something else
i'm a student right now
you are
which university
at indiana university
i don't really know
it seems like that would be an okay life just to hang out
what was that movie that they had out
i can't remember
it seems like you go to work every weekend play maybe one two tournaments a month you come in about tenth you'd still be doing pretty well
yeah
i guess when i get back i'm going to school in florida
fortunately i've been able to play some golf on a student budget which is
it's unfortunate
i guess it's like two hundred fifty dollar minimum or three hundred dollar minimum just to practice even
those fees to join a club
a million dollars or whatever is just that is out of control
i guess they have those driving ranges that are actually stacked one on top of the other
i played eighteen holes with some japanese guys in gainesville as a matter of fact
it was really wild
they kicked our butt all the way to
do you work with a company that gives drug testing
i'm a student
they do a little bit of drug testing
they do
they do it before you go in
occasionally they'll have a random urinalysis
they will huh
you can't be smoking marijuana in the military anymore
i don't work right now because my company i worked for p i e went bankrupt they was getting a program set up that for all new hires they was going drug give them drug tests
they didn't hire very many new hires because all the people that usually work there just stayed there because they had been there for a long long time
i believe they should too
i don't think anybody needs anybody to be working for them that's on drugs of any kind
i don't know whether i believe that they should just randomly do it
i think they should kind of warn them like we're going to do that or maybe tell them before they do get hired that this is what is going to happen
if you don't like it why then you'll have to go look for a job someplace else
after you
i suppose you are right there too
personally i
i know when i was doing my basic training in a i t there was guys who would fool around
when that urinalysis came around they would be all scared
it does work it is effective
the only problem is if you have done drugs but you've stopped and you do get caught it is kind of harsh
i suppose they fire you and everything right then huh
what do they do with you guys if that you guys get
we get counseling
i think part of our pay is docked if we're first time offenders
i see
i haven't
i don't know
i don't either
i think anybody that does them are dumb
you just watch it on t v and see how it just burns your brain completely up
really dumb huh
what do you think about our other government agencies testing
i think they all should test really
it just seems like there is so much more of it going on anymore that i don't know what's wrong with the people
i think that the government should do something about stopping it completely
they just slap somebody's little hand
don't do that again
i know
they'll get out
they're right back at it again
right now it's too lucrative for the drug dealers
the risks are worth it for them
other than that why i don't know
like i say maybe one of these days i'll get a job because i am looking still for a part-time job since my company went bankrupt
i'll see what they do
like i say i wouldn't care because i don't even smoke
i wonder if you take medicine if that would effect it
that's
sometimes some medicines will give off a false positive
i've heard of that
now that would be really unfair then huh
they should be like if you get a positive they should double check you and still give you the benefit of a doubt
find out if you have been taking some kind of medication and if that would effect it and everything
i guess that's about all we can talk about
it was nice talking to you rose
maybe i'll talk to you again
we keep a monthly budget
we try to stick to it
it's really difficult here all because there's always something breaking
car needs tires or something
we do ours more monthly than long range
we
out of his check they take a savings
out of my check they take savings and retirement out of both checks
as far as extra savings we really don't have that much extra to save
his check once a month
how nice
my check weekly buys groceries and gas and that kind of thing
it works out real well that way
we don't run into a lot of problems budgets are horrible
we pay all of the little bills one paycheck and then the mortgage and the electric bill those big bills the second pay
again he does have a savings that comes out for christmas and stuff that kind of thing
when the car insurance is due and you call the credit union and tell them send me some money
it would be nice if we didn't have to touch the money he has taken out and put in savings
we do
it's nice that it's there
neither one of us has had a raise in a couple of years
of course the cost of living keeps going up so much
i keep saying my check does less and less
it seemed like we spent more
then a lot of it was going to daycare and that kind of thing
it just seems like with me staying home we had that big cut
we save more
i don't know why
we it seems like we do
i know that since i do work i buy a lot of quicker cuts of meat and the frozen things for the microwave and things like that
i'll stop by the deli and pick up chicken or whatever where if i did not work i'm sure that the grocery bill could be managed a lot better
i don't know how it comes out
i'm sure you do
i do not have to pay child care during the winter
my son's old enough that he likes to come home from school
in the summer he's still young enough that i cannot leave him by himself
ours is seventy dollars a week plus all activities that's usually movies one day skating one day
you usually end up paying close to eighty dollars a week
that's a lot of money
if they're going to be in daycare then they need to have some activities other than just being there
the other one's two and a half
they're expensive too just the outgrowing of their clothes
i'm sure the budget
it does add up
medical bill
although the insurance we had was good when thomas was younger a lot of the stuff had to be paid up front
you were reimbursed
it was nice when you'd get a couple of hundred dollar check from the
in the meantime you had to put out the money first
that's hard
i'm enjoying my stay home for the little time that i can
i would too
i would advise anyone that could possibly do it to
that's what's so sad
you probably wouldn't want to do it forever
i'm perfectly happy
let's see
i haven't got mine yet because my parents are getting all that stuff at home in the bay area
i'm not sure how much i'm getting back
i'm pretty sure i should get back a little bit since student
as far as writing checks out and paying taxes i think it's pretty high
i i'm
i guess it's where we have to be
it's one of those necessities of life that we all have to pay taxes although it is kind of a pain sometimes though
that's scary too
it's not anything like the way it was when i was young and small and a child
that's a scary part too that you have to think about
as time goes on things get more expensive
because we were increasingly complex society that day by day things get more expensive as well as more complex
None
everything from medicare to social security to feeding the homeless to maintaining prisons to maintaining polices or fire departments and things like that
it's becoming a larger
that's us
you find out about all these things about is your money going to where you want it to go
there's going to a special this week
i can't if it's twenty twenty
i think it's one of the local news
that's kind of scary too
that would be interesting to see
even today it's the amount of taxes that we're paying for
you'd think that we're still in that
this deficit state that
makes you wonder when there's countries out there that have tax rates of close to fifty percent or higher
it's like fifty percent of everything you make is already gone before you even get it
that's kind of a scary thought
on the other hand while those countries that have high taxes also have things like
everyone has the access
it's good
it's the price they pay
you sure do know a lot
just keeping up with the times that's all
as it turns out it's one of those interests i kind of like to keep up on
it's nice to know that when i do start working that i like to know where my tax dollars are going too
work hard to get
what do you think about these items that are going to be taxed even more like tobacco and that kind of thing
i think in a way it's good in a way it's not
i think in general
a lot of things like tobacco and alcohol and things like that in the past have been not taxed because there's been such a large lobby against the taxes for them sponsored by the alcohol and tobacco companies
things like tobacco they're a proven health hazard to smokers as well as nonsmokers
as far as the safety thing in san luis obispo for example there's an ordinance which states that there's no smoking in any public areas
if you walk into any restaurant or any hotel there's no smoking allowed anywhere
i just currently quit my job
i think one of the my
the second thing is because we have children
it would be
right now we have probably some excellent benefits right now
i don't know if you're familiar with them
we're real happy with them
i've had a variety of different jobs with various types in the computer field
i've seen a variety of types of benefits
i've worked for awhile
they are a really academic type of place
i've worked with regular industry type places and then with others that are kind of half way between and stuff
i've seen a wide range of both nonsalary type benefits and other stuff like health care that's either fully or partially paid
some have bonuses
others have had lots of vacation time but not much other types of benefits
i would
that's one of the big things that we always look at when i think about changing jobs is what kind of health care they have
does the company pay for it all or partially
how does that work
also vacation time too is a big one for me
and i guess support for whatever other
kinds of professional activities you have at work
cause i've been at places which offer a lot of support and others that don't offer any and sometimes that's coincided with a place that offers more vacation time though
that's not so bad
it's kind of a give and take kind of thing i think
i say that health care is probably definitely number one though
want to just all your salary can't
another good thing is with the health benefits when they give you more than two choices
that really helped us out a great deal
my husband does get vacation
it's worked out really good for us too
flexible hours are pretty important to me as well
that makes a big difference
she works as a assistant manager in a fabric store
she works a lot of evenings and weekends
two days a week i manage to get home early enough to meet the kids on the bus
she goes in early those days and works noon til close
we have
that's great that you all can work that out
being on a
i think it's kind of neat to be able to spend the afternoons with the kids occasionally too
usually you go to work before they're awake or as they're getting
you get home
it's already dark unless it's summer time
even in summer time sometimes you get home so late that you can't do anything with them
especially in the winter you get up in the dark and come home in the dark
it's like a vampire sometimes
it's the same with my husband cause he's got pretty flexible hours as long as he puts in the hours he needs to do
is there anything else that you look for
i think some of is how the
i guess it's not really a direct benefit but how your performance is rated and stuff like that at work
i've been
especially in large corporations you can really wind up having real problems i've found out
i've worked for a few several thousand plus
and especially if you're doing like professional work where it's kind of
i work with computer systems a lot
it's kind of hard to say
if you're a brick layer somebody can look and see you laid fifteen thousand bricks today
they were all straight
your building didn't fall down
if you build computer systems what does that computer program really do or especially if you write papers
it's like get a painter or something a artist
it's like how do you really rate michelangelo
how would you tell if he was really good or so-so or whatever
that does make a person want to stay
the type of cars that i would be most interested in if i was going to buy another car now would probably be something like a mazda miata
the
i'm very much a fan of sports cars
though in som-
if i h-
i'd rather put my money into
None
if i was to buy one probably something like a miata
i have a nineteen eighty-five c r x
which is it's
it's kind of annoying cause i've got no reason to replace it
what do the miatas run
those are
they're about thirteen to fourteen thousand dollars and a bit more if you add some some options and so on
that's not too bad
None
it's nice
i've also driven one at something mazda put on where they went to autocross events across the country which is where you race in a parking lot or something like that with a bunch of cones to see who can get through the fastest
about a minute or so
and very twisty stuff
it handles so nicely
you've done this
it's just so smooth
you don't get involved in car decisions
not too much
he wanted to drive that van and travel and wanted everything in there t v the whole bit
i never drove it
it just wasn't me
i'd want a minivan
i'm with the kids all the time
it's small enough that it's easy to drive
i pick up my little one from preschool
the whole parking lot's full of minivans
i drive a little subaru
i just wanted to hold on to it cause i just really enjoy that
that's really all i needed was for something just to go here and there and back
i've driven it a few times
it's nice
of course my family has always had cars like that in that my father's always had a v w bus every since about nineteen sixty or so
he used it
and pulled the little trailer behind
it's
it's really amazing how much a minivan can do
they're not that expensive
mainly because everyone makes them
we do a lot of driving
that's the only time that the conversion van came in handy
it really didn't cause our kids are still little
minivans do pretty well
twenty twenty-five miles per gallon or more
there's some other cars i'd like
i would never be willing to send quite that much money for
mandatory service i don't think it's a good idea
we'd have to change the constitution to allow involuntary servitude in service to the government
i'm not sure that we could
they might be able to say that anyone who does that gets certain benefits that
to use force
you are not a free american citizen
when someone is out of high school and not sure about college or out of college and not ready to go into a career and they're not committed to huge amounts of debt that's the best time to be able to do work that doesn't pay very well
i also thought that that would interfere with college work
they didn't
if someone were studying something take something obscure somebody was studying economics the state department could offer to send them to the soviet union for two years to teach them how to run their country
in reality i think what you would wind up with is a political football where they would see all these body counts that they can use for their own will
i just don't think it would work
what year are they looking at
they're not
it's sort of a topic of debate
the people who are proconstitution oppose it on the grounds that the government shouldn't even have the right to enforce you to join the military unless the united states is actually under attack
mostly it's just kind of one of those things that goes away
they've got a noisy line
it's somewhere between here and there
what age group are they looking at
eighteen
if it's my line
maybe that's part of it
they figure that they can draft you at eighteen
that's the
of course this one the women would be equally grabbed
they're almost on the verge of saying that if you're going to draft men you're going to have to draft women
you're going to have to put them in front of the guns just the same
if you're near that age
i do have children to think about
you don't want them sent off to the middle east to help defend bush from saddam after bush gets done arming him
it's another thing
you're in perot country
i find out that he helped rid the united states of the gablers
he's helped out in a lot of ways
he's from dallas
he's in the dallas area
he's very well known around here
i'm in the computer biz too
i know he's well known in the industry
i have high hopes for him
i think that
in the democratic primary i'm going to vote for brown just because i kind of like brown and his attitude
when it really comes down in the fall i think i know where it's going to go
i think he's got a very good chance
there's a lot of people here pulling for him
i don't know
th-
how did you work in the computer business is that what you said
my husband works for texas instruments
that's how we found out about the switchboard
that's their project too isn't it
air quality
i know in here downtown dallas you drive by and you can see it
then again
there is a big difference between texas and california
they'd have their smog alerts and where you'd have to stay indoors for so many hours with an air conditioner
of course they don't have that here in texas
you mean they don't have the smog alerts
not in dallas that is
i spent a summer in tyler so i know just east of dallas there
i'm a california born person
i know what you're talking about
i know that they're looking at better running automobiles
some things they do one of them is they're using corn in fuel
that's big up here because they grow a lot of corn
the
unfortunately it still contributes to global warming cause you have to wipe out forests to grow corn and things like that
one of the most productive crop in the world is corn
of course i doubt if there's any
they're looking at
there's some work being done on automobiles that are electrical powered
it has a engine in the back that charges it
the engine kicks on when the batteries need power
it turns off
interesting thing about about battery powered cars is when you're at a stop light you're not using
it's either on or off
None
ford and general motors and all those compete
i think that was a setback
g m chrysler announced that they're going to they're
they actually have an electric minivan
their caravan
it costs fifty thousand dollars
they're very expensive too
people are buying them
free for them
it doesn't make sense
if they want people to convert
it's a good good vehicle
i'll tell you
sometimes it's pretty bad here
i don't know if it's just the allergies or what
some days it's very nice here downtown
other days it's just really bad
i don't know
what kinds of things did you experience in l a when you were there
can you remember
i wasn't there too long ago
i haven't been there probably
going over the hills coming into the valley
we were there when they had a
i tell you what i'll start off
i personally think to set a mark with the judicial system and we're talking about criminal cases that they should bring back hangings on weekends
i think if we quit building these taj mahals with the color t v and sixty thousand a year to keep an inmate in there on a life sentence we should start hanging them and get it over with
let's just screwing up the system
the sentences are so unbelievable
i just saw on the news last night that they said the average time a sentenced murderer is in jail is two years before he's paroled and a rapists is six months
and a burglar is two months
they just say there's either no room in the system in the jails for them
it's just that it seems like the automatic sentences if a judge has leeway on what he's going to sentence someone for between two months and fifty years and what's his whim to decide it should be two months
it's crazy
the way the law reads if they sentence you to life in prison then he's available for parole
what
even if it's life like you say we end up spending sixty thousand dollars a year to keep some joker in there for life
we could spend that money for children that are starving or twelve million other things would be more useful than that
to me if somebody has life beyond a reasonable doubt that should be it
you know particularly for some of these really
it's not just like one instance or something it's just horrifying some of the murders that go on
the guy
just shouldn't be allowed to even live
about the issue about sentencing by the judge
bam bam the guy got off
he was a veterinarian and killed two a father and a son okay
it kind of gets back to the second request
we've been asked to look at most criminal cases requiring an unanimous verdict
there's a certain percentage of the people there with seventy percent of the people said hey
rather than have to retrial the whole thing and spend all the money for people to go back to court and all the lawyers
it just winds up costing the taxpayers a fortune to keep doing that
the victims the family of these people that have been murdered they just have to have it dragged on for years and years before they ever get any resolution
it's not next day they have the start the trial it's x number of months and just prolongs the situation that much more
i think that if it's not a split decision go with the highest number
let's just get on with the program
as far as the sentencing by the judge i would have to vote against that since there is a jury because that's what the juries are for is to make the decision
what are your feelings
if i
she just has really stiff penalties
i saw that
likewise you could have the flip side and have some judge that was paid off or had a good old boy network
for whatever reasons politics just let all kinds of people through
he would have a heck or she would have a heck of a lot of power if used wrongly
at least the jury system does something to prevent that or help it with it anyway
seems like the jury system does have it's advantages
i've also heard on trials that sometimes they go through three hundred jurors before they hand pick these jurors that they think are going to be the ones that are going to be the most lenient
i don't know how much they're getting just a jury of their peers at that point they're really getting a select group
it almost should be the first twelve people that they have on a list
that's it
i get back to price's comment when he was found guilty he said he didn't have any blacks from his neck of the woods
give me a break
you're in dallas
in a murder situations they look for juries who don't know anything about the system well or know anything about the occurrence
you'd either have to be in a cave not to know what's going on or moving it to lubbock
they'd have to move it to taiwan for people not to know about it practically
this has been an interesting conversation
this breaks up my afternoon from changing diapers and mopping floors
you're at the house you're not at the plant
i'm at home with two little preschoolers
that's good
i wasn't sure
i'll let you get
as a matter of fact i was thinking about that the other day
i really don't know the answer
i would sort of like to think about something in the way of sort of a sporty car but not a luxury type sporty one
but something that still has a lots of amenities and gadgets and things
you do want a lot of that stuff
i like some of those things
what kind of things are you going to consider
you said something about the
what do you call them
what about their reputation of the company or the price
of course i guess price is always the big consideration
i have preferences for some makers over others
i would sort of like to buy american
i'm not so totally hung up on that that i wouldn't buy something else
the last car we bought was american because of that reason
have not been entirely happy with several things about the car
several things minor things sort of
still they cost us money that we didn't feel like we should have had to pay on a car that was that new
under two years we had to replace the clutch
they just said clutches are disposable
i said since when
i never thought a clutch was disposable
that was kind of a shock
i guess there's a lot to think about when you're trying to make that decision
the less you spend on a car it seems like luxury cars
they're called luxury cars even though they're much more expensive like a mercedes benz
on the other hand i guess too whenever you do have to have some major work done on one of those it costs a fortune
i don't know
i've worked with a couple of people who have owned various years
even though they do a lot of the work themself just buying the parts and everything is pretty expensive
for them it's sort of a hobby too
what things are you looking at
i haven't really gotten that far with it
i guess i really don't know
i've been kind of
i know that a lot of people i've known that have had toyotas have been just extremely happy with them hardly had any problems at all
i think they have a really good quality
my daughter has owned two different ones
we've had some work done on them
it's not too bad
the reason
one of the reasons we bought the first one was because a friend of ours had a toyota that he just really drove for years and years and years
he lived way out in the country
he put a lot of miles on it
you knew it had been through a whole lot
yet it held up pretty doggone good
i don't know
i'm not ready to buy a new car yet
i don't know if the next time i'm going to try to stay with buying something american or if i'm going to go for a little more what i would consider to be a long-term investment
i guess you always have to think about things like your gas mileage and stuff like that
it's easy to get gas mileage in this car
enjoyed it
go ahead
i was thinking that you needed to put some waivers in there for the handicapped and also for people that had to stay home and maybe be wage earners for their family
they had somebody at home that was ill that they had to tend to
you can't make it everybody
then you need to make it sure that the rich people can't buy somebody off and maybe send them in their places or get out of it some other way too
it could be like the draft where before they draft you you get a physical anyway
when they send you a draft notice and they give you a physical
if there's nothing physically wrong with you then you're drafted
we could maybe give physicals to the rest of the family members
they all had to pass
i thought it a good idea too though would be to extend this and make people that are accepting public welfare have to do something along this line before they got any money
if they did this maybe help them out in their college cost
maybe they could pay people for doing this at least something
they could subsist
that's true
america's paying all this money to have other people give aid to other countries
they could be paying their own people and training their own people at the same time
when you do service overseas you end up learning something usually that's really useful plumbing or farming or something like that
you're really learning a skill
you know all these old people they would get out of this right
what we could do is take all the retired people that are going around in their big mobile homes and they could do public service all over the country
i think that's probably the idea
i thought it would be a good idea if maybe you took some of the kids and had them go over to other countries
children from their countries came over to ours too a trade off
other than that i can't think of any other ideas
i like the idea of being a mandatory thing for welfare
course that's what
was it roosevelt
i can't remember
with w p a
getting people
the work program and all the make work jobs
we're still using those things too
it's real pretty
with all the spanish moss on the trees it's eerie
i been
i talked to someone else before that was a texan
i guess that's what we're going to have
this is a t i experiment to see how talk
that's neat
it is neat to get other people especially since you got other ideas about how people react to things and stuff especially when it comes to social services
i'm glad they have a lot of topics on social services because like this thing this is a pretty good idea
i wonder if they thought about it themselves or whether someone somewhere is really thinking that it would be a good idea to have everybody spend some time in public service
i can't remember who it is
there's a really famous
politicians pushing it or mitch snider
that's a d c thing
mitch snider is the advocate for the homeless that he's said it out here in washington
he started the movement for creative nonviolence
that was basically a donate time and money to help the homeless
the other topic was like i said something about politicians
it was what meal would you cook for special dinner
another one though that was good was what do you think about the social changes for the last ten twenty and thirty years
what do you think has caused some of the social problems
we had to talk about air pollution too
what should we do about it
that would be sort of interesting because then you get people from other parts of the state
of course pittsburgh would say find the better cheaper ways of burning coal
people in the south would say don't burn coal
we don't have much coal
we have a lot of coal
it's a dirty fuel that's for sure
how did you get into this program
they sent it out in our bulk mail so that if any engineers wanted to participate
does your company have something to do with t i
not really
no more than any other company
no real association with t i other than being in the same electronics industry
they just sent out a letter to everybody they do business with saying that if you're interested we're doing a study
since
do you know how long this is supposed to go on
it says just keep on until
they'll notify you
at first i was thinking it was just a week because that's all it shows on the schedule
then it seems like it might be longer than a week
what do you think we're going to get
i don't know
you're going to get you own t i seven thirty-two or something
i didn't hear about that
your not you're
she saw this on her computer and thought it might be neat
she ran off copies of the thing
i just signed up for it
that's a neat idea
he's gotten a good mix
probably knock t i profits margin way down
we're footing the bill on our taxes
i enjoyed talking with you
thanks a bunch
i'm going to try to clean up the house after my two children for about an hour see if we can walk around
i'll talk to you
last thing i saw was i think sleeping with the enemy with julia roberts
i hadn't seen that
i've heard that it's real good
it was a little strange
this woman supposedly is being mentally abused by her husband
she figures out this way to leave him secretly
she fakes her death kind of thing
he tracks her down
the end scenes are kind of suspenseful when she realizes he's in the house after her
kind of had the feeling along that
look bucko
anyhow what have you seen
last week as a matter of fact my children was on spring break we went to two movies
we went to see kindergarten cop
i really liked both of them
awakening was kind of sad to me
it would be to anyone because they really don't know that much about it
this is where the people have been kind of
the drugs let them come back
the drugs didn't work for long
they started having real bad side effects
this is about nineteen sixty-four or something like that
there still hasn't been any new development in prescribed drugs that can help it
there
it was a big breakthrough
in time all the side effects started showing
how bad were the side effects
they actually went back like they were
they wasn't mild
i really enjoyed it though
how about kindergarten cop
arnold schwarzenegger is getting to be a bit of a variety actor
he's kind of branching out
as a matter of fact sylvester stallone is that his name
i really believe schwarzenegger is really going to be a variety player more so than he is because he really played the part good
he could be this rough tough guy and then this substitute teacher
there was a movie out
there's this thing with danny de vito called twins
i've seen that
it is
i even like some of the original stuff
i like the terminator
at first it was kind of strange
i still like watching him in the terminator
and some of the other things
total recall last year i thought was really good last summer
i thought it was pretty good
i'm not into that
i have some
i just keep telling her how can you do that
i told her when she had her little girl
she says her little girl's into it now
my goodness
she watches these really gross things like
and that kind of
i remember when i was real little we all went to some kind of scary movie
it was like this big house had a basement
there was all these weird things going on in the basement
i was scared to death of our house had a basement for years
i got a lot of really weird ideas
they tell you that kids can be impressed by all that stuff
it's true
i had a lot of things that i
i don't want to go home
i think a lot of kids get the same kind of fears like there's somebody under the bed
i know
i really do because my youngest one he watches something you might as well just plan on staying up all night because
they're
it's just a movie
i remember i was with a friend of mine had three kids
the little boy must have been maybe about ten
we rented charlotte's web
he just bawled at the end and just
we were trying to say kenny it's okay
he didn't want to listen to it
he just was beside himself
i guess that's why the actors and actresses make millions of dollars
people like us
i've enjoyed talking to you
maybe we'll run across each other again
i've just been called by the switchboard
the first week i think a lot more people were doing it
i normally get a call every other day
as far as
from where i'm at
they said it would be up friday march the fifteenth before it was prepared
i missed several days because i was getting quite a few calls
how weird
they do have a variety of topics
i was going
my husband sometimes he'll receive a call
he's at work
if i know the topic i'll go ahead and accept it as mine
the other day i got one about fishing
i thought my
i'm not even going to try
when they listened to that tape they would have really had a good time
i know it takes a fishing pole and some bait and some water
i'm really not for sure though if
i'll let you go
we'll talk to you later
have you ever been involved in any trials
two years ago i spent some fourth of july to labor day on a jury that was a change of venue from columbus ohio for aggravated murder and kidnapping
it was quite a session that disrupted my whole summer of course
it was an absolutely fascinating experience
it sounds like it
my father-in-law's been involved in several trials including a couple murders and talking to other people who have been there
i don't have any real experience with trials
i do
i took a little business law in college
i've
m-
i think that the trial by jury is a great idea at it's inception back two hundred years ago
right now though it's so difficult because there's so few courts to get anything really done as you know you spent a whole summer on one trial
it's just that i think they're just tieing up the whole judicial process tying
there's a lot of things they could do to make things easier and like the suggestion that maybe a judge should be the one who decides on what the sentence should be rather than the jury
i think that there are many cases where the judges probably do make the decision rather than the jury
our situation was somewhat different in view of the fact that we were a landmark case
it was the first time in the state of ohio that d n a testing was entered as evidence
they were being
the judge was being especially careful that everything was done correctly so there couldn't be a mistrial of any kind
the interesting thing was the tremendous selection of jury process that we experienced
that took one full week to get forty-three people qualified to sit on the jury
it was a matter of the selection of twelve people after that
it was fourteen because we had two alternates
the judge was extremely concerned for our welfare if we were comfortable and things of that nature which made us feel good
we were sequestered
the makeup of the jury was truly a cross section of a country
one was a former student of mine a few years before who was out of work
a couple of them were housewives who had never worked
some are people who did work
we had quite a cross section of black white and women and men
it was interesting just to listen to the rationale being proposed and the logic of some of the people
we were not allowed to take any notes of any kind
i thought that that was a failing because from the standpoint that it was difficult to try to remember everything
yet the judge said if you're taking notes you're missing something
he was right
i certainly
i think it depends upon how the judge handles the case and if the criminal chooses to have a a three judge panel i think he can
would surprise me that
when i was in texas i had the displeasure of getting a traffic ticket
i went to court
you can even get a trial by jury for a traffic ticket
i thought my god talk about tieing up things for tying
that's extremely expensive
the first thing you had to do when you came before the judge was waive your right to a jury trial
i do think that
i also feel as you said that the original concept of the jury as it was originally setup back a hundred years ago was fine but that it needs to be more refined for today's standard of living and the level of education of so many people now
by the same token we had some people who had vacations planned
one man in particular had reservations made plane tickets made everything
the judge called and had it all canceled so he could get his money back
he wasn't selected on the jury
my god
another young fellow had to meet with the judge and the prosecutor and the defense attorneys on three different occasions before he was finally excused from the jury because his wife was about to have twins
he had to go through all of that in three days to get excused from that jury to be with his wife on the birth of the twins
some of it just seemed rather extreme
i think they can probably come up with some ways to insure that people would get a fair trial
some things are just so cut and dry
in the level of evidence that they come up with now when you start thinking about they've got video tape and audio tapes
they've got ways to nail people
to the point where they really shouldn't even be going to trial
i guess he'd have to be careful with entrapment or some of those things
i don't
that was horrible
None
that certainly cannot be said to be something that happens everywhere
the fact that it can happen that it probably does happen in many places it's horrendous
it's just a stroke of luck
that someone was able to get it on tape and then to listen to the tape recording at the police station of the whole conversation afterwards
i only heard portions of that
it's absolutely
if you beat a dog like that they'll put you
we get a few other case
like up at the end of last year where one police officer it was on a drug raid was trying to extricate a confession or information from a drug dealer and did so by placing a hot iron on his bare chest burned him
they wound up paying him
they paid the defendant three hundred thousand dollars or something to drop the lawsuit
last week someone shot and killed the former policeman
as
some of those things are absolutely horrendous
we do need an overhaul
we just need more discipline country wide
i believe that too
it's been very nice talking with you
it's been nice talking with you
good luck on calls
i was just looking around my house and thinking about the painting that i've done
the last time that we tackled it i did the kitchen
i had gone through a period of depression at one time and painted everything a dark
the kitchen was one of the rooms that got hit with that color
it was quite a feat getting that dark a color covered and then just the hassles getting around the cabinets
if i look underneath my cabinets i'm not satisfied with the jobs i did on it because there're splotches
i'm glad it's done because it's brighter
we
we bought a house at the same time
we're about halfway through the painting process
the only
i guess the big discussion just kind of what you were mentioning has been the color
we ended up with our living and dining room are now kind of a light peach color with
it's got all the old original hardwood trim and stuff
we've got the trim in kind of an off-white
this is really the first interior painting project that i've attacked
it's been something else to say the least
we had the same type of situation
the walls were
they weren't
there was semigloss underneath we put a flat over the top
everywhere you'd miss there'd be this little bright spot you could see
we've learned
we've worked our way back into the hallway
we're in the middle of the bathroom now
it's been quite an adventure
we've learned to be a little more careful about covering up the floors since the first
what are you going to get it off with if you get it on and it's dried
it's not too bad
it it
it's really not to bad to get off too
it's not too bad to get it off once it's dried even
it comes off with a mild abrasive pad like a scotch-brite pad or something like that and soap and water
we got pretty lucky on that
it's not scratching your floor
that's pretty good
we painted every room in this house some of them two three times
they just
i have been coloring my hair
i'm real haphazard when i do it
i've got dye on my bathroom door
i haven't figured out how to get that off
we have a two story
i couldn't stand the back side going up that high on the ladder
our house was painted as part of the purchase contract
we didn't have to mess with that this time
i grew up on a farm
i've messed with outdoor painting a little bit
most of that it was done with a sprayer and up in the bucket of a loader tractor or something like that
it took a lot of the hassle out
they're
you're not nearly as concerned with a barn or a grainery or something like that as you would be with your own house
a little bit
we got to do that this summer
just the opposite of what everybody's working towards now
we stocked up the first time around
we've definitely got all the formulas on file
they'll be there for a while
we're pretty comfortable with that
it
i'm real nervous every time i open a new can
i'm wondering if i shouldn't buy about twenty gallons at one time and keep it all in a washtub or something somewhere because i'm always afraid that the next coat is not going to match
it's gone pretty well
it takes some time
i'm a self-proclaimed perfectionist
it takes me a long time to do trim and things like that
i'll find something as i'm going along something not related
like i've gone about changing out all the outlets and switches because they really didn't match
i always pick up these little extra tasks as i'm doing this
i'm always doing all this other stuff
my wife's hollering at me and wondering what else i've come home with from work this time to put in a ceiling fan or something strange like that
it always
it gets you to look at everything real hard when you start putting a coat of paint on everything
i still feel good the minute i put that paint on
what else can i tell you about painting
i get it all in my hair too
it's been
we bought this house with the idea that we were going to spend a lot of time working on it
it was part
part of the excitement was getting a good deal on an older house that just really hadn't been taken care of very well
it was actually
we ended up getting a fairly good deal on it
there just isn't enough time
i find myself going to work knowing that there's a job about half done at home
i really
if i'd just stay home and finish it i'd feel a lot better
i'm starting to learn that there's always something else
you make up all kinds of excuses
not a whole lot
they're in pretty good condition as far as major repairs a lot of little filling holes and nicks and things like that
the only
the most major things have been i guess i moved a couple of outlets and switches i should say
that's smart
yeah
i didn't like that very well
i moved that
most of it's in pretty good shape
where do you live
live in dallas
i hadn't tried
in fact we were planting flowers this weekend
i was pretty tied up
i've never tried any other kinds of painting besides on a surface like the house like to paint a picture or anything
it hurts your arm
i get a sore neck from looking up all the time things like that
you're glad you're doing it
it just
like i say the overall appearance of this house is what really devalued it so much
i don't want to put a price on it
i just feel like every gallon of paint adds a tremendous amount of value to the house
every time i do something aside from that it just makes me feel a whole lot better to come home an the walls are clean
they match and all those kinds of things
it sometimes works
it sometimes doesn't
it's a
when i start doing trim i've gotten to where i tend to freehand it because there's so many layers of paint on this house after forty years that it's so hard to tell where an edge is anymore
we've got carpet
i haven't figured out how you're supposed to paint it on down so that you won't see where you stopped off and still not get it on the carpet
every time you move that edger then it gets the carpet into it
None
i've seen
they make some plastic edging stuff that comes in three foot lengths
you can tape them together
put
what do you think about the way the criminal justice system handles trials
they tell you that you get tried by a jury of your peers it's pretty hard to try the man down the street that's living on social security or somebody that's on a limited income to be tried by a jury of his peers if most of the people
the juries that i've served on are businessmen
now they don't understand that maybe he needed fifty dollars
he held up the seven eleven
i think that a trial by your peers should be exactly that someone in your own age bracket
you can't really do it ethnically
you could probably get it a little closer
then there's another thing that i disagree with in texas is sometimes you have a jury of six
sometimes you have a jury of twelve
i don't know why they do that
i think the six is called a grand jury
that's mostly to decide whether or not the person's actually going to stand trial
whether they're acquitted or whether they're actually going to be accused
in texas i noticed since i've been here twelve years that they break up the trial and then the sentencing part of the trial
i think that
we know there's a few out there
it seems like if you break the sentencing away from the jury and you give it to one person you're letting there be a whole lot more of an opportunity for something to either go wrong
for
if the judge is not of high moral standards he could be bought off much easier than twelve people could
i don't think that if i was the criminal that i would like the judge passing sentence on me
i think it's
then two weeks down the road we have to set a sentencing date so now we're back in court again
that's more money spent
it's not so much that i haven't seen a lot of really bad sentences passed either by trials or by judges
what bothers me is that they really don't mean anything
yet the parole system it's going to let them out in three years for good behavior
it's not working either
where we're at now our jails are overcrowded
i think they're all overcrowded
it's overcrowded
now they start turning them loose
i think i heard fort worth that they've been ordered to do something because their jail is so overcrowded
they're not allowed to accept any new inmates
what are they supposed to do with people that they need to put in jail
it seems the way it's been working here's
i really like the system of house arrest where
someone wears a bracelet like a ankle bracelet that's a monitor
they keep
they are not allowed
some of them are even allowed to work
they're instructed so that this electronic monitor is turned on at at a certain time
it connects them up to a system where they know their whereabouts
they can put a
when the parole officer calls to check on them they're instructed to turn it on and stand in front of it
that's working rather well
to actually continue to be productive members of society while they're
that way it would give
the probation department and parole department they've got to be overloaded with as many criminals as we have here in lubbock
that would give
i've really
this may sound cruel
i do not think that they should be allowed cigarettes
they're in jail for crying out loud
there's another thing about the justice system that i don't like
there's a lot of people that tell me that maybe my thoughts are wrong
i came from california when you're in jail they take you out just like they do in alabama or anywhere else what they call a chain gang
they clean the city parks
i think that's a wonderful idea
they clean the city streets
we have criminals in jail that do nothing but sit on their duff all day
here it costs us seventeen to eighteen thousand dollars a year to support a prisoner
i know
i know families myself that have three and four children in lubbock that don't make that much
they're not doing anything to support themselves
the thing that gets me is that while we're supporting them
i don't know
some percentage eighty-five percent of their wages should go toward their room and board figured on a whatever basis how much it costs to actually support them for a year
when they get out they should have some reasonable amount of money to start like a couple of thousand dollars
there should be a limit over which it all goes back to the state
anything that they've earned while they're in prison should go back to the state except for that there needs to be some allowance for when someone gets out that they have some money to start with
at least that way they would be helping pay for their own
something else that i would like to see is victim reimbursement because they like you say these guys are in jail
they're working
the guy that they messed over to get there or they stole something from or beat to death
has nothing
our victims are victimized period
the law has no regulations to deal with that
they know how to deal with the penal system
they know how to deal with the criminal
they don't know how to deal with the victim because we as citizens i guess haven't laid anything up there for them to deal with on that aspect
i sure don't
i strongly disagree with any judge passing sentence on a person himself
i think it works much better if it's the actual jury
the jury is dealing with the seriousness of the crime
if they figure there's maybe litigating circumstances or something like that whereas maybe the judge just doesn't care you committed this crime
i'm just going to throw the book at you
whereas the jury may have a little sympathy
why did he do this
is there a basis for it
cases it would work that way
in some cases where the judge says okay i'll give you two to three years
the jury would slam them
i think that the jury probably has more of a right to sentence than the judge all the time
they have a stronger debate too because there's twelve people there
they can sit at the same time and decide what his punishment would be
you'd have more than one person's input on it
we're supposed to be in a democratic society
if you can find me guilty then you ought to be able to pass sentence
a lot of jurors
a lot of jurors may just sit there and say he's guilty
i don't have to deal with it from here
the judge takes care of all of that
it would be a more responsible way to deal with it
serving on the jury you'd have to be a definitely more responsible person
the thing that i don't really like
i don't know if a lot of jury selection processes that i've seen have been a
i think we should have a balanced budget even if it means that services are dramatically cut back
bet right this moment you probably have several loans out
you have borrowed money against your credit card or something master charge
our whole system is built on owing not borrowing
that's the problem
without it people wouldn't be able to own automobiles
they wouldn't be able to own a house
we might have to just be able to
i think if a generation went without debt then the next generation
if our generation
my husband and i we're twenty-eight
we wouldn't be living on the street by any means
just compared to how spoiled we are we would be in our own minds
i feel like the generation after us would
it would be so good
then they could learn to live with what they could afford to save to buy
if you want a nicer car than that you save a little longer
now i agree with you one hundred percent
i still go to right back to what i said
we made poor choices in college
both of us had twenty thousand dollars in loans for student loans i look back on that
i bought shoes
it would have been a little rough
i did not need it
as i look back now now we're paying that back
don't take out ten thousand dollars in loans
i don't think he'll have to do that
i just feel like if we didn't have those loans we could have saved in the last five years the money for that
i believe we would have because god's really put it in our heart not to get in debt
we have friends in church that do this on a constant basis that are totally debt free
they pay cash for everything they buy
i guess i've seen it done
i know you can do it
you have to drive that old car until you get that money saved up for that new van
that's where americans don't like to do it
we don't want to cut back our services from the government because we're spoiled
i have one way to suggest reducing the budget
and take some of those holidays away from them like columbus day president's day
they get all these days off
what a week i think we here at t i get a total of eleven a year
that's about three or four less than civil servants get
i always think the mail never comes on these days
you're like what is it
now don't forget the mail is something else again
isn't it in the federal budget
isn't it part of our income
that's why it keeps going up
i can remember the days when it cost only three cents to mail a letter
that is a good short term thing though
that little things like that
overall though i just think we're just going to see
i guess i'm kind of leery of this topic because i know that bush is real for the new world order the one world government and alleviating all national debt between all of the nations
i see that to be a potential power problem later with who's going to be in charge with this new world order
i'm uncomfortable with that much power being in one place
i know we already have a new money system
i've seen them
i know that the long-term vision for the u s government is to alleviate all national debts and to start over afresh
i'm concerned with who's going to have the power over this new world order that they keep talking about
i guess because i
i'm kind of like the only answer is to start over or to totally change our lifestyles
i don't think americans are willing to do it
what about sending all this money overseas supporting other governments third world governments
i don't feel we should loan them money
if i wish our leaders were really seeking the lord on these things
if we feel led to give a country money to help them fine
i don't feel we should be loaning money like that
it doesn't work
in so many cases it's not a loan
it's not set up as a giveaway
it was something that our president and our leaders could be seeking god saying god is it your will for us to bless this nation with this money
i believe if we gave it no strings attached that god would bless our nation
because our motive is interest our motive is not pure it just backfires
none of these nations have paid us back
you understand i guess it's a principle of giving and receiving
they may never give you anything back
because there's no strings attached it gives them a freedom to give us something back
it might not be money
it might be no taxes on our things our computers going into their nation
it would be come back
because we're loaning it i think that's the problem
i don't mean give it to everybody that asks
i think if we gave to a few select ones that really needed it that it would work out better for us and for them
now we have all these nations that owe us all this money
i just think we're never going to get that back
that's true
i understand that france still owes us money from world war i
world war two debts have never been repaid
and said we'll cancel it just like they did to that polish debt here last week
half the countries of the world simply canceled the poland debts to help them
long term though do you think it would best to see a one world
do you think it would be better for our leaders to just start seeking god on how to turn our nation around financially
i've got to respect your opinion
do you disagree
what do you think long term
i don't believe in a single government or a single control for the world
that's asking for trouble
you could travel from one coast to the other here in the u s and find a tremendous differences between the peoples
therefore i don't believe there could be a single government for the whole world
there's too many societies involved
sure
somebody said years ago let's make it english international language
we've got too many immigrants
my grandfather came over from lithuania back just before the turn of the century as a matter of fact he's a draft dodger
he was supposed to serve some time
he did serve his time in the militia
he came back
his father said if
tell you what i'll let you start
i wake up to it in the morning
this is i guess my prime time for news first thing in the morning while i'm getting ready to go to work
i quite frequently glance through headlines or in the newspaper
primarily mine is t v news
i have to agree with you
i normally don't have time in the morning to watch any type of t v
usually catch it going to work on the radio or when i drag the paper in from the front and catch the head lines which is normal what you see the night before on the evening news
i've kind of
it's kind of hard sometimes to watch t v during the night
i usually try to catch the ten o'clock or
i have to say during the war the american public was probably flooded with too much information
as far as the sub question about was am i satisfactorily covered i have to say yes
when it came to the war issues who's telling the truth
between the channels there was the casualties the amount of missiles launched were different
it was almost too much information over communicated
that's true
let's face it
today's means of communication a newscaster could very well giveaway a piece of top secret information
and pat himself on the back for making a good scoop
i would have to say across-the-board i'm satisfied with the way the news is spread
of course here at texas instruments the rumor mill runs rampant
i check that everyday
i don't think much of their sports coverage
that's all right
outside of pro football i'm not too interested in other games other sports anyway
the t-news is a good way to keep up-to-date
anything else crossed your mind
you need to continue to read so you people learn to read
i spent twenty years in commercial broadcasting radio and t v
i know what it takes to get some of those little bits and pieces of news on the air
there are times where the reporter actually will risk life and limb
i remember one time up in nashville tennessee
he was lucky he got out of it for some reason
he was carrying a camera
they left him alone
i've enjoyed speaking with you
did you get your catalog on your gifts
it kind of sparked me to keep calling
i'll be looking for it then
i do that
we recycle newspapers
we take the dallas morning news daily
after a month of that you got a ton
newspapers and glass
we don't drink milk
we don't have children
we don't have six thousand plastic milk jugs
a month
with a two year old and a
it really builds up with us
there is a place you can take those also at the same place just put them in a different container
plano has plans
the city is going to leave receptacles at people's home
they ca-
they can separate it
the trash guys will pick it up
which would really be handy for people like shut ins or
people who can't or don't drive
it just builds up so often
i'm sure rather than try to ask someone to take them for them they probably just pitch them
i think that's probably a good idea
they used to have several places that were a little ways out in the community that did the paper and all
they stopped doing it because they said it wasn't profitable
finally the people put so much pressure on the city
they took a big huge bin that has paper and plastic
it just really
every time you went by there it was just over flowing
wal-mart complained
they moved it behind the store
nobody knew where it was
people kept piling stuff in the same place
it was just like a dump there
finally i called
they said it was behind there
i started taking my things behind there
we do that because we have milk cartons constantly
it just builds up
it would be so nice if they had it at your home
where you could just turn it in so they final had enough of a response that they decided to try a small target area
they have pickup there
it's i think once or twice a week
the first couple weeks they did it nobody got their stuff out
they had not much participation
they were going to cancel it
then finally people started getting the message
i think that if they can get enough going
they'll continue it throughout the rest of the city
it's not
it's not going to be
i think basically it's a good idea
i do to because it's amazing how much trash
they gave you a little seedling to plant
you could take the mulch home with you and take buckets of that home
that was really good idea
there's just the two of us my wife and i
it's amazing how much stuff just the two of us generate
i can imagine a family of four or five
as far as new stuff to recycle i don't really know
now their saying that originally they thought the disposables were just awful
now their saying that they're really not that much in comparison to the others because you don't have to use the water to wash them
and all different kinds of things too
i don't know what's the right thing to do
i really would hope that they would come up
the landfill have to do something special for those
that just generates a tremendous of volume
i'm sure it must
i'm not personally involved because i don't have any children that wear diapers
i'm sure it creates a large amount of
you just feel guilty if you don't
something with them
on the on the other hand the alternatives aren't to great either
i don't know about cans that you keep vegetables and stuff
there is a receptacle at the centers also for aluminum
again we don't generate that much
we don't really have
ninety-nine percent of ours is newspaper glass
now when we lived out in california they actually had places where you could recycle if you change the oil in your car
i don't change my own oil
i don't don't have that problem
other than that i'm not really sure
we try to recycle old clothes
we do to as a matter of fact
they pass them on to
our church each year has a
one of their major fund raisers is a garage sale
there's a ton of clothes always left over
i take those down to the
they distribute them to the people
that's real helpful
i'm not sure i can't really think of anything else that we could recycle
i really can't either
it was nice talking to you
i primarily listen to classical music when i have my druthers partly because i find it more soothing
i don't know a lot about classical music so far as any background in music
it's the music i enjoy the most
i would like to buy more classical tapes and stuff
i'm not sure which composers or which i really like
i kind of hesitate to buy something
i tend to listen to the classical music on the radio a lot
there several stations in this area that play classical music all the time
there's one in particular that is on both a m and f m so i can listen to it without worrying
it's cute though because my children when they get in the car and i have the button pushed for that they always switch it to something else
naturally that isn't their taste at this point in time anyway
are you involved in music
i do the world a favor
i don't sing aloud
my daughter's quite involved and all that sort of thing
i think that one of these days maybe she'll get involved in classical music too because that's usually what happens unless you get into rock which isn't her voice style
i don't care for rock at all
most of it is not all that exciting in that it is terribly repetitious
there have been some nice folk songs over the years that kind of still hang around
the more popular music i don't care for usually
even when i was a teenager i didn't really like the music of that period so much because i found i liked a little bit more melodious music than what was often the popular
now rock and roll seems tame compared to the new age and all that stuff
much of the music that was popular at that time has come back
you don't hear everything all the time
you hear much of the same music perhaps a new version of it
it's the same stuff
which is always kind of funny
i remember my older sister
at the time that i was a late teenager i guess i can't remember the year smoke gets in your eyes became popular
she laughed
she said when i was a teenager that had been
some years before she said that was a version of a song then
she said it's very similar
they've changed a little bit
they did it again about
i laughed again
i listen to the christian radio station when i'm in the car
now there's some wonderful christian music when you can find good stations
the problem that i found in this area is that there is inconsistency in the quality here
sometimes they kind of get on a binge
they play the same sort of thing over and over again without really necessarily quality
i live in the washington d c area maryland
i said they're playing one of their ten songs
they just play them over and over
i
now my children have sometimes
they've gone to a few of the concerts and so on of christian musicians that come to our youth group at our church
when they buy a tape or something sometimes that's fun because it's different and something i've not always heard
i enjoy that
is your husband a singer
just an amateur singer
he likes to do special music and stuff at church
that's a good thing to do
do you have children
you can get
i know when my children were younger we found a lot of really nice tapes that they liked
there was an agape music group
some of the songs i still find going over in my head over and over again because they were really very memorable even though my children are now
i still find some of the same songs from those tapes i enjoy
there's one that's a little girl singing practice makes perfect
she's playing the piano
she gets the wrong note every now and then
then she keeps repeating it practice makes perfect
talking about that so far as christian life too
it's really cute
i tell my husband to sing to my stomach because they say that babies can hear quite a lot while they're still in the womb
i said then when it's born you can hold it and sing that again
maybe it'll comfort her when she's fussy and stuff
do you know something
i have always played classical music or classical style
it's not always classical as the official word might go
even when i was pregnant of course i listened to that
when our first child was an infant of course when i was around the house i played that music too
when he first made sounds that you could detect they were in the music scale
someone else noticed it i said i guess that's true
it was somewhat melodious
in other words it wasn't just it was really funny
we'll have to keep up with that then
i do think there is probably an influence there because i noticed that even though popular music the wilder stuff was around when my older children were early adolescents when they first start listening to music on their own they first ask for a radio of their own and so on
this same child really listened to more ballady or pleasant sort of songs and even classical rather than the real hard rock stuff that so many other kids listen to
i didn't want to say too much for fear he would think it was wrong and wouldn't do it anymore
then i must say they all kind of like a variety of music which is nice
i guess that covers it
it was nice talking to you
good luck with the baby
charles gun control
what are you in favor or no comment
you are
this should be very interesting
i don't mind people owning guns
i just think it should be a little more regulated
now here's something that first occurred to me when they started having all these problems with these automatic weapons
now there always has been a federal law against fully automatic weapons
yet the gun control enthusiasts are preaching about the gun control and how we should have stronger laws and what not
for fully automatic weapons
now for instance
in california where they passed the semiautomatic now what was it they called them
how is that going to affect the sports weapons rifles
i really don't have any problem jack with people using firearms for sporting purposes
i would like to see that happen
now i've got to admit i'm inclined to agree with you there even though i am a member of the n r a
their reason being that if you let one little law get through pretty soon one's going to stack up on top of another
you've got to admit that congress does kind of look at things that way
like i say i don't have any problem with people using firearms for sporting purposes or hunting purposes
i just think it's just may be a little too easy to acquire one
on a whim of some sort
that's true
now did you hear about the control that they have up in virginia
it's a little hard to believe
they can of course
like just about every other state in the union they have a felony law
anyone ever convicted of a felony cannot purchase a weapon
when you go in and buy a weapon or a handgun in virginia
if it comes up negative okay fine
you get your gun right then and there
they are the only state that does it
that's interesting
according to virginia it didn't cost all that much
at least records of known felons which are available to local police departments
certainly those records are available
all they would have to do is expand it
to connect them into a modem somehow
they managed to squeak out a few bucks to do it
it's one-hundred percent successful
that's interesting
they were bragging about it
they should have have pride in this because it's a good system
it's working well
they don't need that seven-day waiting period
the whole idea of that waiting period was
so that
we seem to be one in favor and one against
although neither one of us are really dyed in the wool
we both
i just think there shouldn't be quite so easy to do
now here in texas all you need is a driver's license
even felons can still get a driver's license
i don't think they are too
they're not rigid enough here in texas
don't tell the n r a i said that
i'm looking forward to it in about just over a year myself
i do not quite a lot
i do some volunteer work here in plano
i have a few handicapped persons that i try to help them do
i bought a motor home here four years ago i have been living in it ever since
i'm looking forward to just traveling
and a few grandchildren
i'm looking forward to just traveling around visiting them
i was thinking about our topic for the night
what do you think about it
i sort of see perspectives on all sides
i've no hope for solutions
i do keep myself somewhat abreast of the issue
i have worked a little bit with refugees from
southeast asia who've come over to escape the genocide programs that are over there
and heard about some of the problems that they've had
i'm also fairly sensitive to the issues about how open should the borders be
i in general like a smaller rather than a larger population
we've got a lot too
we're getting a large
gosh i don't know
i think there's twenty-six different languages now that are spoken in the i s d dallas innercity school district
we're getting a lot of mexican americans
we've had
i don't know what the solution is
i don't either
it's a really delicate moral issue
if you have
i guess the one thing i do see is that needs to be a solution is that if you do let people into the country i do feel you have a certain obligation to get them on their feet
otherwise what you're doing is you're letting people in
you're dooming them to being underclass people
you're dooming them to ghetto life or whatever
i know that the southeast asians the hmong people that i've done some work with feel very quite hurt and unsure of themselves when here
they're coming from the slash and burn intercultural society
they're being plunked down into america
the c i a of course isn't doing that
they don't know what the heck they're doing
they're finding themselves adrift in the big cities
of course there are people in the big cities who would like nothing better than to take advantage of them
they're incredible victims of crime
part of it is this lack of basic information being dissimilated
i'm not saying it's easy to do
i know there are a few people who are trying
the funding isn't there for very much work to be going on
there's a lot of graft like people giving them information that was free to them anyway if they just knew how to get it
these are people who don't have the foggiest idea about what america's like
it's
i couldn't really conceptualize how hard it was to understand that until i met with them
i realized that some of the information that i just don't even realize and know is information they don't have
i never thought i guess that is something you need to know
they start farming on available land like the median strips on freeways because no one's using it
then someone comes along and says you can't do that
they have no idea why not some of them
the ones that have been here longer and have been in understand now
when they initially come over
they're being put in the middle of the city
they're nomadic farmers
these are people who've never seen flat ground before and people who've never seen property rights before these people who've never seen any machines other than those used in war
they have
i do have a lot of sympathy for them
i feel that america could try a little bit harder to help people adjusting to the american way
if they don't you're going to produce an underclass
many of them ended up just working the same jobs they were as slaves then
there was no
real upward movement
not being
what did you do when you helped these people
what did you do
i wasn't helping them
i'm a linguist
i was trying to learn their language a little bit
i actually helped them in the sense that they received money for working with me
i wasn't a social worker or anything like that
by explaining to people how the language
all the models of teaching english are based on teaching english to spanish speakers or to other european language speakers
people don't realize how different some of the languages they speak are
i'm an e s l teacher
you are
they did not teach us very many things about how really to go about helping people to learn another language
that's been my impression
it's like people don't know what they say
they're not withholding information
they haven't the foggiest idea
i enjoy it
spanish is
i'm applying for
spanish is a lot like english
None
i love it
i love the culture the way that they respect education and their teachers their parents so much more than than my children do
i like it
what i've been thinking about doing is volunteering for this asian center that a doctor falk has started that works with the school district
and trying to get them set up inculturated
i'm sure it would
i've applied at another district where many of the children are asian
i think that would be wonderful too
you'd be helping people i'm sure
not to trivialize the problems of any immigrant group but i do know the asian groups are having a lot of trouble
part of the problem is that a lot of chinese and japanese immigration from decades ago has been very successful because they valued education and so forth
a lot of people coming over from vietnam right now coming from worn torn countries are not having the same success
i think some people have just assumed why can't you be successful
it's really much more complicated
the times were different too
the times are different
my neighbor is jewish
he's going through the jewish league or something
he spends
right now he's down to once a week
he was going over there several times a week to be with the family
he thoroughly enjoyed it
i think it's a wonderful thing to do
there's a lot more
i guess another possible solution is since taxpayers aren't going to start paying more money for this other budgets aren't going to be cut to pay for it
everyone gains from it
if it's
what's so sad about this is both of the man and the woman had a degree having to do with computers
because they're so deficient in english they haven't been able to get jobs
they'll have to go back and get a degree here almost start all over
i've known people with effectively worthless degrees in this country
they're highly educated people
of course if you're educated and you don't speak english no one thinks anything of you
this woman was stocking the shelves in a drugstore
it's been good talking with you
thank you
i just pressed my
i got one that's interesting not too controversial
not
i do get somewhat of a kick out of
that's kind of an interesting recent thing that i could think of recently that
i was wondering what you thought about that getting a general into politics
i've been thinking about it
i kind of get a kick out of they always want the hero
time magazine was saying that in essence
they said in general generals are more familiar with training that they believe in training more
they really were very positive on a general's staff person having a very much better education than the average corporate president
i thought maybe
i think they probably have a better education than the average congressman
that too
they talk about the army
why did we win and all that
they talked about how the training was so important
they're liable to be right that generals in the service
schwartzkopf might make a good politician whether it be governor or whatever
we know he's a good leader
the question is can he be the man who's ultimately responsible
like what he said is a lot of times in his interviews he was talking about people asking why are you doing this why are you doing that
it's interesting how they say that when they're usually the top dogs
schwartzkopf was ordered to get iraq out of kuwait
he went to the president and said here's how i want to do it
he wasn't the one that decided iraq needed to get out of kuwait
you pick one
i just thought of that one when they brought up about politics
that was pretty easy you don't have to pick democratic or republican
the thing that i'm
i have an easy answer for that is that limit it to eight or ten years max
whether that's two five year terms or whatever
i don't really like it
you're not
i think if the president can prove that he's popular that he can do the job then the people should be allowed to elect him as often as they want
how many of these big campaign contributions that they're running on this year did they get just after they were elected two years ago
as soon as they get elected the people dump all kinds of money on them and say you're my friend
two years later he remembers that
what they done is they've bought this congressman for two years
i think there is a needed change
i'd lik-
my god it's ridiculous
that's what the financing rules and the the mailing rules and the size of the office staff and all that stuff
i think i had one of the subject about voting
i think that the voting rules need to be changed where you have a little more time
i vote as often on absentee as i can because it's so easy now
i think you could make it a couple
i think a lot more people could vote if they were somehow persuaded that it's something worth caring about
like the recent election about how the dallas city council should be made up that election last december
boy i live in arlington
i don't know if you like the mayor
i think your mayor
what is the woman's name whose not the mayor but the
they're just awful just awful
what get's me is this thing it went down to defeat last december by just a few hundred votes
if it had passed
there'd be no more argument
they're still fighting about it because of the way the election went last december
they don't even do that recommendation
it's amazing the money that they spend once they get in
this is supposedly to benefit the minorities
you're right there
all the minorities had to do was go out and get a couple more hundred people to vote they would have had their way
people are
politics
hopefully people will get more involved
my position is people who don't vote don't have any right to complain about the way the government's going
those are the ones that are complaining a lot
the guys that don't take any interest in and constantly on the negative of everything
you ask them why they don't vote
they say they don't want their name on the jury duty list
is that right
that's where they get the jury duty list is from the voter registration
i'm a democrat
at least i'd like to see compe-
i like competition
i can not believe it
they've got a pretty good lock on congress and a lot of local things
i still think in the last ten years
of course that's not a recent event
i guess on this speech thing
i haven't made any calls
i received about a dozen
i
i think i have to make these
i get distracted and get to do something else
all of a sudden my phone rings
and go what the heck we'll talk for a while
i am amazed by
i wonder why you need thirty renditions of the persons voice
i'm not in voice synthesis
i'd sure like to see a summary of it
we'll get to politics
i think we've used up as much time as we're supposed to anyway
that was three minutes ago
hey thanks for the call
i go visit a lot
their real estate up there is ridiculous absolutely ridiculous
i live in an apartment
my apartment is three fifteen a month
how big is it
it's a one bedroom
i prefer to live in a nice part of town because i feel safe here
i pay more to feel safe
what's included in that
just nothing no microwave
i have ceiling fan
it's real cute it's got a little vaulted ceiling and mirrored
it's wood
i used to live in waco
far north on lake shore where all those apartments are
we live in a house here
it's a three bedroom two bath
i don't know
we were talking about mortgage insurance today with my agent
it's about sixteen hundred square feet
we looked at a lot of houses that had more square footage
they didn't use it right
it was a bunch of empty hallway and stuff that cur-
we've used every bit of it
our house we bought it for sixty-four
the neighbors house next door to us sold for seventy-five
i think we got a good deal on it
that looks good when you all get ready to sell you'll probably do really well
my father used to live in dallas
he went back to new jersey
right now he lives in rhode island
he used to like to go
we used to go just every weekend just to look at houses for no reason we weren't buying one every weekend but just to look at them
i got a pretty good feel of what i want when i do get my house whenever that is
i completely lost my train of thought
we enjoy going looking at houses
we now
a fireplace
it was circular
the other side was the patio and the backyard
it had a built in grill
it was just the ultimate party room
that's pretty nice
that's what we had
and big closet space
i don't like to have a lot of things out just all over the place
that's what we went for first
we just have a big living room
a dining room is separate
some places have
the house next door to us that we looked at
to stick a wall between two rooms didn't do anything for us just so we could have a living room and a den
we opted for the just the whole wide room
my father had
he had the kitchen kind of a kitchen and a very long family room
what he did he put a bar right in the center
and put a glass rack down so you had wine glasses hanging from the ceiling and then the bar
it kind of separated it
it was still together
it just looked a lot better
i personally don't like the combination rooms
i think for where we are
i think we got a real good deal on it
we have a
the backyard is just huge
we really liked it
in middle of august it's kind of
it's nice
that was a big selling point too
i think another thing that was really nice was that our neighbors on the other side of us bought the lot right next to us
they've lived there and have it all built up
it's not like we're
kind of secluded
that's good
right up to our bathroom window or whatever it is
a lot of the little model homes that they throw up in three days
in fact we talked about that just a little bit
we were joking around about
steve said we'll i'll buy a bigger house
i said no i would just fix this one
i like where it is
i like how it's laid out
it took us forever to find it
when we found it we knew it
i'll probably move
i'll probably move to another apartment or something because i'm really
like here i'll be here for a year
i'll move off
i'm a news reporter
this is my first job
i won't be here very long
i'm not even looking to buy anything as permanent as house
i'm staying in an apartment
i'm not married or anything
that's one thing is once you get into a house it's like you get more stuff
to put it all back into an apartment would just never work
it actually fit
it was just unreal
i'm amazed at how much stuff i've accumulated in my apartment
i could take all my stuff home because i didn't have a bed or a couch or any of that
now i could not move back home
i just realized this the other day
it was just a weird transition out of home
i have to move in apartments just because i have so much stuff
three fifteen over there's probably not real real bad
for waco
for gosh as many apartments and condo's are over there
my goodness
it's just
especially around lake shore area that area's picked up quite a bit since we were there
there are tons of apartments down here
i had lived in the
they were lake shore apartments that are right next to the m c c baseball field
i think they're called lake shore villa or something
it's a nursing
there's an apartment
there's another apartment
we lived in those third ones
they we moved in when they were brand new
None
we drive by now and think gosh
look how much it's changed
every now and then
it's not really
now that it's sixty-five it doesn't take hardly anytime to get there run to the mall or run to sam's or whatever
we used to run to red lobster
now they've got one in killeen
that's about how things are
seems like the market here's picking up
just for the fact that the
it seemed like as soon as we bought this house we saw all these houses for sale
i think now a lot of them are selling
a lot of sellers are getting close to what they want instead of just having to give it away
waco to me seems like it's pretty steady
i'm not a real estate person or anything
it's a real college town
you have these apartments
most of the houses are pretty nice
i don't really see a lot on sale or anything
people are pretty stable here
i kind of see this as kind of a retirement community as i always call it
i see that a lot too there
it's nice too
i don't think i could live here much longer
okay it was very nice talking to you
what kind of car
are you in the market to buy a car
i'm real close to being in the market to buy a car
i've got a couple older cars
they're both over ten years old they've served me well
i kind of would like to get a more gas efficient car and a newer model something looks a little nicer
i've got three children at home two fourteen year olds and a twelve year old
i need to make sure i've got one that i can fit
if you know anything about teenagers it's kind of hard to get them to sit together for any amount of time
i seem to remember when i was young that was a problem
i've kind of been leaning towards a caravan
now i know that they've gotten quite pricey in the last couple of years
i like the dodge products
couple times i've had a opportunity to rent one i've been really pleased with its performance and with the size
because if you get the seven passenger version
i think that would serve us well
it's got good storage capacity in it for taking things along
they have the commercial on tv where you can pull some seats out
you can move around
is that the dodge caravan
you can take the
usually there's a double seat behind the front buckets
if you get the
there's a three person seat that goes in the back
you can take the three seat out and just use the two seat
you can take the two seat and move the two seat to the back
it's very versatile
the one that
i can't remember it's the toyota or one of the other ones
i don't know if it's one of the americans or the import ones where they actually have some bucket seats in the back
you can actually pull them out
they're really easy to pull out
you can move them around and stuff
it
to me that would be real good for us
my husband and i like to go camping and stuff
right now we have a van which is
we're thinking about buying another sedan probably next year
since that's what my husband really wants right now
next year we'll probably buy a new car
we're looking at possibly the honda accord
that's kind of
as far as the interior it's got the luxury interior
it doesn't really have the luxury price tag that a lot of the other cars have which is one of the things that we were looking at
finding something that's fairly affordable but yet has all the nice luxury items that we want
i think that's getting to be kind of important now that the price is becoming the driving factor
you look at
once you realize how much money you've got to spend then you start looking around at what you can buy with it where before i think you looked at the car you wanted
you looked to see how well you could afford it
how you could afford it
i think it's going to be a lot easier now
i think it's going to be a lot easier to to be able to get a car now and finance it
i think banks are going to be a little bit more lenient
i know they're trying to do everything they can to end the recession
dropping the prime is probably one of the things
that is also effecting buying a new car
you got to kind of work that into your budget
that and that
of course if you buy a new car you're going to
two fourteen year olds will be fifteen on the fourth of july
are they twins
you're going to have twins have them on the bicentennial july fourth seventy-six
i've still got another full year and three months before they're going to be behind the wheel
america's safe for another fifteen m-
after that
they're small enough that a first time driver could handle it yet big enough that i feel safe that
i don't get that kind of feeling with the kind of car like you talked about the honda
the honda's have been very safe
in accidents more so that a lot of the american cars
matter of fact i just heard something today on the news about those
automatic seat belts that are attached to the door they're questioning the safety of those now saying that
they showed a simulation where there they had a dummy in the car
the door opened
the dummy actually fell out of the car
the car rolled out on top of him
they're saying they're not as safe as
they're really not as safe as they appear to be
i'm kind of concerned about that as far as the seat belts
i don't know if maryland has a seat belt law
they do have one in texas
you're required to wear them
there's the door belt
there's one
i don't know about ninety
probably fifty percent of the people that have those probably don't wear the lap portion of it
he has one in his car
you think i've got one portion of my seat belt on
if your door comes open it's not going to do you any good
that's a concern of mine as far as what i'll be looking at with buying a new car
i'm not really sure if i would want the seat belts attached to the door
behind the door
the supports
they'll give you a list of all the problems that the car's had in the past
you can look at the track record on
you usually notice a lot of problems at the beginning and then things kind of iron out
you get an idea on how well the next car's going to be
now as long as they aren't changing the model when the pontiac grand prix went from being a huge car to a small car they had a lot of problems
the le mans is like that too
we used to have a le mans when i was in high school
it was a big car
it was like the grand prix
in i think around nineteen eighty they changed the model
it went to half the size
it got chopped in half
it wasn't even the same car anymore
unless they're really changing the model chances are that it's probably going to have the fewer mistakes than it had the year before
everybody that i've talked to who's ever had a honda loves them
my husband had a honda
it was a lease car
he had to turn back in a year and a half ago
he had it for four years and never had a single problem with it
it was great
the only reason why we ended up not buying it was because we didn't feel at the time the residual was sixty-five hundred dollars
it was a four year old car with seventy thousand miles on it
we thought that was a little bit too much to pay for a four year old car
we ended up
just went ahead and just turned the keys back in and got out of the lease
some of the vans now have driver side air bags
when i was much younger than i am now i had wanted to go to the peace corps
it seems like it was something that i really wanted to do
i don't believe they accept you after you're married
you have kids and all that
i got into
i wasn't able to participate
they will accept you later in life also
they will
i didn't know that
there was a retired plumber that went to uruguay i think and helped them quite a bit with concepts in plumbing providing for better public hygiene
do you think that people should be required to give a couple years for the good of the country
there are a lot of people who would like to do it
there are a lot of people who get into other things
they get all involved
they just don't want to or don't have the time
i understand
if it were told to us that we would find the time somewhere between our seventeenth and twenty-sixth birthday to give a year or two to the to the country in the form of maybe building better roads or the parks service or the peace corps or the military service or something wouldn't we have maybe a better class of americans
i don't see how that can make a better class of americans to make it mandatory for everybody to participate
a lot of our
yuppies now are interested in one thing and one thing only
i don't think that
at least if you legislated
giving for a couple years of their lives or honestly purely giving but some sort of equitable exchange then at least the country would have gotten two years from them where they would have given something to the country instead of taking away all their lives
are you suggesting then that if i have to go and do something for the country for two years that the country will compensate me in some way
i will be compensated for this
give them your entire life for two years
i'm sure that the peace corps doesn't pay well
it does pay
currently in our country especially in some regions there's an employment problem
that's true
even in our region there's an employment problem
there's a lot of people gotten laid off lately from just companies like general dynamics and texas instruments
in another time we had the w p a
i'm not familiar with that
that gave people pay that was halfway between relief which was welfare
that was some program where people gave their time
in trade for money
and living
here in colorado you'll find a great many things
public roads that were worked on by the w p a dams that were built by the w p a
scenic overlooks parks
our road system's falling apart
our national road system of highways
then i guess there are a lot of things that people could do to contribute to the good of the country
there's a lot of work to be done
i really don't see anything wrong with it
i can't see the problem in it for a year
what i'm saying is that if it were mandatory
would not give a year but trade a year
at least one not more than three or four then it would definitely effect unemployment
i wonder if they didn't make it mandatory if they would actually get enough people volunteering to do it that they would have enough
i'd probably
texas new mexico colorado huge numbers of other western states have no real welfare system
there's no real welfare system
if we took these people off the streets for a year there would darn sure be more hours labor available in the nation for everyone else
who knows maybe some of our graduating high school seniors would find out a little bit more of what the traditional american work ethic means
we have had some problem with that in recent years
yes
with recent generations i know exactly what you are talking about
i know several people who do not wish to work
they wish only for the paycheck
they decide that they're going to get the money anyway they can
without without working in the traditional american job market
one other thing
they get the money anyway they can
maybe if we instilled the work ethic
i enjoy working
we have not in some years now
i think we are going to try to have one this summer
that will be fun if you have not done it in a while
where is your family from
you are going to have to go there
that will be where it is
if she gets it planned
i do not know what she has been doing
they are all getting very very old
we need to see them soon
my grandmother just passed away this last year
None
i think as we get older it is more difficult to when
it is
i will probably have to take charge and do it one of these days
it takes a lot of effort to either get everybody called or written and settle on a date that
if they are
we just did it by word of mouth
my uncle in louisiana he is the only one that had to travel
now i have got a sister in germany
my gosh
it is going to be hard this time
we have got a huge family
we need to have more and more of them
i think i hope that is not a lost art people getting together as they do spread out all over the world
it is so fun
my mother has got thirteen brothers and sisters
i see
every one of them have five or six kids most of them
that makes a big crowd
we had two baseball bleachers full of people
there are still about eight or ten people taking pictures
it was just
we need to have another one
i hope my aunt is successful as later
it is probably not going to be done because i have not heard from them
it was supposed to be this june
i do not imagine there is anything coming
we have always had ours in a park or something
it has away been the same park
there is nothing really special there
it is open
we have it usually at this one park because there is a pavilion there in case it rains
you have to have it fairly early in the summer or it is too hot up there
it is not
it is just very humid
the old people cannot take it anymore
that was part of the problem with the ones we have
the kids would sneak off
we were just being kids
we found what we thought was just an old water hole
we was going swimming
like i said we was just big kids
we was eight and ten years old
our parents came and caught us
that keeps you busy
if we could have gotten it by a lake or something i thought that would have been much better
it would have been something for the young people to do
there was a baby pool
i love it all the different foods because that
i do too
grand
how long did you say it has been since you all had one
i think it has been three or four years or five even since they have tried to get everybody together
we really need to no matter what kind of crowd they get
i have been married almost five
i guess it has been seven years since we have had one
since then we have lost just our grandmother
time flies so fast
it may have been that long since we have one
i think it has been about four or five years
i hope both our families get to have one soon
if i can ever get down to kentucky
it has been four years since i have been home
i know when we had our
i won't do it with the babies
i have got a four month old and a four year old
i am just starting
i just quit too
i am telling you
that is
i won't be adding any more to the family reunion
i know it takes a lot of effort right with two little ones like that
i am not too upset
i have enjoyed talking to you
let's see
i like to go out to eat
being from dallas i think we have an average of six or seven restaurants that open and close every month
we have a really high turn over rate
there are streets just called restaurant rows
you can get everything here from a very spicy indian meal to the favorite barbecue and just anything your little hearts desires around here
here they have to entertain us to make us come back
i guess it's all one big game because you just never run out of places to go
a good turn over would be sort of nice
we go to an older part of town
we just notice how many
gee there they've changed
we've got to go try that one
it's really
you have the pick of the crop here
are they big into ambiance down there
is it more like
texas to me makes
you can get that too
they've got everything here from the french room which is ultra ultra to dean ferrings restaurant which is the mansion on turtle creek
we've got beautiful places to go
you can get as dressed up or just going to the local barbecue and just doing take out
None
we're always searching around for chinese
now of course they've added the taiwanese
any part of the country you want to hit they have got it
vietnamese restaurant we went to last week it's great
it's good stuff
it's very very mixed
i think if you like food like we do
i don't know if that happened before or after we moved here
you get a great variety of things here
if you were going to a restaurant where would you go
we have a lot of favorites here in northern virginia
of course we've got d c to call on
there's all sorts of things down there
one thing about d c is that there are a lot of traditional restaurants where the guy used to be the cook for the capitol
he stays in the same restaurant for twenty years
he's got a big clientele
there are some hang outs where you can go if you want to see people
it's sort of like hollywood in a way because there's favorite haunts for southerners and things like that
we don't hang around with them because usually it's ninety dollars a plate or something silly like that
my wife has a friend that runs one of the restaurants down there
we've been down there and had french cuisine
i don't know
i don't particularly care for that sort of thing just the type of food just because i do like getting a meal
most french food always leaves me hungry for some reason
i don't know what they say about chinese
i'm always hungry after a french meal
the atmosphere is just wonderful
you do feel like you've gone out and done something
as out here you might have enjoyed the meal and go away feeling satisfied it's not so much an event out in the suburbs when you go to a local restaurant
they're starting to get a little bit different
they're realizing that more of the people with the money are coming out and living in the suburbs getting away from the city
there are a couple jazz houses that have jazz bands playing while you're eating and stuff like that
there you go
we're sort of in the middle of the extension of the cajun country too we have a lot of ambiance provided by the bands and like you said jazz bands and things like that
you eat your crawfish and jambalaya and stuff
i really don't like that stuff
my husband does
they cook for a bunch of people
it's really
when we do go out we really want to be wowed by the presentation so to speak
there are little places
like i said some of our very favorites are the chinese restaurants
we do a lot of take out because everybody's so busy running around
it's the fastest thing to do
we sort of enjoy both parts because
we have two very special places in northern virginia that people go to
one's called captain pell's which is a crab house
being so close to maryland
maryland is a big place for crabs with the bay pretty much taking over most of maryland
captain pell's is a place with the big huge wooden tables inside
people just go in there and just pig out and everything
the other place is called the vienna inn which is
that place is known for the rudest waitresses in the country are at the vienna inn
people go there to be abused
you go in there to be abused by the waitresses and the bartenders and stuff
that's a talent
people come all over the country amazed at the abuse they were seized
it's on the honor system
you tell them what you've eaten and what you drank or whatever
they figure out the bill for you
you're lucky if you get change
usually they take your change and throw you a couple of mints in your hand and say thanks
they
they say you need mints
here guy you don't get any change
that's funny
we just went to an italian restaurant this
just wonderful
they
i've never been to italy
it's just this big beautiful italian restaurant
very low key in terms of the people are from california
they have their own adaptation of what italian is
it was a wonderful wonderful experience
you know they have women there going to southern methodist university and graduating in opera or something like that
they are all singing arias to you and just walking around the restaurant singing
they make the food right there so it's display cooking
they have wine casks all over the place so you're lined up waiting in line to this place
you just take a drink of wine
they don't count that really
you say you're going to buy a new car
i drove a nineteen seventy-seven b m w
i believe
i'll know the answer today
i'm not interested in having any car payments
i actually went last weekend with
we went and looked at used cars around town
i found a nineteen eighty-four regency ninety-eight with only forty-six thousand miles on it
that was pretty good condition
i also found a nineteen eighty volvo station wagon that was in just super condition
there's not a dent on the outside body
it has about eighty thousand miles on it
that's all right
i think it would last me probably another fifty or sixty thousand miles
i guess i'm kind of in limbo waiting to see what the insurance company is going to do to see whether or not i can get one of these cars
i understand that
we just paid off one
we're enjoying not having that payment every month
it's getting up in age
we're trying to hold out a little while longer
we've got a daughter who's almost two now
i guess when we do buy another car it'll be something that we can kind of grow into a little bit
it's tough on trips because
anytime we're getting ready to go anywhere it's like trying to put a puzzle together to make sure you get everything in the car cause it's
not only that needing the room we finally ended up buying a dodge caravan here about two and a half years ago
i have one that's now
she'll be four in september and then a little boy that's just turned two
it's like you go on a trip
you pull over to the side of the road throw them on the hood change a diaper and keep going
i wanted something that i could maybe walk through and get to them
i would like that in fact i've thought of that possibly getti-
i'd like to do that
i have a truck myself
i'll take
a truck's a thing that you need when you need it
None
the rest of the time you wonder could i use something else
i've still got a couple years payments on it
if we can hold out til then i may get to where i need a something else maybe buy a van because they are really really nice for long trips especially
i understand it is too expensive to have two car payments
that was the problem my b m w was paid for
my husband's been in business for himself for several years
he can depreciate cars
you hav-
when they did all the tax law changes you had to keep them five
i was trying to keep my b m w in tact for three more years
we'd trade my car in on a new car for his business
basically that's what i'm looking for in a used car something that's going to last me at least three years
if i can pull a deal on this volvo it will last me longer than that
i don't know how families afford two new car payments
it's outrageous
my wife's car is probably around five years old now
it's got
i guess it must have seventy or eighty thousand miles on it
it's getting
it's not in bad shape
she's kept it up real well
it's getting to the point where we really need to do something with it
i'm hoping we that we can work something out here
we've got other bills that kind of precede or preclude us
you can't afford a car payment now
it's almost getting to be like the house payment
could find something for seventy-five a hundred dollars a month
it was a decent car
you just almost can't find that payment anymore
i understand that it's kind of hard to go do
if you do look at them i really recommend the dodge caravan
it's the only minivan they make that's on a car chassis instead of a truck chassis so it doesn't
shake you around like a truck does
i didn't know that
we have had just wonderful luck with ours
we take it everywhere
my car was also a two door
which drove me nuts trying to get car seats and kids
into a back seat
it's wonderful to have the room and the space
you can haul things
they climb in easily
it's just been everything that we were hoping it would do for us
it is nice on long trips
you can take out the middle seat
they come out fairly easily so we took out the middle seat put the car seats in the back and just had a whole area in the middle like if we were out on open road
it was their nap time
i wouldn't do that if we were in a city or if there were a lot of cars around or anything
it made it so much easier to travel
that's our daughter's problem 'cause when you get out on the road like that it's just long stretches where they just have to sit
in town she does okay
even on the road she does all right for a little while because she'll sleep some
i-
she wakes up
she wants to get up
i know right before christmas we had driven over to shreveport
we were driving back
it was when all that bad weather was hitting
the roads were all closed
we were trying to get back
it took us a lot longer
she was pretty good most of the way
then get to a point where she just had to get out of her seat and we had to stop
we got out and played in the snow and put here back in her
she was fine
if there was something to where she could kind of get up and move around like you say on the highway or where where it wasn't as bad just for a little brief period of time it would be okay
i'm thinking maybe we
that would be good
i gue-
i appreciate talking to you
i hope everything works out
really i'm supposed to hear today
i hope it
i really would prefer the volvo i think
they're built of that unibody steel construction
it would take a hit fairly well
my b m w that my husband was going forty to forty-five miles an hour
it didn't even bend the frame
unfortunately they think if it says b m w on it that you have money
i have enjoyed thirtysomething in the past now that it has gone off
what are your
we sort of got hooked on la law
do you ever watch that
we try to catch that most nights
it was kind of interesting some people complained about the kind of whining or whatever on it
i really did not think it was
i think it had some good situations that it presented
the problems that michael and hope had in their marriage and stuff
i think a lot of people kind of felt that way
they had a lot of counseling groups that use some of the episodes as examples of things that were going on
that they called interaction between people and sort of to use as as a way of getting people to talk about their problems
our t v viewing has slowed down a little bit since
that tends to put a cramp in your viewing because by the time you get through
it's better to spend time with your kids than glued in front of the t v anyway
i don't think there's as many good things to watch as there used to be really
i can not
i don't think there were
there are not as many good shows that i continuously like to watch as much as i used to
i
i used to be able to name ten shows or so that i felt were worth my time to watch
i very seldom like to watch those
i like home improvement shows like bob vela's home again on saturday morning
i notice it's like this old house
it's on
instead of being on p b s it's on regular t v
it's kind of interesting because they renovate an old house
i like to watch that
if it's a team or something that i am really interested in i am not one to just watch a football game just to be watching it
i am not a big basketball or baseball fan unless it's baseball if it's a team i really like i may watch
it's so slow that you just get bored
i will switch between
i usually
if it's a football team i really like a college team or pro team
that's the
occasionally we will if we do not have anything to do or kind of bored and we just want to sit in the house or something
it's kind of like baseball
we went to the movies a lot on weekends and watch them at home because on friday and saturday nights there's nothing good on
i think that's
as t v
i think the less good shows being on t v has caused a lot of people to do that get more movies and watch
i know
we used to rent two or three movies on a weekend and try to watch
the development we moved into was
they have it on one si- right across the street from us
when they built our section did not put it in
they still do not have it
i am hoping that soon they will
they say that it's
every year they look at different areas and try to determine where the most houses will be
they look
when we reach a certain number of people in that area they will put
some in they will at
we had it for awhile
it just seemed like we never watched it
we did not have the movie channels
we just never watched any of them
it seemed like we did not watch even half an hour
we decided to just cancel it
i put in an antenna a really good antenna
it's really helped ours
it's not been too bad
there's certain things that i have that i want to see occasionally like a football game a college game or something that happens to be on cable
the
i have not been bothered by it too much
i can not
it was nice talking to you
we are to discuss air pollution and what we think the causes are
i probably would target
i think individually just by the vast number of people there are i think cars are also a major contributor to it
there's a lot of commercial vehicles out there
especially the big rigs like the busses and
eighteen wheelers and so forth
i think one of them would probably generate enough for three cars
that's not
i think it can be resolved if they really let go with
the technology that they have at their hand
they haven't released it yet
i think there's a lot of hold back because
of priorities that they have
it's
i have five in the kitchen at the moment
they keep turning the tape recorder up besides
do you watch children
do you
i have two that i'm tending for the summer
that's interesting
is there anything
i think another
you can tell when you go around cities you can smell specific things
i grew up in
i know in michigan the way they used to take care of the trash is they would incinerate it
the fumes from the incineration was a terrible pollutant to the air
of course now
people think you burn it it's gone
it's not gone
when they
you bury it
it's not gone either because it has untold ramifications
it gets into people
which is the most important resource that we have is people
they're destroying us
i think the cockroach will evolve safely
i'm really glad to see that there's more of that happening
there's not enough
we need expert cooperation
it's a
at least they're starting
at least they're moving that direction
education of the people is primary i would think
we're hard to teach
it's probably going to be a generation or two before it's really going
the children are being taught in the schools it'll be on down the road this is going to be passed on which is good
of course we would like to see it accelerated because of the critical nature of it
the learning of it and the
just to think that way we have to be in that thought pattern and able to motivate ourselves to do what is right for the atmosphere
i think we're all contributors
every human being that lives is a contributor
education is a big thing
as we educate them individually what they can do
i think that they'll work towards solving those problems more too
hopefully it can be resolved within a shorter time frame than we have seen it done in the past
that the time frame for cleaning up our air and our
None
i'll turn it up in a minute when i'm done
get that through to the people and get us educated
i think science has come a long way to making it so that it's possible to find ways to solve the problem
i don't know if they offer classes in the grade school
subjecting
would that be perhaps
i think they're kind of getting it in all different grades
are they starting though with the children that are so
they can really
relate to that
they're hearing somewhat about it
if you go in the entrance they've got stands usually where they have kind of a little newspaper thing that the kids can read
i see
they can form
that's wonderful
i'm sure that perhaps they're the leaders
others will pick up on their example and carry it further
thoughts are
i know it's a hard problem to solve because mcdonald's has changed back and forth between paper and foam and that kind of thing
they do all these studies on which ones pollute more
there's the paper and plastic bag question
i guess we're supposed to talk about music
let me go ahead and push one here
i sing
do you sing in a choir or a choral group
not right now
have you been singing a long time
have you studied
i've had some classical vocal training
did you do that in texas or somewhere else
in germany
that's wonderful
i likewise sang in high school and in college in choirs
i didn't sing in a choral group until after i was married
i sang in a couple of community choirs and then
now for about the last eight years i've sung in a church choir here
i enjoy
are you a soprano alto or
what kind of music do you like to sing
you were saying you had classical training
i've been listening to some advertisements for madam butterfly
i'm wondering if you have ever done anything like that
if you had done madam butterfly
that's puccini i think
madam butterfly was
i went to see that
None
you don't play an instrument
have you ever wanted to guitar or piano or
i think it would be nice if i played the piano
i think that's always a good instrument for anybody who sings or does some other kind of instrument
i played piano i guess from the time i was five until i graduated from college
i was a piano teacher for a while while my husband was in graduate school
that was the instrument both of my children started on
neither of them stayed with it
one of them turned into a violist
the other one the boy is guitar and percussion
the
i think that the piano background is very useful
i'm sure that for you it would have been great to be able to accompany yourself
i like to listen to all different kinds of music
i used to work with a fellow who had
although this was a computer company he had his p h d in musical i guess it was in composition from university of north texas
when i would go into his office every now and then you never knew what kind of music he'd be playing on the radio
it might be rock it was just he said that just about what you said that he just liked all kinds of music
that was neat for me to hear that somebody is
there's some of the really totally country stuff i don't really particularly like
do you have any plans to do anything with your music in the near future
i wish i could i don't really know how to go about it without having a degree
i do know that some communities have
community choruses
that's often a good way to get back into it again
it's not terribly demanding
that probably wouldn't be a problem
you get to know people socially as well as in a musical setting
that's always fun
i think that's one reason why i have enjoyed my choir so much is that not only do we sing wonderful music
we've gotten to know each other quite well on a social level
i think we sing better because of that
None
i think we sing more like people who trust each other
whereabouts in
i'm in flower mound
i'm in plano
we're just not too far apart
it was funny
it's
i talk to people all over texas
i'm always asking where in the state the person is from if they're in texas
do you have a family
i'm married
i was wondering if your spouse
if you had other musical people in your family
if you have other people in your family who are also musical
a little bit
were your parents that musical
that often is the case
the
sometimes it will skip
his mother is very musical
his children are very musical
i'm not sure how long we've talked
i haven't been paying attention to the clock
i'll bet we've done at least five minutes
maybe we'll talk again
now we're supposed to talk about music
why did you check music
i know a little bit about music
i thought that i would put that
i like to listen to music
i really enjoy the oldies
like what kind of oldies
i think it's a fifties sixties and seventies station that i listen to
when i listen to music most of the time that's what i listen to
i don't know a lot of the musicians' names or the singers' names
i know a lot of the old songs
we just got a disk the other day that was a disk of nat king cole's greatest hits it is excellent
it's about twenty of his greatest hits on it
we were really quite pleased with it
do you listen
have you heard of nat king cole
None
i played the accordion for seven years i played the clarinet for seven years also
at the same time or
in fourth grade i started the clarinet
i played that all through high school
you're in the marching band and stuff in high school
i played the baritone horn in high school band and in college
my wife played flute in high school
in concert band i played the bass clarinet
that's exactly the same thing my ex-wife did
she played bass clarinet during concert band
i asked him if i could play it because i was first clarinet
they end up playing a lot of the high notes
i don't care for the sound of the high notes
i asked him if i could play the bass clarinet
he said sure
i played it
i really enjoyed it
i like it
i like the low instruments better too
do you go to listen to much live music
we're going to one here in a couple of weeks
i don't know if you follow broadway much
michael crawford was in phantom of the opera on broadway
you know whom i'm talking about
he's coming to dallas on the twenty-ninth
we got a big group going down to hear him sing a bunch of andrew lloyd webber's music
that'll be good
my older son is at columbia in new york city
he's been to see phantom and les miserables and bunch of other things up there
he does it
my gosh
one of the
chris didn't want to go
the friend david went
he went and bought one of the low priced student tickets
they gave him the seat that normally belongs to john bel john
he said it was a great seat
they've been to see it several times
i would love to go see that and cats chorus line i would love to be able to go see those
don't any of those ever come to pittsburgh
i work
i go to college
i really didn't have the chance or the money to go see them
we're kind of
i saw two road shows of les mis-
they were both excellent
if it comes to pittsburgh in the road shows and i think they have three different companies that tour the u s you should go see it because it's really outstanding
he went to new york
there was twenty students from high school that went
he went to new york with them
he saw it
he said it was the best thing he'd ever seen he doesn't even like that type of stuff
i think it's just incredible
those two guys who wrote les mis wrote a new show call miss saigon
my son and his friend were in a lottery to get tickets to it
they got tickets for the opening night
they went to it
they said it was great
i like that type of stuff
my fiancee doesn't really like it
i guess i don't know either
my younger son listens to some of that kind of stuff
i don't know
really weird names the dead milkman
i don't know
it's really weird stuff he likes
i thought my gosh
he listens to new wave
you listen to the oldies
that's good though
i'll listen to anything basically except i don't like the real hard metal rock
i like some country
now we don't listen to much country
we just
i've never listened
i've probably heard him
i've never bought any of his music
my wife bought an album of hank williams' greatest hits
hank williams junior
these are a bunch of old recordings
those should be good albums
it's a little too country for me
it's a little too ronky tonk or something
i like the garth brooks album a lot
i don't know
he's really country himself i really enjoy listening to his music
which of his albums do you think is the best
i don't know
if i were you i would get the greatest hits album if he had one because that would have a mixture of all his top songs on it
we have four records of his
i can't name the names of them off hand we have all his records so far
all my brothers and sisters listen to them even the ones that like the heavy metal they really enjoy listening to him
maybe if you did like hank williams and garth maybe you would enjoy randy travis
i think we'll probably get one of his albums because we do kind of like it
it's kind of different
it's good
do you know any
i was going to say do you know any other country singers that you would the women do you like the
only my grandmother but for a very short time
she was just more or less in a nursing home for recovery from a broken hip because she could receive more medical attention
that
i think in visiting her there it was very obvious to see that a lot of the people in the nursing home that she was in weren't there mentally
she was probably the only person in the whole nursing home
that was very disheartening
what do you think can be done about that
what can we do
i come from a family of take care of your elders i guess
my dad's mother is an invalid
she lives with my aunt and uncle
they care for her all around the clock
though she doesn't have to receive constant medical attention because of arthritis she's just unable to get out of bed
i guess there's that family commitment
i know that my mother is trying to let my grandmother stay in her house as long as she can
i can remembe-
we did not have to call on someone else
i feel
you tell me how you feel about
probably i think as long as the person's able to understand what's going on around them
i think my grandmother right now is still able to walk around
she's still able to do some things for herself though she gets meals on wheels which i think is a great thing because it saves people from having to prepare food for her because you worry a little bit about her leaving a stove on or whatever although she does most things very well it still makes a little bit easier for her
i worked with an agency in west texas it's where they really started this concept of meals on wheels i think it's such a valuable thing for our elderly
if they didn't have to go into a kitchen my mother expired just a little over a year ago
we had finally
she didn't want to live with either my sister or me we found a retirement center for her
it was beautiful
they didn't even have nursing care there
as long as mother was mobile and got her food
she was with people with whom she enjoyed
i think it's really funny
my one grandmother says that she wants to stay in her house for as long as possible
she's openly told people
she's eighty-nine
she said that she would really like to stay in her house as long as possible because it's her home
when the time comes and she can't do things
she has to be cared for whatever she would prefer to move into some type of community where she has her own apartment probably with a living space and a bedroom with maybe a kitchenette so that if she wants to fix herself something light she can do that
if she wants to go to a meal she can go down the hallway to a room where there's a cafeteria there's other people there
she can mix with them and talk with them and enjoy their company
i am finding it extremely hard to adjust to
mother had the little kitchenette she could do all these fine things that she just had a microwave had to pop her popcorn
when it came time for a full meal then mother was able to go with people and enjoy
i think so
i think that probably until the elderly are invalids i think that they should be able to interact with other people in an environment that they choose if the family can afford it
i know that my grandmother would like to stay in her house
my parents actually said that they may have to take their end sometime because my grandma she says who she wants to live with
she's pretty
number one i am one hundred percent for total gun control
i just have had my fill of what is going on with the crime rate
i really feel that we have to do something in order to
i agree something should be done
i don't believe there is any way of total control over weapons because crooks and people who are going to perform things that are not correct
that means they'll always have an advantage over us
they may even get worse because they know we have nothing to support myself
now i agree with a lot of the things you just said in your few moments because personally i used to be a great hunter
in the last few years i've said no way
matter of fact if i find a fly running around in the house i pick him up and carry him outdoors
i don't even hit him with a flyswatter
i've gotten over this business of wanting to go out and shooting and killing and that sort of thing
i think personally that we do need some weapons available to most of the people
most of the people really are honest and worthy of carrying on their lives properly
i'm sort of in line thinking in terms
there's nothing wrong with that
there's only one problem i have with the whole thing though is when they do it i think our biggest problem is the crooks and what have you are going to get weapons if the weapons are available
i think the biggest problem we have in this country is there are just entirely too many weapons available the types of the weapons
there is no
i'm against this automatic and semiautomatic stuff
there is no reason for it
when people say my god they're cutting into my civil liberties and all this i take a different stand that as long as they are available and they are so readily accessed out there then something is taken away from my civil liberties
maybe i'm a little bit strong when i said total gun control
that's really not what i meant
we need control
we've got to reduce the number of weapons that are out in the public
the people should be selected so that we know that they are all right and that they're not acquiring weapons for illicit use
that is not good
as a matter of fact there's a fellow out there working on my house right now who brought to me a target from a rifle that he pretty halfway designed
he put together the the bullets in it he was showing me that at a hundred yards he kept five shots within a quarter of an inch of each other at one hundred yards
from a technical point of view that is something that our military people need to know about
there are other interesting facets in guns and weapons
this is a bolt action rifle i think he has
he has done other things to the way the barrel sits in
he designed the bullets themselves
he has
just from a technical point of view that interests me not to kill anybody with it or anything with it but just the fact that a piece of mechanism like that could be made to be so accurate
you sound like you're into the technology of it which is
i agree
again my entire family they are all hunters they don't appreciate my stand
i really have no problem with sports hunters
None
i think something will happen
beverly what do you think about drug testing
i think in some professions it's essential things like pilots and things that involve the safety of other people particularly
we got a lot of mistakes here in the maryland baltimore area because of train conductors on drugs
also on just like i bet you within five days a dump truck where the driver was high on marijuana
my goodness
i guess he smoked marijuana for lunch and drove his truck up the back of two small cars in a tunnel that goes underneath a river that leads into the chesapeake bay it would
that tied up traffic for a long time
i i think if you're in a field
then who would test all truck drivers
that is a problem and every time before they get into a vehicle
yeah i think looking at athletes being drug tested i don't know
i think the random drug testing i don't know in my own mind if it has reduced the athletes from taking drugs because they're still being caught that make sense
i think
it may make a difference for some of them because they don't want to lose that lucrative career
in the long run i think it would be good
i think in the short run they think because so many of those tested have gotten away with it the test hasn't come down hard on anyone i don't know
uh-huh however here in dallas we had a player roy tarpley on the mavericks team he had been suspended a couple of times because of drug testing
he was on probation
they wouldn't have to pay him
the mavericks wanted to get rid of him
they couldn't afford to replace him and still pay his contract just recently he was missing from practice
whenever he missed like that usually he had some kind of problem
a mandatory drug test was done was positive
they were able to get rid of him and not have to pay his contract
in his case he lost his whole career
it's just been awful talk about a terrible role model
i think that that's a terrible thi-
it's really funny though
my goodness
i guess my dad was hit by a drunk driver who was also high when i was probably eighteen my senior year in high school though he's alive today and everything worked out fine it happened about two blocks from the high school
a friend came and got me
i was there
i could smell the dope
i could see the beer cans from the guy that hit him nothing ever happened
that's terrible
from that point on i became so anti drunk driving now i think people should be allowed to drink i think that's an adult responsibility whatever
i really
drugs have long lasting effects i guess when i younger i was probably a little more liberal on the subject
as soon as that happened
i guess when i was eighteen years old if you'd have asked me i'd have thought it was fine by the time i was nineteen my opinion had totally changed
for example we have some friends whose son was driving home from work was hit head on by a drunk driver the drunk and his wife in the car were killed
traction and all that terrible stuff
bobby missed his whole junior year of high school he went through surgery after surgery for a long time they didn't even know whether he'd be normal again
as far as his athletics he's lost all of that
he has been tutored
he'll catch up in school and everything
he's still not back where he was
you don't have the right to interfere in somebody else's life
i wouldn't even say ruin somebody's life
another thing that we saw here recently some of our high school kids were out goofing around in a park area that a train track ran through one boy who had been drinking decided for some stupid reason to try to play with the train
the train missed him
a metal thing sticking out hit him in the head he was in a coma for four months
eventually they think he will come back
you don't know that
he's lost
what kind of a house do you live in
i'm in a ranch
it was about sixteen hundred square feet when i bought it
it's about two thousand square feet now
it's one of those typical
it's probably built in the late fifties
it's not what you would find where you live
for the older ranch homes it's pretty typical i guess
our home is for our area it's probably one of the lower income homes out here
i shouldn't say all of them
most of them now are up in the millions of dollars
we have got about i'd say about twenty-four hundred
we've got five bedrooms
a bedroom for my mother
made a fourth bedroom out of our living room and then added what we call a sunroom to get the
that's great
when we added four hundred square feet to our house so that
this house is very comfortable
that's the thing i probably like the most about it
we've been real happy with it
they could probably come in and say this is not straight
this is under something
it doesn't give you trouble
is it a natural gas and
i sure wish they could build basements in homes in texas
i've heard a lot of people say that
we have an attic that we've just put plywood over the beams and things up in the attic
that
certainly not
in parts
you really couldn't use it for a room
you have a probably a more pitched roof than is typical around here
ours is pitched so shallow that you don't get much room in the attic
we've got
five bedrooms and two family t-
we have the family room kitchen and playroom at the rear of the house which has been really nice
in fact i really enjoy the playroom
you would think that would not be a real bonus to a house
of all the rooms in the house i'd say that was the one that's been really nice to have
probably our family room is the biggest
some people
families seem to migrate towards one room and carry on most of their activities there
we have one room that we never use
might as well not even heat and cool it
that's kind of the way our living room and dining room is
it is nice to have it because with our size of family it's nice to know that there's one that's always straight and clean if you have
you've been fairly happy with it
it doesn't seem that long
it is because we came to this area about the same time
we've been fifteen years in the house that we're living in
the principal feature i like about ours is that it's pier and beam
i've done a lot of electrical and plumbing and other work
that's interesting
that's because it's so old
my husband wouldn't do that anyway
that's his
i on the other hand
do a lot too much of it
i've gotten good at it which in a way is bad because then you start to take pleasure in it
that's great
we just kind of save everything for when his dad comes to visit
he does all the repairing
my dad is actually
i guess tonight's subject is to discuss current events and how we keep up on current events and if we're satisfied with the thinking about it some of the ways i try and keep up on current events is i enjoy reading the newspaper but quite often don't have time to read all of the newspaper
i enjoy watching some of the t v highlights and also some of the news periodicals weekly magazines
at work i also have management summary reports that give basically a lot of the current events
how about yourself
i'm like you
i like to read the paper
i basically don't do it every day
i usually watch either good morning america or the today show every morning while i'm
i usually watch the news either at early evening or at ten o'clock i get it from t v a lot
i read time magazine
that's one i read pretty regularly
you think that that's pretty adequate coverage
you get
the thing about it now that i've found is that we get such good coverage on t v or at least such attempted thoroughness of coverage by the time you get the time magazine
then you can just sort of have pictures to go along with it or something because i've thought lately there's nothing new in the time magazine
it's basically you've heard everything you might get a little more thorough account of something
really i don't know
i get most of mine from television i would say
i found out too that quite often if i see something on television that i want more in-depth understanding or want to know more about it that the newspaper or newsweek can give you a better and more thorough coverage of what i've heard on t v
i found out that also on t v that you can scan through a whole lot of different things on c n n
like you said the news shows that are happening
you can read some more about it if you want to
i found out though that
i feel that a lot of the stuff on t v and the newspapers is negative
there's an awful lot of negative news or bad news
it'd be refreshing once in a while to hear some good news
right i think there's an attempt to do that
i think people
i think we basically associate news with bad news or catastrophes or problems or crises
on t v i think they try to throw in good stuff
it doesn't sway the vote
i've heard an interesting comment also that with budget cuts and expenses the way they are that it's affected the news media whereas before they would be able to have a in-depth analysis or investigative reporting on certain topics and issues
that takes time
quite often it's a lot easier to listen to the police scanners or what they call ambulance chasing it's lot easy to go after and follow a fire department or a police officer and find out news from that as opposed to going out and finding good things
i don't know
i guess the economy is effecting also the news media we have to pay that price
i don't know
i think that nowadays with communications the way they are also that we can see global events happening as they occur all over the world like the
the war last winter was certainly a good example of that because we saw every single thing practically
twenty years ago thirty years ago we wouldn't have been able to have that privilege or luxury to view that
i remember just the things that are covered
that was just so phenomenal to see this stadium shake and the announcers grabbing
it's like that was just something because that was live and real like you said
of course one thing i think too is with tele-
any kind of recent painting you've done yourself
we remodeled a bathroom
which required completely repainting the bathroom
that's quite a chore
the other project we've done around here is we've remodeled all our closets which required quite a bit of painting
did you do that yourself
that's fun
we just recently had our boys' room
the paint has kind of faded and deteriorated
we decided to paint their room and put up wallpaper and border and so forth
looks quite good
it's a project that i did
None
what brought about the fading of the paint
i don't think it's sun exposure
boys will be boys
there were crayon marks on there
we had to scrub the crayon marks off of course try and get it clean
that's what we put back on there was a latex paint
they had bunk beds
one of the younger boys when he was younger about three years old got a nice marker and got up on the ceiling and decided to draw pictures
you scrub and you scrub
you can't it all off
that's one of the reasons why we painted
what kind of paint did you use on the ceiling
we used a flat latex paint in the bedroom as i understand that's one of the better type of paints to have because it's not so reflective and glassy colored
it turned out real real well
seems like we've done some remodeling of some rental houses that we have it appears as though that in the fifties or sixties when some of these houses were built they used a lot of semigloss type enamel for ceiling paints that was a little difficult to cover with today's paints
we had an occasion where we had to do some sealing of this type of paint before we could paint it
you had to prime it and cover over it
i like to use this sears the ten year guarantee or the fifteen year guarantee
the reason being is once i painted i don't want to have to go and do it another five or seven years later
we're quite satisfied with that occasionally you can watch for it and get it on sale
we do that
i read an article recently that you have to be very careful on the kind of paint you put on the ceiling in your bathroom because it does tend to peel or come off because of the high moisture content in your bathroom
it's a lot like wall paper
did you have any problems with that
the particular bathroom that we did is a half bath
we didn't have a problem with that
i've have never experienced that type of a problem with a latex paint
neither have i
you shouldn't have a problem with it
they're pretty well refined today a lot of the paints
sears is one of the better ones
i've used many a gallon of them myself
have you ever used an oil base paint
used oil base paints for trim around doors and on doors things like that
why do you use that
i'm kind of new at this
primarily because it seems to be a little more let's say not so much that
it seems to hold up a little bit better towards the nicks and dings as opposed to a latex type paint
it gives you a variance even though it's the same color
that's good
it's worked out pretty well for us
have you ever done any painting outside
quite a bit
recently this summer we painted a out building which is a shed that we have on the
on rutherford
it's corner of new york just west of mayfield
it's south and okay
i know the area
our kids probably never went to school together or anything
i've got one in college
i don't think under the way the system is right now it is
i think
even if people have good intentions i think
the ultimate power ultimately
it seems like maybe more of them come in with good intentions
it's just so enticing
a lot of corners being cut and the special deals available because they're in on the know
i just don't
you even see people on a small scale cheating when they have certain positions
little bitty positions in your own home town and they'll cheat somehow or bend the rules use their power
maybe it's just man's nature
here in oklahoma we had a few years ago a major corruption on our county commissioners there were several counties including the one i was in that lost every one of their county commissioners
my word
it was to the point of not just losing their job but going to jail
they were taking kickbacks
i think there was something like thirty or forty commissioners that ended up going to jail
we haven't had that big a scandal in arlington
we do have the people that work for the convention center were falsifying records
that person wasn't even anywhere near there
one of them had cancer and died
that's small scale
i don't know
i really don't know what could be done
i don't either to make it totally honest
i think there's always going to be some way somebody can cut a corner
however the things that have gone on in the last couple of years we can't afford too many of those the hud mess or the s and l
i think that reagan and bush were up to their necks in that iran contra thing
it kind of makes you feel bad that the top people in your country would be lying to you like that
i don't know
i'd like to believe that there is some way that our political people would really go there and look out for our interests
i think that's what upsets me worse than that they're getting a little on the side that
they stay there
it seems that when they get up there it's if i vote your way what it'll do for me rather
this would be for the best for the nation overall
i guess that's where they stay in
they always please the money people too
you think if it was longer terms then they would never have to try to please the people at home
it is a big problem
i think most people are kind of depressed and cynical about government now
i don't think that anyone has a lot of respect or faith in the government
there was a time where i remember when i was real young i just loved harry truman
i had
some of them seemed like kind of heroic people
jerry the topic was favorite t v shows and what kind are you interested in and do they differ from mine
okay
most of the commercial television these days i'm just a little bit sick of
in fact i don't watch hardly any television at all with my other activities
between my family and my church et cetera et cetera i hardly any time to sit down and watch the news
i do watch the discover channel and some on channel thirteen
do you
aside from that i pretty well turn it off
i'm sort of a
i'm sort of a movie buff
honestly i'm self-employed
a lot of times i will go out and take a lunch hour go to lunch from twelve to two go to a movie and just come back to my office
i do it
i'm pretty much of a junk movie watcher by myself
if i take my wife then we see something a little nicer
my kids are all sort of movie watchers
we've always gone to a lot of movies in our life
i would just as soon be doing something else
my wife's a school teacher
sometimes she doesn't get home until about seven o'clock
i'll come in five thirty or six
i'll turn on the tube set there and have my coffee or coke or whatever and a little t v
sometimes i set there all evening
it
sometimes if it's real good
there's been more than one evening that i've caught every animal show that evening on on the discover channel
because they're documentaries and they're
that's an interesting channel
you bet
in fact i'm glad that it's part of our basic cable package
i've just never spent any time watching it
i like my sports and everything
me too
i left at halftime started driving
they whooped up on them
they're in the playoffs
i'm not sure that the eagles are not
he's brought the pokes from a one and something team to playoffs in what three years now
as much as everyone used the word love tom landry i'm glad that jimmy johnson's there
it was the time for the passing of the guard
i think tom knew it
he earned his stripes
i wouldn't have blamed him one bit because yeah
nobody remembers him as a loser because he's far too much of a gentleman and a practicing christian to ever be thought of as anything but a winner
he is
he's a winner in anyone's book i hope he's a winner in his own book because that's the key there
he is because he has to like himself before he can like other people
i know he's being a little hardnosed about it
this ring of honor thing he needs to be there because he's earned it
he was the dallas cowboys
he won't do that yet
he will
i hope he makes up his mind to do it because he needs to be remembered
nobody's going to forget tom landry
he needs to be honored
i'd not a you betcha
i guess if length of time i'm in the state now is after you're here twenty years you're considered native
i feel like a native
let's see
did you
i haven't looked back yet either
we came down from new york state in seventy-four and never had any regrets at all
especially looking at some of the weather new york state has had look at the weather we have down here
i've got my last kid graduating from college this next december she's getting married the month before in november
i will be finished
we're finished with all but the last one and trying to get him through his technical school he's over halfway
i'm really not too concerned
i'm enjoying the chat
i enjoy my t v programs
this is a question that hit pretty close to home
his health was failing he was adamant about two things
we talked about some length
i respected his wishes
he stayed at home as long as he could
he died in a hospital
i think that my position is that you need to find one that you can really have confidence that they are taking care
i've thought about this more than once dealing with
all over thirty percent isn't it
in talking with some of my fellow students it looks as though nursing homes are not going to be the only option any more
it's difficult for many families especially in the case of alzheimer's and some of the more degenerative diseases to to have them at home because then the family becomes completely exactly
did you experience that with your father or not
at one stage we had care somewhat like what you're talking about
we had the visiting nurses program they sent somebody in
it was a nominal charge that it started out that the lady would come in i think three times a week and eventually got up to the point where they were coming by every day
they would try to
they would check him over to the basic checks
try to get him to talk and be motivated that's what we went through
up to a point things seemed to be working
i think he became discouraged they did not know how to take care of that
at that point i think it's mostly a psychological problem
yes
i think it's time that we decide to do something about it
one of the other subjects on the switchboard and this is one that i've been thinking applies here
this would be an excellent example of some place where the community could be more involved more than just leaving it only to professionals
there is a lot the community can do to or assist the lives of those who are keeping a loved one at home
in today's large metropolitan areas or even the rural areas now people are not quite as close as they once were
the mobility factor the factor that we're living longer and people are less trusting all these things tend to destroy this type of system
i agree with you
that's a good point
let's see
do you use them
we own one
its an emerson eighty eighty-six two low density floppy drives and no hard drive yet
it comes in mighty handy
there's a fair amount of programming getting done on it
the
right now we got a project going where we're trying to put all my wife's stray recipes on the disk
it came with a menus program
that doesn't
it basi-
both
mostly kind of a pain in the neck without a hard drive hopefully sometime this spring we'll be able to get one and get it configured
gosh it's worth your time to just upgrade
impoverished college student
we got a way out while to pay it off yet
that's sounds nice
it's fun
my job is e d p auditor
i'm into computers all the time
it treats me well
what are you studying in college computers
computer engineering technology which all i can understand is it's a slightly more hands on version of computer engineering
i've got a ways to go yet
so far most of what i've done is getting core classes out of the way
taken some electronics classes and one class with computer logic
the lab for that computer logic class was a lot of fun
we got to hook up a few counters and encoders
hardware stuff
i've not had a chance to work with it although my data structures teacher was telling us something about how fuzzy logic works as far as the concept behind it
how you'd implement that software wise or mechanically i don't know
it sounds like a very impressive piece of work
i've written a couple of programs for commercially it's a fun field
just regular
you have to take into account with any computer program all the type of things people can do to you to make your program crash or things you normally don't consider
messing up your files and things like that
you're going to be an computer engineer type
what the c e t program seems to be so far is just a broad based specialized from
you get a fair amount of programming
you get basic electronics courses that deal with not only the digital circuitry but power supplies and just the whole gambit but mostly towards computer electronics
the idea is that you can go in a variety of direction from c e t major
i have more with the hardware than i do with the software
so far i'm planning to go in the engineering direction
that's good
you got the topic right
where in dallas are you
you do recycling there
richardson they have a newspaper pick up once a week supposedly if it's not raining
they also have a couple of areas where you can take cans plastic and paper to dump them off there if you don't want to wait and have a pick up least of paper
they don't pick up the other items
i'm in the city of dallas
i know they do have a pilot program going on
it's not here
they're not picking up anything
we collect everything
we've got all these boxes in our garage for green glass and clear glass and plastic and everything
there's a couple places
there's a lot of places to take the plastic shopping bags like most of the grocery stores
there's a wal-mart nearby that takes almost everything
the library will take glass
we end up
as we go places
it's kind of disappointing
i would even be happy if they just had one place where you could do everything
it would still be more convenient than what we have now
she's not here anymore yeah
i'm north of addison actually
i'm really
sometimes we always keep our aluminum cans
a lot of times they take them over to one of these can banks
normally i collect three trash bags full i take them over to that can bank
it's more fun just to kind of like crunch the cans
you get something
again that's another stop it doesn't take plastic bags and all that sort of thing
i heard that it was going well in the pilot area wherever that is
hopefully they'll do it soon
that would be good because we have two trash pick ups a week where i grew up we only had one a week
that was certainly sufficient
if they just do
the alternate time would be recyclables
i'm disappointed sometimes they're not always consistent in picking up those papers
sometimes they come by
i could certainly have three bins out there for plastic and tin and paper whatever they were going to separate into and have them pick it up on one of the two days per week
do you have to sort the paper and take out the glossy pages and that sort of thing
do they take the whole thing
you're not supposed to have the coupons in there
you're not supposed to put magazines in there you can't take newspapers
now at work we have changed our recycling
not too long ago they finally decided if it's anything that's paper and tears you can throw it in there because at first they said
at first they said no telephone books
that's stupid
they said no newspapers
in my department everybody gets the wall street journal
there was a lot of paper coming out of our department that wasn't recyclable
i thought that was pretty good to expand upon it
they take cans now too
i don't want it with paper
in fact this past year we got all of our money for the christmas tree because we saved cans for the entire year
it worked out really well
we had the one person who used to take things to the dallas shelter
she used to collect from the whole department
she took them all down to that dallas shelter place
it's a charity for the benefit of this shelter
she used to collect them from everybody in the department
we would get it
i don't seem to have as much spare time as i used to
i guess i'll have to say my computer has probably taken the place of most of my hobbies
i sit and design cards i'm really into graphics
i sit and learn new programs
i play
i do this
i do that
did you have your own business
you do that just on the side or what
i'm starting a side business in desk top publishing it's just getting going
i'm teaching in the daytime
that's good
i guess
to high school kids it's alternative learning it's really a challenge
what hobbies do you have
i play trombone in the plano community band
i like to do a lot of bicycling when the weather allows and during summer when there's daylight savings time's when i get out and bike
i hope you all had as pretty a day today as we did
it wasn't too bad other than the cowboys didn't do so hot
now yes
just a crummy
the lions are pretty good a lot better team than the cowboys were today
i haven't played in a while but i do when i get time and it's pretty weather and it's summer i like to play golf
i play that about six times a year
every year i hang my bag up if i get that five or six
i swear that game off for another year
i always go back to it
i take spells
i'm kind of a compulsive obsessive person
when i start something i go into it a thousand percent i get burned out on it
i do some counted cross-stitch and some painting on shirts
you do lots of stuff
it doesn't seem like i get anything done
i guess i do
i like to bake
when i bake it's usually to take out for something
i come up there i'll have to stop by and try some of your baking
my business is machine tool sales
i have some
i cover texas and oklahoma
what i said that i wasn't being real facetious about that
how neat
i got customers in oklahoma city and tulsa and perry oklahoma and eda and all that way
you do quite a bit of traveling then
that doesn't leave a lot of time for hobbies
we have our band practice is on monday night
during the summer we have concerts every monday night in the park
we have some concerts during the year
various people in the communities want us to play for things
those are usually on the weekend
that isn't too bad
we got pretty good size band
if everyone did we'd probably have over a hundred
we only average about forty to fifty people usually
that's still a pretty good size band
we have a lot of
i don't pretend to be that good
there's a lot of people that are band directors at schools or have been
there some people that are actually music majors
they don't necessarily follow that any more
we have some extremely good talent in there
as a rule it sounds pretty decent
i have absolutely no musical ability whatsoever
i'm always very envious of people who do
i've always enjoyed it
i'm probably one of the few people that the
tell me about your ideas on this the u s government supporting health insurance and so forth
i think it's inevitable that we are going to see national health care
the reason is because the market place doesn't seem to have performed adequately the invisible hand that which adam smith wrote has provided some very good health care and much inadequate health care
in some cases the absence of health care has resulted from market place forces
i think it's inevitable
it is just a matter of time and mistakes
they're both inevitable
what is this going to do the insurance companies who are supporting this work now and hopefully are doing a good job
it's going to make it tough for them
it's going to be a difficult transition
i don't know how it's going to play out in terms of the particulars
i don't think that society will be willing to tolerate the current health care crisis for too long
our physical and mental and spiritual health it's really very costly
as a society
this is what's bothering me lee another question
do you think that there should be some control innovated such that the doctors are not allowed to charge ridiculously over priced things
matter of fact in some respects their life might depend on it
by the same token some of these charges they make for minor endeavors on the parts the doctors are really out of line
they're abusive of privileges
that is what is giving the local insurance companies hard times
you get something done
they want to charge twenty thousand dollars for it
this i think is one of the things that national health care of some sort of evolutionary process over the next ten or twenty or thirty years will address
i know this is addressed in canada
i have a good friend who is a physician practicing in canada
they made the transition
i think that the
for example the duplication of magnetic resonance imageries
i've had one myself
they're wonderful technology
cities have three or four more than they need or three or four times the number they need
i think that what the market place doesn't do because of the way the system has worked
it doesn't allocate resources oftenly because at least there has been a tendency to drive up the price of medical care primarily because the insurance companies could pass on the bills
it's begun to change all of that
the people paying the bills
i think the evolution will be interesting
hawaii has a system that is apparently working
it will be interesting to see how much more attention we pay to that
i believe that it will contribute to something that we would at this point call national health care whether it's subsidized by the government and operated by private insurers
we would be a lot better off if we contracted our national defense to a group who rather that operated as a government entity because we would probably have much less waste
that bothers me about the government
that's the problem with government administration of these programs
that is one of the things that we as society are going to have to deal with
that is really a tough one for me to answer
i would like to see the greatest improvement in management
my field is the cognitive sciences
i recognize that a lot of these things that are done
those operating systems have to change
as we become more efficient in developing machine operating systems we're going to develop more efficient human operating systems
a state or federal application could work
it all depends upon the way you structure the environment
in atlanta georgia you probably have a lot more crime than we have here in patterson california
this little city is only about eight thousand people
is crime a problem there
a major problem minor problem or
in patterson there's
i lived in oakland until just recently oakland california god they've had sixty-seven murders so far this year compared to forty at this time last year
it's really bad there
it's all related to drugs it seems like
i've only been here for
probably just over six months i started school here
we had a problem there
here there's just no comparison that much more crime
every night the news is very depressing because they run down the list of how many people were shot drive by shootings or whatever
it's pretty bad
they've actually taken steps to try to make it better
it still is a problem
i don't know what they can do to make it better unless they just hire more policemen
that seems to be what they were doing
they've stepped up more patrols in certain areas
it has made some places safer
it's very difficult
if you don't have an infinite amount of money to try to stop the problem although most people wish you could as it's definitely a problem
the less that's done about it the more it seems it tends to spread into smaller areas unfortunately
i think that if they would do something to these people that they do catch instead of just slapping their little hands maybe those other people would be kind of scared
they would not do these bad things
i think that it's seems to be that some people they do something
sentenced to jail for thirty years they're out in five
they're back on the street
they shoot someone else
just a cycle
it seems as though the system doesn't tend to stop them unless something is drastic is done
i just don't understand our laws here
like in other countries they're really a lot stricter than we are
it seems as though we try to play humanitarian i think a little to much
maybe some of the people don't deserve the humanitarian treatment that they get
i don't know
something has to be done because i definitely think it really reeks havoc with your quality of life when you can see it's going on around you
then when once it finally affects you then it really starts to bother you
it seems
people have moved out of the city because they want to get away from the crime
they tend to spread the cities farther and farther out
it's only a matter of time before it still catches up with them
you can't really run away from the problem something has to be done but just that too many people argue about how to fix it
i know when i lived in oakland it was just that i definitely wouldn't go into certain areas of the city by myself
then again some areas i wouldn't go by myself after dark
down here in patterson like i say it's so small that you can go anywhere
just twenty miles away in modesto they have those gangs and things over there
it's bad
in sacramento also they have drive by shootings it seems like all the time
i don't know
i just don't know what they can do
it's to bad because it's just even the random occurrences where it's unsafe for a woman just to walk from the car to the some in certain areas like from their car to the mall or something
it's dangerous
that's just ridiculous
that's just not right
something
like even going to the grocery store
i know we've had this one lady that was attacked
None
some of the times it's happening in the daytime too
it's not always happening at dark
i don't know
let me see
it seems like i get most of my news from television
we only get the paper on the weekends
i'm not much of a paper reader
None
i get most of my news from documentaries like forty-eight hours twenty twenty the news at night
i get a
in addition to that i get a local weekly
i live in suburb of milwaukee they have community newspapers around here so their extremely local
i get the sunday milwaukee journal because i don't have time to read a paper
mostly that's my difficulty
i get my news pretty much from the same sources as you do although i do listen to n p r
i'm not
i can run my radio in my office
i teach at the university
when i'm not teaching if i choose to have the radio on i can listen to that station
i see
are you satisfied with the twenty twenty and forty-eight hours and the things that you do watch
i pretty much am
i watch the news at least twice a day
if i've missed something and i've just recently decided to stay home with my children
that's different for me
i usually find out exactly when it happens and that kind of thing
is that the aspect of the news that you're most interested in is the timely noting of the events as they happen
it just seems like since i've recently stayed home that is what's happened
it's just that now that i've stayed home i'm usually aware of when these things occurred it happened
i myself the reason why i listen to n p r and the reason why i watch macneil lehrer
rather than the network news shows at night although i do watch a local ten o'clock in the evening news which carries over a lot of the national news stories is that quite often it seems to me
i feel that macneil lehrer get a little more deeply into some of the issues that are really current
perhaps newspapers do that
as i said i don't have time to sit down and read a newspaper
frankly when i have
there is some danger to that of course too
if the analysis is inaccurate or biased or whatever then how good is it
i like a little more indepth coverage
i think that's what maybe appealing to you too on something like twenty twenty or forty-eight hours
i'm more interested in trying to understand what's going on in the world rather than simply being aware there that an event has occurred
i like to stand back and get a slightly bigger picture
i try and catch most of those programs
if i miss them
it's pretty interesting
those evening shows are probably also at a time when you're at liberty to take some time off and be in front of the t v set for awhile without interruption
i find that i have to video tape quite a bit of things
you do
if i don't want any interruptions
it seems like ten o'clock at night
that's what it seems like ten o'clock at night
i was
i'm probably one that has to agree with it too
there a-
some things that go on that i just feel that
i just feel that
california we just put somebody to death for i think it was a double murder
to be honest i didn't pay that much attention to the details of it
it had a lot of controversy out here
basically because in california people like to protest about everything
i agree
i believe that there are a number of crimes that capital punishment is the best way to go
the big disagreement i have is that
that's ridiculous
if you can the trial is supposed to prove within a reasonable doubt that the person is guilty
they have appeals
that's fine
it shouldn't take more
i should think two or three years maximum you should be able to know
you should be able to either put the guy to death
he's innocent
if he's guilty for multiple murders or whatever the case may be
maybe that's something that needs to be worked on
i just feel that capital punishment needs to stay within the system
was that the man that claimed he was abused
he was like
that he had he
the the defense they're given was that his mother had been an alcoholic when she was pregnant with him
he wasn't mentally competent or anything else
the court found him competent
he knew what he was doing and everything else
it was the best defense they could come up with
how long had he been appealing
it was something really outrageous
it seems like it rarely does happen
it's not used that often at least here in texas
i think it's something that needs to stay
i think in general
it needs to be
you wait three months
you put his nose in it and spank him for it
there's no connection between the two
you take most of the people who are committing violent crimes most of them not all by any means
a large percentage are the kind of people who are living very much day to day in the first place
they don't really see past next week much less next year
to say if i kill somebody then a decade from now i might face the punishment
my sister and i were wondering about this recently because an old friend of ours in california
her husband just killed her
we're wondering if that has an effect
if something does capital punishment does it happen within that
you mean would he be put to death for that
generally from what i understand it's only the most
where it's multiple
if they can say things like he was just temporarily insane because of
some domestic squabble then they'll give him twenty years with parole in twelve or something like that
i have an uncle that is an attorney that defends people
i guess our topic today is air pollution
we are to just discuss what substances do you think that contribute most to air pollution as well as what society can do to improve the air quality of the atmosphere around us
does your work entitle anything of environmental along these lines
i'm in the legal department
we do have a group of attorneys who handle our environmental issues
i don't know too much about the air pollution thing
i do know for other types of pollution like the toxic waste and such that t i has to dispose of that we normally put in the ground we're coming up with a new solution
we just transport to these places
after awhile it always seems that the site starts to leak
you have to clean it up and such
the new idea is to take everything up to sherman
we're going have that incineration place up there and
supposedly that facility will not generate air pollutants from what i've heard that everything would be in confined kind of incinerator and just burn it all up
i'm sure we have to have permits for that place and that there's limits as to what we can let go into the air
it's hav-
i work in environmentals projects right now
the sherman deal
what we run into is we have the texas air control board t a c b that send out jurisdictions under which we have to reply to
a lot of their rules and regulation aren't real clear so we have our manager of environmental who assist the t a c b in writing
we are presently in receipt of a site permit which will allow us to
this is our side allow to have certain emissions up to a certain tonnage
it's in tons per year
what we do to make contributions so that basically we go and do things like put in high-tech scrubber systems that scrub out the n o x and v o c's and ammonia compounds like all the acids to a certain level
are very aware of the opacity which is the thickness of a stack emissions
if you don't see anything coming out of a stack the opacity is zero or twenty or thereabouts
what we go through is if you see it smoking there's a problem
having worked with some of the legal folks very closely it becomes a real issue especially when it's smoking
you have to get it fixed el pronto
as you know they're allowed to come on site the federaldes anytime they want drive through and see and inspect
it's a full time everybody has their home phone number type of job
you're still on the makings of it
the sherman facility we are still in the closer too but still have a little bit of finalization to do
it's been pitched to the sherman city council with
tom jones our corporate environmental guys handle the project
its going real well
i think it's just a matter of funds right now as i understand it
it's something else
they're in the same issue
the system is setup where it won't have any emissions
it will have something coming out of the stackhouse it was human nature
it won't have any bad stuff
i think t i of all the major semiconductor firms we probably put safety and environmental on the utmost foremost first thing we always look at
and we probably put more money into the systems engineering behind the system of any other firm i know of
it's an interesting job
i know from some of the sites that we've had quite a list of cites that have gone bad
you have to clean up
you know the law now is the super fund
anybody who's contributed toxic waste no matter if you were somebody that eventually damaged the ground or not
everybody has to contribute
it's been a lot of big bucks when we've gotten pulled into these super fund deals to clean it up and mega bucks to take everything out and redo it and fill in some other area
certainly it would to have a better solution the sherman facility than just letting it go in the ground
eventually it seems that no matter what they do if they put it in oil drums and then seal it in some kind of cement lined dump area
there was one site that they cleaned up
the new place leaked again
we have stuff that's very interesting
we have duckwork and all those type of interesting pieces of equipment where they have that we sample it may have over a certain emission levels
we take it
we can't deep well inject something like that because it's a solid
we mix it with concrete and potash per se and concrete and then actually put it in the ground but not in a hazardous waste location because it's basically a concrete slab
the cost of doing this is astronomical
we were very very cognizance of and aware of all these types of expenditures because it could get very expensive
i think we do all kinds of things to make the world a better place to live
you were
i hope you like your office
we used to be really embarrassed about the gray metal desk
place in t i that had the gray metal desk
people used to come and laugh and go i hadn't seen one of those ten fifteen years
i think what changed everything is y'all were the only ones that make any money for ti here in the last ten years
that's when you start paying your way jerry takes a different outlook towards you guys
in order to make the curried chicken i just fried the chicken
until it was nice and brown
you take it out of the fat
you let the chicken you fried kind of drain so that a lot of the oil comes out of it
you pour all of the oil out of the pan
you kind of clean it out
you put back maybe two tablespoons full of the oil and saute some bell peppers and onions in that little bit of oil
you mix flour and a cup of water maybe one tablespoon of flour and a cup of water
then you pour that in there to make the gravy
you let it come to a boil again
you let it simmer
you add about a tablespoon of what i'm using now is jamaican curry powder
it's going to be really good
these bell peppers and curry
if you like it really hot you can add some hot hot peppers and hot sauce and all that kind of stuff
that sounds really good
it will be in a little while
i'm trying to get it ready early
i was single until i was thirty
i did cook a little
i cook a little bit now
my wife normally says tom why don't you make a stir fry tonight
we just were recently married so we have a stir fry pan sort of like a big wok
we do a lot of stir fry vegetables
is it a real chinese wok
it's called a stir fry pan
it fits right on your burner whether it's gas or electric
it has a flatter bottom than a normal wok does
normally what we do is just like two tablespoons of oil maybe sesame oil some other type of oil than just regular vegetable oil
i will use peanut oil or things
we just stir fry broccoli and carrots and green peppers and maybe put in a little bit of garlic and ginger beforehand
that gives spicier flavor
after the stir fry is over just mix in a little bit of sometimes chicken broth
that sort of makes a glaze
that sticks to the vegetables
cause i guess i'm not
she likes to watch how much red meat and things
we'll do a lot of times vegetarian
it's a real good meal because you have squash and broccoli and carrots and celery and green peppers and mushrooms
it's a pretty big
we put that over rice
that sounds real good except the squash
you don't
she'd have squash and corn bread
maybe she'd have chicken or something
i'd just be
in fact i never had squash growing up
my wife ate more vegetable than i did growing up
i'm from pittsburgh
pittsburgh is a very meat and potato town
that sounds good
we were from north carolina
we had a garden
my mother would grow the squash
she'd grow white potatoes and onions and cabbage and collards and all kinds of
she had all of those types of vegetables
no vegetables in my family
i've heard stories
they put the head under a tin tub and chop the head off
you hear the chicken jumping around under the tub
finally it dies down
it
this is ter-
you shouldn't be talking about this while you're fixing dinner
my dad used to tell stories about the way they eat chickens
we lived in the suburbs
we bought everything in a grocery store
it was funny
when we got married a lot more vegetables a lot of changes
that's good
we just went shopping
we came back with sweets chocolate covered peanuts
we came back with sweets
i'm trying to learn how to cook deserts without all of the sweets maybe use honey or something
that's supposed to be the trend of the future
but the cut back
recently was over a friends house that's indian
she had brought indian sweets into the office
it was really funny because they were made from yogurt and carrots
i was like ugh
it's a candy
i'm like ugh
everything
everything was sort of hot
then after a couple of minutes you could taste it
it had that after taste that it was a very indian flavor
they were very yogurt and carrots and pistachio nuts and yogurt
it wasn't very good
i might have liked some of that
i like hot stuff
have we done our ten minutes
is it ten minutes
normally they just come in
they say you've overextended your conversation
this is my first one
you'll see it will come on
it'll say you've over extended your conversation you now have fifteen seconds to complete it
i've been cut off twice
i just thought
i'm hearing a siren outside i think my neighbors car must have got bumped
the neighbor has an alarm on a car
it's going off
i was going to go out and see what they were doing
thanks so much
you said this was your fi-
you'll get a couple more probably
i called yesterday or friday
maybe i talked to somebody that i got them on during the day
she was home with two kids
while we're talking the kids are screaming in the background that they wanted something
they were arguing back and forth
she just kept talking the whole time
thanks a lot
do you own a p c
you have one at work
now because
i'm doing my master's in computer science and computer engineering
i don't have one
i have to use them
especially during my undergrad
you use
your first couple of years you use personal computers because the software
it's easier for you to go to and run a program
through the disk
because the grader can do it at home
then as you go up higher in your senior level you're doing projects which are so big
you have to have so many people sharing the same data
that you can't use personal computers so you have to use a main frame
i know i do have a computer at home
it's one that the company has loaned me
that's been my situation is that that way i can get in access our computers that i have up here and do work from home
does it have a disk drive
the ones that we use are like unix base systems
they don't have a disk drive
you can't
you just do it that way
that's the only way that you can get through to the system
i have both because that's what i use all the time is unix systems versus the dos
then i teach dos classes at night
you also have to do all your grading on the p c
that's the really neat thing i teach in the continuing education classes so i don't have to have any grades no grade books so that's great
i find that i use the personal computer a lot though for my wordperfect
i think it's extremely helpful and very useful
for us it's like for doing resumes
uh-huh
we use for example a mackintosh which is a lot easier for graphics
than the i b m p c's or anything compatible with that
due to the fact that i haven't tested the p s two yet
uh-huh
i don't know if the software is as easily like you can manage it a lot easier than the old one
you know with the mouse you do it a hundred times faster
you also get
when you see it on the mackintosh with the one i have
that's the way it's going to print out
especially if you have a laser printer it's going to print out the same way as it's on the screen
with the i b m what would happen is since the software that i had was it was basically you only see part of the page
the whole page you never can actually see it
they have to zoom out and zoom in
it's like every time that you have to do something it's really a pain
also it's like for presentations
it's like if you have to do any statistical data it can be easily represented on a p c
it can be easily represented on a p c
years back when you didn't have that you would have to map out all these numbers
and get a graph which you weren't sure if it was okay or not
with a new system i can calculate everything so fast
like for spread sheets
i love all the windows that they have out now too
None
one window i had the program
the other one i had the program running
so if there was ever a mistake i could easily check
go back and forth
you always
the old ones you had to go out of your program load up the program again
run as long as it took
with windows you can have the program
it messed up in line fifty-four
you take a look at line fifty-four
you can see where it messed up because it's like in the old computers the ones that we're using here a couple of years ago you would always have to have a printout
i know i remember my college days
did you learn it in computer science
when was this
i graduated in eighty-six
it's been fairly recent
i know because all i know is that when i came here in eighty-seven
it was the last year to put all your punch cards in
dear
it was just sensational because i walked in
they go my god they're still using this
None
that's about it
the price of computers has gone down
they said that if the auto industry would have kept the same trend as the computer industry has ever since it started
they said that cars would cost two dollars
they would run forever
that would be great
it's like the joke with the yugo
it's like when your car runs out of gas just throw it away
that's the way it would be
it's like i think i'll buy a new car today
the price has really gone down
i b m which
an i b m p c in in nineteen eighty-one it would cost you five thousand dollars
now you can get it for one thousand dollars because of the parts basically
the two eighty-six too
they're not charging you over pricing
it because it's like if we sell it for less it's like we're losing money
i think they stopped producing the i b m p c
the p c junior was a total failure
they had
the only problem was that when they took that one out the small computer was the i b m p c
you couldn't
it's like sure bring out n- into the market something that's smaller when nobody uses anything that's smaller than this
over the past years it's like i b m has been producing
like the p c x t a t and the p s one p s two things
it's just that you have to always compete
mackintosh took a lot of the market from a lot of schools
of their
that's what they're trying to do
have a good lunch
we used to be big time campers
now we're not quite so much since the kids are involved so much in sports
we went twenty or thirty at a time
we took just our little tents
we did it that way
we did it that way
how neat
we've always enjoyed camping
i know i just have a tent
the kids and i like to go out and camp in the tent
i bought a van
that way i can sleep in the van and be more comfortable
when they go on vacation a lot of times they'll just sleep in the van
one night
the next night they'll stay at the motel or something like that
they enjoy it
i don't think i'm a real true trooper when it comes
i try
i try
to get out there and enjoy everything
what was so fun though is that i had to take my son to the doctor this morning because he went out camping with some friends
he got poison ivy
it's all over him
the poor thing
there's definitely hazards to going camping if you don't know what you're looking at
i enjoy it every once in a while
it's not something i'd want to do real often
have you done much camping around texas
not really because usually it's when we go off
for a couple weeks or so
have you camped all over the united states
now i haven't so that
it really is
i know my parents like to camp a lot
they've been going to gulf shores alabama
and which is really really neat
it's not real populated so they feel like they're in the outdoors and still close to the ocean
from what i understand from them it's really really pretty there
i just like to go
have you done much camping up in kentucky and those parts
we've been to wyoming and kentucky and montana and places like that
usually if we're with a group of people we really don't stay any one place very long
if we're just going through and they camp one night and then head on
now that we have children and we go every blue moon
that's my idea of camping
we're getting more into it
we've done quite a bit
the kids like to go out as often as they can
that's good
they're becoming enthusiasts then of camping
by the time we really get a chance to it's july
it's so hot
our camper doesn't have an air conditioner
we hadn't did that
that's really neat
they're in scouts and stuff like that
that's neat
how old is your children
i have a son that's going to be eleven here pretty soon
they're getting old enough to where they can help out with a campfire and
cooking and all that kind of stuff too
that's really neat
they really enjoy it too
i agree with you
this wasn't so fun this last time for nathan to get out there
he didn't realize he was touching poison ivy
it got all into his eye
it was really swollen
they had to give him shots and everything
or bushes whatever they are
i have brother-in-law and a sister that really just camp
they love to go camping
they would all the time they wanted
i'm just not that involved in it
now i like to go out several times a year
but not on the regular basis
in the season
i just couldn't do that
i haven't really as far as entertainment
i guess my entertainment's
i see they just want to get away
every friday night they'll go home straight from work
they'll pack up
they'll leave
i'm just going
by friday night i just want to crash
i want to go home and do all that
i don't either
and then get out on the road to boot
anyway that's their life
they probably live in a city also
we're in a real small county area
that makes a big difference
if we want to go camping we can just go just a few miles
it was nice talking with you
we'll probably be talking to you again
take care
do you have any credit cards
i have an american express and a visa card that i keep kind of for emergency purposes
i use a gasoline credit card which i pay off every month
i've gotten rid of all of the credit cards that i possibly could
my balances are practically zero on the ones that i have
especially since it's no longer after this year
after tax year nineteen ninety there's no deductions for credit card interest that you pay
it's a
credit cards run anywhere from up to eighteen nineteen percent i guess
course there are emergencies that you probably need to have a card
that's probably enough
i try not to use it
right now it's maxed out
it's very easy to do that or to abuse it
we're trying our best not to add any credit card debt to our structure here
i have
the thing that bothers me worse than the credit cards i think is you mentioned the gasoline credit card
i've got one of the instant teller cards that you can use for point of sale purchases
we use that usually to buy gasoline
it's really amazing how quickly that goes
i don't participate in that
a lot of folks do
at least with the
the instant thing may be the way of the future to replace checks and every other thing
that's what they've talked about it
it was
they consider it to be the same as cash cause it actually is
i understand it's becoming the popular thing to do
i don't really perceive doing it unless we absolutely have to
i have in times past gotten into a bit of trouble with credit cards
it's just too easy to do
i'm so glad he told me they got to such a point with their credit cards they didn't want to cut them up because they were afraid sometime they might actually need them
they stuck them in a thing of water and froze them
that's funny
that's a novel idea
there are times when you'd at least think you do anyway
i want to still have just one just in case
i'd sure want to get it paid down and not use it for a while
we're really not compulsive shoppers
we plan purchases pretty well watch for the best buys things like that
some people have a real problem with it
our limit is fairly low that's one thing that's good
i'm sorry
we lived
i was used to the heat
i was used to what couldn't grow
we had a small farm house out in castroville which is just to the west of san antonio we did a lot of gardening out there and mostly in raised beds so we could keep the soil nice because basically out there it was mostly a clay soil very hard to grow very hard to cultivate
when we came up here to california we're in the monterrey area
it's very nice sandy soil rich soil
the weather is perfect for growing just about anything you want to grow so we've been out here really in the house since december
we've been planting flowers that we could never plant
in san antonio because the heat would just dry them up after about three
we're at the edge of a forest area so there's a lot of pine mulch
it's been raining pretty much continually now off and on maybe one day of break for about a month
there is
now with all the rain everything is just gorgeous lush and green and beautiful
i hope that it holds out here after the summer
that has been the major change that we have noticed in gardening
that's about the extent of what we've done just a little bit on the patio and waiting for the rain to subside so we can
we finally got to mow this weekend
we're just so happy to see green
we just moved to our first home
we had lived in a condominium before
we didn't have any lawn and garden type duties
we're just learning the ropes here
when we moved in
our backyard has so many tall trees in it that there wasn't even a blade of grass in the backyard
we're talking to some of our friends that are landscapers and things and learning about different kinds of grass
it just seems so funny to me that when i grew up in missouri
you didn't have to worry about growing grass there
do you have to get a shade tolerant grass
we planted
it stayed pretty green throughout the winter
it's pretty goo-
it doesn't look like it can withstand too much
it's supposed to die off in august
you replant it in september
we don't
mostly we're not even to the point where we're getting into flowers
let's get grass so that the kids can play in the yard and not have to be worried about the dirt so much
when we
eventually especially when it was so bad last year i guess it was the year before now it was so hot that year
we were just watering all the time
when we left the back yard had some
primarily once the weeds
i don't know
you would spend so much money trying to keep a large lawn alive
we were sitting there wondering there must be a better way to landscape so that you don't have to spend so much money trying to keep the lawn alive and green and the weeds out
we never
it's been real fun here to see
there's a lot of market up here since it's kind of the area that people are moving into in the dallas area and big market for yard work
it seems like everyone is so particular especially in the dallas area
there's so much money
everyone can afford
another thing i've noticed is that the lawns in some of the homes
i noticed that they're really putting in small back yards because most of the houses have the alleys that run behind
that really cuts into your backyard space
None
right now we just moved in in september
we're just still at the point where we're talking about
it's awful the first house
we had no idea the expense that lawns and gardening
when it comes to fertilize then it would come to raking
when it comes to making sure that somebody had put the timer on the water
the one thing that i did notice is that people that have the underground irrigation systems the sprinkler systems that was the way to go if you could do it
people that were building the new homes that put those in that was the only way to go because it was just so convenient
the timer would run
it would water their lawn
they didn't have to worry about it at all
that was so nice
we didn't have that luxury
we were dragging the sprinkler around everywhere
i hope you can find
i remember the guy that was on the radio
i've still got the book
i think it's just called texas gardening
it talks about the different grasses to use for the shady areas versus the really sunny areas
there is a grass that you can use that is shade tolerant
i don't remember what it is
it's got a boot on the front of the book
it's texas gardening
it talks about different problems that your lawn can have and how to recognize it
it goes into the full gamut of gardening everything from flowers to bulbs to perennials to grass to weeds to trees and how to prune
one of the things i do remember was when it talked about the grass
i think one of them was a blend of two types of grass that they had used
i don't remember if it was raleigh and saint augustine or what
i do remember they had used a blend
we're going to have to do that because have the shade the trees
the trees are just so tall
there must be ten or twelve big tall trees out there so that even if its raining you can
that's so neat because so many homes don't have that
you'll be cool all year around
that's what we're looking forward to
that's what they say the payoff is
we ha-
the people that moved in next to us they built a new house on the empty lot
they just had their brand new little trees
any time they had people over they had to do it on the patio because it just got too hot during the day
that's great that you have them
there are all different kinds
that's even better
there are some oaks magnolias and plum trees peach trees
you have children i take it
it's not a very valid topic
i have two dogs
we have one
rather odd personality
he's fun
time we spend with our children
time spent with mom and dad
especially when they get into the teenage stage
they
we do spend time driving in the mountains
how nice
i thought if i do that i might not have a job
it's better to be employed
that creates family tensions
i don't have any children
how does she feel about going out and doing stuff with you all
they'd much rather be with friends
i remember
i'm sure part of it is a male female thing
i remember whenever i was growing up often times spent with my dad was just wonderful go hunting or go to the races
or any number of things
we'd have great times
it seems that now the bank's not available
we do have our trips
we do have our fun
hunting and
i said you can take a little girl hunting and fishing just as easily
they don't like it
there is a difference there
i enjoy it
girls at that age
that's a little tough for fathers
is that quality time
there is camping
we both enjoy that
that's good
what do you think about child rearing
how would you spend time with kids
probably doing outdoorsie stuff and trying to keep them away from the t v i guess
i always said that if i had a kid they wouldn't know what mcdonald's is
they learn from their friends
amazingly a lot of times it's real easy
a lot of times whenever we head out of town on a trip or something
breakfast is a kind of a funny meal anyway
kids eat funny
she was talking about her daughter said one week her daughter will be on a no meat kick
one week she'll eat nothing but twix candy bars
little girls are worse about it than little boys
something yeah
go on a diet or they have a
it's really morally wrong to eat meat or something
i'm not sure
is that where you're from
i understand about bass
it is interesting
i will tell you
every person out there should have kids at least once or have some they can borrow for a time
jenny is a sweet kid
it's funny
we were talking about how much it cost to go to disney land
for just a day or two not including lodging and food and all that
i understand six flags is real expensive now
at least once you pay your way in there
disney world or disney land
our problem is that a trip to six flags or disney world or disney land or god forbid disney world would take forever
you'd have to pay air fare
ooh for a family it gets pretty expensive pretty quick
my dad worked for braniff when i was a kid so we got our air fare free
we got
my hobby is sewing
i've just started learning how to sew
i've taken some classes
i've made a few garments
i used to
i sewed in high school
when i went to college i think everything in my closet i had made
i haven't sewed since then
that's been fifteen years
i didn't have access to a machine the whole time i was in college
my sister sewed
she needed the money so i would pay her
she'd make my clothes
just in the last ten or twe- i just haven't sewn anything
i would like to get back to it
clothes are getting so expensive now in the stores
the quality is sometimes so poor that
it really is worth while to sew
it is an even back then
i remember you could make something for half what it cost to buy
of course the quality was just exceptional
now it's a little more expensive to make it because you start paying the price for the patterns and the material
it's still such better quality that i think it's worth it
the patterns have gone up tremendously too the prices for them you used to could get a pattern for two or three dollars now they're five six seven eight
i can remember paying seventy-five cents for a pattern
the cheapest ones now are maybe four or five dollars
you get into the vogues
they get up into twelve and fifteen and
do you have kids and a husband
right now i'm just sewing for myself
i do have two daughters that they're grown now though
i wish that i had started sewing when they were younger
it would have helped me out tremendously
i guess i have always tried to sew
i didn't like the way it looked so i'd never wear anything
now i have bought some new sewing equipment
it really makes it look professional
i've taken some classes here in dallas
that always is helpful for starters
there's just so many people sewing now days
do you do anything el-
do you knit or crochet for sweaters or anything like that
i've not ever been a real craft type person
i have a sister-in-law that if it can be done with your hands she does it
i look at them
i think god i should be able to do things like this
i have a sister that can crochet real well
or knit i guess i mean knit
she knits things hats
and sweaters
when my sister had her first child my niece
it was my last year of college
i asked my roommate if she would teach me how to crochet granny squares
she did
i crocheted a blanket for my sister's baby
i started crocheting a king size bedspread for a guy that i was dating at the time
when we broke things off
we were supposed to get married when i got out of college
when we broke things off i quit crocheting it
i've never picked up a needle since then
my goodness
now they have the knitting machines that will do it for you
my problem i guess is time
i talk to my husband
we kind of planning for the time eventually when maybe i can quit work kids because my kids are young
he says
bev i think you'll be so bored because all you've ever done is work
i said but there's so many things i want to do
i'd like to learn how to do this cross stitch these knit these things
i think that would be fascinating
are you familiar with what a serger is the serger sewing machine
when we used to sew we'd sew the seam
we'd finish the edges
we would trim the seams and finish the edges
this machine does it all in one step
as you're sewing the seam it's finishing off the inside edge
it's cutting off the
there are two knives
it cuts off the excess seam allowance
that takes all the work out of it
how neat
especially on from the inside how you look under under something that you've made
it doesn't really
the serger really makes it look professional
that's neat
i paid about eight hundred dollars for mine
since i bought it and paid that much for it i guess i'd might as well get some use out of it
that sounds really good
i play the piano
so do i
you do
i have one here
my folks gave it to me
a couple years ago when they sail
they sold their home
they've been sailing
it's here
i haven't touched one since college so i kind of am picking it all out again and trying to remember how to do it again
of course my kids jump in the middle of it and want to pound on it
i'd love to teach them to play too
i'm not great
i remember it
i'm not that great either
i have played for the church choir
i don't practice a lot anymore
you get rusty
i'm rusty now
i figure it takes practice
i say i don't have the time
i've worked all day
i come home
i do that
and even hobbies and crafts and sewing things like that i think gee i could do this or that
i try to save that for the weekend
sewing does takes an awful lot of time
if somebody would lay it out for me then i didn't mind cutting it out and sewing it
i can remember once in high school i wanted some extra money
my mom wanted some pants
she laid out the material
i cut it and sewed it
she paid me i think two dollars a pair
i hate laying out material and trying to get the most out of the material and
right on the straight grain
that's the part that i don't like too
i like sewing up the garment itself
the cutting and all the
what are some of the other features on this machine
that's about it really
it has four threads instead of the regular basic two threads
it
is that for the regular seam in the fabric
you can either use three or four of the threads
None
there's a seam stitch
it's the loopers that form that edge finish
that's what really makes it look professional
you can make piping and cording
you can use all kinds of different textures of thread
it has the ability to do just about any type of sewing you want to do
you have to use it in combination with a sewing machine
you need it to do things like button holes
and seams that need to be done on the sewing machine
the serger is not a sewing machine itself
it's a machine
it does sew the seam and trim the edges and all that stuff
there are other things that a regular sewing machine does that it doesn't do you can't top stitch with it
you can't do top stitching
it will also do a rolled edge
it's just so versatile
i rem-
i'm going to have to go check it out
what do you think
we're taxed on taxes
most all government entities are just trying to give us a state income tax for those who don't have it that is
we don't have one yet
eventually they may try to push it through
they have n-
no state income tax
that's great because they don't have it in florida
like i say i'm in new york
we have a state tax as well
that just cuts even more
i think that i
i wouldn't be so upset about the amount of taxes paid if it weren't for the fact that they don't go to any place
you don't see it going to any place where it belongs
i think
given that it's not spent properly i think it's a major problem
we're really overburdened from federal state and local
that's certainly true
what is it they were just talking about sort of how middle income people
what winds up happening is for instance having kids they wind up having kids as a deduction
the deduction is so little for kids that they wind up having to pay more in taxes than it costs to raise a kid for the year or something
so they want i think they're trying
i think that most of the politicians understand this
they're just not very good at doing what they're supposed to be doing
they're kind of put into a trap of being out there to please the special interest groups as well
i think the only way that can be changed for us to get a better tax revenue that's fairness and all is for us to limit their terms
by doing so they're not obligated to anybody
i don't know how we're going to do that right away though
what in general though that taxes are doing to us is it's just taking a bite out of our savings
i'm just not sure if i see it going to the right places
it'd be one thing if it were taking a bite out of your savings and then you were getting it all back when you got older
i'm not convinced that social security is doing as well as it should
instead i think it's going to the wrong places
i believe the social security tax is a great scheme
it's
that scares the hell out of me
that's illegal
if most company c e o were to do that within their private company they'd be in jail
i don't
they're the ones who make the laws
who's going to yell at them
and performed a citizens arrest i guess
i don't know if we can do that or not
a lot of people have become too complacent believe everything is just the norm as to the way things are going and feel absolutely helpless to oppose a lot of the situations going on
yeah
like you said i wonder if it's certainly not going to be a slow change process
i wonder if it'll ever be a change process
i sort of get discouraged when i think about all the things that i think are wrong
all those things that really could be changed that aren't
tax is one of those things that just sort of sits way up there on the list
i don't kno-
i have no idea what to do about it
there's no quick solution or no sure fire easy answer
it's just going to take really a combination effort of the majority of the american people to come to a decisive answer
we have no say so as to where the money goes in the first place
the only say so we have is supposedly by electing people who we think are going to vote one way of another
they are controlled or pretty much do what they want to do
i've never quite understood that even though i've never been sort of politically minded
it's never been clear to me as to sort of how congressmen can just sort of go ahead and vote their own conscience as their own ideas when clearly their constituency doesn't back them up on anything
often times that will happen
they feel invulnerable to any wrath
it's occurred so many times that they figure people will usually forget and don't think about it when the election time arises
generally it does work out that way
they do forget because everybody
think of what happens is whenever the one who made that supposed mistake turns around
his or her opponent can say look they did this
they can turn around and say my opponent did this
it becomes a general battle of the sort of the election of the lesser of two evils i think
i'm unhappy with it
i'm sort of semifortunate right now
i don't make that much
what i make isn't taxed very highly because i'm still in school
when you get out into the real world then you'll know
None
when i get her job we look at her paycheck i'm just floored when i see how little of it we're actually allowed to keep
my wife does
you're taxed on the bonuses too
my wife is taxed on her bonus as well
that's usually a big chunk of her bonus check
her bonus isn't that much
they tax it as
i guess they tax it as if that were her weekly check or something
she gets destroyed on her bonus check
she works
a good portion of her salary is quarterly bonuses
sales is lucrative
then you're paying really high taxes when you're doing a lucrative job
she's not entirely sales so it isn't as lucrative as one would hope
it keeps us supported temporarily
i don't know
i guess at this point in time we're just sort of going to have to live with it
i have about said all i can think of to say
it's a rather touchy topic at that
i do agree with you most wholeheartedly
that's great
it was a very difficult choice
he must know is he interested in law or medicine
that's one of the reasons why he chose williams that it has solid liberal arts
while they're east coast i don't know anything about their football
there you go
they're really very strong academic rather than big sports
where you at
we're outside of washington in maryland
i'm in suburban dallas
about all i can say is i guess about picking schools i guess if you don't know what you're going to do liberal arts program is a good idea
i
one of the advices we've given our children is that you can always learn a job what you can't learn on a job is a good solid well-rounded education
that's right
the renaissance man if you get that you can
if you do well you can learn a job
if they learn the job and they can go into graduate school usually a company if it's worth it's weight will subsidize
this is true
if you want to go away
the advice we gave to them was number one visit the colleges that you're thinking about describe first of all the size school that you might be interested in do you want to go away
now my son is a national level competitive swimmer he wanted to swim in school
he did not want to be in a swim factory
he wouldn't have gone to something like where we're at in austin texas university of texas
i think the other thing is too i know i went to a city high school in chicago a lot of the kids weren't as fortunate as say my brother and i were
economics was the choice sounds like your son has academically the standing to get into that type of school
we've just
he had to look to see what kind of environment he liked
yet he did wind up having to make a choice
he did apply to a large large group
university of pennsylvania
that's it's a little bit more diverse
it does have the under
that's total undergraduate with five hundred graduate school so that the the college of arts and sciences is i guess about four thousand
how large is williams
williams is an undergraduate school only it's a total of two thousand
that's not bad
he knew the feeling because my other son is at amherst which is fifteen hundred he had visited his brother at amherst and knew that he liked the environment he did go on college visits
he liked
not having any children my husband was an ohio state person
that has something either the first or second largest student population fifty thousand
both boys had decided no that they did not want that
i can only say it's strange your son picked those kinds of college because i spent a year at bennington in vermont
this was twenty years ago
did you ever eat at the blue bin diner
let's not talk about that
we've been there when whose gone up there
it's in that area
i just can't say enough about it
it
he was impressed by the clean air
he met the students at both schools
he liked them
my husband's an engineer and a strong liberal arts background with a graduate degree in a technical field will get him much further than say a strong business administration degree than with another m b a on top of it
they usually
they usually don't
the thing is if a person really knows very early on that they want to go in a technical field then it's probably good to apply to a school with a good technical program
if you're going into
if engineering is the thing then you've got to at least take engineering
who does
i think the majority of people just don't know
he looked at criteria such as location size of school
a lot of kids just don't even want to go
williams is about seven
that's not too bad
he so it wasn't
he
then the university of pennsylvania is two hours from here by train
he will
it came down as he came
he came down
one of the things that he said is he went to pennsylvania this weekend
he had an absolutely marvelous time he had a great time
then he said it was such a good time that i almost got the feeling that their emphasis is on having fun
he said it almost back-
he's developing his internal instincts right now
that's good because i'm sure what he said was true that you
that's one of the reasons i went to
kenyon he made a good choice
i was supposed to
i spent a year in vermont my freshman year
it was too different the level of income of lot of the students
their attitudes was just beyond my
in terms of drugs et cetera which i thought was shocking
then i went
i did
was that he had to really decide what he wanted out of college
in a larger school he had to realize that if he was going to screw around it he could probably slip
it wouldn't be caught up until it was too late where in a smaller school where especially in a kenyon or a williams where you see the professors around town all the time you skip class in the morning and they see you
you're going to get a little bit more input
a swim coach is going to be right on top of you
he will know the professors in a small
i don't know how to put this either in this way
it doesn't sound like your sons would need this
i just think the other thing is with the way a lot of the youth is today i think the refinement that they get i don't mean specifically or culture but just what you're saying just a solid background because i just don't think at that age i just don't think that young people know what they want to do
it's just the personal contact where if you need help he had
are you the kind of person that will go into a large college and if the professor says i've got office hours but you really don't feel that you know him because you're in a class of a hundred that you're really going to look him up if it's a class of fifteen and you need help you know that it's much easier to do it and especially in the large schools they have lectures even though they may break it up into smaller groups penn is known for having graduate assistance teaching
that is very ironic too that your son just made the
he made the decision i'd say about an hour and a half ago
that's so funny
in fact he had just an hour before that two recent graduates from kenyon spent close to two hours talking with him they were really nice
he said that they didn't tell him anything that he didn't know
they helped confirm his decision that a smaller school was better
we're talking about what you think
obviously you're experiencing it
did your other son
the moment he knew he decided early on that amherst was the school
he's a classical guitarist he also got into the graduate school of music as an undergraduate for classical guitar
he decided he was going to go to the smaller now and then graduate school later
they'll do fine in their studies
i'm sure they'll go on to graduate school
my older boy's real happy
he's minoring in english
he had thought about economics
he took a couple of courses in economics and decided that wasn't
now he's a senior
is this early admissions
he's going to be a junior
he'll be he's finishing his sophomore year he's double majoring
he's yeah
sounds like you have two talented sons
the advice we give is to not limit yourself especially this go to a school where you're not forced to make too many irrevocable decisions your first year or two
it's not the economics i solely zeroed in on
i think a lot of people think about the tuition level and what exactly are you getting in return i think that a lot of people shy away from the smaller colleges because of that
i think it's rather sad
one of the things we said is that they should pick the college
we place a real high priority on education in our family
i agree
my husband and i
in fact i'm taking my l s a t
that's great
the point being and your sons will learn this from you that no matter what age you are you can learn it sounds like they're going to they're
let's see
that's great
we just bought a seventy-three mercedes that we have restored it
i'm a hobbyist too
we found some guys that actually worked for a mercedes dealership
that's good
they also repair them for other the people on their off time so we have redone that thing from stem to stern inside outside we've redone the body repainted it detailed it so i really haven't thought much past that
why they didn't
what would you buy
i don't know it just seems like for what we've put into it i feel like that's something that might retain it's value a little bit more
than
vehicle is great
the one thing that we did decide as it's
we did break down and put a c d player in it
that's great
at any rate that was one of the features that i did want
of course we do it ourselves
like i said we were just lucky to find these guys that do it
they just weren't really expensive
that is good
yeah
they work on it
the things that can be done here they just come here to our home and work on it or work on it
it's really been nice
i do all my own work
i have chevies
i'm an american car person
i do like mercedes
i have always had an american car
i had a real real bad experience with the cougar that i had
i don't know
i thought what the heck
i'm not a ford person and never have been as a kid
i do like the v eight engines
i think the
to me the american cars are far superior to the japanese in styling engines
right now
i would that there's
as far as what i've heard about performance and such so hopefully it'll stay that way
i would hate to see the american car industry suffering more than it already has even though right now i'm not driving an american car
i think
they said what do we want to buy
i'm not seriously thinking
i would like to
put it in that category by a cadillac
i wouldn't
of course if i had the money i'd be happy to by a new one
i do look for a one year old vehicle
that's what my parents are avid cadillac freaks
they had
i think my mother drives the seville now i guess it's a couple of years old
she had a seville before that that had the odd backs that was so
it final just wore out
they had purchased it
i can't remember how many years they had that car
she loved the styling of it
that she may want to save if she doesn't have it anymore
that could be turned into a classic
in ten fifteen years
it's sort of a bone of contention between she and my dad because my dad said just let me take it down there and find out what's wrong with it
he came back with a new car
he could just see dollar signs starting to flip by as far as repairs went
they really are nice cars there
i like a full size cadillac
i want one of those
i think they are a classic
they haven't changed in about twenty years
they'll eventually phase them out
i sure would like one ever those within the next five years
it seems funny you how within the last couple of years cars have gotten bigger again
they've scaled everything down so much
i've never owned a really large car
even the japanese cars are bigger too
i've had friends who had them
i think they're a lot over ra-
they're is just no styling to them
i don't mean that as a joke
i don't have any idea which car it is
i think they have not lead the field in styling
they do have sports cars the price is way more
i know that
i've sort of always felt like with buicks it seems like all buicks to me look alike
i guess it just seems to me they're all the same shape
she's got way offer a hundred thousand miles on it
that's what she's going to buy again
i'm like please it looks exactly the same as this old one
i guess it's in the eyes of the beholder
if you're interested you ought to go to the next auto show
i look at the cadillacs
there were some cadillacs that i didn't even realize they made
they were
they really looked beautiful
what they have out for the next year is everything still pretty square
it seems like the cadillacs is one of the few makers that are still making really i can't think of a car that they make are the than maybe the alliance
they have convertibles now in the cadillac
they have that new
it's not the big fleetwood the one i want
now when was this
i have
they have it every year
that's usually when i see anything
now this was in it downtown in the convention center
i see
they had some new cars that weren't even out
they had a new chevy suburban
truck
that big big one that was
my word
you think that can't possibly be done
that's just too weird
i like engines
they had a lot of
None
displayed engines
you could tell
that sold me in buying a new car
certainly interested in buying a new car
again the american cars were for superior in styling and
somebody's finally woken up
i think that i would definitely buy
again there's the question are we in the market
i could buy anything
if i could fine
i was really crazy about jags for a while
the convertible had a x j s or something like that
thought that's a dream car
you really would have to be a dream car because the repair bills are supposedly just constant
i haven't work on them myself so my cars don't go to the shop
i've always done it myself
that's good that you can
i've got three of them
i can't remember one
like i said i don't do that
i think it takes a talent to do that
my husband is engineer
he cannot
maybe he's just doesn't want to mess with it
i just say forget it we'll just take it in
he drives a honda
noticed that when i was a kid
i worked my way through college as a mechanic
and dropped it for a long time after i got out of college and
now again i've got three vehicles
i never get in them and just go to the shop at you will
that's one thing that when you would consider
when i go out to think about a new car or buy another car i don't think about is this engine that i can work on
my husband can work on or whatever
you're pretty lucky in that respect
i'm keeping v eight chevy engines
in fact i stock the same part
i'm a little stock
brought your chevy to me i'd probably have some parts
for it right now
it's really been funny because we have been you are own contractors kind of with this car
when i say we have redone everything i mean we have done everything
that's great
it's really been so interesting the people you meet because my husband carl has called all over the country
i can imagination
i guess i'll start out
that is i don't know what section of the public school system they're talking about whether it's the first eight grades the high school or colleges
what do you think about the lower grades k through seven
i should imagine the lower grades
what's certainly drawn everyone's attention to that is the fact that many of the inner city and i guess what we'd call ghetto or poorer districts
including rural districts don't seem to be able to produce the students that indeed many manufacturing and other
they can't seem to read properly do math
that's got everybody excited
it seems that high schools at least produce candidates although i have great misgivings about the s a t that go on to a variety of colleges
it seems a great deal of our public colleges have foreign students in them from a myriad of nations
also i think that a certain percentage of the public colleges produce a fairly decent student
i just read some things recently where
i didn't realize it was that high
just about f-
None
when you consider
that's what i was going to point out i think it mostly is that technical
especially in those areas
that involves both canadian
and european middle eastern and far eastern
i think i have similar views
that's where our elementary grades
it's amazing
i have a friend who's an elementary school teacher
she said that they have to pat the kids down because they bring guns to school
i just read an
amazing article
in this week's new yorker about baltimore
which went on to talk about
i thought it was rather slanted in favor of the mayor or the politicians in there
i do know a few people and have done some business up in baltimore
it seemed to me that the inner city school system was the one thing that didn't flower too well
it was very difficult
i think if i was going to fault it
if i'm looking to carry on a conversation
that way there's a couple of things that really bother me
i think when i learned the other day that the average american
and that school children are not far off that mark with six point eight
i don't know what school children what year that is
that's a hell of a lot time to be sitting in front of the tube
it's really
kids can't read
my wife teaches middle school
they can't
you're close to the subject
they can't read anything
yet you know i have grandchildren
i have nine grandchildren in various parts of the country
of course i can't speak to the rural or poorer inner city schools
they seem to be doing extraordinarily well
i i quiz them
i talk to them
they read well
i i think that's part of the environment
i think it's probably the work that your children are doing
that could be very well true
she can tell when they have kids come in for
she can tell before a parent comes in normally
give or take eighty ninety
per cent what the parents are going to be like when they come in and the responses the parents will give back
i
i guess i can understand that
maybe not that long ago
i always felt i didn't get a real good education in the grammar schools and part of high school
i lived in new england at the time
i didn't have that much money
we struggled
we did it i thought a great deal of the success that they had in their education was due to the low student teacher ratio
i think it's probably very true
i think that's a formula that could be applied everywhere
surprisingly because you put such a commitment on education
your children probably could have gone to schools with a higher student teacher ratio
would say what did you do today
let's sit down and read together
that must be
then if that's
i think we both agree on that then a
it's parental
i guess you got to take them away from the tube also
another problem i have is i don't really know how to resolve this
is the incredible emphasis on sports where enormous amounts of money are spent
it seems to me that money could be more well spent somewhere else
you know what's really funny is that there's been some research because i'm a college professor
endowment to the university in other words money that could to everything everything and normally gets directed away from sports realistically a lot of the was was probably two-thirds i guess it's now two-thirds of what it was when they were national champions
None
send big bucks couple hundreds of dollars
thousands of people
to
normally it's because of the sports
they don't just send it to the new stadium
the sports brings in the money
when georgetown was number one
i guess they're
their money that was donated to them from companies
from business people from graduates whatever
was up into twenty million dollars
now it's down to fourteen million
i never thought of that benefit yeah
their alumni giving and other funds have slowly dropped since then
i never thought
the consequence
i guess what i'd have to say about that is
it's amazing the way
now that's big time
smaller schools aren't like that
only the big time schools show that
you're right
i think the emphasis on sports
as a
i'm a former athlete in a sense
i swam
swimming never gets much glory so it really doesn't matter
mark spitz made a lot of money on it
you know they still
he came back this year
he didn't make it
i would have liked it if he would have though
i think realistically you read the research studies
i don't think he would have made it simply because the event he was trying to swim the research shows that distance running
he was good at distance spitz as a swimmer
None
were in their early thirties
he's was trying to make it in the sprinter's event
most of them
i also read i
i do want to add this to that because i was quite interested in that myself
i read where the reason that he had to do this in the sprint events is that national television wouldn't pay for the distance events
they didn't think they could capture the excitement to get sponsors
you're kidding
it had to be
and i guess capture the whole thing for some sponsor
that as an athlete i just hate that
what were you saying
if you teach college
i know when i went to college i went to summer school
i thought in fact that my idea of it was rather than finish early i just enjoyed some of the subjects that i was taking
i had the ability to go in summer school
i did
what that leads me
None
how do you think that would work in grammar schools
i think in some sense
something you have to consider too because i know as a former high school teacher
okay where do you work at
do you wish to discuss that
i i'm in
i live in richardson
but grew up in iowa on a farm with a considerably different philosophy in terms of
None
don't do
any gardening in the sense of vegetable gardening
tried some different
flowers and bushes and stuff
and have a lawn service
there was one
we just continued with them for a long time and then switched to a different one
in terms of the fertilizing and
i thought phooey i'm going to do it myself because i figured up the cost
i said huh-uh
what i did i switched to liquid
i do it with an applicator with my hose
it's so much easier than taking that lawn spreader and walking all over the territory
i thought i'm going to do this all the time
i found
i've got some problems with two trees in my front yard
i took them to a certified nurseryman the other day
do you know what he told me i needed to do
the tree is fifteen feet high
it probably has about ten thousand leaves on it
he told me i needed to pull every leaf off and then spray it with this chemical that he said i should purchase
i thought
i think i'll get my son-in-law
is it a pest
i don't know
what happened to it
it
what kind of trees are they
one is a maple
one is
i would much prefer
the ones that really do well are the ones that are on the city property
they don't
they're cedar elm
they're just beautiful
it's these things that you pamper
None
although i don't have too serious a problem
i don't know if it was from the late freezes that were or the early freezes we had that caused this tree damage
sperry said that's what happened to the crepe myrtles
the last two years that we are looking at all the freeze damage from the prior two years
i kind of think that maybe that happened to these large trees that i have
i really hate to lose them
that's one thing that we've had very poor luck with in our yard is trees
had been put in by the developer when he built the house
he just put in whatever was cheapest
he
and figured
there were seven different trees of various kinds and sizes in the yard when we moved in
we got one left at this point
three we've lost to to freezes between eighty-three and then a year ago we lost another one
did you cut them down at the ground level
did you pull them
how did you get rid of them
i i don't know how to get rid of these big trees because one has a circumference of about ten inches
we didn't have any that were that big when they went
two of them
i don't want stubs in my lawn
you still have to
now the last one that we lost a year ago up until then they hadn't been big enough
what i just used a hand saw and sawed them off as
and then
got some chemical that drill holes and pour in that
a stump killer
None
stump killer and stump rotter
this last one had a fair sized root
some guy was doing a job in the neighborhood
and saw it and stopped in and asked
i said fine
he had a trailer with a machine on it that was specifically for that
they get that saw
i think it's some kind of a screwing thing that just rips it right out
it yeah
it just ripped it right out
i
he left the chips
used those for mulch
i put them up mulch around the other shrubs
and had a pile of dirt from various things back by the garage that i filled in with
it's filling in with grass nicely this year so that that was worth it
two fold purpose
do you do your own
lawn in terms of mowing
i have a self-propelled snapper
None
it's very difficult to address
we just got a old push sears mower
it's been fifteen years now since we first moved to texas we've had it
i keep waiting for it to die
every year it just seems to hang on
that's good
yeah
they said no it's too old
i took it back home
one of my sons and a couple of his friends this year have
we have quite a few
we don't really use them a lot
we like a lot of gasoline credit cards
because we like to be able to stop when we're traveling and stuff wherever there's a station
as far as like mastercard and visa we don't use those too often
now i have one or two of them
i think i've even let some of them expire
i was living out of the country for a while
i wasn't using them too much i don't drive that much
i have mastercard and visa as you know
as long as
my mastercard is free as long as you spend about three thousand dollars a year or something like that
i tend to buy almost all major purchases on a credit card
i used to even use it for my grocery shopping and stuff
i don't
i was living in france
there you pay for everything by credit card
it's not really a credit card
is it like an automatic debit
it's a debit card
just many times
they're just so well set up with it
we always have the money set aside already
we just pay it off the next
we don't like to pay interest on the
i never pay finance charges on them except when i screw up which i occasionally
i'll forget to pay the bill by the due date
this last month i mailed a check to them on the twenty-second
they didn't get it until the thirtieth
it was
i thought i
i got hit up with a finance charge on it which pissed me off because i really did mail it in time
they have no proof of that
i don't want to probably talk to them some more discuss it
i usually never pay
we screwed up one time like that too
they just never did get it
we had to finally mail them another check
that went on for months and months and months
they eventually found the check and deposited it months later they were still telling me that i owed them finance charges and late fees and things like that
i said i mailed you a check
you eventually did deposit it
i guess i don't know who the burden of proof is on
kind of the
you never d-
i don't
i don't mail them all a signed receipt whatever i
at the bank to have a proof of when i mailed it
you can't do that
i like to use my card if i buy something through the mail which i don't do real often or something from out of state where if something is wrong
you can
a couple times i've had to write big credit card companies and say i didn't really get this
i don't know what this is
i returned it
don't charge it
that's basically what happened with us is we bought a computer
the computer didn't do what these people said it would do
it wouldn't do that
he brought it back to them
they're supposed to modify it
i called the credit card company and said we haven't really taken possession because it's not useful for us
they said then don't pay it
a month later i had to dispute it in writing
i was out of the country and got back
i took care of it as soon as we got the computer back
it was okay
it was too late
now they're hitting me up there
it's sort of
it's half our fault
w-
i learned that for the next time
i don't like to pay the yearly fee for a card
since we don't pay the interest it doesn't really matter what the interest rate
we had american express cards
my husband had always had that before we got married
those got so high we finally decided for him and me both to have a card it was ninety dollars
we decided let that one go
my husband and i both have that
i don't know what we pay for his card
i think it's like seventy-five dollars for me i'm not quite sure what it is for him
i had really like w-
nowadays i'm not so sure that it's worth it
in the past there are some places that only take american express they don't have the credit limit because i've over done the credit limit on the other card
a couple of plain tickets and a little bit more and you're over the limit on the credit card
with the american express they say there is no limit
then that was one advantage
that's like
like you said if you need that extra for charging tickets and stuff
we should probably get another visa card
another one that's free
there are some
i think a t and t has one that's free if you make two purchases a year
that's easy enough to do
if that's true it might be better off to have that as a second card just to have the credit
i guess i do understand the mentality of people doing it
i don't understand
people think it doesn't really cost them anything to pay
i have had months where i was shocked at how much had come in because i thought i would buy a big expense and think that it would take one or two months to process sometimes it comes in right away
it's like guess
many times i'll buy some things towards the end of the month thinking hey i won't get that bill until the next bill
it will come in on the next one
sometimes the is long
i've had things that i didn't get billed on for two or three months
that's what happened with us
we bought a washing machine seven months ago
i got billed the next day
we prefer g-
with the credit card you get the automatic one year guarantee so if something breaks things like that
you can return it so the washing machine we bought it in october
if something goes wrong with it within the first year we've got an automatic guarantee on it besides the manufacturer's guarantee
somethings like that are
the insur- if you break it yourself even
if it gets stolen or if you lose it or whatever it might be that's another advantage even things like airline tickets you automatically get flight insurance which hopefully you never use
like if your bagga-
things like if your baggage gets lost you get money for that to buy new bags and things like that
i didn't know that
sometimes you get discounts with the cards
i usually keep up with news by watching a b c news on television and reading the papers here the local dallas morning news
i also take the wall street journal
do you mostly catch up while you're at work
i
i use part of my lunch period to read the wall street journal
then i read the the newspaper at home generally in the evening
you have a little bit better newspaper
the a j kind of dominant
i finally quit taking it because it stacked up
i try to take weekend papers
during the week i catch up on the radio on the way to work or if i'm traveling around at lunch or on the way home
hopefully i'm sitting down by the ten o'clock news to where i can kind of get a recap on t v
that's what we do to
we're never in home in time to really watch the six o'clock news on television
we catch the ten o'clock news
i catch the news on the radio coming to and from work
radio news is rather short
most of the stations here that are not all news stations you get about five minutes on the hour
if you catch the news stations you don't catch that much in the car
i see
it's frustrating to me because
i haven't found anything yet that keeps me there on a constant basis
somebody will say did you hear about this that happened last week
it might be local
it might be national
i'm like no i missed that one
they'd just stack up
you have to have time to sit down and concentrate on the stories
all of a sudden you look and there's three weeks worth laying on the coffee table
you wind up throwing them out without reading them
it's too much trouble to try and catch up
have to depend
i guess we're becoming more of a television oriented nation in that i don't think that my children even read newspapers other than the t v guide section
oh no
there's is all strictly television news
it's an
i wish they would just report the incident and then leave the commentaries out
so many times you get this is my opinion of what he meant by that
i'm like who are you to judge
thing with the news magazines like time and the other magazines
it's hard to separate the news from the comment because
then you have to try and sort out what really is the news
i feel like they sensationalize things that shouldn't be sensationalized
i feel like they focus too much on things that
so much during the gulf war they would ask questions that you wouldn't want broadcast
they keep asking these questions
i thought it was really asinine actually
so many of them also come through
they have discovered that this is the most popular issue of the time whether it be the homeless or cancer or whatever
they devote an inordinate amount of time on the news cast to their personal ax to grind
None
particularly the local television i know the the wednesday's child bit
they'll take up ten minutes of a newscast and leave out something
they leave out a real news issue to devote to one of their local pet projects
it's frustrating
i guess when i get to listen to the news it's probably television or radio
i don't get to see that as much as i want
when i do i'm wondering why i wanted to see it so bad
we again
like i say by the time i read the newspaper it's that morning's news from the day before
i'm reading it in the evening
i'm about a day behind most of the time anyway
i'm glad tha-
i used to think that i was probably the only one that just was running around so much
i look at other women workers or men at work
i'm like how do they seem so together all the time
i guess news is just part of that rat race for me
it's always there's something going on all the time
you don't really have time to sit down and thoroughly read a newspaper
that's about all then
i appreciate talking to you
do you play golf at all
i'm kind of embarrassed i'm talking to a man cause i'm sure that you play a lot more than i do
i don't
when i was younger i played a little bit
i was horrible
i just stopped playing
my husband is a very good golfer
he has got a six handicap
he has been playing since we have been married for twenty two years
i had to start playing because he was such an avid golfer
i have been playing now
i have had clubs for twenty years
you have been playing
i really enjoy it
i had to check that and talk about it
have you played recently
i don't even know if i checked that or not to be perfectly honest
i don't know
that's okay
when i was
i basically had a horrible slice or hook
the hook goes to the left
i was slicing
as it turns out i went and took some lessons for awhile because i just would lose so many balls and make it a horrible time for everybody
a i got a little bit better
then i sort of went back to school and did not have time and this and that
the only thing i do now is i occasionally go out to a driving range and hit a couple of balls and see what i can do
i still have this slice
are you in school
as a matter of fact i don't have time to do much else except for graduate work
i hang around this way
occasionally
a bunch of us were pretty avid golfers so we will go out
we will play
you don't have the length of the playing time that we do
at the moment i have very little playing time
when i go on vacation my father and i play a little bit
i don't
we play a par three nine hole course
that's my favorite kind to play
for a woman it's really nice to play a par three course because
i can't hit a driver very far
in fact i don't even like to use a driver
i can just have better contact with the ball that way
i'm still using a three iron
my husband is trying to get me into using a
know a high number wood instead
those are still not you favorite
i enjoy
i really do
we have three teenage daughters
during the year i don't play much golf
when we are on vacation i love to play just like you said
we got to play in monterrey in california right along the pacific ocean this past spring
that was the way to play
if i could play there every time i want it was great
miniature golf there's my game
that's the thing my kids like to do that on dates and stuff
golf is
we probably are talking about golf because i did check it
i don't
i don't recall anymore
i feel like anybody that's ever played golf can talk about it
maybe if you can even talk about it if you have watched it on t v
we have a very very
we had the
we had
there the l-
we had a p g a a very big p g a tour stop here last year
they say the
they say the course is pretty tough pretty challenging
it's not only that
it's exceedingly well kept apparently
those are the comments i kept hearing from the pros
they kept saying we hear on television i
they keep saying it's just wonderful
it rained through half the tournament so people had to
they still
when the l p g a came here i guess that was about a week and a half ago it takes over the whole town
it's all over the news
lots and lots of people take off work
to go an watch the ladies
i think it's absolutely wonderful to see
a lot of people are just crazy about it
it seems a lot of people are really
either you have not played it or you have played it
you sort of play every now and then
it's just such a difficult thing
i watch my husband
he was a professional athlete
he's a very good athlete
he's got the coordination that god given coordination
he just struggles
all the time to master this game
same here i'm a brown belt in karate at this point in time
my really
None
i
i watch my husband swing
his swing compared to the pros is so ridged
or how far he's going to hit it i think
i worry about that
i have just got to get this drive really far
i have this nasty habit of turning my head at the last second or just keeping my arm wrong
you are always so anxious to see where it goes
it's just like i don't watch the ball die
i have to that especially even more so with a short iron than a long ir-
those short irons it's just you want to look up cause you are getting close to the green
you want to see it hit the green
you know that's why
that is certainly true
i don't know what i'm supposed to ask questions about
when i
do you get reimbursed for the calls you make or the calls you talk on too
i really did not know so i
i actually don't know
i get a random reimbursement every now and then and don't really figure it out
this is only my second day doing it
i did not know
that was
i just started yesterday
i have been doing this for awhile
i just
we both just sort of get these random checks in the mail
to be honest i really have not been accounting
i just sort of figured it's going to work
if it works it works
my
do you think we should go metric
i don't know
it's kind of a tricky question because i think it's a practical system
obviously if it's all compatible and it tens
things make sense
it's a switch
i think what
i don't know what happened last time
we all learned that metric
they were ready
i don't quite know why it failed
push i bet the push just wasn't big enough
they didn't sort of encourage businesses and things to use it
what i think they'd have to do would be to have both things on there for a while and then start phasing things out
i think that's what they did at first
there's things that we've gone metric
you can
so that we have little things that are metric
no one talks about
even though the car says miles and kilometers
i would be total loss
i think though if there were some sort of government incentive program or something people would begin to switch over
i think there would be the hard core older people who would get really pissed
but
who would get really upset and start to complain and get all cranky and stuff
i think in the end it would make life a lot easier for people coming up
it's because i think they had a good try there when they started with us in the elementary schools trying to
i think our generation could make a change
it would not be as difficult for people fifty years old now who have never been exposed to the metric system other than buying a two liter coke
what i think the difference between now and then might be is we were the first generation that was in elementary school
if they kept it up
let's say imagine they had kept going
you'd have two or three more generations that all now are familiar with the metric system
i could convert
i could handle it for a while eventually i'd learn
i think that before it was just a bunch of little kids using it
now i think there are enough people
sort of as we get older i think others that will bring more generations in on it eventually they'll be able to make the switch
we're not going to start going crazy and yelling and saying
we'll say it's a pain in the neck
it's for the better
we'll sort of deal with it i think
i would hope it would
everything seems to be based on the same thing
i was trying to think of what kind of things you'd have to change
you'd have to change your height on your driver's license
when you wouldn't be five foot eight anymore you'd be
you'd be lighter in kilograms than you were in pounds
i wonder if
all the dieters would be happy
i wonder if that's even something that they have to change immediately
they could just sort of phase that in
start from now
from now on all licenses would have that
rather than going back and changing everything all new licenses as of nineteen ninety-two would have it or something
they'd have to change that little ruler that's on the door of the seven eleven that
hold it up
yeah
i know though at the amusement parks they say if you're under forty-two
i bet what they do in that case they
what some of them is they say if you're not taller than this line
that would be good that i don't know
it would be a neat case where where kids taught the parents i think
isn't it pretty much everywhere in the world
i don't know
england is not
i don't think they are because our measurements started in england
i think they're the only part of the continent that hasn't changed over to metric
None
virtually the rest of the world is
it seems sort of stupid
of course we are americans
we're supposed to be
now we're backwards
i don't know why we haven't changed to the sensible system
i would think a base ten system as compared to a base twelve system makes a lot more sense
it's not even base twelve for everything
let's see
i always forget
i don't understand liquid ounces and fluid ounces
i don't know that i have that much concrete knowledge in the current
those wouldn't be a problem
it's not like it's really entrenched other
i have no idea
i just
i know things like a pint is a pound the world around or something
i didn't even know that
i learned that because a friend of mine
i had two friends
i had more friends than that
two friends of mine in college
that's good
we opened a jelly bean business
we sold jelly beans
we had no idea how many
we didn't bother buying a scale
we'd go out and just buy five pound bags of sixteen different flavors put it in plastic shoe boxes and then sell them for x amount per pound or quarter pound or something
we didn't bother buying a scale
one of these guys was a physics major
he said just remember a pint is a pound the world around
he got the measuring cup and just measured i think a cup or two cup whatever is a pint
i think he the calculation at home
it turns out that he was actually pretty close
we were giving them a little too much
that was our general tendency anyway
we were in
it was almost like we did it for the hell of it in school
make
after an entire semester
we had a hell of a lot of fun doing it
we tended to eat a lot
our friends would just sort of walk by and just put their hands in it
we had another friend the physics major again he wasn't aware of jelly bean physiology i guess
he got into a snowball fight
he just
some snow fell into one of the cartons
he brought them into the bathroom to wash them off
basically what we had sort of non coated beans at that point
it's just the same
there's just sort of this stuff you see it's sort of like glorified sugar
when you rinse them off all you get is the coating
i guess we are just to discuss trials and punishment if it's to be given by the judge or not
did you catch your explanation of that
it's
i think that there should be some preset penalties in criminal cases rather than degrees of sentencing
again having participated in jury duty myself
of the person
i think what you have is the way the justice system works is they bend over backwards trying to protect the guilty
it's insane
had came up with the maximum sentence in the jury form they found out that the gentleman involved had a long history of the same type offense which was theft of property
yet the attorney
for the prosecution could not enter the good man's background into it
there's too much leniency
there's too much underhanded things going on that the public are not aware of
it seems as though we are giving the criminal the benefit more than the victim
i think this is one of the reasons that also that attorneys have such a unsavory reputation
i don't have an ounce in my body of credibility toward the judicial system in the united states
what you got is the situation wherein if you ever get in trouble you want to hire the smartest crookedest lawyer you can find
that's not the idea
the idea is not to get the guy off of the crime
to punish him for the crime but also to try and reeducate the man's thinking
to get him out of that criminal mind that he has and to direct
we have a situation again that i am familiar with where the son of an acquaintance of mine was killed while trying to stop a robbery
the person that killed him was a young woman
then due to technicalities she was going to be out of jail within eighteen months after she was sentenced
of course it took eighteen months for the trial to happen
then
the parole board received approximately a thousand letters protesting putting this person back on the street within eighteen months after killing someone
fortunately it worked
they corrected the technicality
the person now will have to serve three to four years of the seven or eight they were sentenced to
responded to the parties that are involved and if enough
our priorities are a bit backward
they again the
i'm not knocking the civil rights program or anything like that
we've gone
overboard to protect persons from having their civil rights
i am too
i just can't
i served on a jury for a lady that was having a mental problem
we found her not because the lady obviously was not in their right mind
if the person is not in the right mind they had to
for her own safety and because she didn't know what she was doing
we just dismissed the case
she was taken care of
another side of the coin with our justice system there are a lot of frivolous cases that go to court
there are a lot of things that could be settled out of court or should never have gone to court
the amazing thing of course is how some cases can come to trial in thirty days
others it takes eighteen months
carolyn i have a little miniature schnauzer
it's kind of a mixed breed that we got from the humane society
you know those make the best pets
my son has
it's part doberman and part husky
gentlest dog you ever met
they got him from the humane society here in oklahoma city she's just turned out to be a jewel
my little
being single she's become very important in my life it's so nice to come home and find something or someone who's really so happy to see you
my children are the ones that wanted our pet
this one is probably the best one that we have had
as i say we got it from the humane society
we had lost a pet
we really went there looking for the one that we had lost
we just looked all over for it and couldn't find it
when we walked in to the humane society this little dog was in the office and would sit up and beg
just he was so cute
the kids just fell in love with it
whoever had it before must have trained it real well because it's a good house dog
i'm not home unfortunately she's not as well trained as i would like her to be i realize it's my fault
she's real good
not one mess does she make we go outside
she'll stay outside for thirty minutes to an hour come inside and use the restroom
she's a doll
i shouldn't say the only time
most of the time when we have problems with restroom is in the night
she usually stays inside at night
sometimes it doesn't work
we always had a pet when i was growing up always had a dog
we always had a dog
course when my children were growing up we always had a dog and always said it was because the children wanted the pet i find that i'm enjoying this one far more than i ever did when it was the children's dog
in fact my children gave me this little puppy for christmas
we got one one year for christmas
my goodness
i had a baby the next day that one wasn't really well trained
i just didn't have time to take care of baby and train puppy at the same time
that is really probably bad timing
we thought that would be a fun time for them to get it at christmas time
it was a little spitz wi- a little white fluffy and looked like it came right from the north pole
that was fun
i sure wasn't good at training it i think you have to have time to do those things
do you and patience you really have to be just like your children
when you set a rule you have to stand by it and be consistent
since i'm in college i haven't seen that much change
i don't know how much it changed in the last twenty years anyway
i don't know
do you have an idea of how much
social changes
i can remember are from from my childhood were the disco days
maybe that's changed a lot the way people dress
maybe a people are a little more open-minded than maybe they used to be
a lot
i think people are used to now saying what's on their minds more up front than they used to be
especially with a lot of the different organizations now like pro-life and pro- choice in the special interest groups maybe amnesty
maybe people are a little more free to express their opinions socially free
i think women have come out more too on child abuse and the wife beatings
like you said pro-choice and whatnot
i think that's become more outstanding than it used to be where women i think used to be a little bit afraid of coming out and saying something
maybe too a big social change that's maybe for the worst is how the people's views on relationships has changed
we have to worry about aids
we have to worry about maybe people are becoming more afraid of relationships
i know like when i was in high school and junior high and stuff and sitting down and having the sex talk with mom and all that stuff
we didn't have to talk about
basically her thing was just don't do it i'm not naive
i've got a ten year old
he thought he knows about condoms
he knows about aids
it's just different things you have to talk to them about now that you would never even have dreamt to have to say anything about
it used to be that we were trying to protect morality
it's a much different
we have
you can't just hope for abstinence
i think that's stupidity on parents' part
sex is rampant
it always will be
i think too noticing the kids that the fourth and fifth graders which is what my son is and stuff they're very open
the boys are very open because that's all i have is boys so that's all i'm around basically is boys
they talk about things that my brother didn't talk about until he was in college
they sit down
they look at you right in the face
they expect a truthful answer
you can't give them the cabbage patch answers and stuff
they can tell me basically some things that i don't know
it's interesting listening to them
i think the social changes in them i think i see it more with that generation than i do with our generation
i imagine you're right
i teach swim lessons a lot
to see what kids talk about when they're open about
kids are a lot more educated now than i think that we were at that age about a lot of things
besides what they learn from our social environment their education is just amazing
kids are learning
every year algebra goes down a grade
students learn it earlier
my son my fourth grader he is
which ones have you seen lately
i just sort of blanking tonight
i just got done saying i just saw one fairly recently
gosh i know the one with the two girls that take off from across the country on a crime spree
it's interesting
i was going to go see the billy crystal movie also which was
i'm not familiar
which billy crystal movie
this is the
just the one
it was the
city slickers
it says a lot about
i'm young
it says a lot about middle life
it's a really good show
i've heard lots of good things about it
i would have liked to have seen it
i was with my wife
i figured she'd like thelma and louise better
i'd heard it was really good too
has jeff bridges and
really really good
there's been a fair number of pretty good movies out recently
it kind of runs in
for a while sometimes they come in a whole bunch of them that just doesn't even sound like something i want to see
what kind of movies in general do you like to watch
i really enjoy watching a movie where they don't really try and attract the great audience but rather put out a real good movie
it always
my favorite movie of all time has been the mission
it's a
it's a
he plays one of the main characters
it's about jesuit community
really really good show
in fact i'll look for it because i
it's something that
it's really stirring
the cinematography is just beautiful really beautiful scenes and real good music
my wife's from down in that region called the seven missions which are right down where i'm sure where it was filmed at
i'm sure that that would make it worth her watching
my movie watching has changed a lot since i got married
she likes action movies and comedies
anything has anything little bit less than sort of mainstream hollywood is boring to her
None
i used to watch a lot of sort of the less popular films
i find i don't do it anymore or else i have to watch them on my own
i have a fiance
it gets very difficult to
i'll watch them
i don't seem to get as much variety these days lately as i used to
i found when i get with my old college buddy we usually rent good gladiator movie or two
i still enjoy watching those
it's fun to
on the other hand given that my wife likes those i occasionally like to watch them
you can always count on her to watch something like that
she'll even watch things like karate movies and stuff like that
which most women now
all the ya
on foreign films did you watch
are you fluent in another language
i speak several
i don't mind watching subtitle movies
you don't
i feel foolish sometimes because i don't speak another language fluently
i do enjoy watching subtitles
for some people that's just that's out of the question
lucille i'm on
our topic was
i certainly am too
unfortunately i don't expect a great deal out of them
when roy tarpley just now he messed up on them it just hurt them so bad
it just seems like they were just getting themselves in a position where they could possibly be a final team playing for all of it
do you think it's time that we go for new coaches
i think at this time we're just in a rebuilding type of phase
i think that probably be evident with the more and more young guys they draft
it just it's so discouraging that they can't really
they're entitled to more than they've been able to do so far
i'm awfully sorry that the mavericks can't come on and do
who do you like after the mavericks
i'm so much a maverick fan i don't know
they have a similar situation in that a lot of old guys on the team
they're still playing good ball
i've always been a boston celtic fan too
i've lived in texas since seventy-four
being a transplanted texan in the dallas area i have to stick with those dallas mavericks
we do
when my kids got to a certain age and went off to school and college and doing their own thing sort of gets boring going by yourself
you bet
maybe they can do some
i don't know
it seems like rolando blackman and harper sort of carry the team
that can really help the team
they do that
course i don't know any of the newer ones that they have
i'm not well versed on their capabilities
we really need to do something
i feel like the best they can hope for this year is probably an opportunity to make the playoffs
i think he deserves a good break
donald carter the owner i think with all he's invested he deserves a a healthy team for one year and a good break also
they have just done as much as they can for that man
he apparently can't straighten his act out
we need to build on something more positive than that
i do too
it
you can't give
there's an old saying you can lead a horse to water
you can't make him drink
i think tarpley's just a sad case
to be making a million dollars a year that's pretty sad
i don't
we're going to have to do something about all of these fabulous salaries they're paying to all of our athletes i think
i think you're right
you take a young kid roy tarpley's age i'd say he was twenty-one when he came into the league
now he's probably an old age of twenty-five or six and making all that money
that's a little more of a challenge for a young man than they need at that point in their life i think
i think it's created by
are you from this area
i live in garland
i don't know if you know
garland has got a real big recycling center that in fact we went to it yesterday
you take the stuff out of your trunk
they have different bins for the different materials like clear
they have all the different plastics separated by those little symbols on the bottom
my daughter is four
she's real interested in
we're trying to promote that because she thought we just put them in a special trash can and threw them away
we went to the recycling center to show her what we actually did with them
does dallas have a curbside recycling program yet
i don't know dallas
richardson does
they started with newspapers and of course aluminum cans and and bottles and plastic
like soda bottles are one type of plastic
milk jugs are one type of plastic
most of the recyclable containers have the little symbol on the bottom with the arrows around it that tells whether it's a one or a two or a three
it's just different kinds of plastics like the clear plastic is different from that milky looking plastic
that's what the different types are
yes i know there's a long scientific name
it's like polytechnochloride and all that fun stuff
i don't know if they do it all over
our kroger does a newspaper recycling every saturday
they have one of the bag boys out there that will take the newspaper out of your car
they'll put it in their little bin
they do the recycling
they collect the newspapers and their plastic grocery bags which i think is pretty neat
one of their articles was on recycling
it was actually on a town that has a dump that they charge other cities or towns to come in and dump their trash there
they have made so much money from that that they bought a brand new fire engine
when the fire engine was delivered the fire house wasn't big enough so built a new one and paid for it in cash with the money that they've earned from this landfill
in the winter they put snow on it
they charge to ski on it
the city gets the money from that
they get the money from that
it's riverview ohio or some place up there
i thought it was a pretty neat idea
their city hall looked better
they only have fourteen thousand people in the city
they like the trash
i thought it was pretty neat
it would be nice if more communities could do that
you have to know from beginning
you have to have the space to do it
they're already planning a second mountain
they're going to be called the twin peaks
i was like go back two t v shows
it would be nice if more communities could get really involved in recycling
it's like no honey
that
that was one reason we went to show her what people did with their stuff when they recycled it and try to explain you melt down the cans
you make them into new things
you get the paper all wet
you make it into new paper
do you all go ahead
was well from trees that's why you have to cut down trees and why you have to plant more trees
how do you grow aluminum
let's see
she was like what do you do with the glass
you crunch it up real small
you melt it down
what if it breaks
it was an interesting weekend trying to explain all that fun stuff to her
at least she knows that that is something that people need to be doing
she got our baby-sitter to start recycling her newspapers and cans because that's all she talked about
i guess what
what are your feelings on the topic today as far as crime in america today
i think some of the blame can be placed on plea bargaining and people getting less time and not serving any of the or a lot less of the
time they're given by the court system
i don't know
i have to agree with you
i had occasion a couple years ago to hear the chief of police of richardson texas speak
it's a shame
when he gets caught he'll be sentenced to something like five to seven years
he gets five days credit for every day he serves
it's like a bonus to go to jail
subsequently a five year sentence means he's going to be out in a year on probation
what he does the chief said is he just merely goes back to his stash where he has it hidden and continues to operate
when he uses up all that and spends all that money then he starts robbing houses again or whatever and gets caught again and goes through the same thing
there was an article in our paper sunday that the average person sentenced to seven to ten years in north carolina serves six weeks
that's a crime right there
we don't have any room in our prisons
we don't either in texas
they shuttle them in and shuttle them out
they get them early parole in order to make rooms for the new criminals who stay there for their six weeks
they're paroled to make room for the newest criminals
it's just really absurd
it certainly is
that would be a huge concern
i don't think the general public really realizes this as far as what goes on with our criminal system our judiciary system and everything else
it's terrible the way it is right now
they think that there's absolutely nothing they can do about it
as far as steps to reduce crime if it's crimes like we're just been discussing
i don't think that's going to happen because just like you said
our state's a good example
it's just not going to happen
i know it
i'm sure he gets to watch a lot of t v
i'm sure they have exercise facilities and movies
everything else they can have a good time in
i don't know what the answer is
i know that asking the question over and over and over again isn't working
hopefully something will come out of it
i don't know
i'm pretty much of a hard person
i believe in capital punishment
a person rapes a kid or shoots someone or kills someone
if it's just downright outright
i definitely believe in capital punishment
that's the only way to
it's when they're on death row for nineteen years that i'm kind of curious about
you spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to take care of them and all
i think the average is eight to ten years to get in to the north carolina supreme court after that it goes to the supreme court of the united states
that usually takes another four to six years
i know
meanwhile you're living in a country club situation perhaps
i guess they're trying to prolong their lives and hoping people will forget what they did
it's just a
the thing is the the thing
the fundamental problem is
i'm sort of don't know if this an advantage or disadvantage
then i'll walk softly
there is a lot of serious things wrong with the school system today and the teaching system
for example my wife she has kids that are on drugs
of course like everyone she has kids that get pregnant even in the seventh grade
to give you an example one of her kids will come in and you could tell he was just bombed out on drugs
she sends him to the principal's office
the principal sends him right back or her right back and says your problem you take care of it
if you do that then your allocation's cut from the state or the feds or whatever
it's a numbers game
i don't think that's right especially if they're interrupting the class and preventing other kids from learning
i think it's more of a
there's a bigger problem here than than discipline in the schools
i think it gets back to the parental participation into the program
to give you an example both of my children are in the academy system in the garland school district
it's a public system however you'd think that it was a private school because i take it the best teachers and the best students
they're taking top three percent that have tested out in the district and put them in this academy system
to get into the system's very difficult
once you're in they have they have self-paced programs
you have students that want to learn
you have teachers that want to teach
you have parents that are really interested in the children
basically there's probably some discrimination if you want to say that
most of
i'm saying a large percentage of them are
also the other large percentage is that all the parents just about of these kids have college degrees at least one parent does
there's
i think that's my justification for saying that the parents that are pushing their children at home even if they don't know what their children are learning they're saying do your homework let me see it don't get in trouble at school or we're going to be all over you
my son had such a tough time in the school he went to
there was through
we put him in a private school in richardson
that cost more
that was more than his college tuition was it had to be done
at least it took care of him and threw him in a good learning situation where he did participate and want to learn something
i'll tell you what there are a few faults to say the least in the school systems today
i think what we've done is especially looking at the south dallas area is that we're trying to bring the education level down to the lowest level so that the lowest level can succeed
that also probably crosses over into business because now businesses also say that if you're don't have the proper education including exposure to high tech fields such as computer technology if you can't use a computer today and do word processing and do data base management and do i forget all the other stuff financial management and all this other kind of stuff in your regular job you can't function
i think that the school system proliferates over to the business world
the business world then says we're not going to pay you unless you have the education
educ-
what we've done is caused a big problem that proliferates itself
teachers they have a a tough row to hoe so to speak always fighting the system
we came down to texas from the new york area
my wife is from new york
she was born and raised there and educated there college and everything
i think the schools in the east are really a whole lot better than the schools in the south i don't care where you're from
they
they have a tendency to learn more
in that part of the country there is all nationalities
the questions is concerning the changes in the roles of american women in the past several generations in the society we live in
i think one of the major changes is the whole attitude towards women in the work place and the role of women in doing jobs outside of the home
are they being given the full honor for the work they are doing what they have to accept that's they are responsible for
responsibilities is what i am trying to say
i don't think so
by the same token in most cases women have the jobs with the same responsibility of men who have been there before but at lower salaries
i think that's what we really ought to look at that if they are going to do equal work they ought to get equal pay
they ought to have equal opportunities to advance to those positions i don't think that we have gotten there yet
what changes do you think are most significant over the past few years
any individual thing is it just a general switch over
i think that switch over has been more in the work force
they have one and three quarters jobs now whereas the husbands have one and a quarter
in that the lady needs to stand up for what she has made and her own rights and has a right to do so
this upsets the man because we have always been built to think that we were sort of head of the household
do you think that is going to be difficult saying as far as marriages and people enjoying each other in the future years
i am not sure they are becoming more skilled at it
i think it really has put some additional stresses on the family units
do you have any opinion of potential changes that may occur in the next generation
i think one of the things that always happens is i think is when the one end were moving out to the end where a lot of women will be at work i think we are starting to see now some tendency of women at mid thirties
the opinion of this career thing isn't all that it is cracked up to be
i want to go back and do something else
i think we will probably see the pendulum in terms of the work force swing back a little bit
i mo-
the people
how do you feel about women in armed services
i think they ought to have the right
i have some problems with my own family thinking about my wife and my daughter going into combat i have problems with men doing that
i guess if they want to they ought to have the right to do it
the men went out and took responsibility of earning the money bringing in whatever they needed and protected the household
it really still bothers me
it still bothers me to see ladies out in combat or out in places where there is two or three of them there and five hundred men around
how are they going to protect themselves so to speak
i really don't go for that
i think one of the other things that has concerned me a little bit
i think i see some change in attitudes there
my wife happens to be a wife who has chosen to stay at home there's has been a tendency over the past few years to treat her as though she was somebody who didn't have much intelligence because if she did she would be out in the work force fulfilling herself
that's not fair because i can tell you one thing stay home sometime and start doing some of those jobs that she's been handling
you're going to learn there is a lot of responsibility just keeping the home going
i hope we reach the point where whatever women chose to do that's acceptable
if they go into the work force they should be treated as nicely as well as a man or any other person
not
what do you think of the giants
i like the giants
they got
i probably didn't get into baseball until maybe three years ago really i just like the giants
i don't know why
i read dave dreveki's book his autobiography
that was incredible
really proud of him though the way he's
really
i just think the giants have a good team
they got all
they're real balanced out
they got the hitting to go along with it
i just don't understand why they're not right up there on the top
i think they just need that one element to push them over the top
every team that's really good seems
like the a they just had it all that one year
i was mostly an a fan
i had been to more games at the a than i have in the giants because i lived in oakland for some time
i still like the giants though
if you're a fan you got to stay with the team any way good and the bad
it's kind of hard
i still basically the
we can go to the astros or the rangers teams
since no-
of me and my friends are really like either one of those teams
we about the most baseball we get is t v we play it on nintendo
that's small town trying to make it through not being around it really
i prefer football over baseball
baseball is still you got to do something when football ain't on
hot dogs baseball and apple pie
what do you think is going to happen this year to the teams
i don't know it's hard to say
i haven't really
at least you have to read the paper and sports illustrated and everything to keep up with who they traded and who they picked up and all that
like i say if they can get that one element that they were missing i think the giants can do it
the giants are
i don't like the a matter of fact i can't stand the oakland a
just because they've got their jose canseco and all the attitude that goes along with that
you hear what he did
i was like yeah
he's like a little bitty kid
he's just a little boy with a lot of money
None
i guess the giants might move away from san francisco it sounds like
i've heard talk about that
they won't be that far away
san francisco will be hurting anyhow
i hope they can do good
that's just
i think they're a good team that just need that one little thing to push them over
it just might be the drive more than anything else
they probably just need something to push them because that's the only thing i can see that's holding them back is the ambition to do it
somebody basically
maybe that's what some teams need
i know isn't that something i couldn't believe that
my roommate's a twins fan for forever
he had his year this year
we got into that a whole bunch
that was a series to remember for sure
i saw all seven games of that
i couldn't believe that
i don't
you're right
you have to figure out why they're all doing that i'm like it's doesn't work it's obvious it doesn't work because the braves didn't win
why keep on doing something that didn't work
i don't know
i was kind of surprised that we were going to talk about baseball
i get a woman's voice
i was thinking uh-huh
i got a call the other night about fixing your automobile up
baseball's baseball
they give you a list of things that you want
i'm not familiar
i think you guys in indiana don't you have the death penalty
we do have it
i can't even remember the last execution we had here
personally i'm in favor of capital punishment
i know there's a lot of problems with it
seems to me that some crimes are just so heinous that the person i feel doesn't deserve to live doesn't deserve for the tax payers to spend however many thousands of dollars it costs a year to keep them in prison for life
i know there's a lot of problems with that like they say if you put them on death row and execute them then ten years later you find out that he really didn't do it then that life was wasted
just seems like in some cases that it's a good policy
i tend to agree with you
that
None
that's a thought that i had never really had on that which seems pretty sensible
i don't
not completely failsafe
if a man's convicted of two murders there's a pretty good chance that something's wrong
to tell you how liberal i have turned toward this or whatever side that is i've kind of chosen i believe it that big time drug importers like noriega for example that these people need to be eliminated from society
i think the death penalty is the best choice for those people because really any kind of jail sentence for them is just another chance to create another power structure
you're right there
i gue-
basically my views i guess they tend to be more economically oriented in that they come out with these figures that it costs fifty thousand dollars taxpayer dollars a year to keep someone alive in jail when they're going to be there for life they're never going to be rehabilitated
i don't believe that the prison system that we have today does much towards rehabilitation to begin with to me i'm paying taxes twenty percent of my check or whatever to keep somebody alive who i in my mind shouldn't be there in the first place and is never going to be a valuable or worthwhile part of society
i'm all in favor of it
are there cases where you think that the capital punishment shouldn't be sentenced
i really don't know on that question
for instance the jeffrey dahlmer case i don't really think that this person is going to ever be a worthwhile part of society
i hope the guy never gets back out on the streets in that case wisconsin doesn't have a death penalty
he's going to be sentenced to life imprisonment
i think that he should not be allowed to live
then you're kind of playing god
cases where i think the death penalty should be withheld not really that i can think of
i would be in favor of the death penalty in things like murders and like you said repeat murders or serial killers i don't really agree with the death penalty for people like noriega and such as that
i think that they're operating on a more
i know that they're causing massive problems in society up here
i don't really think that it's in our power to take these people from a sovereign state and say you don't deserve to live because they're feeding our consumer needs
i understand your point
of course with dahlmer now you realize that i think it's ohio gets to try him next
they do have the death penalty
something is sort of nightmarish to say the least
that's right
here in texas we
i think even this last week they had another they
they use their capital punishment by lethal injection
do you have any experience in finding child care
i guess we were in a situation where we didn't need to be looking at two family income at the time
our kids were older
i've had to deal with friends of ours that have used child care and that kind of thing
it
still have been certainly exposed to criteria people are using
we're kind of lucky
i'm working
she is taking care of the kids also
we haven't had to look for child care either which has been very nice
i do have like you mentioned a lot of friends a lot of co-workers and associates that are looking for child care
some of the things that they're very critical about is the number of kids that are in the child care what kind of guidance counselor to student or adult to child relationship
how many you don't want to have thirty or forty
then something happens and the adult wouldn't be able to accommodate or take care of the kids very well
they also want to make sure that the kids are being taught and not just playing around all the time
depends also upon the level of the child
we we take a very close look at finding a good preschool for our kid
i kind of relate that to that in making sure that the teachers are very well educated themselves they have a good curriculum and that they're willing to teach the kids and have a fun time with them
it's very important i feel that the kids interact with other children also
it's a good way to develop relationships with other kids their age and get to know and work with kids
i don't know i guess we're kind of in the same boat
even here i guess we have
that will be groups of anywhere
otherwise there will be
people form a co-op and parents will work in the co-op and put a fair number of hours
the emphasis is primarily someplace for the children to be
at the same time there's some fairly good training programs and some of them formal two year programs
that
there is some definite creative play good social interaction that kind of thing
i think it's important like you mentioned that's a good idea on the parent co-op because
i don't want to just take them to somebody i pick out of the yellow pages or out of some ad somewhere
you hear on the t v and you read the newspaper quite often of people that don't treat or take care of your kids the way you think they ought to be taken care of
hope to never get into that situation where we have to find somebody and we have to trust someone with the welfare of our children
hope that we can stay in this situation
we've even had some of those kinds of situations publicized here
it's typically whether it's been child care in a home
you've actually got children that most people would consider problem children
it's more of a group home rather than actually day-care type of facility
steven it's been
i'm sure that i probably prescribe to different magazines ones that you do
i also take better homes and gardens
my husband he just subscribed to a wood
he just sent away to get some woodworking books
what kind do you get
i have a bunch of computer journals because i'm in computer science
beyond that lately i've been reading
lately i've been picking up some of the travel both trade magazines and just the general travel magazines
trying to keep up on what's going on
she still likes to get time which i've never liked very much
she seems to
if i happen to find it i'll go ahead and read it someplace if i'm in a doctor's office or something like that
other than that i never liked that really
i can hardly wait in the mornings for the newspaper to get here
i do like to read the newspaper even this little newspaper that patterson puts out
other than that magazines i don't know there's so much advertising in them anymore
when i used to get it it was about five hundred pages about three hundred of them advertising
that was interesting i think a lot of the trade magazines are like that
that half the fun is finding out what all the products are
some of the get ridiculous
travel and leisure all of the american express magazines travel and leisure food and wine and i think they have some others certainly half the pages and maybe more are pure ads plus they have the advertising supplement sections that are supposed to look like articles but are paid for
they don't care if they make any money on the magazine subscription they're making everything on ads
i only subscribe to the things i'm interested in
i used to get the coin magazine the paper actually is what it was
now that i'm into dolls that's about all i really want
have you ever read or subscribe to consumer reports for any length of time
i think they're interesting
i've always had this
i've always had this problem with consumer reports that in the areas that i know a lot about i disagree with them
i always wonder whether there are people who know a lot about every area disagreeing with them on everything
or what's going on
i've picked up now a subscription to one of the travel agent organization magazines
it's a ridiculous difference when you start reading from their perspective
their major interest is in commissions
there's very little talk about the quality of places or airlines
their major talk is about commissions and commission rebates and how they won't suggest hotels to people if the commission's not the full ten percent or whatever it is
it gives you a different
those travel magazines more or less show you different countries that you could go to
some of them
the general travel magazines do
because i don't expect to be traveling overseas in the future for quite awhile
i usually just read through the sections on domestic stuff
i don't know any other magazines i could talk to you about
i don't take anymore than that
None
i guess that will be it then
i know what it is
i'm kind of
i'm i'm kind of in the
